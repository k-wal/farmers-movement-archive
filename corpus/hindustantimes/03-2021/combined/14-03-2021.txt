14-03-2021||Mumbai||IITs set up schools, centres to foster research in AI||Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) across the country are now setting up new schools and research centres in applied artificial intelligence (AI) and data sciences (DS) to cater to the rising demand for qualified manpower in the area.Last week, IIT-Bombay announced that it will set up a ‘Technocraft Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence’ (TCA2I), a research centre to foster collaboration between industry and academia in applied AI. This comes merely a year after the institute set up a new Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (C-MInDS) to build a future talent pool in AI and DS through research, teaching, and collaboration with industry/government. While AI, Machine Learning (ML) and DS are widely taught to computer science students, institutes are realising the need to train students from all streams of engineering in these courses, given an increase in demand for qualified manpower in AI. C-MInDS at IIT-Bombay is now offering a BTech minor in subjects in the field of AI and dual degree MTech programme. “BTech students from any stream can complete five additional courses in AI and ML-related subjects and they will be awarded with a minor degree in machine intelligence and data sciences. The courses cut across all streams. The goal is to develop manpower, who are experts in their own domains, but also have expertise in AI and ML,” said Manjesh Hanawal, assistant professor, Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, IIT-Bombay, who is an associated faculty at both CMInDs and TCA2I. So far, around 100 students have registered for the BTech Minor course.In 2019, ed-tech company Great Learning estimated that around 97,000 jobs related to AI, analytics and DS were lying vacant in India. However, India ranked 40th among 172 countries in 2020 in AI-readiness, according to Oxford Insights and the International Research Development Centre. The study measured the country’s preparedness to adapt to AI technologies across 33 indicators.Demand for talent in AI and ML is 30% higher than the supply, said Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice-president and chief strategy officer, NASSCOMM, a not-for-profit association of the IT industry.Research output in AI, too, is poor as less than 2% of all PhDs are in the field of AI, ML and DS, according to a Niti Aayog report. Centres such as those set up at IITs will help improve the country’s research output, said Gupta. At Madras, the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI) was kicked off in 2017 and has since then published over 93 research papers.In September 2020, IIT-Delhi set up a School of Artificial Intelligence (ScAI) which began PhD programmes in AI from January this year. It has received around 160 applications in its first term. “From the next semester, we plan to start an MTech programme with an intake of 40. We have identified five core areas where we have our strength in AI applications — healthcare, material sciences, industry 4.0, robotics and multilingual natural language processing. ScAI aims to bring AI researchers across all departments together. It will facilitate collaborations to foster research in AI,” said Mausam, professor and founding head of ScAI. CMInDS, too, is likely to start regular MTech and PhD programmes in AI from the next semester.“There is an urgent need to improve the quality and quantity of research in AI as well as create highly trained professionals,” said Mausam. Inter-disciplinary research involving AI is key, said faculty members. “TCA2I focuses on research across domains. We are looking at interdisciplinary research in the application of AI in supply chain, logistics, transportation, cyber security, among others,” said Hanawal.“Today, many donors are also realising that there is a huge thrust on making our workforce ready to adapt to AI as well as bring out high-quality research work in AI,” said Hanawal. TCA2I at IIT-Bombay has been set up with donations to the tune of ₹15 crore spread over three years from alumni members.Many of the centres at IITs, such as Madras and Kharagpur, are set up in partnership with major IT organisations. “We are seeing many of our member companies partnering with these institutes for research centres. One of the reasons is they all have cases where they want to work on solutions in partnership with the academia. Through these centres, we have scope to build out new use cases where both the academia and the organisations can get an edge in these areas. For the institutions, these centres offer an opportunity to focus more on research,” said Gupta, adding that NASSCOM was also developing and curating courses in emerging technologies in partnership with various institutions and making the courses accessible.Madras was the first IIT in the country to offer an interdisciplinary five-year dual degree programme in data science — the students earn a bachelors degree in any branch of engineering and a masters degree in data science.B Ravindran, professor of Computer Science and Engineering and head of the RBCDSAI at IIT-Madras, said, “The goals of the centre were three-fold — to encourage fundamental research, to enable adoption of cutting edge AI in multiple verticals, and to impart high-quality AI education. We are one of the most productive AI labs in the country now, as measured by publications in top AI conferences. We also have significantly improved our footprint in interdisciplinary applications of AI across transportation, biology, manufacturing and finance.”The centre is now planning a part-time MTech in Industrial AI and an advanced programme for working professionals in applied machine intelligence.“AI, being a transformative technology, is a necessary skill for everyone and such centres play an important role in bringing about awareness and necessary appreciation. Our centre has projects that span various engineering departments, management studies, biotechnology, and social sciences,” said Ravindran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iits-set-up-schools-centres-to-foster-research-in-ai-101615746588661.html
14-03-2021||Noida||Noida: Gang robbing passengers on pretext of lift nabbed||Noida: Five members of a gang, allegedly robbing passengers at gunpoint in Delhi and Noida, were nabbed by the Expressway police on Sunday from Sector 128. According to officers, the gang was nabbed following a chase in Sector 128.“They had been active for the past six months. They mostly operated in Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan, Anand Vihar, Mayur Vihar, etc., from where they picked up passengers to Noida and used the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway or the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway to bring them here. They also worked around Mahamaya Flyover, Pari Chowk etc,” said Yatendra Kumar, station house officer, Expressway police station.He said that members of the gang allegedly already present in a vehicle would offer lift to passengers and once they reached desolate spots, they would rob the passengers at gunpoint.“The gang often resorted to violence to rough up their victims and take valuables like jewellery, cash, etc. In case the people were low on cash, the gang would have them withdraw money from secluded ATM kiosks before letting them go,” said the SHO.Police said the vehicles allegedly used by the suspects were registered in their names to avoid suspicion during checking. Two sedans, several weapons and ₹25,000 were recovered. Police recovered over five kilogram narcotics from one of the vehicles as well, officers said.So far over a dozen cases have been identified in which the suspects were allegedly involved, in Delhi and Noida. Police are on the lookout for other members of the gang, while their criminal history, if any, is being looked at. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.This is the second such gang to be busted by the Expressway police in less than ten days, said officers. On March 5, three members of another gang were nabbed for similar offences from near Sector 168.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-gang-robbing-passengers-on-pretext-of-lift-nabbed-101615746587542.html
14-03-2021||Pune||MSRTC pulls out of Shivajinagar multi-model hub project||The Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has taken a decision to withdraw its stake from the multi-model hub project and refused to sign a contract agreement with MahaMetro due to the lack of viability gap funding. The MahaMetro has taken a decision to pay MSRTC for the piece of land which it acquired to construct the underground station. MahaMetro has proposed the construction of a multi-storied building with a bus depot and terminus at ground level where the MSRTC Shivajinagar bus terminus is located. It was decided that MahaMetro will develop the MSRTC bus terminus and hand it over to them. Accordingly, the Shivajinagar depot was shifted to Wakdewadi which is 1.5 kilometres away from the original depot in December 2019. The total land of the depot is more than 10,000 square metres. According to officials, the Shivajinagar terminus will remain closed for the next three years as metro rail terminus is being constructed under the state transport depot, crucial for buses going towards Aurangabad and Ahmednagar. Approximately 1,400 buses ply every day from the earlier Shivajinagar, now Wakdewadi bus terminus. Once the metro station is ready, the MSRTC will shift back to its terminus to Shivajinagar. After shifting the depot, MahaMetro wanted to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with MSRTC. However, the MSRTC has now taken a decision to not be a part of the multi-model project. Metro will pay MSRTC for 4,000 square metres land Atul Gadgil, director Maha-Metro said, “The MSRTC doesn’t want to be a part of the multi-model hub of Pune Metro. They have written to us about that. Now, we will take 4,000 square metres of land from the depot for our station and the remaining will be handed over to them. We have also sent letters to them that we are ready to pay an amount for the piece of land which we want to use for our station.” He further said, “MSRTC did not mention a clear reason about withdrawing from the project but a lack of viability gap funding may be one of the reasons.” “It will not affect the Pune Metro footfall. The MSRTC will keep a pickup point there which will connect to the existing ST depot shifted at the Wakdewadi area,” he clarified. Commercial exploitation of prime land According to metro officials, as per the agreement, the MSRTC was going to give some amount to Metro as well as developers. At present, the MSRTC doesn’t have the money to give an amount to both agencies. Therefore, they postponed the decision to develop the depot with the help of the Metro. On the other hand, the MSRTC wants to shift their entire depot from the main city areas to the outskirts of the city and use the prime land for commercial exploitation. Abhijeet Bhosale, MSRTC chief public relations officer said, “At present, I don’t have any information regarding Shivajinagar depot.” Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC divisional controller, Pune division said, “It is a policy decision. I cannot comment on that.” However, it has been cleared that the MSRTC wants to put to use the prime land of Shivajinagar commercially. Last year in the month of February, Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab had announced that MSRTC is facing financial problems. The department will look at financial models such as utilization of land banks, commercial exploitation of depots as well as public-private partnership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-pulls-out-of-shivajinagar-multi-model-hub-project-101615746528732.html

14-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt devolves powers for road upgradation in forest areas to field officers||Divisional officers in the forest department can now sanction repair and maintenance works of roads constructed in forest lands, prior to the commencement of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, instead of the state government. Officials said this move, which was formalised via a forest department circular dated March 9, will allow such projects to be cleared and implemented at a faster pace than before; thus preventing inconveniences to motorists as well as department staffers executing their duties in the field.This development, as per the forest department circular (a copy of which is with Hindustan Times), applies to only those roads “constructed in forest areas prior to October 25, 1980,” and to roads “which have been brought under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna (PMGSY)”. A key outcome of this decision is that such roads in forest areas can be converted from ‘kacha’ to ‘pakka’ roads without the sanction of the state government, as was the case earlier.Sanjay Gaur, additional principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) (protection), said, “A lot of roads in forest areas were constructed prior to 1980, and these require regular upkeep and maintenance. Sanctioning these projects until now was the responsibility of the state forest department, but we have clarified the matter with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the devolution of powers to divisional officers is permissible. This will save senior officials time from presiding over routine matters. Moreover, a lot of the roads passing through forest areas need urgent upkeep, and we can process it faster now at a decentralised level.”As such, the power to sanction upgradation and maintenance of road projects in forest areas has been devolved to the additional principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) (wildlife-East), additional PCCF (wildlife-West), additional PCCF and chief conservator of forests (CCF) (mangrove cell), CCF, CCFs (Territorial), and field directors of tiger reserves in Maharashtra.The move, however, does not allow for project proponents — such as public works departments and the National Highways Authority of India — to increase the width of these roads or fell any trees as part of the upgradation work. “If that is the case, then state approval will still be required. The purpose of this notification is merely to save time of senior officials, who are supposed to deal with larger policy issues. Such routine clearances can be done at the district or divisional level at the discretion of appropriate field officers,” said Gaur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-devolves-powers-for-road-upgradation-in-forest-areas-to-field-officers-101615746291830.html
14-03-2021||Noida||GB Nagar is likely to revise circle rates||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decided to revise the circle rates in the district. Officials of the stamp and registration department in GB Nagar said that the revised rates will be applicable from April 1, 2021. The stamp and registration department is likely to have a meeting at the district collectorate at Surajpur on March 16 to discuss the circle rate revision issue. Besides the district administration officials, top officials from the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities will also be present at the meeting, said the officials.“The revision of circle rates will be discussed in a meeting on March 16. We cannot talk more on this issue now,” said SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general of stamp and registration department, GB Nagar.Circle rates revision is an annual exercise done after inviting objections and suggestions from the general public. The circle rate is the rate at which a property is sold or bought. It is the circle rate at which the government charges stamp duty for the registration process, which is required to transfer the property from one person to another. In GB Nagar, the government at present charges 5% of the total property cost as the stamp duty.Meanwhile, realtors have advised not to go with the hike now when the real estate is witnessing a low sentiment.“In view of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the real estate sector, there is a need to reduce the circle rates. It is time the government should also reduce the stamp fee from 5% to 2% and we have already requested for it to benefit homebuyers. Increase in circle rates will affect the interest of buyers,” said Subodh Kumar, secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), a builders’ group.Homebuyers also said that any increase in circle rates is not a good idea. “Instead, the government should reduce the circle rate as well as the stamp fee. With reduction in stamp fee and circle rate, more registries will happen that will help the government earn more revenues,” said SK Nagrath, president of Jaypee Aman flat buyers’ association.In Noida’s ‘A’ category areas, the prevailing circle rate is of ₹1.3 lakh per square metres, which is the highest in the city. These areas include sectors 14, 14A, 15A, 17, 30, 35, 36, 39, 44, 50, 51 and 52. In Noida’s five ‘E’ category sectors, the circle rate is ₹40,000 per square metres. These sectors are 66, 102, 141, 158 and 162. The registry officials said that in some sectors the circle rate is low as compared to the facilities such as road, connectivity, greenery and others are provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-is-likely-to-revise-circle-rates-101615746287470.html
14-03-2021||Noida||Surajpur wetland suffers from industrial pollution as foam seen over stream that feeds lake||Domestic and industrial pollution seemed to be taking a toll on the Surajpur wetland as a stream that recharged the lake was covered with an unusual white foam on Saturday. While the forest department and pollution board was yet to establish toxicity, experts opined that the foam, also seen on the Yamuna when it is grossly polluted, suggested so. Spread over 308 hectares, of which 60 hectares is a lake, the wetland is city’s largest reserve forest and one of three major birding hot spots, the others being Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Dhanauri wetland.“It was not a stream, rather a toxic fuming drain that should not be let into the lake. Forest department should take a note and do something to stop it,” said Pranav Awalkar, a Noida based birder.“It’s killing the serenity and tranquility of the lake. The stinking drains that is going into the Surajpur wetland lake can be noticed by anyone and it’s obviously hampering the wetland’s health,” said Sumedh Nagrare, a Delhi-based birder.According to water expert Rashmi Verma, the froth indicated the presence of high levels of sulphates and nitrates likely from industrial or domestic sources.“It is not a good sign. Such water bodies are considered dead and unsupportive of biotic life,” said Verma who is also a senior fellow at union ministry’s department of science and technology (DST). Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad said the stream is actually a drain.“It called Havelia and is a storm water drain that originates in Hapur. On its way, it passes through several industrial areas and is polluted with untreated discharge. The drain then splits with one discharging into Surajpur and the other into Hindon river near Kasna area. It had been polluted for years and getting worse with time,” said Vikrant Tongad, city based environmentalist.Government officials said that they will test the water and also write to the concerned department.“Yes, the inlet stream that comes from Havelia drain has seen a spike in pollution levels and the major reason is apart from industrial waste being discharged, a large agricultural patch around Surajpur wetland has been converted into residential area and they too are releasing effluents into the drain. We are in process of getting the water samples tested and we will write to the Greater Noida Development Authority to check the industrial pollution,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Greater Noida Authority did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/surajpur-wetland-suffers-from-industrial-pollution-as-foam-seen-over-stream-that-feeds-lake-101615746228681.html

However, it has collected only 70% of the total target of ₹3,650 crore. Due to this, with a few days left for the financial year to end on March 31, BMC has accelerated its action against defaulters.The BMC, in a statement on Sunday, said that water connections of Solitaire Corporate Park and Vertex Building were disconnected, and sewers were blocked in the Andheri area. However, after this action, the property holders paid 50% of the outstanding amount of ₹9.91 crore cumulatively. Further, water supply connection of a theatre was disconnected in Chembur area owing to property tax outstanding of ₹75 lakh. The BMC on Sunday also sealed office and confiscated a vehicle of a property consultant in Chembur areas as ₹1.10 crore property tax is due and the luxury car of a real estate developer was confiscated for property tax due to ₹38 lakh.Meanwhile, the BMC statement added that ₹25.86 crore was collected from Bharat Diamond Bourse as settlement arrears of property tax. This was followed by recovery of ₹39 crore from Reliance Industries Limited as property tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-cracks-down-on-property-tax-defaulters-101615745988052.html

14-03-2021||Gurugram||Farmers to protest fuel price rise||Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border said that they’d protest the rise in fuel prices on Monday. They said that they’d be submitting memorandums to district administration officials in Haryana and Rajasthan besides other states to highlight the spike in prices of diesel, petrol, LPG and other essential commodities. They will also be protesting against privatization and extending support to trade unions that plan to protest at railway stations across the country on Monday.Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. The protest at Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera has completed 92 days. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha—the umbrella body of farmers unions protesting at Delhi’s borders— and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers had received support from trade unions in their agitation and would be extending support to workers in their fight against privatization and the policies of the government. “Since the beginning, farmers and workers are united in their struggle and have given the message of mazdoor-kisan ekta (farmer-worker) unity. Even workers are suffering due to privatization similar to the manner in which the government is implementing policies against farmers. We will be opposing the policies of the government in a united manner since it has capitulated before big industrialists,” said Madhav. He said that the current movement had transformed into a mass movement that had received from different communities. Madhav added that farmers at the protest site were gearing up for the proposed Bharat Bandh, scheduled for March 26. “We are soon going to complete 100 days of our blockade.

14-03-2021||Gurugram||Ahata manager, owner attacked by group of five men in Sector 74||A 33-year-old manager of an ahata — an authorised open space for liquor consumption — in Sector 74 on Delhi-Jaipur Expressway was severely injured while its owner sustained minor injuries, after a group of five men assaulted and robbed them of ₹1.60 lakh cash, said the police.The police said the suspects, who also ran a roadside eatery shop nearby and served alcohol illegally, often misbehaved with the victims. They often came to the ahata and abused guests, said the police, adding that professional rivalry between them seems to be the main reason behind the attack. Ranjeet Singh, manager of the ahata, said that he was closing his shop at around 2.30am on Saturday when two men, identified as Sonu and Titu, came up to him and started threatening him. They told him to run their operations according to the terms dictated by them. “I was about to leave along with two of my staff members, when these two men came up to me and started abusing and pushing me,” he said.Singh said he rushed inside the ahata but the suspects called their friends and together they assaulted him again. One of them hit his head with a stick, following which he fell on the ground. They snatched ₹1.60 lakh from him.When Singh’s employer came to the spot, the suspects thrashed him as well. The staff informed the police control room and took Singh to a private hospital where he underwent treatment. Both Singh and his employer recorded their statements to the police on Saturday evening, following which a case was registered at the Badshahpur police station under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (assault),427 (mischief causing damage),452 (House trespass), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. The victims told police that the CCTV cameras and digital video recorders installed at the ahata were damaged by the suspects. However, there were two more eyewitnesses, who are willing to record their statements.This is the fourth such incident in the last four months in the same place. Professional rivalry between ahata owners is the main reason between such frequent clashes, said the police.Naveen Kumar, station house officer(SHO), Badshahpur police station, said that a team from the police station was sent to the spot but the suspects had fled by then. “We have registered the case against five men, two of whom have been identified, while the rest are yet to be identified and arrested,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ahata-manager-owner-attacked-by-group-of-five-men-in-sector-74-101615744848059.html

Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that the video pertained to an incident that took place about a month ago and they sought a report from the contractor.In the video, workers can be seen suspended in the air and swinging, while a steel staircase fell from the top, narrowly missing a worker standing below. Vehicles on the road can be seen moving along the crash site and no safety barricading is visible on the spot.HT could not verify the authenticity of the video.Yashesh Yadav, president of Dwarka Expressway homebuyers’ association and a resident of the area, who shared the video on social media, raised concerns over danger to commuters’ lives. “The incident is a recent one and happened near Sector 84. The video clearly shows that there is no safety barricading and the life of workers also hung in the balance. It was only due to luck that nobody was injured or killed. We are writing a letter to the NHAI and PMO, seeking more safety measures and a probe into the incident,” said Yadav. Nirman Jambulkar, project director, Dwarka Expressway, said, “We follow strict safety practices and corrective steps have been taken to prevent such incidents in the future.”A few residents alleged that such incidents took place several times but were not captured on camera.On August 22, 2020, a large portion of concrete had fallen between pillars 10 and 11 of the Sohna Road elevated project, following which the NHAI mandated safety measures, including barricading of the site with grills, before allowing resumption of work. A senior official of the NHAI, requesting anonymity, said, “We have sought a report from the contractor and asked him to take suitable measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. However, this is a large engineering work and things like snapping of a cable or failure of machinery can still happen.”The official said that the launcher for installing girders for this project has been designed in such a way to ensure minimal damages in case of an accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/video-of-dwarka-expressway-mishap-resurfaces-on-twitter-causes-panic-101615744789697.html

Three women and a child were rescued by fire department officials. However, no injuries were reported from the site, said officials of the fire department.As per the officials, the fire broke out around 2am in the basement, where a local shopkeeper used to store bundles of incense sticks.A short circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire.Nobody was present inside the basement when the fire broke out.“One of the neighbours informed the fire department that he could see smoke coming out of the basement of a nearby building. Upon reaching, we found the entire basement to be engulfed in fire,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).Kashyap added that fire tenders from Sector 37 fire station, located less than three kilometres away from the site of the fire, were the first to arrive at the site. A total of eight fire tenders were used in the dousing operations which took almost two hours.“As part of the mandatory mode of operation, we checked the two residential floors above the basement for inhabitant who might be stuck . On the top-most floor, three women and a child were found sleeping. They were completely unaware of the fire. We used the staircase of the building to escort them to a safer place as a precautionary measure,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said that the fire department officials ensured the fire was limited to the basement of the building and did not approach upwards.Furniture and electrical equipment were gutted in the fire apart from the stocks of incense sticks.Kashyap said that since storage of any commercial goods in a residential area is illegal, they are investigating the matter and are likely to take legal action against the shopkeeper for violation of norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residential-apartment-catches-fire-in-pataudi-four-rescued-101615744788545.html

They were travelling to Rajasthan, to meet their family members and attend a wedding. The police registered a case against the dumper driver, who fled the spot leaving his vehicle behind. The injured man was identified as Sohan Singh, a resident of Dausa in Rajasthan. He decided to accompany his uncle, who worked as an executive with an RO water purifier firm in the city, to his village in Rajasthan’s Bandikui, for the wedding. Around 4pm, when they reached near the Naharpur Rupa underpass, a speeding dumper rammed them. “Both of them fell on the road and the dumper ran over the rider, killing him on the spot. The driver stopped the dumper a few metres ahead and ran from the spot,” said Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar). The police said that passersby took both of them to Civil Hospital in Sector 10A, where doctors declared the 40-year-old, identified as Bijender Singh, brought dead and admitted Singh. “He was planning to gift his wife a gold chain and had promised her to take her along for shopping. We were driving slow, but the dumper driver was speeding and lost control over the wheels. It seems he forgot to apply brakes and rammed us,” Singh said from the hospital, adding that his uncle is survived by his wife and three sons. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the unidentified driver on Saturday night at Sadar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/speeding-dumper-mows-down-40-year-old-driver-near-rajiv-chowk-101615744789114.html
14-03-2021||Gurugram||GMDA starts pilot project to ensure equal distribution of water||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority(GMDA) has initiated a pilot project to ensure equal distribution of water to all houses along a stretch between Basai and Dwarka Expressway. According to GMDA officials, areas such as Sirhaul, Gandhi Nagar, parts of Iffco and Huda colonies, Civil Lines, Shivaji Nagar, among others would be covered under this project.Officials said that this measure will not only conserve water but will also ensure that the authority gets the amount due for the water being supplied to residents. “There are several underground water tanks between Basai and Dwarka Expressway. Presently, while some tanks get more water, residents towards the end of the blocks get less water. As such, we are developing a system in which there will be flow control walls, which are electronically controlled and programmed. This would ensure equal quantity of water to all residents,” said a senior GMDA official privy to the matter, who did not wish to be named. As work for the pilot project continues, the official could not give an estimated timeline as to when the system would become fully operational. The project is a part of a centralised integrated water management system, which is being developed by the Smart City division of GMDA and will cover around 40 underground tanks, which provide water to all residential housing societies, individual houses and hotels.With the centralised system, the GMDA will have a larger degree of control over the entire distribution and supply chain from a single location through the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC).At present, Gurugram’s water comes from the water channels in NCR and the Yamuna channel. This raw water is carried to the water treatment plants (WTPs) at Basai and Chandu Budhera, which have a daily operational capacity of 270MLD (million litres per day) and 300MLD respectively. There are also two boosting stations in sectors 16 and 51 to help overcome the difficulty of transporting water to the eastern parts of the city, which is on a higher ground than the two WTPs.The official further said electrical sensors have been placed on the water pipelines, which will help in ensuring equal distribution of water. The project will also focus on plugging the leakages in the pipelines to arrest wastage of water due to overflow and unauthorised water connections.As per official records, flow meters, level sensors, flow control devices and other field equipment will be tentatively installed at over 300 locations for the centralised water management system.Earlier in 2019, the GMDA also developed a network of CCTV cameras and sensors for transmitting real-time visual feeds and data to a dashboard dedicated to water supply at the command centre in order to check on possible water theft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-starts-pilot-project-to-ensure-equal-distribution-of-water-101615744787997.html

The health department has assigned one ASHA worker and anganwadi worker for every 200 households and they will be moving from door-to-door to motivate the beneficiaries to get the doses of the vaccine administered, said additional chief secretary (ACS-health) Rajeev Arora. The health department has also coordinated with officers of the department of social justice and empowerment, urban local bodies (ULB) and panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) to motivate the beneficiaries above 60 years and those with co-morbidities falling within the age group of 45 years to 60 years. “The objective is to ensure maximum reach of the Covid-19 vaccine as it will contain the further spread of the highly contagious virus,” Arora said. In Gurugram, health department officials said that to expand the vaccination exercise, they have decided to increase the session sites from around 60 to 100. “The target would be to vaccinate around 10,000 beneficiaries,” a senior health official said. Arora said that the officers of other government departments have also been asked to mobilise the beneficiaries and they have taken extensive steps to ensure that the Covid-19 vaccine reaches all residents, including urban pockets as well as rural areas. The vaccination is being administered at health subcentres that are located in the villages, so that the vaccine can be administered to every eligible beneficiary, he said.Prabhjot Singh, mission director, National Health Mission, Haryana, said that till March 13, 2021, the health department has administered the first dose of the vaccines to 168,000 healthcare workers (HCWs) and the second dose to 97,410 HCWs. Besides, 83,338 front-line workers received the first dose of the vaccine. As per the details shared by the health department, 65 people tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the total number of cases to 59,835. The number of active cases in the city was 571, of which 520 patients are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/largescale-awareness-drive-for-increased-vaccination-101615744787469.html

At least 1.70 lakh beneficiaries have already received Covishield in Pune city, including frontline and health care workers, who have to now, mandatorily take Covishield as their second dose. The administration does not have enough doses of Covishield to ensure those who got their first dose get their second dose of the same vaccine. A message sent by the the PMC health office to hospitals reads: “Henceforth we will be able to get only Covaxin and not Covishield. Covishield will be supplied by the government of India for the 2nd dose in the next few days. We request everyone to pay the GOI fees and take Covaxin, and start vaccination of new beneficiaries. Caution needs to be exercised as those who have balance Covishield stock should use it only for the second dose. Give Covaxin for the first dose. A site registered on the software previously for Covishield, will print certificates only for Covishield. So you have to first exhaust the Covishield stock, then cancel the Covishield site, register a new site for Covaxin, and only then start giving Covaxin. Only one site can be created either for Covaxin or Covishield. Beneficiaries coming for the second dose will be directed to select centres giving Covishield, which will be preferably government centres to avoid confusion.” It is highly recommended by the ministry of health that under no circumstances should any individual get two different doses of two different vaccines. Dr Ashish Bharati, PMC health chief said, “It is true that we have got only 50,000 Covaxin doses as opposed to the one lakh Covishield doses, which we were expecting. We do not have any Covishield stock as of now and so we have requested hospitals to keep all pending doses with to be used only for the second dose. We were completely unaware of the situation and as of now, we know that we have only Covaxin doses.” “For Monday, we have asked hospitals to use the Covishield for a second dose and they have to freshly register for Covaxin now. The hospitals will have to create a second site for Covaxin and then restart the process. As of Sunday evening, seven private hospitals have taken the Covaxin doses from us. We have vaccinated about 1.50 lakh beneficiaries who have to be given Covishield. We do not have any Covishield stock with us right now and this may lead to some confusion,” Dr Bharati added. As of now only Aundh district hospital has been administering Covaxin. Covaxin is an indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with NIV and Bharat Biotech, while Covishield has been developed by Oxford university and is being mass produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble hospital, a Covid-19 vaccination centre, said, “This will definitely lead to confusion and chaos at vaccination centres. As of now we do not have any Covaxin doses with us. We need to re-apply for Covaxin even though we are yet to get 700 doses of Covisheild from the government for which we have already made the payment. However, we have to now create a new site for Covaxin and from Monday we would be able to vaccinate only a few healthcare workers. We will not be able to give Covishield as we have to keep it reserved for those who have already got the first dose of the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shortage-of-covishield-doses-pmc-tells-centres-to-only-vaccinate-with-covaxin-101615742687323.html

14-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body sends 50 samples for genome sequencing daily to NIV||As the positivity rate in Mumbai has increased to 11% from 4% in January, health officials are speculating that the city may be facing a virus mutation. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), since last week, has been sending 50 samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for genome sequencing, to know about the possibility of mutation of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. However, they haven’t found any mutation similar to the ones, found in Amravati.Genome sequencing is a technique that involves analysing the genetic code of an organism.Last month, the positivity rate in Amravati shot up to 50%, which raised concerns among the state health officials.The results for genome sequencing of four samples showed a mutation (E484Q), while another four from Yavatmal showed a second mutation (N440K) of Sars-CoV-2.“As seen in Amravati and Yavatmal, the infection rate of the mutated virus is high. However, the mortality rate is low due to its less severity. A similar trend is also visible in Mumbai. So, there is quite a possibility of the mutation of the virus in the city,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.In January, the city recorded 500 new cases, while in March, the cases increased to an average of 1,200 cases.According to BMC data, the infection is spreading faster in places like Andheri, Mulund, Malad, Kandivali, Bhandup, Chembur among others.As the procedure of genome sequencing is expensive, the central government has issued guidelines for selecting samples for the process.“We are selecting samples as per the parameters. We are sending samples of patients with a long history of hospitalisation, sudden death after hospitalisation, UK returnees. Also, we are selecting random samples from hot spots,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.In recent times, BMC is observing a high infection rate among people from the same families. “So, we are also sending samples to NIV from families where the infection rate is high,” she added.Last month, BMC had sent 90 samples to NIV for genome sequencing, but no similar mutations like E484Q and N440K were found. “We had found one UK variant from a traveller, but he has successfully recovered and sent home,” said Kakani.Dr Subhash Salunke, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on the Covid-19 outbreak also said the rise in Covid-19 is possibly linked to mutation. “Though the government has overruled the claim of mutation, I believe that the virus strain has changed,” he said.Active Covid-19 patients who are currently on treatment have increased by 36% this month. On March 1, Mumbai had 9,690 active cases which surged to 13,247 on March 13. Almost 80% of the newly infected people are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, with a majority choosing home quarantine.Dr Salunke said infected patients are violating isolation safety rules which are further contributing to increasing cases in the city.“The government needs to impose stringent rules and heavy fines for such violators,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-ends-50-samples-for-genome-sequencing-daily-to-niv-101615741248090.html
14-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports close to 2,000 cases, bed occupancy rises||Mumbai reported close to 2,000 cases with 1,963 cases of Covid-19 being reported on Sunday. This was the highest number of cases reported in nearly five months after 1,823 cases were reported on October 16, 2020. As the city is reporting record-high new Covid-19 cases daily, the bed occupancy rate has also increased. This has also resulted in the vacancy of beds going down to 59%, as of March 13, from 70%, as of February 22.According to BMC data, the bed occupancy ratio in dedicated Covid-19 centres and dedicated hospitals has increased to 40% now, from 29% on February 22. The data reveals that there has been a substantial surge in the occupancy ratio of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds followed by oxygen beds and ventilators. With this, the number of beds in the Covid centres and dedicated Covid hospitals has increased from 11,205 beds on February 22 to 12,998 beds, as of March 13. This increase has been significant in terms of oxygen beds that have increased from 6,174 last month on February 22 to 8,022, as of March 13.On Sunday, the city reported 1,963 fresh Covid-19 cases followed by seven deaths taking the case tally to 343,962 and death toll to 11,535. The city’s recovery rate stood to be 92.74% with 318,995 recoveries in Mumbai. There are 12,535 active cases in the city.In terms of the vacancy rate going down, the vacancy rate in ICU beds was 63% on February 22 to 44% on March 13. There are 1,536 ICU beds in the city of which 961 are vacant. In terms of oxygen beds, the vacancy rate has gone down to 66% from 76% on February 22. There are 8,022 oxygen beds in the city of which 5,354 beds are vacant. The vacancy rate of ventilators has gone down to 42% from 62%. There are 944 ventilators beds in the city of which 405 are vacant.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician said, “The bed vacancy is not worrying yet considering the maximum or say over 75% cases are asymptomatic cases where home quarantining will also work considering 90% cases are from high-rises. However, any drastic increase in cases, which is happening currently is worrying, considering this could worsen the scenario. For this, speeding up the vaccination process is the only solution.”Further, in the last one month, the number of cases also in the city has gone up with the city reporting over 1,000 cases since the past one week. The daily positivity rate has gone up from 3-4% in February to around 9%, as of Sunday. However, despite this, the silver lining remains that the mortality rate has remained stagnant at around 3.35%.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal last week had said, “We are ensuring strict compliance of existing restrictions and there are no plans for lockdown further. The positivity rate is around 7-8% right now, and the situation will become alarming, requiring a review of restrictions if the growth rate goes to around 15%.” Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had undertaken a meeting with the malls and hotels association requesting them to take all Covid-19 precautions to ensure the spread remains in check. However, there are chances of the state government announcing fresh restrictions in the city this week, if cases continue toMeanwhile, Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai city said on Saturday, “The task force and the government is working on what all restrictions may be needed for the city. Within a week, we may make an announcement, which will pertain to restrictions on hotels, malls, gymnasiums, crowds at railway stations, taxis, and all public places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-close-to-2-000-cases-bed-occupancy-rises-101615740827905.html

Kushwaha had left JD (U) in 2013 and formed RLSP, the same year. A formal announcement about merger was made by Kushwaha himself after RLSP’s national council meeting Sunday morning. Kushwaha, later drove down to JD(U) office where he was welcomed by the CM. Soon after joining, Kumar announced appointment of Kushwaha as chairman of National Parliamentary Board of JD(U), with immediate effect. “I am personally very happy with the development. It is a historical decision. We were together earlier and again we are back. He is a big leader and will work together for state’s development,” said Kumar. “We were in talks with the RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha for quite some time. When I discussed it with my party members, they were happy with the merging of the two parties,” said Kumar. Earlier in the day, Kushwaha, after the meeting of the RLSP national council announced the decision of the party to merge with the JD(U). “The entire RLSP will merge with the JD(U) from today. The decision has been taken in the interest of the state and country. Seeing the people’s mandate and the prevailing political scenario, it was decided that leaders with similar political ideology should come on one platform. This is the demand of the current political situation,” said Kushwaha. “People’s mandate was a clear message that we should go together. This is neither going to benefit me nor Nitish Kumar. It will benefit the state and strengthen Bihar,” said Kushwaha and ruled out that any political bargaining was done for the merger. The former union minister made it clear that his role in the party would be decided by Nitish Kumar. Heaping praise on Kumar, Kushwaha said, “He is my bada bhai (elder brother). I have always respected him. I will continue to serve people and party irrespective of the role assigned to me.” “JD (U) is the only party which is committed to state’s development whereas some other parties are more interested in their own development. I will do service under Nitish Kumar and strengthen the party,” said Kushwaha. JD (U) alliance partners, the BJP and the HAM-S also welcomed Kushwaha’s home coming. Former chief minister and HAM-S leader Jitan Ram Manjhi said that Kushwaha’s return to JD(U) is in the interest of the state and country. “He was a union minister in the NDA government. He went to Grand Alliance where he felt insulted,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand. Meanwhile, the RJD took a dig at the merger. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said Nitish Kumar should handover the chief minister’s position to Kushwaha. “The way BJP insulted Nitish Kumar in Bihar Assembly elections using Chirag Paswan it was obvious that it somewhere niggled Nitish Kumar as well as Upendra Kushwaha. However, it is time that ‘Luv’ should handover the CM position to his brother ‘Kush’ as ‘Luv-Kush’ was the base of the JD(U)’s formation, said Tiwari. JD(U) leaders feel that the Luv-Kush unity in Bihar (a term used in reference to Kurmi and Koeri caste) can become a potent factor in revival of the JD(U). The Kushwahas and Kurmis together form nearly 12% of Bihar’s population and had been a major vote bank of Nitish Kumar. Political experts, however, feel that it would hardly help JD(U)’s cause, which is trying to consolidate itself. “The reason is simple. Kushwaha has lost clout. All his community grassroot leaders have joined the RJD. The Kush (Koeri community to which Kushwaha belong) is a divided house. The message is loud and clear that Kushwaha is fighting for his survival,” said D M Diwakar, political analyst associated with A N Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rlsp-merges-with-jd-u-8-years-on-kushwaha-returns-to-party-fold-101615739567243.html

The process to make the 8 kilometre-long rangoli on the street started at 5 pm on Saturday and was completed within 24 hours.The official observer from India Book of Records, Jitendra Kumar Jain, along with his team, watched the entire process and they declared it the longest street Rangoli in the country.Jain said that as per their records, this was a first of its kind initiative taken in the country. "We have never seen such an initiative taken to sensitise the voters in any part of the country. There is a possibility that this eight kilometres long street rangoli may have created a world record in the street art category but we are yet to examine this. If we see that there is a world record, we will surely announce it soon," he said.Also read: 'Illegal infiltration will be thing of past if BJP is re-elected in Assam' - ShahUnder Systematic Voters Education and Electronics Participation (SVEEP), the district administration is taking several initiatives to spread awareness among the voters to exercise their constitutional right in the upcoming assembly election.People from several sections of society, including college and university students, tea garden workers, police officers, CRPF, police and army personnel, along with deputy commissioner Keerthi Jalli, were seen taking part in the rangoli-making exercise.It also created a buzz on social media as thousands of people took pictures and uploaded them online. With the help of this social media traction, people started gathering and took part in the rangoli-making process. It became a day-long festival at East-West Corridor Mahasadak.Keerthi Jalli said, "As far we know, the record for drawing the longest rangoli in India is four kilometres. But we were not running after any record. If it was only to break the record, a four-and-a-half kilometre-long rangoli was enough. Our main objective was to make people aware and we wanted to involve them in the process."She said this year, the focus was on making women voters more aware of their rights. "I am a woman deputy commissioner and about half of my officials are women. Half of our voters are also women. We are focusing on women from tea gardens to college and university students. People from different sections of society spontaneously joined our initiative. Some of them even donated colours and brush. We are glad to have completed such a dream project and our awareness drives will continue till the day of the election," she added.General Observer IAS Amlan Aditya Biswas also took part in the initiative. He said, "Apart from conducting the elections smoothly, our responsibility is to attract voters to cast their votes. I appreciate the local administration for this innovative approach. I am sure that this will attract not only locals but people from outside as well. Such a big task has been done in a well-planned manner. I believe the assembly election will be similarly disciplined."Assam goes to polls in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-district-gets-into-record-books-for-longest-street-rangoli-in-country-101615737927482.html

The new technology will be used on the Pune-Satara route where the doubling work is underway. This new technology tracks are being made at the Bhilai steel plant of the Steel Authority of India (SAI). The tracks are stronger and quality wise better than the earlier tracks which were used by railways. So, it would be beneficial in the future to run the double decker goods transport trains on these tracks. The Indian Railways receive the supply of railway tracks from the SAI regularly. For a faster speed, the quality of tracks is also equally important. Currently in India, UTS 90 and 80 qualities are used on which the trains are running. The new R 260 quality tracks are made of alloy. “In the ongoing railway track doubling work in Pune railway division new German technology of R 260 tracks are going to be used. These tracks are 260 metres long and are of better quality than the earlier tracks,” said S Patil, deputy chief engineer in Pune railway division. Once the speed of the trains is increased, it will certainly reduce the travel time of passengers. “It is good to hear that railways are moving towards new and upgraded technology for the safety and benefit of passengers. At the same time, they should look after expenses and should not inflate the passenger’s travel ticket,” said Kalapana Jambhale, a regular passenger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-division-using-german-technology-to-boost-train-speed-101615738127175.html
14-03-2021||Bangalore||People are coming back to swim regularly: Arjuna Awardee Nisha Millet||Butterfly, backstroke, or simply getting over your fear of water, Nisha Millet can make a swimmer out of anyone! Not convinced? Ask any of the 1,200 students currently under her tutelage. The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games swimmer’s academy in Bengaluru, which had been closed since 25 March 2020, is back and she’s in the pool with Bengalureans lining up for classes. “After an entire year of staying indoors, people are now venturing out. They have realised that swimming is an effective way to counter a sedentary lifestyle while avoiding crowded spaces. Chlorinated water is known to kill more viruses, and this isn’t a contact sport, so safety is maintained as well,” says Millet, adding, “I have been inundated with calls from people, since summer is upon us. We have increased the number of batches; currently we have eight people in one batch with the coach, so social distancing is also adhered to. I’m yet to start the toddler classes, but parents of kids as young as one are waiting for that to happen (laughs).” The Olympic swimmer, in her career spanning over 15 years and more than 600 gold medals, has won many accolades and achievements, including being the only Indian athlete to ever win 14 gold medals at the National Games in 1999. Her commitment to the sport is palpable as she describes her foray into the sport . “I had a near drowning experience in a pond when I was 5. At 9, my father put me in a swimming class to help me overcome my fear. But I came back having learnt little. So, my father taught me! I credit all my success to my parents.” But in 2002, a benign tumour threw her training for a toss, and after missing out on the 2004 Olympic qualification by a whisker, Millet decided to retire from competitive swimming. “I was young, my parents had sold their house to afford my training. There was no financial help from authorities and I realised that I needed to start earning to support myself and reduce the financial burden on my parents,” she recalls. In 2004, she founded Nisha Millets Swimming Academy, and then there was no stopping her. “I understood the importance of good training, which is the only way through which Indians will be able to compete (in sports) internationally. I started with one centre in 2004, and now we will soon be operating out of 11 different places in Bengaluru itself” she adds. Millet says she tries to bring the fun back to swimming. “We have swimmers as young as six months old and as old as 84; age is just a number here. We conduct classes for beginners, and also train competitive swimmers and adults who are prepping for triathlons, and Ironmans. Five of the triathletes are headed for the World Half Ironman Championship,” she informs, adding, “Swimming was always perceived as a summer camp obsession, but that is changing. We now have heated pools so that people can train all year.” 2020 was a difficult year for Millet who lost most of her savings since the academy was closed during the peak months. “We had to make some tough choices. I kept paying all the coaches while incurring expenses for upkeep of the pools. But I’m glad that that time is behind us now,” she says. When not in the pool training students, Millet is often busy working out, losing the weight she says she has put on when she had her twin daughters. “I do crossfit and am also an avid runner. And my twins keep me on my feet. We like to travel together as a family. In Bengaluru, there is so much to do in the city, including going to parks like Cubbon, or a new place to eat. And there are so many beautiful places in the vicinity of the city as well; where one can go out for a drive too,” she says. Talk about India’s prospects in the international swimming arena, and Millet, who was decorated with the Arjuna Award in 2000, opines, “We need more financial support for athletes, pools that can be used the entire year, and more importantly, a free mind. In many foreign countries athletes can drop a year or two in school to pursue their sports but here, we put too much emphasis on schooling. Kids should be allowed to excel at sports without the burden of academics, which can be picked up later or even done simultaneously. We should allow our kids to pursue their dreams, that is what will give us great athletes!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/people-are-coming-back-to-swim-regularly-arjuna-awardee-nisha-millet-101615735969280.html

Credit that to another batch of Covid-19 problems! With the stress of attempting Open Book Examinations (OBE) students have fused their time table with breaks to de-stress and relax! “After all, being wholesome is as lit as acing your stat exam is,” quips Sarthak Mishra, a student of Ramjas College. If you’re wondering what a Gen Z’s off time looks like, during the #OBEseason, here’s a low down on the ways that are being adopted to chill and unwind! Motivational song wali play list “There hasn’t been a single success story that I’ve heard where a student hasn’t used motivational songs as a propeller to finally grab his notes and start studying for the exams. Whether it’s Divine ke raps, or the song Aashayien (Iqbaal, 2005), motivational music is really what all students relax to, between study breaks! We share our exam playlists with each other, too. Another thing that all students do to unwind is watch cringe reels and tiktoks. We just like to zone out and keep scrolling our social media feed until the next alarm for sitting and studying goes off,” says Mishra. Quick gossip sessions with mom“What’s the new gup on campus? Ask my mom!” says Yukti Aggarwal, a student of Shaheed Bhagat Singh College. “I love to spend time with my mom during breaks from studying for my exams. From a time when we used to hide secrets from our parents to a time where we share each and everything with them, I feel that youngsters have come a full circle. Just chit chatting with mom in between study session makes me feel energised and happy. Mom makes sure that I’m well fed during exams because only then will I be quicker to learn my syllabus – chalk that one up to #momlogic! Power naps FTW (For The Win)“Sona kitna sona hai is the principle that governs my student life. I think there is no better way to de-stress than taking a power nap. Exams ke stress se pareshan? So jaao. Syllabus ka pahad? Better sleep. Break up problems? Doze off. OBE ki tension? So jaao. Wifi stopped working? Sleep! Sleeping to regain your MoJo seems to be the most popular way to deal with online campus problems, and is also the greatest de-stressor during exam times,” says Tejas Malhotra, a student of Sri Aurobindo College. Meditate and Nama-slay the day! “I have been trying to meditate and focus on my breath whenever I get time to take a break,” says Mansha Khanna, a student of Hansraj College, adding, “I love the guided meditation video sessions that are available on YouTube. I’m a new bee at meditation, and I think while I might not have the time to go on a full on search for the monks in the Himalayas to learn from them — like the guy in monk who sold his Ferrari — YouTube is guru enough to teach me how to nama-slay my day and hopefully, my exams too!” Bhai, farre wala group ready hai? “De-stress matlab? Sab chill hai yaar! Humara group taiyyar hai. We’ve formed groups for different subjects that have students from different colleges taki answers same na lage; when a bro helps out another bro while sharing the answers. Aur baki toh gediya lagayi ja rahi hai to chill. The only hope is kahin offline exams na ho jaye because then fail hone ka darr thoda real ho jayega,” says a student on condition of anonymity; for all legit reasons.

This will ensure that additional irrigation can be given to the crop. There are 14 lakh agriculture tubewells in state and eight-hour power supply is given by rotation to one-third of the total tubewells.State’s agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu told HT that the sudden rise in day temperatures over the past 10 days – 3-4°C more than what is conducive for the crop is a cause of worry. “This would lead to early maturing and fall in yield by at least 3 to 5%,” he said, adding, “A maximum day temperature of 26°C is acceptable. Any further increase will damage the crop. We are having day temperatures touching 28-30°C. Last week, the temperature touched 33°C. Sidhu added that night temperature should ideally be 16°C and was still within permissible limits. “Last few days have been cloudy, which was a respite,” he added. This rabi season, wheat was sown over 35.1 lakh hectare and the state food and civil supplies department is making arrangement for procurement of 135 lakh tonne from April 1, when mandis and procurement centres will start accepting the crop for purchase.Sidhu said December-sown wheat (particularly after cotton crop in the districts of Malwa belt) is under risk because it is at a maturing stage. “We have advised farmers to give timely irrigation, so that the crop doesn’t dry up early,” he said, apprehending that incase the temperature continues to rise and farmers are unable to give irrigation, the crop will mature early and arrivals will be preponed.Sidhu claimed that the state government is organising village level camps to spread awareness among farmers on the need for timely irrigation to protect their yield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wheat-needs-irrigation-give-farmers-8-hour-supply-agri-dept-to-pspcl-101615734527726.html

A police team went to the hotel where the incident occurred and recorded statement of the staff there.Superintendent of police (city) of Moradabad Amit Kumar Anand said, “The case is being investigated by a team of local police headed by station house officer (SHO). The team has also collected CCTV footage of the place. Statements of concerned parties are being recorded.”The said FIR was lodged on Saturday on the complaint of journalists who were allegedly injured in the incident on March 10. Based on the complaint, the police booked Akhilesh Yadav and 20 unidentified SP workers under Sections 147 (rioting), 342(wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.The second FIR was lodged against one Ubaid-ur-Rehman and Fareed Samsi, who are reportedly journalists. The duo has been booked under sections 160 (committing affray) 341(wrongful restraint), 332(causing hurt to person being a public servant), 353(deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC on the complaint of the SP’s Moradabad district president Jaibir Singh Yadav.Samajwadi Party leader Shafiqur Rahman Barq on Sunday condemned the FIR lodged against his party chief Akhilesh Yadav and said: “This FIR is equivalent to a fake FIR. (Akhilesh) Yadav ji our president. This move by the complainants is not acceptable. Instead of covering what Yadav ji spoke in the press conference, the media is busy covering his FIR-related stories. Yadav ji too has lodged an FIR against the complainants in response.” The senior leader added that party member will protest against the FIR in the coming days. In a tweet in Hindi, Yadav said, “Today, the way in which the Constitution is attacked, false cases are registered against leaders and physical assaults taking place after raids by probe agencies, are all an adverse result of BJP’s violent political thought.” “Those who level allegations on others of running a syndicate, are in fact themselves running a ‘sanghicate’,” he said.On other hand, BJP leaders attacked Akhilesh Yadav for the alleged violence against journalist. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya in a tweet said, “SP has crossed all limits by attacking journalists for asking questions. Akhilesh Yadavji the violence against journalist in your presence is condemnable.”State law minister Brajesh Pathak also criticised the attack and said on Sunday, “Akhilesh Yadav is letting out his disappointment by attacking journalists. The state government condemns the attack and will never allow it to happen again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/moradabad-police-begin-probe-into-case-accusing-akhilesh-of-violence-rioting-101615733867053.html
14-03-2021||Other||Country’s growth can’t be imagined without forest dwellers: President||President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday said the overall growth of the country cannot be imagined without the development of rural, tribal and forest dwellers’ communities. He also referred to the contribution of tribals and forest-dwellers in Lord Ram’s victory in this context.“When Lord Ram emerged victorious in the war against Ravan, the ‘vanvaasi’ (forest dwellers) extended great assistance. In the same way, if the society and the country have to move ahead, then the forest dwellers’ community has to be first taken ahead,” Kovind said.The President was addressing a gathering at Chapki in Sonbhadra district in eastern Uttar Pradesh on Sunday after inaugurating the newly constructed buildings of the Seva Kunj Ashram. “Without the development of tribal, forest dwellers, the development of the country cannot be called complete,” the President said, adding, “Therefore, the development of tribal and forest dwellers’ communities and rural areas is necessary.”“It should be our endeavour that forest dwellers remain an integral part of the modern development process, while keeping their cultural heritage and identity intact,” he said. The central and the state governments were implementing various schemes for the overall development of rural and forest dwellers’ communities, he added.Recalling his long association with the Seva Kunj Ashram, he said social worker Vanyogi Bala Sahab Deshpande founded Akhil Bharatiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram around 70 years ago and Awadh Bihari established the Seva Samarpan Sansthan as a service wing of the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram around 40 years ago. Remembering Birsa Munda on the occasion, the President said Birsa Munda struggled relentlessly to protect the forest wealth and culture from exploitation by the British. “His life has been a source of inspiration and ideal not only for the tribal communities but also for all citizens,” he added.The President said that he was happy to inaugurate the newly constructed buildings of the Seva Kunj Ashram. Noting that construction of school and hostel buildings were undertaken by NTPC, he appreciated this social welfare work.“When I visited the NTPC stall, two sisters greeted me with “Ram, Ram”. I interacted with them and told them that Lord Ram had achieved his victory with the help and support of tribal and forest-dweller heroes,” he said.The President said that he held the belief that the soul of the country resided in rural and forest areas. “If anyone wants to get acquainted with the roots of India, then one should spend some time at a place like Sonbhadra,” he said.The President termed Sonbhadra as the power capital of India. He appreciated the fact that the forest dwellers are keeping alive the tradition of intuitive knowledge received from their ancestors and carrying it forward. “From agriculture to art and craft, the harmony they have with nature impresses everyone,” he said.“Many success stories are coming from the forest areas. Our tribal sons and daughters across the country are increasing the pride of the country by their hard work and talent in many fields, including sports, arts, and technology,” he said.The President said he was confident that the Sonbhadra region connecting eastern Uttar Pradesh with Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh would become a major centre of modern development.He expressed joy over efforts being made by the Sewa Samarpan Sansthan to revive the folk arts and preserving the folk languages and songs.Stating that he liked calling on the “brothers and sisters” of the forest dwellers’ community, he said he was supposed to visit the ashram last year, but could not do so due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The President also participated in Vanvasi Samagam. UP governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/countrys-growth-can-t-be-imagined-without-forest-dwellers-president-101615733688192.html
14-03-2021||Lucknow||UP Govt hopes for revenue mop-up with OTS for traders||The authorities are keeping their fingers crossed for the success of the one-time settlement scheme (OTS) announced for the state’s traders/dealers. The scheme gives the traders an opportunity to clear their arrears with no or reduced interest, depending on the amount of the dues.Successful implementation of the scheme may help the government to bolster its coffers with the help of recovery of pending tax liabilities in the time of pandemic that is said to have squeezed government’s resources.“We have made elaborate arrangements by setting up a helpdesk under a gazetted officer at each location to help dealers avail of the government’s scheme,” commercial tax commissioner Amrita Soni said.“We expect a good response to the OTS,” she added.She further said officials were asked to verify the documents and personally contact the defaulters, encouraging them to avail of OTS.The government recently brought the OTS. In line with this scheme, the interest on the traders’ tax liabilities under UP Sales Tax Act, Central Sales Tax Act, UP Entertainment Tax Act, UP Cable Television Network Act up to December 2020 will be waived, provided one opting for the scheme clears the principal amount at one go.The scheme will be in effect for three months. But it does not cover the GST arrears. “OTS will cover tax liabilities prior to the GST regime that came into effect on July 1, 2017,” another official dealing the issue clarified. “There are around ₹3,000 crore recoverable tax arrears pending against thousands of traders and dealers, including government agencies,” the official said.The OTS circular issued by the government seeks to waive 100% interest component on the arrears up to ₹10 lakh, 90% on the arrears of over ₹10 lakh and up to ₹1 crore, 50% on the dues between ₹1 crore and 5 crore and only 10% on the arrears if they are above ₹5 crore. The exemption be will available only for full payment of the arrears.The available data shows that successive one-time settlement schemes (OTS) have not been able to make any significant dent in the amount of arrears, the volume of which keeps on fluctuating.It is seen that the total recoverable (undisputed) dues in 2013-14 were ₹1957.95 crore. It went up to ₹2594.53 crore the next year and further increased to ₹4270.21 crore in 2015-16. The arrears were ₹4161.43 crore in 2016-17 and rose again to ₹4430.17 crore in 2017-18 before they again came down to ₹3444.15 crore in 2018-19. Although the department is still not sure as to how many defaulters would like to avail of the OTS this year, over 18,000 traders/dealers having old tax liabilities against them are said to have opted for the interest waiver scheme in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-hopes-for-revenue-mop-up-with-ots-for-traders-101615733267139.html
14-03-2021||City||Stage set for Kerala polls: Metro Man, Chandy figure in BJP and Cong lists||Metro man E Sreedharan, former chief minister Oommen Chandy, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and actor Suresh Gopi figure in Kerala candidate list of the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released on Sunday.The BJP has named 88-year-old E Sreedharan from Palakkad. Though the party wanted to field him from an urban constituency in Kochi, he preferred Palakkad district where he had his education and grew up, party leaders said.The seat is now being held by young Congress leader Shafi Parambhil. BJP state president K Surendran will be contesting from two seats, Mancheswaram in north Kerala and Konni in Pathanamthitta district. Rajya Sabha MP and actor Suresh Gopi has been fielded from Thrissur. In the April 6 assembly election, the stage is set for a fierce three-cornered contest after all three major alliances released their lists.The BJP declared candidates for 112 of the 115 seats it is contesting for the 140-member legislative assembly.Also read: The political importance of KeralaChandy is seeking re-election from Puthupally constituency in Kottayam district which he held for more than half a century (51 years). Similarly, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala is contesting from his sitting seat Harippad in Alappuzha district.Congress alliance called the United Democratic Alliance (UDF), comprising five other parties, declared candidates for 85 seats of the 91 it is contesting. The remaining 49 seats have been left for the allies. The Congress, in which at least 55 per cent of the candidates are new faces, triggered protests at many places.Party headquarters in the state capital witnessed an unusual protest after Mahaila Congress state president Lathika Subhash, who was denied a seat, tonsured her head. She has also resigned from all posts but she said she will continue to work as a party worker.“My leaders have let me down badly. I have tonsured my head in protest,” she said. In tears, she said the party always put women in high esteem but always ignored them during seat distribution.“I came to the party at the age of 16 and now I am 56. Now I don’t think the party can do justice to women. Even 10 per cent of seats are not given to women. My protest is for all women,” she said. But state president Mullapally Ramachandran later said she was keen to contest from Ettumanoor (Kottayam) but the seat went to Kerala Congress (Joseph) during seat distribution.“We are upset that we could not accommodate her. In coalition politics certain sacrifices are necessary,” said Ramachandran in Delhi after releasing the list. Chandy also underplayed the protest saying it would not affect the party's prospects.Similarly, senior BJP leader Shobha Surendran was also denied a seat though the central leadership was keen. “I have no complaints. I will work hard to for my candidates,” she later said. She was sidelined for more than a year after a feud with state leaders. She, however, took a dig at the state president who is contesting from two seats.The Congress has tweaked the norm of not alloting seats to the MPs in the assembly elections to name party MP from Vatakara K Muraleedharan. He has been named from Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram, the lone sitting seat of the BJP. Earlier, the party high command had insisted that a senior leader should contest from Nemom where former Governor Kummana Rajasekharan is contesting on the BJP ticket. Of the 91 seats the party is contesting, the Congress has announced candidates for 85 while 6 will be announced later, the PCC chief said.The ruling Left front alliance called the Left Democratic Front led by the CPI(M) had declared a list for all 140 seats last week. CPI(M), which announced its list on March 10, is contesting 85 seats, six less than the main opposition party, the Congress.With this, the contestants in Kerala's electoral arena are almost clear with more than 95 per cent of the seats declared by all political parties. The BJP is contesting the most number of seats among any political party in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stage-set-for-kerala-polls-metro-man-chandy-figure-in-bjp-and-cong-lists-101615732748033.html

One is a BJP-Asom Gana Parashar government led by Modiji, Sarbananda and Sarma and the other choice is Rahul Gandhi’s Congress and (Badruddin) Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front. Who can work for Assam’s good? Modiji or Rahul-Ajmal?” Shah said at Margherita in Tinsukia district.The Union home minister said that in the past five years, the BJP government in Assam has been able to put an end to agitations and terrorism in the state and ensure development in a peaceful atmosphere.Also read: Union minister and 3 sitting MPs mark BJP’s Bengal nominees for 3rd, 4th phases“Can Rahul, who has tied up with Ajmal, put an end to infiltration by illegal immigrants? Give us another five years, and illegal immigration will become a thing of the past in Assam,” said Shah.Targeting the influential tea-tribe community in upper Assam districts, where polls would be held in the first phase on March 27, he listed welfare schemes launched for them by the state government and the Centre while blaming previous Congress governments in the state and Delhi for failing to do anything.Shah assured that if the BJP comes to power again, Assam’s biggest problem i.e. annual floods would get solved. He said floodwaters would be diverted to big reservoirs, which in turn will become tourist destinations.“We understand the pain of tea-garden workers and that’s why the BJP-led state government has approved an increase in their daily wages and allowances to ₹318 (from the existing ₹167),” Rajnath Singh said at a rally in Biswanath district.“On May 2, when the poll results will be announced, the BJP will return to power again in Assam and also form its government in West Bengal. Tripura is already under BJP's rule. When we have governments in these three states, no infiltrator (from Bangladesh) will dare enter India,” he added while blaming the Congress for joining hands with the AIUDF.On Sunday, the BJP released its list of 19 candidates for the third and final phase of polls on April 6. While two sitting MLAs have been denied tickets, the party selected industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary to represent Dharmapur again. Names of ministers Himanta Biswa Sarma (Jalukbari) and state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass (Patacharkuchi) had been announced earlier.“Before coming to power in 2016, the BJP had promised to protect ‘jati-mati-bheti’ (community-land-base). But by bringing in Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), it is giving a red carpet welcome to illegal immigrants, which in turn threatens the language, culture and identity of the people of Assam,” Congress in-charge of the state Jitendra Singh said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/illegal-infiltration-will-be-thing-of-past-shah-in-assam-101615730244058.html
14-03-2021||Pune||Pune adds 14 more private hospitals as Covid vaccination centres||PUNE In a bid to increase the number of beneficiaries getting vaccinated the central ministry of health and family welfare has approved 14 non-empanelled private hospitals, each with a capacity of 200-100 beds, which will serve as Covid vaccination centres in Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad.The additional hospitals will increase the vaccination by at least 4,000 beneficiaries daily, said officials.These hospitals are not empanelled with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) or state health insurance. The Centre has approved 67 such hospitals in the state out of which 12 are for Pune city and two from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) area.All the approved hospitals, government and private are approved after assessment of space for vaccination, cold chain space for vaccine storage, vaccination team/human resource and emergency service after reported adverse effect following immunization.Currently, Pune has 135 session sites that can administer more than 16,100 vaccine doses.Rajesh Deshmukh, district collector, said, “We are trying to increase the vaccination centres in Pune district given the high number of Covid cases. We aim to vaccinate about one lakh people daily. We are also seeking permission to vaccinate the population above 18 years.”While the earlier notification of the government stated that only those private hospitals empanelled with central or state government health schemes and with more than 200 beds would be eligible for vaccination. However, given the high response from citizens, the government has further relaxed its guidelines and allowed more private hospitals to come on board.The hospitals have to purchase the vaccine for ₹150 per dose and can charge ₹100 per dose, so the beneficiary would have to pay ₹250 per dose at private hospitals.Currently, Pune city has 83 vaccination centres out of which 42 are private hospitals, while PCMC has 21 centres out of which eight are government hospitals.At least 35,687 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the Pune district on Saturday (March 13) which was the highest in the state which took the cumulative number to 3.08 lakh.Out of the total vaccinated, 90,000 health care workers have got the first dose while 29,000 have got their second dose and have completed their course. While 55,000 frontline workers have got their first dose and 2,657 have completed their vaccination course.Out of the 90,000 vaccination doses, 1.29 lakh senior citizens and those aged between 45-59 with comorbidities have got their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-adds-14-more-private-hospitals-as-covid-vaccination-centres-101615728946905.html

Their workload may further increase as fourth year MBBS students will not join the hospitals as interns until May.Most examinations have been postponed due to Covid, including the final examination for fourth year MBBS students. The exam is usually conducted in December, followed by the results in February. Internships for students start in March. This year, the examination was postponed till March 8. Fourth year MBBS students can join as interns only after the results are declared. That process will take another two months, which will put a strain on hospital staff in government, as well as private hospitals.Sohel Inamdar, president of the Association of State Medical Interns (ASMI) at BJ General Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said there are 3,000 interns across Maharashtra, in government and private hospitals.“The examination of final year students was postponed due to Covid-1. Till May, there will be no new interns. In government colleges there are 2,500 interns in Maharashtra and there are 1,500 interns in private colleges. Every year by the end of February, internships for most students end. There are fewer interns right now. Till April end, there will be a stress on the medical system as there will be fewer interns to carry out the work and assist resident doctors,” said Inamdar.Dr Vijay Yadav, president, Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (Mard) at BJ General Medical College and zonal secretary for Mard Maharashtra, said that at present there are no regular interns.“Due to this, the resident doctors are over worked. One of my colleagues handles the Covid-19 ward at Sassoon General Hospital and has 54 patients there. Each patient requires checking of oxygen level and other details every three hours. This was mostly done by the interns. Due to their absence she is overworked and overloaded. This is the picture when there is a absence of interns, as they play a crucial role in taking samples and other works, which aid the functions of the residents,” said Yadav.He added that many other departments as well are understaffed as the interns will join late. “This has put a burden on many residents. Many of them are seeking psychiatric help as they are overburdened and overworked,” added Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delay-in-exam-results-leaves-hospitals-with-shortage-of-interns-pressure-on-residents-docs-increases-101615728886874.html

With stricter norms for restaurants, hotels and malls, cab drivers are also affected.According to the new order – malls and restaurants will close at 10 pm, while only delivery of food from restaurants will be allowed till 11 pm. “I work as a peon in a hospital in Kothrud till 8pm and then drive my auto rickshaw till am. I give service to Ola and Uber both. Since February 21, I have been going back home at 10 pm. Driving at night helped me to earn money which took care of my monthly rations,” said Sunil Ramse.Most private cab drivers prefer to wait at Koregaon Park or SB road for after-hours customers. “Although Pune doesn’t have a night life like Mumbai, if you are in Koregaon Park or SB road you get many calls, as there are many pubs and bars in these localities,” said Dhanjay Kudale, an Ola driver.IT park’s WFH a big blowBefore night curfew was imposed, many cab drivers who used to provide their services to IT companies in Hinjewadi and Kharadi, were left jobless with companies continuing the work from home (WFH) routine.“Private cab owners who were on duty with IT companies had developed a very good source of income as their payment was always done on time.

14-03-2021||Pune||Survey: 2,457 students have dropped out of school in PMC limits||A total of 46.89 per cent of students could not attend school due to Covid, according to a recent survey by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The survey also highlighted that 2,457 students have been reported to be out of school within the PMC limits. Suresh Jagtap, additional commissioner with the PMC said 3,05,898 households were surveyed in the PMC limits. “There are 2,457 students who are out of school between the ages of three to 18 years in the PMC limits. Of this, 1,152 students have been out of school due to the ongoing pandemic,” said Jagtap. He added that PMC will continue its efforts to include these students in the upcoming academic year. “We will trace and admit them in the upcoming academic year. The schools are shut till March 31. We will be following the plans chalked out by the state government to include these children back in the education system,” said Jagtap. Mukund Kirdat, an education activist as well as a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that it is unfortunate that these students inside the PMC limits could not receive formal education last year. “These families of these students have reported financial difficulties. Not just middle-class parents, but single parents who are daily wage workers and domestic helpers do not have the money to continue the education of their ward. There are also parents who are single, financial difficulties have been a challenge for them as well. In such cases, the authorities have failed to include these children in the system. There has been no system where these students are included. The sad part is that these students are in the city and have not migrated out of here and the authorities have failed immensely,” said Kirdat. Of the 2,457 students, only 153 have migrated out of the city. There are 174 students whose parents have financial problems due to which they are out of school and there are 21 children who are out of school as they have single parents. “The authorities should plan the upcoming academic year in a better way so that those parents seeking admissions now are able to continue the education of their child,” said Kirdat.

14-03-2021||Pune||PMC begins auctioning 40 properties of property tax defaulters||Despite the introduction of the amnesty scheme, some property tax defaulters in the city are not paying up taxes owed to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and therefore in a first, the PMC has initiated the auction process on a total of 40 properties. PMC property tax departments have identified properties that are not responding to the property tax department. Last week, the PMC sealed nine properties and sent a proposal to the tehsildar to put the civic body’s name on the 7x12 extract of the defaulter’s properties. In the background of the Covid-19 pandemic, the PMC is facing a financial crunch and property tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST), building development charges are the main income source for the PMC. At present, the property tax department has collected ₹1,465 crore so far in property taxes and is expecting another ₹50 crore by March 31, 2021. However, the PMC has claimed it has collected the maximum property tax as compared to other municipal corporations in the state on the background of the Covid-19 pandemic. The PMC’s target of ₹2,100 crore which was set in the 2020-21 budget has still not reached. Vilas Kanade, joint municipal commissioner, property tax department said, “We are first initiating the process of adding PMC’s name on the 7x12 extract and auction properties. At present, we have started the online auction of properties to recover outstanding dues of ₹7.72 crore.” He further said, “We have identified another 30 properties for the auction. We have started the process to seal and put the name of the civic body on the 7x12 extract. It will take time to complete the entire procedure. After that, we will go to the auction. We have to recover more than ₹20 crore against these properties.” 40,000 new property registrations Kanade said, “On one hand, we are initiating strict action against defaulters, and on the other the property department has registered 40,000 new properties. It is one of the highest records of registering new properties in PMC history. The PMC has also collected ₹1,654 crore despite the Covid-19 pandemic.” In the collection of property tax, around 5 lakh residents paid property tax of around ₹778 crore online. Now, the department has completed all necessary procedures to send new property tax bills for 2021-22 from April 1st. It will be distributed until April 15 to all property holders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-begins-auctioning-40-properties-of-property-tax-defaulters-101615727926843.html

Malik was addressing a gathering after his felicitation at Sheelchand Inter College in Aminagar Sarai town of his native district Baghpat. He belongs to Hisawda village of the district. He shared that he wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and home minister about the ongoing farmers’ agitation but it remained unresolved. Visibly perturbed over the stir, , he said that a governor was supposed to be quiet on certain issues but “I went against this norm because I am also the son of a farmer and understand the pain and problems of farmers.” He claimed that he opposed farmers’ arrests and advised the government to not use power against them but ensure that they did not go back empty-handed. He said the farmers’ demands were genuine and the government must listen to them. Malik also recalled his tenure as governor of Jammu and Kashmir when Article 370 was repealed. He appreciated the decision of the Modi government and said that a better kind of democracy was established there after conducting panchayat elections. He said, “ I don’t know how long I will remain in the Raj Bhawan” and added that he would write books after his retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meghalaya-guv-backs-farmers-demands-101615727086809.html

The party decimated the opposition parties completely. The counting of votes took place on Sunday.The YSRC won 10 out of 11 municipal corporations and established a clear lead in Vijayawada municipal corporation. The counting in Eluru municipal corporation was withheld as per the direction of the state High Court due to an election petition.The YSRCP also won 73 out of 75 municipalities and nagar panchayats, including four municipalities – Pulivendula, Punganur, Macherla and Piduguralla municipalities, as its candidates were elected unopposed unanimously.The main opposition, the Telugu Desam Party, drew a blank in the municipal corporations and won just two municipalities – Tadipatri in Anantapur district and Mydukur in Kadapa district - with a slender margin.Also read: Artist in Andhra creates miniature golden YSRCP symbol on party's foundation dayHowever, senior YSRCP leader and state municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana told reporters soon after the election results that the ruling party would capture power even in Tadipatri and Mydukur municipalities with the help of the votes of co-option members. “We shall not allow the TDP to rule any municipality in the state,” the minister said.If it happens, it will be the YSRCP all the way in all the urban local bodies in the state, which is an unprecedented victory for any political party in the state.“It is a historic win for the YSRC and an endorsement of the welfare schemes taken up by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government,” said Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, senior YSRCP leader and advisor to the state government.The Congress drew a blank by not winning even a single ward anywhere in the state, while the BJP-Jana Sena combine did not cross even a single digit in winning the wards and divisions.A festive atmosphere prevailed at the YSRCP central office at Tadepalli in Amaravati as the party leaders and cadre celebrated the victory by bursting crackers and distributing sweets.It is a huge setback for the TDP which was desperate to regain the ground which it had lost in the 2019 general elections. Party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu extensively campaigned in various municipal corporations and municipalities, attacking the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on various fronts.Naidu especially focussed on Visakhapatnam trying to exploit the ongoing agitation against the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and also in Krishna and Guntur districts where he banked on the strong sentiment in favour of Amaravati being retained as the capital city of the state.However, the TDP lost heavily in these districts. For instance, in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation elections, the TDP could win only in 30 out of 98 divisions, while the YSRC won 58 divisions.In Vijayawada, which Naidu developed as part of Amaravati, the YSRC was leading by winning 23 seats in the 64-member corporation, while the TDP was left far behind with victory in just eight seats. In the remaining divisions, too, the YSRC has a clear edge, reports from the YSRC said.Similarly, in Guntur municipal corporation, the hotbed of agitation for Amaravati capital city, the YSRC established a massive victory by winning 44 out of 57 divisions while the TDP ended up with just nine divisions.“The victory in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Vijayawada municipal corporations is a clear indication that the people have endorsed the chief minister’s decision to form the three capitals for the state with executive capital at Visakhapatnam,” YSRC general secretary and MP V Vijay Sai Reddy said.TDP politburo member and spokesman Varla Ramaiah said it was the YSRCP, not the TDP, which should make an introspection on how it had won the elections. “It has completely bulldozed the elections, misused the official machinery, used the ward volunteers as party workers, spent thousands of crores and cared a damn for the state election commission,” he alleged.Ramaiah said the TDP would not get disheartened by the defeat. “In fact, the defeat will only strengthen our resolve to fight back and we shall overcome this crisis very soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/its-ysrcp-all-the-way-in-andhra-civic-polls-tdp-draws-a-virtual-blank-101615726313678.html

The former chief minister said the arrest of the officer who was investigating the case has put a major question mark on the way the entire probe was earlier carried out.Fadnavis, while speaking in Pune on Sunday, said, the way the details are coming out now shows this was a major conspiracy of which some police officer is part of.“This isn’t a small plot. It is a major plot. There are many people involved in this. All those who are involved and the reasons for doing this will come out now,” said Fadnavis.Also read: Ambani security scare probe - Sachin Vaze remanded to NIA custody till March 25Vaze was in the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) leading the investigation into the security scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia in Mumbai. However, following the death of Mansukh Hiren, a Thane based decor businessman who had been in possession of the vehicle, Fadnavis presented some fresh details putting Vaze at the centre of the case.Late on Saturday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is investigating the February 25 bomb scare outside Antilia, arrested Vaze.On Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut’s allegation that Vaze’s arrest is part of a conspiracy to destabilise the Maharashtra government, Fadnavis said, “What Raut said is laughable. In fact, what some police officers were doing itself was an attempt to destabilise the government.”Raut had also alleged that the opposition is hurting the image of Mumbai police to which Fadnavis said, "If the investigating officer is involved this way and is arrested, it puts a series of questions. Those who are saying we are damaging the image should give it a thought that such an act by some officer is actually causing more damage to the image of Maharashtra and Mumbai police."Fadnavis also questioned the reinstatement of Vaze into the police force last year when the High Court had not cleared his name in the killing of Khwaja Yunus in police custody.“When I was the chief minister and holding home portfolio, the Shiv Sena had asked me to reinduct Vaze. I referred the case to Mmaharashtra’s advocate general, who opined against it. However, after Shiv Sena came to power, Vaze was reinstated into service citing a shortage of manpower due to Covid,” Fanadnavis said, adding, Vaze was directly given charge of the crime intelligence unit.Get our daily newsletter

Annapurna 1 is located in Nepal’s Himalaya Annapurna Massif (cluster), home to several mountains 6,000 mts tall, of which Annapurna 1 is the tallest.Now four Punekars – Umesh Zirpe, Bhushan Harshe, Dr Sumeet Mandale and Jitnedra Gaware, will attempt to to scale the 8,091metre-tall mountain in an expedition that will start in the third week of March, and expected to end in last week of April.In 2012, Basanta Singha Roy and Debashis from West Bengal climbed Annapurna 1 successfully. Annapurna 1 is also considered a deadly mountain, as so far, 61 climbers have lost their lives while scaling its peak.“Due to its unpredictable weather it is one of the deadliest mountains. Climbing between Camp 2 and Camp 3 is hardest, as most avalanches occur between these two camps,” said Mandale, who has climbed Mt Cho Oyu in Tibet and Mt Kanchenjunga (located on the India Nepal-border).All four mountaineers represent a well-known mountaineering club in the city, Giripremi.Before Annapurna, mountaineers from Giripremi have climbed the seven tallest mountains in the world (see box).“We are experienced mountaineers, and since it is a tricky mountain to climb we did not think of a bigger team. Before heading to base camp to acclimatise we will be climbing Mt Singu Chuli, which is around 6,000 metres tall,” said Umesh Zirpe, president, Akhil Maharashtra Giryarohan Mahasangh (AMGM).Giripremi had planned this expedition in 2020, but it was not possible due to Covid-19. “Although covid patients are increasing in India, in Nepal the situation is completely under control so we will not have any issues of travelling and once we are in the mountains, there is nothing to worry about,” added Zirpe.Previous expeditions by Giripremi:2012: Mt Everest2013: Mt Lhotse2014: Mt Makalu2016: Mt Cho Oyu2016: Dhaulagiri2017: Manaslu2019: Kanchenjunga||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4member-giripremi-team-to-scale-deadly-mt-annapurna-in-himalayan-cluster-101615723006708.html
14-03-2021||Delhi||AAP will make Delhi world-class city if voted to power in next MCD polls: Pathak||The Aam Aadmi Party will focus on making Delhi clean and a world-class city if it comes to power in the municipal polls due next year, party leader Durgesh Pathak said.Having won the municipal corporation bypolls, the Arvind Kejriwal led party is now focusing on consolidating its position in the civic bodies.Pathak, who is the party's in-charge of municipal corporations, said there is a feeling on the ground that the Arvind Kejriwal government must be given an opportunity in municipal corporations.The municipal corporation polls of Delhi are due in 2022.On the party's vision for municipal corporation, Pathak said the first thing they will do is to clean Delhi if they win the polls."The main work of the municipal corporation is to keep Delhi clean but the national capital is so dirty under the BJP. So the first thing we will do is to clean Delhi.Local bodies play a very important role in implementing policies so if the AAP government comes we will succeed in making Delhi a world-class city," he said.He said the party will reduce corruption in municipal corporations.Talking about the bypoll results, Pathak said the AAP won the bypolls in the strongholds of the BJP and in other seats too, the AAP's margin has increased."So the feeling we are getting on the ground is that Arvind Kejriwal must be given an opportunity in municipal corporations too," Pathak told PTI in an interview.The AAP swept the bypolls, winning four out of the five wards where elections were held on February 28.Speaking about the factors that worked for the AAP, Pathak said there is anti-incumbency and at the same time people are impressed by the AAP's work."Looking at the work done by the AAP government in various sectors like health and education, people believe that if the AAP government comes in municipal corporations then Delhi's development will happen," he said.Speaking on the AAP's loss on one seat of Chauhan Bangar in the bypolls which used to be its stronghold, Pathak said in by-elections, local factors also play an important role.Congress leader Chaudhary Mateen, whose son fought from Chauhan Bangar ward, has an influence in the area.Moreover, Mateen had lost many polls earlier which might have led people to sympathise with his son Chaudhary Zubair Ahmad."Congress lost its deposit on the rest of the seats.I am very confident that next time AAP will win from Chauhan Bangar also," he said.The Congress wrested the Chauhan Bangar ward from the AAP by a huge margin of over 10,000 votes.Pathak said people trust the AAP's governance model and they will oust the BJP government in the upcoming polls.The BJP has been ruling the municipal corporations since 2007. In the 2017 MCD polls, the party won 184 of the total 272 wards in three municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-will-make-delhi-world-class-city-if-voted-to-power-in-next-mcd-polls-pathak-101615707531532.html
14-03-2021||Mumbai||BJP's Fadnavis, Patil slam Shiv Sena's backing of assistant inspector Waze||Senior Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday said the arrest of assistant inspector Sachin Waze in connection with the explosives-laden vehicle found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's home was just the beginning of the flow of information about the case.It also puts a question mark on the Uddhav Thackeray- led Maha Vikas Aghadi government that was shielding Waze, Fadnavis claimed.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Waze on Saturday night for his alleged involvement in placing the explosives-laden vehicle on Carmichael Road near Ambani's residence Antilia on February 25, an agency spokesperson earlier said."If somebody from the police force works in this manner, then how will law and order be maintained? Waze was sheltered by the state government. Now the NIA has proof and has arrested him. This is just the beginning and more information will come out as the investigation progresses," the former Maharashtra CM told reporters.Fadnavis said Waze was under suspension since 2004 due to a Bombay High Court order.Also read: Ambani bomb scare probe: Sachin Waze appears before NIA in Mumbai"But when I was chief minister and held the home department, my Shiv Sena colleagues wanted Waze to be reinstated. I took the advice of the advocate general who said it was not proper to revoke the suspension. Last year, the MVA government reinstated Waze citing the lack of police officials amid the Covid-19 outbreak," he said.Fadnavis said Waze was posted in Crime Intelligence Unit, a sensitive and important arm of the Crime Branch, that too by giving him charge after transferring the inspector level official heading it.He was handling every case in the CIU despite being just an assistant police inspector (API) because he was confident he had the backing of the ruling Shiv Sena, Fadnavis alleged."He is now accused of staging an incident of which he was named the investigating officer," the former CM said.He rubbished talk of the involvement of the NIA, a Central agency, in the probe lowering the morale of Maharashtra police, and asked if the morale of the police was getting boosted due to the presence of personnel like Waze.Reacting to some leaders accusing him of getting sensitive information about the case before hand, Fadnavis said, as Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, it was his duty to highlight wrongdoing.Meanwhile Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said Waze had done irreparable damage to the image of the state."It is shameful that a police officer defended by the state chief minister till yesterday has been arrested by the NIA in a terror conspiracy case. The Shiv Sena was supporting a person who wanted to harm industrialists and destroy peace," he said.Patil said there were several answers people wanted to know about the incident involving the explosives-laden vehicle as well as the death of its owner Mansukh Hiran."People want to know why Waze was supported to the hilt and who are the leaders, MLAs, ministers and police officials who knew about the entire episode but chose to remain silent," Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjps-fadnavis-patil-slam-shiv-sena-s-backing-of-assistant-inspector-waze-101615720071715.html

Therefore, the complainant was required to suffer mental torture and was compelled to file present complaint before us. Hence, complainant is also entitled for Rs20,000 towards compensation for mental agony and costs of litigation collectively,” the forum stated in its order.Dube stated in her complaint that she is the wife of Arun Maruti Dube, who was a farmer and died on January 24, 2016, due to injuries sustained in a road accident. The deceased fell off his bicycle, and was admitted to hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he died during treatment on the same day. Arun Dube owned agricultural land at Premgiri village, bearing Gat No 502, and the complainant is the legal heir of the deceased. However, the insurance firm did not intimate the wwife about the status of her claim. Later, she got the information through an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, that her genuine claim was repudiated. Relevant claim papers produced on record by the complainant show that the cause of death of Arun Dube was due to heart attack. This insurance policy provides for compensation to farmers who sustain any bodily injury resulting solely and directly from accidents caused by external violent and visible means, resulting in specified contingencies such as death. Hence, natural death is excluded from the scope of the policy. The claim of complainant was repudiated on these grounds and the company submitted that the present complaint is liable to be dismissed with costs.The forum held that there is sufficient evidence on record to show that the deceased, who was the farmer owning agricultural land, accidentally fell down from a bicycle and died. “The complainant is the widow of the deceased farmer and has complied with all the substantial formalities as required under the agreement and government resolutions. Therefore, as per the terms and conditions of the agreement, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the insurance company is liable to satisfy the claim of the complainant,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consumer-forum-directs-insurance-firm-to-pay-farmer-s-widow-rs-2-20-lakh-101615721746644.html

However, during the period between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, 9,134 cases of dig bites were recorded. Civic officials have attributed the decline to the citywide lockdown last year, with Punekars spending more time indoors April to November.Dr Prakash Wagh, PMC’s veterinary superintendent said, “Citizens did not step out on the roads during the lockdown period and whatever incidents took place have occurred during the morning and night times. After the lockdown period, the sterilisation programme has intensified and it this brings down the number of dog-bite incidents.”Sunita Khare, an animal rights activist, said, “The strays are facing issues related to lack of food, due to unavailability during the lockdown period. Dogs don’t bite humans without a reason, unless provoked. Society needs to be considerate about strays and give them their due space to avoid man-animal conflict.” The population of stray dogs has gone up from 40,000 to 3 lakh in the last 10 years, according to a livestock survey conducted by the central government in 2019, as per to animal husbandry department and PMC.According to a new proposal, PMC will appoint NGOs to execute the animal birth control programme and provide 15 vehicles to such NGOs to undertake the programme. PMC is framing a programme for three years, like Mumbai, to control the population of dogs.At present, there are two dog pounds, one at the Naidu Hospital near Pune railway station and another located in the Mundhwa area; and a third is coming up in the Baner area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cases-of-dog-bite-drop-from-9k-in-2019-to-800-in-2020-due-to-lockdown-101615719106468.html
14-03-2021||Dehradun||New Uttarakhand CM to review some big decisions taken by Trivendra Singh Rawat||Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has decided to review and possibly reverse some major decisions taken by his predecessor, Trivendra Singh Rawat’s government. Apart from making it clear that there will be no mandatory Covid test for attending Haridwar Mahakumbh, during his visit to the sacred city, Rawat has also hinted that decisions like the formation of Char Dham Devasthanam Board and making Gairsain the third administrative division of the state will be reviewed in the light of people's "sentiments".Rawat hinted at this at his Dehradun residence when some reporters asked him questions regarding these decisions taken by his predecessor. “What is most important is what people want, what are their sentiments regarding these issues. We will talk to people on these issues,” he said.All these three decisions have been opposed by the concerned people, who have expressed their serious misgivings. Char Dham priests have been agitating since last year, alleging that the government's takeover of the Char Dham and 51 temples was not right and it will side-line priests from the management of these shrines, which have been managed for centuries by priests and seers.Following the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Centre and the state government, making a Covid-negative certificate mandatory for attending Mahakumbh, local traders, priests and Akhada seers were not happy with the strict restrictions. They wanted easing of the restrictions so that mahakumbh can be held in its fullest grandeur.And in case of the Gairsain decision, which triggered the recent political upheaval in the state, it was not just the BJP MLAs and ministers who claimed they were not consulted, but people in many of the districts included in the new administrative division were unhappy with the decision.Tirath Singh Rawat, when he took charge, said he will take ahead the work done by the Trivendra Singh Rawat government, but it has become clear that he has decided to review and likely reverse some of the decisions, aiming to check the resentment brewing among the people.Rawat has also decided to cancel the much-hyped events to commemorate completion of four years of BJP government in the state.On Sunday, the new chief minister also took charge of his office at the secretariat in Dehradun after ritual prayers and a ‘hawan’ ceremony. After that he left for Haridwar to meet the officials and review the mahakumbh preparations.The new CM’s focus on mahakumbh is quite clear, given his two visits to the sacred city after taking charge in the last four days. On Thursday, the day of his ascension, Rawat was in Haridwar along with his family members, showering flowers on pilgrims and ascetics and meeting Akhada seers, seeking their blessings. He directed officials that there should be no unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims and they shouldn’t face any inconvenience.Also Read: Uttarakhand: Tirath Singh Rawat cancels events to mark BJP govt's 4 yrs in powerIt is being seen as Rawat’s effort to placate those who have been unhappy with various decisions related to Kumbh management, taken by his predecessor. Many people are upset that the Mahakumbh has been shortened this time and strict restrictions have been put in place.Kumbh Mela additional officer Lalit Narayan Mishra said after the CM’s announcement, they are waiting for the official communique. He said in line with CM’s focus on Mahakumbh, they have taken adequate measures like sanitisation, availability of face masks and ensuring social distancing norms.“The directives and minutes that will come from the government after CM’s announcement regarding Covid report waiver, will be adhered to. As of now, our focus is on the next Shahi Snan (ritualistic royal bath) which falls in mid-April. We are focussing on all possible arrangements to ensure a safer and grand mahakumbh," said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/new-uttarakhand-cm-to-review-some-big-decisions-taken-by-trivendra-singh-rawat-101615718740998.html

After his late-night arrest on Saturday, the encounter specialist of the Mumbai Police was produced before a court in South Mumbai.During the hearing, NIA pleaded that the case has so far travelled to three agencies — Mumbai Crime Branch, Anti-terror Squad and then the NIA. Hence, NIA wants to probe the role played by the accused. The prosecution, however, refused to share the copy of the remand application with the lawyers of Vaze, citing privilege and confidentiality. Vaze’s lawyer Sudeep Passbola objected to it and claimed that the agency has no evidence to implicate Vaze. On the right to have access to the remand application, the court will hear the defence (Vaze) team arguments on Monday.Vaze has moved an application before the Bombay high court challenging the grounds of his arrest. Vaze's counsel advocate Sudeep Pasbola, however, was not available for further details about the high court plea.Vaze's alleged connection to the case surfaced after it was found that the SUV carrying the explosives belongs to a Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was found dead on February 5. Hiran's wife accused Vaze of killing her husband and claimed that Vaze took the SUV from Hiran in November. She also claimed that Vaze was pressurising Hiran to get arrested in the case.A top official told HT that during the 12-hour interrogation, Vaze confessed to being a part of the group that planted the car near Antilia on February 25. “Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive-laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25. He has confessed to it,” a top official told HT.After his name surfaced in the case, he was transferred from the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch to Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) of Mumbai police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambani-security-scare-probe-sachin-vaze-remanded-to-nia-custody-till-march-25-101615717797158.html

She worked a lot for women education, set up the Prayag Mahila Vidyapeeth and worked as its principal, which was quite a revolutionary step during the pre-Independence period,” he said.“It was women’s liberation in true sense. This courage to face the challenges of the society has been an inspiration for many women,” he added. "It deserves to be commemorated. This is why an award has been instituted after her name," Sinha said.Also Watch: ‘Yashwant Sinha Sahab is aged now…’: BJP reacts to ex-party veteran joining TMCDr Namrata Anand, the state president of the GKC, said over a dozen persons from different states including Maharashtra, Delhi, Bihar and West Bengal will be honoured with the Mahadevi Samman on her birth anniversary. “We have selected people from different faculties.

Raut’s remarks come after the 49-year-old assistant police inspector was arrested late on Saturday after being questioned for nearly 12 hours.“I believe Sachin Vaze is a very honest and capable officer. He has been arrested in connection with gelatin sticks that were found. One suspicious death also occurred. It's Mumbai Police's responsibility to investigate the matter. No central team was needed,” Raut told news agency ANI.The Sena lawmaker also reiterated his stand against the “repeated interference” of central bodies in cases based in Mumbai, saying that it creates instability in the state. “We respect NIA but our police could have done it too. Mumbai Police and ATS (Anti-Terrorism Squad) are well respected but central agencies repeatedly enter Mumbai and demoralise Mumbai Police. It creates instability in the state and creates pressure on the Mumbai Police and administration,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Raut was referring to the transfer of the Ambani case, which was first registered at the city’s Gandhari police station. It was transferred to ATS after opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis demanded an NIA investigation into it. ATS registered a separate murder case after the man said to be the owner of the explosives-laden sport utility vehicle parked near Ambani’s residence was found dead on March 5.NIA later took over the security threat case and on Saturday questioned Vaze, who was earlier the lead investigator in the case. His links were also traced to Mansukh Hiran, the Thane-based auto parts dealer who claimed the SUV’s ownership.Raut made similar comments when the probe in the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was handed over from the Mumbai Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau began investigating the money laundering and drug angle in the case respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-very-honest-capable-sanjay-raut-day-after-mumbai-cop-s-arrest-101615713463812.html
14-03-2021||Bhopal||MP to auction unused govt properties to fund direct money transfer schemes||Reeling under a debt of more than ₹2 lakh crore, the Madhya Pradesh government has decided to auction government properties that are not in use or are encroached, with an aim to generate revenue to meet the shortfall of ₹8,294 crore, projected for 2020-21, said officials.To sell these properties, the state government set up a public asset management department in September 2020 for efficient management and rationalization of public assets, including monetization of unused properties.The department has asked the 52 departments of the MP government to share the list of unused properties and land of higher value so that it could be auctioned. The state government’s target is to generate ₹1000 crore in six months by selling such properties, said one officer of the department, who is not authorized to talk to the media.“The departments have started sharing the list of unused properties. Our priority is to sell the properties of MP Road Transport Corporation, which have been closed down many years ago and other such small offices and mills,” said the officer.In the past two months, the MP government has released tenders for selling 18 properties including three bus depots and booking offices of MP Road Transport Corporation (MPRTC), a factory in Ujjain, a government office in Bhopal and government lands worth more than ₹200 crores, said an official. He added that more tenders will be released after the list submitted by the departments are finalised.Another official said that the state government was in a hurry to generate revenue to fulfil the promises made for civic bodies’ polls and panchayat elections, which are slated to be held in April and May.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has transferred ₹4,600 crores into the bank accounts of different beneficiaries since November 2020 and more would be done in the next few months, according to the public relation department officials.The state government has provided ₹20,000 crores for such money transfer schemes such as Sambal, Mukhyamntri Kalyan Krishi, Rising School and Teerth Darshan before the local body polls.Economics professor Ganesh Kawade said, “It is a good decision of the state government to monetize the abandoned properties but they should select the properties wisely with the help of a team of experts. They should also ensure the proper valuation of the properties because there are chances of scam and undervaluing of the property to provide benefit to any private company.”Transport minister Govind Singh Rajput said, “The state government will auction only those properties which are unused and encroached by private persons. The properties of MPRTC in other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, will also be auctioned along with properties worth crores of rupees in Madhya Pradesh. We don’t want to make an excuse for financial crises before the common people. We are here for the solution, not for making excuses.”Also Read: MP Congress seeks Shivraj Chouhan's resignation after SC slammed law & order“We will use generated revenue to run beneficial schemes of the government and to develop infrastructure,” he added.Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary said, “BJP-led state and central governments are planning to sell everything to private companies. What do they mean by unused properties and who is deciding what is useful and what is not?”“Many towns don’t have bus stands but in the same towns they are planning to sell bus depots with an assurance that they will construct bus stands. This idea of revenue generation is to provide benefits to private companies, not for the welfare of common people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-auction-unused-govt-properties-to-fund-direct-money-transfer-schemes-101615712667007.html
14-03-2021||Pune||YourSpace: Pune loses top spot in Ease of Living Index... Rankings are way off reality||Pune has failed to retain its top position among 111 most liveable cities with a population of more than a million in the Ease of Living Index 2020 (EoLI) declared by the central government on March 4 this year. The city ranked top position in the first EoLI report released in 2018. EoLI is an indicator on quality of life and impact of initiatives for urban development. Where has authorities lacked to make urban life more effective? Public transport, sanitation need attentionThere should be continuous efforts to maintain the top spot at ease of living rankings. As compared to other cities, Pune is comfortable to live in but it is not easy. A lot of attention needs to be given towards public transportation and sanitation. These two factors are often ignored. Punekars still don’t have efficient public transportation. Also, steps should be taken to clear piling and overflowing garbage seen on roadsides.Sharayu Fukey Interior areas are ignoredThe Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should not only improve civic amenities of main streets but also interior localities of the city. Many roads of these areas are not in good shape and public complaints are often ignored. Regular road repairs should be carried out. Also, some areas face acute water shortage. A good city is defined for equitable drinking water distribution. It is not enough to achieve top rankings on the index, the results should be reflected on ground also. Sukhada DikeyCity’s traffic management is badTraffic remains the worst problem for those living in Pune. Authorities should have been paying more attention to it. The road traffic has eased a bit as many are working from home because of the Covid situation. Otherwise it seems that authorities are not paying attention to this problem. Roads are blocked during rains or some civic works. An efficient system has to be developed to deal with such situations. Good public transport system could be a solution to it, but not enough is being done about it. Anand GanorkarBicycle-sharing system fails in cityAuthorities chalk out plans and leave it midway. A year before, there was a plan of public sharing bicycle. Friend and I used the facility when we visited Jungli Maharaj road. But now I don’t see the cycles anywhere. What happened to that plan? There has to good implementation of plans. Sometimes work is not completed on schedule. I often see hastily and incomplete construction work and potholes. Delay of civic works can be understood, but it should be completed. Indrani Bhagat Provide clean public toilets for women I often visit Mandai, Ravivar peth, Tulshibaugh and Laxmi road for shopping. These are prime areas flooded with people. Yet, there are no decent facilities of washroom. It becomes difficult for women. Many people from various parts of the city visit these areas. Authorities should provide appropriate facility of washroom and drinking water. Besides constructing washrooms, it should also be properly maintained. Many women avoid public toilets because of unsanitary conditions. What about the ease of a woman’s living? Isn’t it an essential part of a city? Supriya Parakhi Better hospital care mustPeople should feel comfortable and reassured while going to a public hospital. Everyone should get healthcare facilities such as ambulance, first aid in times of emergencies. Are we getting it? Can the poor also get the same standard of treatment? It should be kept in mind. Also, when a new person comes into the city, s/he should feel comfortable in finding necessary things easily. Such system should be created. Mrunali Akolkar Residents should help each otherI feel residents of a city should be cooperative and supportive towards each other. Then only ease of living can be achieved. Of course, administration has a big role in it, but citizens should ask whether they are making each other’s life easier? We should embrace community life. Try to care more for each other. Try to help each other more. Then only mental ease of life will be achieved.Vinay Girhe Rankings are way off from realityThe central government (mainly the ministry of housing and urban affairs) since 2014 seems quite obsessed with holding/supporting intra city competitions on various fronts. If these competitions yield good results seen n ground, Punekars would be the most enthused Indians. Whether it is the Ease of Business, Janagraha, Swachch Bharat Abhiyaan, Happy City and Indian Smart City initiatives or the latest results on Ease of Living Index.The authorities should give respondent and sample detailsBasic service parameters that cover “ease of living” are missing on ground in Pune. Poor urban planning, regular traffic jams, yearly flooding, abysmal garbage collections and disposal, unplanned and unfinished infra projects, bad roads and badly designed footpaths and cycle tracks, missing street lights and hawker menace, ineffective public transport and air pollution are some of the key issues. On what basis are respondents picked? Whether the respondents are Punekars, or tourists, or picked on the streets…as the percentages in scoring are way off target from reality.If it means that cities compete against the worst, then these competitions are a success. But, if it to extract the best outcome out of each city doing a self-assessment by having them compete against themselves, these ranking are abject failure.

14-03-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: The story of “White Rabbit Red Rabbit”||I am writing this article while prepping for a very unique show called “White Rabbit Red Rabbit”. Written by the Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour, the uniqueness of the play lies in its concept of performance. It is a mono-act piece, but every performance requires a different actor. The actor is given the script on stage, in front of the audience and she/he has to start reading and performing it immediately! One of most important pre-requisites of the play is that the performer should not have read the script before nor should she/ he have watched someone else perform it! It should be the performer’s first time, getting to know the material! (So, if you are someone who feels that you have a fair chance to perform it, I would suggest that you leave reading the article at this point!) The concept of “White Rabbit Red Rabbit” came to Nassim when he refused the mandatory military service in Iran. He was not allowed to leave his country and this play was written as a reaction to his incident. Ironically, before he was finally granted a passport, the play had already been performed in most parts of the world. The play is an important cultural phenomenon of recent times. This is an audacious experiment which requires no director and set. Just an actor and some stage props, and of course an audience! There are many moments in the play where the actor interacts with the audience members, often calling them up on stage. Nassim makes it clear through the play that it is his creative expression and that the actor is just a medium. He gives out his email address in the play and appeals to the audience members to send him pictures of the performance and their thoughts about the text. The performer is sent an email 48 hours before the play which has a set of instructions, prepared by Nassim of course. The actor is asked to prepare an animal impression and to bring a water bottle, in case she/he needs to drink during the performance. There are two glasses of water on stage, as part of the stage props, but the actor is not supposed to use or touch any props unless expressly mentioned in the script. The play has been translated in over 30 languages in the world and was brought to India by Mumbai-based theatre group QTP. It is presented in Marathi by Natak Company, of which I am a founder member. I have watched several performances of this play in Marathi and it is interesting to see that the tone, outcome and impact of every show is different even though the text is the same. The same text was performed as a comedy by a few actors, but the climax of one show in particular was extremely emotionally charged. “White Rabbit Red Rabbit” was first performed in 2011 and is still performed by theatre companies across the world. Most of the theatres in Europe shut down on March 13, 2020. Normal theatre going practice is yet to resume in most parts of the world. It is a situation similar to the one Nassim was in when he was not allowed to travel, making this play more relevant. Keeping this in mind, a global event has been organised to perform this play in all languages at 8 pm local time. The script has also been modified considering the fact that most performances will be conducted online. The writer is not charging any royalty for these performances and has urged all theatre companies to donate profits to a charity of their choice. Curtain call: Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-the-story-of-white-rabbit-red-rabbit-101615708726238.html

Otherwise, we will be compelled to impose night curfew at place witnessing an increase in Covid-19 positive cases,” he said.Madhya Pradesh on Saturday added 675 fresh Covid-19 cases, two more deaths and 496 recoveries. The caseload has climbed to 267,851 with 3,885 deaths and more than 259,000 people have recovered so far. The pandemic situation in the central state of India has been worsening since the first week of March.Indore and Bhopal are the worst-affected regions in the state and have reported 61,642 and 45,079 Covid-19 cases respectively. Chouhan said on Saturday that night curfew may be imposed in Indore and Bhopal from Sunday or Monday due to a recent uptick in their daily cases and tough measures would be taken to ‘flatten the curve’.According to a report by Hindustan Times, in what is being seen as a measure to ramp up the fight against the outbreak in Indore, the district's chief medical health officer Praveen Jadia said on Saturday big hospitals in Indore will now allow vaccinations of up to 500 beneficiaries every day and smaller hospitals have been permitted to vaccinate 250 people each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-needs-8-1-million-first-doses-of-vaccine-cm-chouhan-as-tally-nears-268000-101615703394099.html

14-03-2021||Mumbai||NIA to produce Sachin Vaze, held in Ambani case, in court to seek custody||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will present Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze before a holiday court on Sunday seeking his custody to probe him for his alleged role in the conspiracy to plant an explosive-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence.The case will be heard at NIA sessions court in Mumbai’s Kalaghoda.Vaze, an assistant police inspector, was arrested late on Saturday by the NIA at their Mumbai office after he allegedly confessed to his role in the Ambani security threat case. Before his arrest, the assistant police inspector was questioned for nearly 12 hours by an NIA team led by inspector general (IG) Anil Shukla. “Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive-laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25,” a top NIA official told HT. The 49-year-old Mumbai Police official, however, declined to share any more details at this stage, the NIA officer added.Before it was handed over to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and then to the NIA, Vaze was the lead investigator in the case. The NIA recorded Vaze’s statement to find out the sequence of events as he was initially heading the probe and also for his connection to the man linked to the vehicle found with 20 gelatin sticks near the billionaire’s residence in Mumbai.He was named in a statement to police by Vimla Hiran, the widow of Thane’s Mansukh Hiran, who claimed ownership of the vehicle parked outside Ambani’s house and was later found dead in a creek on March 5. The 48-year-old auto-parts dealer’s widow told the police that the explosives-laden Scorpio belonged to one Dr Peter Newton and had been with them for the past three years.She said that Hiran lent the SUV to Vaze in November 2020 and the vehicle was sent back to his shop in Thane on February 5 this year. It has been alleged that Vaze was also forcing the Thane businessman to take the blame for the case on him and surrender to the police.Thane sessions court judge rejected Vaze’s anticipatory bail application on Friday and set March 19 as the next date of hearing in connection with a separate case registered by the ATS in Hiran’s alleged murder last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nia-to-present-sachin-vaze-held-in-ambani-case-before-court-to-seek-custody-101615693496229.html
14-03-2021||Bhopal||MP Congress seeks Shivraj Chouhan's resignation after SC slammed law & order||After Supreme Court reprimanded Madhya Pradesh government on condition of law and order in the state, Congress attacked BJP government and raised questions on working of MP Police on Saturday.The Supreme Court on Friday pulled up the state government for not arresting BSP MLA Rambai’s husband Govind Singh Thakur in connection with the murder of Congress leader Devendra Chaurasiya from Damoh, and for alleged threats to an additional sessions judge, said Manish Nagaich, Chaurasiya’s advocate.“During the hearing, the apex court said the state government should accept they are not capable of ruling according to the Constitution of India,” said Nagaich.Govind Singh and four others were accused of killing Chaurasia in front of his son in March 2019. Criminal charges were earlier dropped against Govind Singh after a police investigation. He was again named accused in January on the orders of Damoh additional sessions judge RP Sonkar. Sonkar also issued an arrest warrant against Govind Singh, who is absconding. Earlier, justice Sonkar, who was conducting the trial in the murder case, alleged the police were supporting Govind Singh and maligning his image. He wrote to the sessions judge, two days after a woman police officer accused Sonkar of harassing and insulting her for the delay in Govind Singh’s arrest.“The apex court on Friday pulled up the state government, asking if there was law-and-order in MP or ‘Jungle Raj’. This proved that the MP government is patronising mafias and criminals," said MP Congress Committee general secretary KK Mishra.Mishra further claimed that despite justice Sonkar accusing MP police of falsely accusing and implicating him, the state government didn’t take any action against the police officers. He said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should resign for “failing” to maintain law and order in the state.Also Read: Big hospitals in Indore allowed to vaccinate up to 500 people per day: OfficialHowever, BJP leaders said the government will look into the matter.“We respect the apex court, but Congress leaders have no rights to question the law-and-order situation in MP.

The Samiti wrote to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman demanding action against the officials who served the notice.Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti is a joint platform of different akhadas and mutts (monasteries) of Sanatan Hindu Dharma.In a press conference at the Samiti office, Swami Jeetendranand Saraswati, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, said, "Certain work was done by the joint efforts of the state government and centre during Kumbh 2019, in Prayagraj, so that pilgrims may live there comfortably. At that time, UP government had done some work in 13 akhadas and major mutts to add facilities to ensure comfortable living to the pilgrims during their visit to the Kumbh. The Jal Nigam was the executing agency for this work and the UP government or centre provided the fund to it.”He said that the akhadas and seers had nothing to do with that fund. They didn't get any funds for that work in their bank accounts. He said that despite that, the income tax department served a notice to the 13 akhadas and major mutts and seers for the fund which they never got.Also Read: On new CM's command, choppers shower flowers on seers in HaridwarSaraswati said that through the notice, the seers have been asked to be present in person and give a clarification. “As an Indian citizen, it is our duty to give an account of the fund which we receive.

14-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze arrested by NIA in Ambani threat case: What we know so far||Sachin Vaze, an assistant police inspector at the centre of the industrialist Mukesh Ambani security threat case, was on Saturday arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for the alleged conspiracy to plant an explosive-laden vehicle near the billionaire’s home in Mumbai, a top official said.Vaze, who was the lead investigator in the case before it was handed over to the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Mumbai Police, and then the NIA, was arrested by the central agency at 11:50pm on Saturday after being questioned for nearly 12 hours.Here’s what we know about the case so far:1. A sports utility vehicle laden with 20 gelatin sticks and a threatening letter was found parked near Ambani’s residence on February 25. There was, however, no other assembled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) or timer in the vehicle.2. A Telegram channel was created by “jaishulhind” [Jaish-ul-Hind] on February 26 and a message claiming responsibility for parking the vehicle outside Antilia, where Ambani lives with his family, was posted from that channel.3. On Saturday, a special cell team of the Delhi Police interrogated Tehsin Akhtar, who is known to be the last chief of the now dormant homegrown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), as two smartphones were recovered from his barrack in Tihar Jail. One of these phones was reportedly used to send out the message that claimed responsibility for the explosives found outside the industrialist’s house last month.4. A 48-year-old auto parts dealer in Thane, Mansukh Hiran, claimed the SUV was his and told the police that it was stolen from the Vikhroli area a week before it was found outside Ambani's house. He was found dead in a creek on the outskirts of Mumbai.5. Hiran’s widow Vimla named Waze in her statement to the police. She said she suspected the 49-year-old police officer’s role in the matter. She told the investigators the SUV belonged to one Dr Peter Newton, who was known to her husband.6. The Scorpio was with the Hirans for the past three years and was lent to Waze in November 2020. The vehicle was dropped off by the police official’s driver at Hiran’s shop in Thane on February 5 this year. It has been alleged that Vaze was also forcing Hiran to take responsibility for the case and surrender to the police.7. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar reportedly intervened as Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray did not want to take action against the police officer, who had once quit the service and joined the Shiv Sena.8.

14-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Tirath Singh Rawat cancels events to mark BJP govt's 4 yrs in power||Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, on Saturday, cancelled the programmes scheduled in all 70 constituencies of the state to mark the completion of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s four years on March 18, citing ‘unavoidable’ reasons, amid murmurs that it could have aggravated the differences within the party. The cancellation also comes amid Opposition charge that the government had delivered very little during the period.State chief secretary issued a notification to the effect on Saturday evening, only a day after confirming events were to be organised as per the schedule, leaving many surprised. The decision to commemorate four years in government was taken by previous chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, who was replaced by Tirath Singh Rawat on March 10 by the party in the face of growing dissension against his leadership style from within the state unit.Party leaders said the cancellation followed concerns over newly-appointed CM’s decision to address one of the celebratory events being organised near Dehradun, at Raipur constituency, represented by BJP leader Umesh Sharma 'Kau', a known critic of former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat. Friday's notification had confirmed Rawat as the chief guest at the Raipur programme."In former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat's programme schedule, he was to attend the programme at his assembly seat of Doiwala near Dehradun. But CM Tirath said he would attend the event at Raipur, a seat held by ‘Kau’, who is considered an opponent of Trivendra," said a party leader, who didn't wish to be named.CM Tirath's decision to address the programme from Kau's constituency raised many eyebrows in the party leadership."The equations between Kau and Trivendra are known to all. Kau, a staunch opponent of the latter, wrote last year to party national president JP Nadda, alleging his constituency was being neglected by the state government, due to which, constituents were angry," said the leader, adding CM Tirath's decision could have created further rift in the party, which could have completely defeated the reason for his selection as the new CM by party high command.Another leader privy to the development, said some leaders requested the CM not to go ahead with his Raipur address as it "would give a wrong signal to party workers and the media" but he "refused"."It was then decided to cancel the whole programme and hold it later," he said.BJP state media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan, however, said, "The programmes have been postponed for later when they will be organised in a much more grand way. However, the new date is yet to be decided," he said.Also Watch: Fire engulfs train bogey in Uttarakhand; passengers evacuatedOpposition Congress said there was no point in holding celebrations when the "government had done nothing on development in four years of its tenure.""It is good that programmes have been cancelled, but the question is what the BJP government was going to celebrate when it failed to tackle unemployment, price rise, rampant corruption and declining economy," said Congress state president Pritam Singh."Moreover, the celebrations would have only led to the expenditure of crores of money from the exchequer. The BJP government has no right to celebrate when it did nothing for the development of the state," said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-tirath-singh-rawat-cancels-events-to-mark-bjp-govt-s-4-yrs-in-power-101615688831254.html

14-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai cop, who probed Ambani security scare case, was involved; arrested: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze, 49, for the alleged conspiracy to plant an explosive-laden sports utility vehicle near the residence of billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25, a top official of the federal probe agency said.Vaze, an assistant police inspector, was placed under arrest minutes before Saturday midnight by an NIA team led by Inspector General (IG) Anil Shukla at the agency’s Mumbai office. Vaze had walked into the NIA office a little after 11 am and had been grilled for nearly 12 hours. The arrest was made at 11.50 pm.Vaze was the lead investigator in the explosives case before it was transferred to the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Mumbai Police, and later the NIA. On Saturday, he tried to get anticipatory bail from a judge but did not succeed.“Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25,” a top NIA official told HT. The officer alleged that Sachin Vaze had confessed to his role in the entire episode but declined to share more details at this stage.Also Read | Vaze under scanner in Hiran death case: What led to the moveIt is not clear if there was a conspiracy to hurt the Ambani family. The SUV found parked near the Ambani residence had 20 gelatin sticks and a threatening letter. There was, however, no other assembled Improvised Explosive Device (IED) or timer in the vehicle.Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old auto parts dealer in Thane who claimed ownership of the abandoned vehicle - he told the police that the vehicle was stolen a week earlier - was found dead in a creek in Mumbai on March 5. Hiran’s wife Vimla blamed Sachin Vaze for the murder, claiming that her husband had given the SUV to the police officer months before it mysteriously turned up outside the Ambani residence.Vaze’s arrest by the NIA could lead to some embarrassing moments for the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), particularly the Shiv Sena, which was accused by the opposition BJP of going soft on Vaze. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who led his party’s offensive against the MVA government, had cited Vimla Hiran’s statement to demand that the police officer be suspended and arrested. But chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was unwilling to take action against the 49-year-old officer who had once quit the service and joined the Sena.Also Read | Antilia bomb threat put out on Telegram channel made in TiharAs the opposition amped up its attacks on the government, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar finally intervened on Wednesday and discussed the case with the chief minister.

A thorough probe will be conducted in the case,” Thackeray told reporters after the end of the state’s budget session where Vaze’s transfer was first announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-cop-sachin-vaze-grilled-for-12-hours-arrested-at-midnight-by-nia-101615664441854.html
14-03-2021||Chandigarh||HC dismisses bail plea of man accused of cheating in name of CM’s OSD||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed a bail plea of a Sangrur man accused of cheating multiple persons in the name of officer on special duty (OSD), Sandeep Singh Sunny Brar, to the Punjab chief minister.Two FIRs were registered against Abdul Gaffar on January 17 on allegations of cheating and Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Allegations were that he took money from two persons to help them in securing release and settling drugs and sexual harassment cases.The complainant, Mohammad Jahid, told police that Gaffar informed him that he could get his brother-in-law released from judicial custody in drugs seizure case for which the total expenditure of ₹15 lakh was estimated. He claimed to have good relations with OSD to CM and he took him to meet a person who introduced himself as the OSD and an assurance was given that “any work” could be done through him, the allegations recorded in petition says adding that the complainant paid him ₹9 lakh. However, as the work was not done, he requested to return the money, it adds. As Gaffar dilly dallied on returning money, the complainant went to meet the OSD, where he found that he was not the same person introduced as OSD by Gaffar, as per allegations in the plea. Brar advised the complainant to file a complaint, following which he approached the police. In the second case, Gaffar was accused of striking a deal with one Mohammed Abdul Rashid for ₹10.5 lakh for settling a case of sexual harassment against one of his relative. Gaffar had argued in court that he had been falsely implicated in these cases and at best it can be termed as a civil dispute between them. To give bribe and accept the same are offences, but no action has been taken against the complainants. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to concession of anticipatory bail, he had argued. Police had opposed the bail stating that investigation is at the initial stage and that his custodial interrogation would be required to unearth the truth behind the entire episode and the modus operandi.The bench while denying the bail observed this is not a case that a single person has made allegations of cheating against him, but two different FIRs by two different complainants have been lodged against him. In order to unearth the modus operandi and to catch the person who impersonated as OSD to the CM, his custodial interrogation is required, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-man-accused-of-cheating-in-name-of-cm-s-osd-101615664024831.html

Stating that this spoke volumes about the state of the Congress government, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that forget facing the public, the government is unable to even face the media now. “This is why mediapersons are being asked to hand over their queries days in advance to the scheduled press conference on March 18,” he said.The SAD reacted to the text messages sent by the department of public relations asking scribe to send questions in advance for the press conference scheduled to be held on March 18 on the completion of four years of the state government. Asking the chief minister why he was going through the motions of a ‘fixed’ press conference, Cheema said: “The Congress government could have very well issued a handout stating it had completed 100% of the promises made to the people as part of a one-day publicity stunt in the same manner in which it had claimed last week that 84.6% of the poll promises made to the people had been fulfilled.” Asserting that the Congress government was insulting the fourth estate by passing such draconian directions, the SAD leader said such conduct was also not conducive for a thriving democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-yrs-in-office-sad-flays-cm-for-planning-a-sanitised-press-conference-101615663844858.html

An authorisation for the arrest of seven persons was issued by commissioner state Tax Nilkanth S Avhad, under Section 69 of the GST Act for violation of Section 132 (1)(a),(b) &(c). Search and seizure operations were conducted at multiple locations in Khanna, including residences of the accused, to gather evidence for establishing the modus operandi that involved creating firms in states outside and within Punjab dealing in copper scrap and hosiery items and thereafter passing the same to various beneficiary firms in Punjab, the release said. The income tax certificate (ITC) created through bogus firms was used to support the local movement of goods of various traders, said the release, adding the department got alerted about the network after a vehicle carrying copper scrap was detained by the mobile wing in Jalandhar last year and investigation revealed that the goods had been procured locally while the e-way and invoice were generated from some other firm. Detailed investigation revealed a network of 44 firms spread across states that was being used to create the bogus ITC for setting off the tax liability arising out of purchases made from local unregistered dealers. On being confronted with the evidence, the kingpin confessed that he was operating the network with the help of some other accomplices some of whom have also been arrested, the release said. During search operations, incriminating documents related to various firms and mobile phones used for sharing fake invoices and e-way bills generated were seized. The total bogus billing by the network is likely to be more than ₹700 crore while ITC created/availed and tax evaded is more than ₹122 crore, the release said. .Evidence was also gathered about various beneficiaries of the bogus network and other accomplices involved. The arrested have been identified as Vinod kumar, Maninder Sharma, Sandeep Singh, Amarinder Singh and Sunny Mehta, all residents of Khanna. They were produced before the duty magistrate and were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rs-700-cr-bogus-gst-billing-scam-busted-in-punjab-5-held-101615663604732.html

Bedridden following a spine operation, he says with his usual rye humour: “Well, if it had to come late, then the award amount should have come with interest added to the award amount!”This Rupana boy penned his first short story in Class 5 and it was his fifth story ‘Hava’ (wind) which became a classic with a difference as it was the first heart-wrenching confession of what happened at during Partition on this side of the border in which the narrator passes a caravan of refugees trudging to the new land of Pakistan with the dead outnumbering the living. This was followed many years later by yet another classic of the great divide, ‘Sheesha’ (mirror) in which he tells the untold some 50 years later.After completing his Masters in Punjabi literature from Delhi University, he started his working career as a schoolteacher in the metropolis with very close literary ties with celebrated Punjabi poet Amrita Pritam, who was one of the first to acknowledge his talent. He has authored some 70 stories and five novels and is working currently on the sixth titled ‘Murti’, which tells a woman’s tale. “I am often accused of having written less but those who say so forget that I am a writer not a printing press,” he says with his usual guffaw. The award winning collection tells stories of the marginalised: Dalits, immigrant labourers, slum dwellers with an extraordinary flourish. He adds: “I am often asked why I suffix the name of my village to my name and my reply is that where would I be without the soil I was born to in which I harvested my stories, never shying away from the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/master-storyteller-rupana-gets-sahitya-akademi-award-at-87-101615663425022.html

A rift has been created in the party over its ticket for Khemkaran assembly.Earlier this week, during his two-day public meetings in Khemkaran, former SAD minister and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal’s son-in-law Adesh Partap Singh Kairon, had laid a claim to the ticket. Khemkaran is home turf of SAD’s senior leader Virsa Singh Valtoha, who has fought three assembly elections from here, winning two of them. Valtoha has dubbed this as a betrayal and vowed to work to deny a ticket to the Kairons. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal is holding a rally at Amarkot village of Khemkaran constituency on March 15, under the party’s Punjab Mangda Hisab campaign. Now, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member Bhai Manjit Singh, son of former chief of Damdami Taksal Kartar Singh Bhindranwale, has written a letter to SAD patron Parkash and Sukhbir, seeking a ticket from Tarn Taran district.Manjit, of Bhura Kohna village in Khemkaran constituency, told HT over phone,“My father opposed Indira Gandhi’s emergency. My brother Bhai Amrik Singh, who remained president of All-India Sikh Student Federation, was killed while fighting the Indian Army during the attack on the Akal Takht Sahib. I will start my campaign from April 13 by paying obeisance at the Baba Budha Sahib Gurdwara.”On Valtoha’s annoyance over Kairon’s ‘interference’ in the constituency, Manjit added, “I made Valtoha a two-time MLA by my support. If I get the ticket from Khemkaran, Valtoha will support me.”Former Subordinate Service Selection Board (SSSB) member Iqbal Singh Sandhu has also been camping in Tarn Taran for the past few months. Iqbal, who claims to have former minister Bikram Singh Majithia’s backing, said, “The party high command has given its blessings to me from Tarn Taran.” BATALA MLA STAKES CLAIM TO TICKET ON FATEHGARH CHURIAN Batala MLA Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal has staked claim to SAD assembly poll ticket from Fatehgarh Churian seat in Gurdaspur district. Ravikaran Singh Kahlon, son of Akali stalwart and former Punjab assembly speaker Nirmal Singh Kahlon, has already been nursing the constituency.Lodhinangal challenged Kahlon’s claim a day after he (Kahlon) shared a photo of his meeting with the party chief Sukhbir. In the photo caption, Kahlon claimed that the party president had handed him over the command of the segment. Kahlon has been working in this constituency as “halqa incharge. “I shall gift victory to the party from this constituency in 2022 elections,” his post said.Batala MLA said, “My home segment is Fatehgarh Churian. My village Lodhinangal is here. Akali workers have warned that they would have no option other than leaving the party if I don’t contest from Fatehgarh Churian.” On Sunday, he is addressing a gathering of his supporters at Hothian village. On Lodhinangal, Kahlon said, “I met the party president on Friday. He trusts me and ordered me to go ahead. Since he appointed me in-charge, I have been serving the constituency. Where was he (Lodhinangal) earlier?”.Qadian, Sri Hargobindpur and Dera Baba Nanak constituencies in the district also face a similar fight over ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/battle-on-for-claim-to-sad-assembly-ticket-in-majha-101615662704985.html
14-03-2021||City||TN Cong members allege 'discriminatory candidate selection' for assembly polls||There is dissent in the Tamil Nadu unit of the Congress over the selection of candidates for 25 assembly seats and a Lok Sabha by-poll Kanyakumari seat for which elections will be held on April 6.On Saturday, Congress MP Vishnu Prasad and his supporters were on a hunger strike stating that those who quit the party and distant relatives of certain unnamed leaders were being offered tickets and being supported by other Congress leaders on social media. Congress, which is in alliance with the principal opposition DMK, has so far announced only its constituencies and is yet to release its list of candidates.“One person has quit the party a month ago and threatened to come back only if given a ticket and that person is being given a seat, how is it just?” Prasad told reporters. “We are on a fast to protest against the party leadership that isn’t respecting the party cadre. District-level leaders should do all the work for the party but only those with money and power are given seats. How is this democratic? It is alright if leaders’ children seek seats but even in-laws are receiving seats. Look how badly the party has been reduced to. Is this Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) or Commercial or Corporate Committee? If we remain mute anymore, we would be betraying our leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” he said.Congress MP from Karur S Jothimani tweeted in Tamil in support of his claims and said that her ‘blood boils’ over the ‘betrayal’ and that ‘dishonest practices’ followed in candidate selection would only end up helping the ruling AIADMK-BJP alliance.Also read: TN CM Edappadi Palaniswami confident of ‘sweeping majority’ in assembly polls“I am aware of the agitated state of minds of Congress cadres…” she tweeted, adding that she has already raised questions on it. “The heartless leaders are drinking the blood of cadres and not listening to the voice of justice.” She said she wouldn’t be an MP if Rahul Gandhi believed in money power and that it was their duty to protect the dignity of the central leadership. Following her tweets, Villupuram MP Manickam Tagore took to Twitter to express his displeasure against the internal rebellion, however, he took no names.TNCC chief KS Alagiri sought to appease Vishnu Prasad at the headquarters and talks were on-going between them at the Congress office on Saturday night.Senior Congress leader EVKS Elangovan dismissed any irregularities in the candidate selection. "Every election this will happen with some aggrieved parties, it is nothing serious and is solved now," Elangovan said.This isn’t the first time that party leaders have made public their displeasure on the internal workings. In January, INC had revamped the state committee ahead of the elections by making several appointments to which Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram, in a tweet, commented that such 'jumbo committees serve no purpose’. He said that with several leaders there would be no leader, no authority or accountability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tn-congress-members-call-out-discriminate-candidate-selection-for-assembly-polls-101615661167198.html
14-03-2021||Other||Education dept probe into paper leak gives clean chit to SCERT||Bathinda An internal inquiry report of the state education department has given a clean chit to the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT). The report was sought after question papers of pre-final tests appeared on social media before the exams were conducted. The Punjab School Education Board (PSEB) conducts the final exams, with paper setting and issue of pre-final tests with the SCERT. A random analysis of these question papers, including board classes of 10 and 12 show that the papers were uploaded on the eve of examination. To date, these test papers remain on YouTube with timeline descriptions on at least two channels. One of these channels has over 17 lakh views, the other has crossed 2 lakh views. Such large viewership is related to the question papers and answers posted on it.On February 24, HT had reported details quoting the director-general of education department Mohammad Tayyab that action was being taken as complaints of the alleged leak of pre-final exams surfaced from a number of schools.SCERT director Jagtar Singh refused to comment on the incidents and on pre-final question papers landing up on YouTube. PSEB controller of examination Janak Raj Mehrok said he had submitted a report to the board chairperson, with official reaction awaited. “In her report, deputy director, academics, Amarjit Kaur Dalam stated that these questions papers were actually guess papers to facilitate students. She has ruled out paper leak,” Jagtar claimed. Dalam, however, could not ascertain or evaluate the content posted on the two specific Youtube channels. This is even as several government school heads talk of the compromising of examination secrecy.Classroom exams for Classes 6-12 started on February 15 till March 1. Uniform question papers for these classes were prepared centrally and dispatched to school heads through email on the eve of the examination.Teachers from schools in Bathinda and adjoining districts reconfirm that students had easy access to the papers hours on the two YouTube channels, before the examination day. Instead of face-saving after the expose, authorities should have contacted teachers as the breach is widely acknowledged, the staff claims. “This is a serious issue as government school students get 10-20% marks in different subjects on the basis of an assessment on these examinations. Authorities should have fixed accountability. The should examine over 200 video posts on YouTube channels and compare content with actual question papers,” said the head of a government school in Malwa region.After the anomaly was highlighted, the authorities opted not to send digital copies of question papers for non-board classes of government schools. Final papers for various classes start on March 15. Sources in the education department said, this time, hard copies of question papers are being sent to schools to rule out any leak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/education-dept-probe-into-paper-leak-gives-clean-chit-to-scert-101615661264499.html

14-03-2021||Other||Telangana MLC polls today, acid test for TRS||Hyderabad: The elections to the Telangana Legislative Council from two graduates’ constituencies are to be held from 8am to 4pm on Sunday. Polls in the two constituencies, each comprising three districts - Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar and Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda - are going to be a litmus test for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. As many as 10,36,565 graduates, including 3,67,808 women, will exercise their franchise at 1,530 polling stations in these two constituencies. What makes this electoral battle more significant is that these six districts account for 75 out of 119 assembly constituencies in the state, thereby reflecting the mood of educated voters and indicating a possible outcome of the state assembly elections scheduled in 2023. “The victory or defeat in these MLC elections doesn’t make much difference to the TRS in terms of numbers in the 40-member state legislative council, as it has huge majority with a strength of 36 members. But a defeat will indicate the voters’ perception against the ruling party which will have a bearing on its prospects in the coming elections,” said political analyst Suresh Dharur. The immediate impact of these elections is expected to be on the by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat likely to be held in April, besides elections to Khammam and Warangal municipal corporations, dates for which are yet to be decided. That is precisely why the TRS has taken the MLC elections to these two seats very prestigiously. The ruling party has already sensed the changing mood of the people with its defeat, albeit with a lesser margin, in the by-elections to Dubbak assembly seat in Medak district, followed by a serious drubbing in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections last year. The TRS has taken the elections to the two MLC seats very prestigiously and mobilised all its resources to win these two seats at any cost. For the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar graduates’ constituency, the TRS president has chosen Surabhi Vani Devi, daughter of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. It is a strategic move on the part of KCR since the state has been celebrating the birth centenary year of Narasimha Rao, the only Telangana leader to rise to the position of Prime Minister of the country. Naturally, the TRS wants to cash in on this Telangana sentiment. The TRS mobilised all its party machinery to campaign in support of Vani Devi. Right from party working president and KCR’s son K T Rama Rao, daughter K Kavitha and nephew T Harish Rao, the entire battalion of cabinet plunged into action, covering every section of graduates’ community. KCR himself personally held interaction with state government employees, who constitute large chunk of graduate voters and promised them a salary hike of 29%, as against 7% recommended by Pay Revision Commission. Since Vani Devi herself is an academician, the TRS made extensive campaign among the teaching community to attract their voters. “It is a master stroke of KCR to field her in the MLC elections, as being the daughter of the former Prime Minister, she commands tremendous goodwill among the educated voters,” Dharur said. On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party, which is on high spirits after its victory in Dubbak and an impressive show in the GHMC elections, is keen on repeating its performance in the MLC polls. It has once again fielded its sitting MLC N Ramachander Rao, who has huge support among the advocates, in Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar constituency. What makes the contest more interesting in this constituency is the entry of Osmania University professor K Nageshwar, who represented the seat twice in the past, as an independent. He is a prominent face among the educated voters. The Congress fielded former minister G Chinna Reddy and TDP its state president L Ramana, but both have very bleak chances. Besides, as many as 88 other independent candidates are also in the fray. In Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency, where 71 contestants are in fray, the fight is mainly between TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, the sitting MLC and Prof M Kodandaram of Telangana Jana Samithi. Kondandaram, once a protégé of KCR during the Telangana movement, fell apart from the latter and floated his own regional party before 2018 assembly elections. Though he has not achieved any success in the electoral battle till now, he commands tremendous respect among the educated Telangana youth. That makes his chances of wining the MLC seat brighter. BJP has fielded its general secretary G Premender Reddy, who has considerable cadre base in Warangal, but the party has little presence in Khammam and Nalgonda and that might prove disadvantageous to him. The Congress has fielded S Ramulu Naik, a tribal leader who was earlier a nominated MLC in Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-mlc-polls-today-acid-test-for-trs-101615660544535.html

On Mondays, there will be no test,” Gahlot said.The decision was taken after the transport department observed that many applicants wanted to give their test on Sundays, which is a holiday for most, Gahlot said. He said that an analysis of their records showed that the turnout on Mondays, a working day, was low in any case.The state transport department had asked all motor licensing officers to get update their softwares to user in the changes. Officers who worked on Sundays to conduct the driving tests will be off on Monday, the order issued on Saturday stated.A senior transport department official said that the Covid-19-induced lockdown resulted in many pending applications. At some busy RTO zones the waiting time was around two months, the official said.“Due to social distancing norms, which we cannot compromise, we have capped the number of daily driving tests being conducted in every RTO. We are also trying to make people aware about the Central government’s relaxations for any expired transport documents (no prosecution till March 31). So, there is no need to panic and rush to the RTO for renewal as of now,” said a second senior transport official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tests-for-driving-license-now-on-sundays-as-well-101615659343865.html

Delhi on Saturday added 419 new Covid cases, as per the daily state government bulletin.On Saturday, the agitating doctors staged protest at the hospital and demanded payment of pending salaries, inconveniencing hundreds of patients. Some patients chose to return home due to the strike.Resident doctors of Hindu Rao hospital and Rajan Babu TB Hospital have also extended their support and are likely to go on strike from Monday over non-payment of salaries.The 450-bed Kasturba Hospital is a maternity and child specialty hospital of the north corporation located near Jama Masjid, while Hindu Rao Hospital is the largest medical facility of the north civic body with 980-bed capacity.According to representatives of doctors association, the civic body had promised to streamline the issue but had failed to do so.Dr Sunil Kumar, president of the Kasturba Hospital Resident Doctors Association, said doctors have not been paid for last three months at all five hospitals of the north civic body.“Our salaries are pending since December and we are working without money. Non-payment of salaries has now become a routine affair in north civic body and this should be stopped. This is the end of financial year and we have to pay taxes, but we don’t have money as our salaries are pending. It is a situation of complete chaos and the authorities should make serious efforts to solve this crisis. We will not return to work until our salaries are paid,” Kumar said.Kumar also said that the strike impacted patient treatments as work at OPD was not conducted on Saturday and patients were referred to other nearby hospitals. “Some patients of gynaecology department in Kasturba Hospital were shifted to other hospitals as resident doctors are on strike,” he said.According to civic officials, the north corporation employs around 1,000 senior doctors, 500 resident doctors, and 1,500 nursing officers across its five hospitals — Kasturba Hospital, Hindu Rao, Rajan Babu TB hospital, Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital and Girdhar Lal hospital.This is not the first time when doctors had to go on strike on non-payment of salary issue. In June 2020, doctors of Kasturba Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital had threatened to tender mass resignations over the issue of pending salary of two months but had to take back their decision after the Supreme Court asked the north corporation to pay their dues. Later in October the same year, the doctors were on strike for over a fortnight to get their pending salaries. They called off the strike after being paid two months salary. Again in January they had threatened to go on strike, but were later paid for one month and decided to call it off.Abhimanyu Sardana, president Resident Doctors Association Hindu Rao Hospital, said that the salaries of December, January and February are pending. He said that a decision on when to go on strike will be taken on Monday after a meeting of representatives of the association.“We have several times written to the civic authorities to release our salaries on time but nothing happened. It is a shame that doctors who have a crucial role in the fight against Covid-19 have to resort to strike or mass resignation to get their rightful salary,” Sardana saidJai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “We are making arrangements to release two months salary of doctors as soon as possible. We have also had a meeting with the doctors of Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals and assured them to release salary soon. We have appealed them to call off the strike.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doctors-of-kasturba-hospital-go-on-indefinite-strike-to-demand-pending-wages-101615659163939.html

Ghaziabad police on Saturday registered a case against Yadav and Shivanand Saraswati, another caretaker who recorded the incident, and arrested both.The video purportedly showed Yadav kicking and punching the boy after he revealed his name and also his father’s name.The boy’s father, whose identity is being withheld as per law to protect the child, said the incident took place at around 5pm.“My son stopped to drink water from a tap located inside the temple as he was thirsty. He was beaten up after they asked his identity. He suffered a head injury. He generally doesn’t venture inside the temple but this time he told me he was just very thirsty. I have asked him not to go there in the future,” said the father who described himself as a daily wager and a scrap seller.The temple authorities said that they had barred entry of people from non-Hindu communities.“There are several taps outside the temple from where people drink water. Our caretakers caught the boy spitting inside the temple. They have been arrested and we will seek to legal recourse to get them bail,” said Yati Narsimhanand Saraswati, another caretaker of the temple.Taking suo motu (on its own) cognizance of the video, police registered an FIR under Indian Penal Code sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 352 (assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and also provisions of the Information Technology Act.“The prime suspect (Yadav) has been staying in the temple complex for the past three months. Both suspects made the video go viral,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Priyank Kanoongo, chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), tweeted the picture of the prime suspect on Saturday and said the NCPCR was committed to protecting the rights of the child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/muslim-boy-beaten-for-drinking-water-in-ghaziabad-temple-two-arrested-101615658803861.html
14-03-2021||Chandigarh||Panchayat polls deferment: Khattar’s budget speech remarks on PRI empowerment draw flak||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s budget speech assertion that his government is committed to ensure vibrancy of the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), the third tier of democracy, in both letter and spirit has drawn flak from the opposition in view of the delay in holding panchayat polls. The State Election Commission (SEC) which is responsible for holding the panchayat elections has deferred the polls citing the pandemic situation and protests by farmers against three farm laws. The term of the panchayats in the state ended on February 23. As per Article 243-E of the Constitution, an election to constitute a panchayat shall be completed before the expiry of its duration which is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. A division bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court had in a 1999 order observed that advocate general and SEC counsel had conceded that the September 30, 1999, order pertaining to preparation of electoral rolls for the panchayat and the municipal polls had been made in ignorance of the constitutional provisions contained in part IX and IX-A (Article 243) and the Panchayati Raj Act and Municipal Act and the order had in fact by implication, nullified a constitutional and statutory mandate. The bench was hearing a review application against September 1999 orders filed by six petitioners including two MLAs for impleading them as respondent and also saying that elections of panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishad in Haryana which were due to be held in December 1999 would be deferred if the voters lists were to be prepared afresh in compliance of the HC orders and that would result in non-compliance of the provisions of the Constitution to complete the panchayat elections before the expiry of their duration. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said the chief minister should stop taking false credit when his government is guilty of trampling the democracy. “The BJP-JJP government has brazenly violated the constitutional provisions by not holding the panchayat polls before February 23. The government is deliberately violating the constitutional mandate of holding the panchayat polls before the expiry of term of the panchayats,’’ the former minister said. Former leader of the opposition and INLD general secretary Abhay Chautala said the BJP-JJP government knows that they will be wiped out in panchayat elections. “The plea of pandemic and farmers’ agitation is a mere excuse to hide their low confidence. If this is the case, why were the municipal polls and Baroda assembly by-poll held? They don’t have the nerve of get polls conducted,’’ he said. Chautala said that on one hand the chief minister claims that he has empowered the panchayats and on the other his government has put a cap on the financial powers of the sarpanches. “Panchayats should get greater financial autonomy,’’ he said. Congress MLA from Dabwali Amit Sihag said If the government is so concerned about democracy, it should get the panchayat polls conducted. “The truth is that BJP and JJP leaders are scared of visiting the villages in view of stiff opposition by farmers. But yet they have the brazenness to claim credit. In fact, the authority from sarpanches was withdrawn much before February 23 by this government and handed over to block development officers. This is undemocratic,’’ the MLA said.What Khattar said about panchayats in his speech? “I believe that although the 73rd and 74th amendments in the Constitution ( pertaining to empowering PRIs and municipal bodies) were carried out in 1992, they have not been implemented in spirit by the successive governments. My government is committed to ensure vibrancy of the third tier of democracy in both letter and spirit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchayat-polls-deferment-khattar-s-budget-speech-remarks-on-pri-empowerment-draws-flak-101615654666391.html

Also, no person below the age of 13 years and above 75 years shall be permitted to undertake the pilgrimage.Appreciating the important services rendered by langar organisations, the board sought their continued support during the pilgrimage this year.The board is issuing silver coins of 5 gm and 10 gm denomination through the Metal and Mineral Trading Corporation (MMTC). These coins would be sold to the pilgrims at the holy cave and at the offices of the Shrine Board during the Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amarnath-yatra-to-commence-on-june-28-101615654365491.html

The NEET issue holds significance in the state as several students have died by suicide either because they failed to clear the exam or they feared they couldn’t realise their aspirations of studying medicine. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami attempted to circumvent this criticism by introducing a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for government students who clear NEET.The DMK is contesting the single-phase election in alliance with the Congress and the Left. Apart from these two, the DMK has also firmed up tie-ups with other parties including the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK). It is contesting on 173 of the 234 seats and has allotted the rest to its alliance partners.The election will be held in Tamil Nadu on April 6. This is the first assembly election after the demise of leaders J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi. The filing of nominations will start on Friday and the last day is March 19.In its manifesto, the DMK has also offered several sops to women who outnumber male electorate (31.8 million female voters and 30.8 million male voters) in the state. The party has also promised to increase the maternity leave period from nine to 12 months, and quota in government jobs from 30% to 40%. An assistance of ₹24,000 has also been announced for pregnant women, along with ₹100 subsidy towards LPG cylinder.State municipal administration minister SP Velumani, meanwhile, termed the manifesto “hollow” and “full of false promises”. The ‘Palaniswami wave’ is sweeping across Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK is sure to return to power, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmk-election-manifesto-promises-to-enact-law-to-reserve-75-jobs-for-tamils-101615652714304.html
14-03-2021||World||Merkel’s party slumps to historic low in German state elections||German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union crashed to its worst results in two regional elections since World War II, as voters vented their frustration over the government’s handling of the pandemic and the slow pace of vaccinations.With Merkel’s exit looming after September’s national election, support for the CDU slumped by four points to 23% in the western state of Baden-Wuerttemberg compared with the last election in 2016, an exit poll from public broadcaster ARD showed. The Greens, led by popular state premier Winfried Kretschmann, cemented their decade-long hold on power with a third straight victory, winning 31%, 0.7 points more than five years ago.In neighboring Rhineland-Palatinate, the CDU scored 26%, also finishing in second place but shedding 5.8 points compared with 2016. The Social Democrats, who rule the state in coalition with the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, lost ground but remained the strongest party on 34.5%, 1.7 points down on 2016.The two elections Sunday, held under strict hygiene and distancing rules, gave voters a first opportunity to express their discontent at the ballot box over missteps in Merkel’s pandemic strategy.The stuttering pace of the vaccine rollout, frustration with lockdown restrictions in place since late last year and a widening scandal over claims that some conservative lawmakers profited from the pandemic have all taken a toll.The CDU’s poor showing in Baden-Wuerttemberg -- the home of carmakers Porsche and Mercedes-Benz -- raises questions about whether the Greens will decide to continue with their current coalition or seek a different partner.The results are a major setback for new CDU leader Armin Laschet, who wants to run to replace Merkel after September’s general election but is hampered by his relative unpopularity. By contrast, his main rival for the conservative nomination, Bavaria Premier Markus Soeder, is one of the country’s most popular politicians.Soeder heads the smaller, Bavaria-based CSU party. While the CDU is the dominant partner and typically provides the bloc’s chancellor candidate, his bid could be bolstered by Laschet’s struggles.Whoever secures the nomination -- a decision is expected after Easter -- will have to deal with an erosion in support after voters initially responded positively to the government’s management of the coronavirus outbreak.The CDU/CSU’s reputation took another blow in recent days after three parliamentarians resigned because of allegations they made money from face-mask deals. Laschet -- who runs Germany’s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia -- has been drawn deeper into the scandal through his son Johannes, who facilitated a deal for local police.Laschet canceled the order for 1.25 million masks after a parliamentary investigation revealed there hadn’t been a tender. That could burden him as he tries to bolster his image as a potential leader of Europe’s biggest economy.Despite its challenges, the conservative bloc still has a clear lead in national polls and the next chancellor will likely come from within its ranks. They may opt to rule in a coalition with the Greens, who are currently the second-strongest party and whose victory in Baden-Wuerttemberg will further bolster their national standing. The Social Democrats are third and the far-right AfD fourth.The SPD has already chosen its chancellor candidate in Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, though his bid is a long shot with the party trailing in the polls.The current vice chancellor has already been campaigning hard, seeking to profit from the conservatives’ decision to delay their choice of Merkel’s potential successor and portray himself as the man with the experience needed to run the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkels-party-slumps-to-historic-low-in-german-state-elections-101615742508276.html

14-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Anthony Fauci hints at major change in US' 6-foot distancing rule||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci on Sunday hinted at a major change in the country’s key social distancing rule that has been at the centre of global flight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Speaking at CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ show, the 80-year-old immunologist said authorities were considering cutting the physical distancing requirement to three feet.The latest federal guidelines for schools providing in-person instruction call for the prioritisation of two mitigation strategies, including at least six feet of physical distancing. “To ensure physical distancing, schools should establish policies and implement structural interventions to promote physical distance of at least 6 feet between people,” the advised mitigation strategy reads. However, the rules in the US state of Massachusetts allow school desks spaced as little as three feet apart.Fauci said that experts at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were examining a Massachusetts study that found "no substantial difference" in Covid-19 cases in schools implementing six-foot and three-foot rules. When asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper whether the findings from the Massachusetts study meant three-foot separation was sufficient, Fauci replied, “It does, indeed.”The six-foot physical distancing rule has been widely adopted across the world to prevent the spread of Covid-19 but the requirement has caused problems for schools, especially those with limited infrastructure, to reopen. The minimum distance of three-foot for reopening of schools has been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).“Physical distance between desks should follow current public health guidance, and desks should be placed at least 3 feet apart and ideally 6 feet apart,” the AAP guidance reads.The study on the effectiveness of three versus six feet of physical distancing for controlling Covid-19 transmission among primary and secondary students surveyed 251 school districts and the findings were published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.The researchers found “no substantial difference” in Covid-19 cases among either students or staff between those observing the three- and six-foot rules, suggesting lower physical distancing policies can be adopted in school settings “with masking mandates without negatively impacting student or staff safety.”A change in social distancing rule could have a huge impact on prospects for fully reopening schools, offices and public areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-fauci-hints-at-major-change-in-us-6-foot-distancing-rule-101615739106334.html
14-03-2021||World||US inflation risk remains small, ‘manageable’, says Janet Yellen||Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said US inflation risks remain subdued as the Biden administration pumps $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief into the economy and a return to full employment comes into view.“Is there a risk of inflation? I think there’s a small risk and I think it’s manageable,” Yellen said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Some prices that fell last year when the Covid-19 pandemic spread through the US will recover, “but that’s a temporary movement in prices,” she said.“I don’t think it’s a significant risk,” said Yellen, a former Federal Reserve chair. “And if it materializes, we’ll certainly monitor for it but we have tools to address it.”Biden on Thursday signed into law the pandemic relief package, which provides funding for vaccinations and delivering aid to households, businesses and state and local governments.Yellen and other officials insist the aid -- which comes on top of pandemic relief passed by Congress last year -- is badly needed for an economy slammed by Covid-19, particularly low-income workers heavily represented in service industries, despite signs of recovery.While US unemployment remains high, especially when including people who have dropped out of the labor force in the past year, job creation has returned.Employers added 379,000 new positions in February, more than expected. Applications for US jobless benefits fell by more than forecast last week to the lowest since early November, the Labor Department reported Thursday.“I’m hopeful that, if we defeat the pandemic, that we can have the economy back near full employment next year,” Yellen said Sunday. “And I think this is the package we need to do that.”Bathtub Overflow?Republicans have objected to the stimulus package’s size, and even some liberal economists such as former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers have questioned whether its spending is excessive given that the broader economy has been remarkably resilient.“If you put too much water in the bathtub it starts to overflow,” Summers said Sunday on CNN about the scale of the stimulus. “We’re trying to pour too much water in.”While saying her views on fiscal sustainability have shifted in an era of persistently low interest rates, Yellen said “in the longer run, we have to get deficits under control.”Also on ABC, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that a planned package of infrastructure measures, the Biden administration’s next big project for the economy, will be “fiscally sound.”While suggesting revenue measures could include something similar to the Obama administration’s Build America bonds, she declined to confirm that tax increases will be required.“We’ll see,” Pelosi said. “We’ll look at everything. We’ll look at the tax code, we’ll look at the appropriations process, we’ll look at bonding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-inflation-risk-remains-small-manageable-says-janet-yellen-101615733870097.html
14-03-2021||World||'Upsetting': London police under fire after dragging mourners from vigil for murdered woman||London police faced a backlash from the public and politicians on Sunday for their heavy-handed tactics in breaking up an outdoor vigil for a woman whose suspected killer is a police officer.The disappearance of Sarah Everard, 33, as she walked home on the evening of March 3, has provoked a huge outpouring of grief and dismay in Britain at the failure of police and wider society to tackle violence against women.Police had denied permission for a vigil on Saturday evening at London's Clapham Common, near where Everard was last seen alive, citing regulations aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus.But hundreds of people, mostly women, gathered peacefully at the park in defiance of the ban to pay their respects to Everard throughout the day, including Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge.Late on Saturday dozens of police officers marched into the crowd to shouts of "shame on you". Scuffles broke out and officers dragged women away from the scene."Last night people were very, very upset, there was a great deal of emotion, completely understandably, and the police, being as they are operationally independent, will be having to explain that to the Home Secretary," safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins told Sky News.Home Secretary Priti Patel, the minister in charge of policing, described footage of the incident as "upsetting" and said she had asked police for a full report on what happened.An image of officers handcuffing a woman as she lay on the floor was widely shared and condemned on social media.The woman, Patsy Stevenson, told LBC radio: "The main point that everyone was trying to get across when everything happened is that women don't feel safe, they don't feel safe walking down a street and that's the bare minimum we should feel the freedom to do."She said she was fined 200 pounds for breaching Covid regulationsA steady flow of quiet mourners visited the site of the vigil on Sunday, placing flowers around a bandstand."I feel very angry that they think that they have the right to dictate how we mourn and how we react," 24-year old student Lilith Blackwell told Reuters at the bandstand.Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball defended the officers' actions and said they were faced with a very difficult decision."Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-19," she said.A police officer charged with Everard's murder and appeared in court on Saturday. Police discovered her body on Wednesday in woodland about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of London. The court heard that her body was found in a builder's refuse bag, and identified using dental records.Everard's murder has resonated with woman across the country, prompting thousands to share on social media their experiences of violence and sexual assaults perpetrated by men, and vividly describe the daily fear they feel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-police-under-fire-after-dragging-mourners-from-vigil-for-murdered-woman-101615732166169.html
14-03-2021||World||'I just don’t get it': Fauci on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among Republicans||Reluctance among certain parts of the population to receiving a vaccine is one of the biggest risks to coronavirus control efforts, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said.“I just don’t get it,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked about polling showing many Republicans, especially men, don’t want a vaccine.A PBS News Hour/NPR/Marist poll released Thursday showed that 41% of people who identify as Republicans, including 49% of GOP-leaning men, said they would not get one of the three federally approved coronavirus vaccines. Among Democratic-leaning men, only 6% said the same.“We’ve got to dissociate political persuasion from common sense, no-brainer public health things,” Fauci said.Fauci made three Sunday talk show appearances to mark a year since the Covid-19 outbreak was deemed a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Since then, some 120 million cases have been identified around the world and more than 2.6 million people have died, including over 534,000 in the US.Fauci also said he wished former President Donald Trump would come out and publicly urge his supporters to get the vaccine. “I wish he would,” Fauci said on “Fox News Sunday.” “It would really be a game changer if he did.”Five-Yard LineHe continued to warn against becoming complacent in the US even as cases and hospitalizations drop sharply and the pace of vaccinations accelerates.“If you’re going for a touchdown, don’t spike the ball on the five-yard line. Wait until you get into the end zone,” Fauci said on “Meet the Press.” “We’re not in the end zone yet.” New variants of the coronavirus are a particular risk, and have contributed to a fresh increase in cases in Europe, where fewer vaccines have been given so far.On Thursday, Biden pledged that all adult Americans will be able to sign up for Covid-19 shots by May 1, receive their vaccines by the end of May, and return to a semblance of normal life by the July 4 Independence Day, the holiday traditionally marked by festive public gatherings and backyard barbecues.That timeline, which Fauci said was “a couple of months” ahead of where he recently thought the US would be, reflected “a full-court press” to mobilize vaccination efforts, including in hard-to-reach communities.Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said Biden’s timeline could be too conservative and that the expedited vaccine rollout was “all about supply.”“We could do it today, all we need is vaccines from the federal government,” Hogan, a Republican, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “If the president and his team is able to deliver, we don’t have to wait until May 1. We could get moving even faster.”106 Million ShotsSome 21.4% of people in Maryland have received at least one vaccine dose and 12% have been fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker, in both cases slightly above the US average.Overall vaccinations against Covid-19 in the US have topped 106 million, with more than 2 million recently being administered each day on average. Supplies of the three approved shots in the US is projected to surge in coming weeks, with enough for every American before June.But a decision by a large swathe of the population to not receive a vaccine may slow or imperil the march toward herd immunity in the US.The US is on course to reach the lowest level of infections since the start of October, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. The average number of daily cases over the last week has fallen 15% compared with the previous week, continuing a decline that started in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-among-republicans-poses-risk-101615731675071.html
14-03-2021||World||UAE sheikh lays claim to oil cargo that US seized alleging Iran's||The US attempt to prevent Iran exporting oil suffered a blow after a United Arab Emirates sheikh laid claim to a cargo that Washington seized and alleged is from the Islamic Republic.A company controlled by the Emirate of Fujairah’s ruler told a US court that the roughly 2 million barrels of crude was originally from Iraq.Fujairah International Oil & Gas Corp., wholly owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi, said it’s an intermediary seller of the oil, according to a claim filed in a federal court in the District of Columbia.The case underscores the difficulty the US faces as it tries to bar Iran from generating income from energy sales and pressure it into re-starting nuclear talks.While shipments of Iranian oil have slumped due to threat of US penalties, they have picked in recent months, though their origin is often disguised. The main buyers are refiners in China.Washington alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the IRGC-Quds Force -- both classified as terrorist organizations by the US -- covertly shipped the oil abroad, relying on ship-to-ship transfers and falsified documents. Iran said the cargo belonged to the “private sector” and that its seizure was an “act of piracy.”“I’m sure that Iranian oil is continuing to flow,” said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at consulting firm FGE. “Forging documents like bills of lading and others needed for trades is not that big a problem.”US President Joe Biden has proposed that the two nations return to a 2015 international agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. His predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the US out of the accord in mid-2018 and tightened sanctions. Tehran says those must end before a new round of talks can begin.Tensions in the Middle East have also mounted recently due to a spate of attacks on ships and energy facilities. Saudi Arabia’s Ras Tanura oil-export terminal -- the world’s largest -- was attacked by drones and missiles earlier this month. Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran, claimed the assault. Several tankers were targeted with mines in the Red Sea last year, while an Israeli-owned cargo vessel was struck by an explosion in the Persian Gulf in late February.FIOGC said that in June it bought the crude from an undisclosed Iraqi supplier, which presented bills of lading from Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO as proof of origin. FIOGC then stored the oil on a ship at the port of Fujairah, a major energy-trading hub on the UAE’s Gulf of Oman coast.Calls placed to SOMO on Sunday weren’t answered, while FIOGC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.​In October, FIOGC sold the oil to an unidentified Chinese buyer. Under the agreement, FIOGC was responsible for delivering the crude and chartered the supertanker Achilleas for the journey to China.The U.S. government moved to seize the cargo late last year after the Achilleas’ Greek owner, Capital Ship Management Corp., alerted authorities to the possibility it had unknowingly taken on Iranian crude, after believing it came from Iraq.Houston DischargeThe Achilleas rerouted to the US and the crude was discharged in Houston this month. FIOGC claims it retains a financial stake in the cargo.The US Department of Justice filed a legal case in early February to allow it to seize the oil.FIOGC was established last year to trade petroleum products. The use of floating storage facilities was “particularly important in 2020” because the coronavirus pandemic hammered demand for oil and traders ran out of space at onshore tanks, according to FIOGC’s court filing.Sheikh Hamad is also a member of the UAE’s Supreme Council, the country’s executive arm. The UAE is one of the US’s closest allies in the region. It’s a federation of seven emirates including Fujairah, though Abu Dhabi is the capital and holds the most sway politically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-sheikh-lays-claim-to-oil-cargo-that-us-seized-alleging-irans-101615729009227.html

But for Bollywood actor Aamir Khan’s Chinese fans, Sunday, March 14 was the day to celebrate his 56th birthday with love and a large cake.A bunch of Khan’s fans from the Aamir Khan China Fan Club - or a+ as it is called - gathered at the Indian embassy on Sunday afternoon to cut a cake, sing birthday songs, watch clips from his popular movies and read out letters addressed to the actor from admirers across China.Several clips of earlier events related to Khan were shown including one on a young Chinese woman, Karen, who was invited to the actor’s home a few years ago.A Chinese remake of the Dhaakad music video from Dangal was screened during the two-hour event.The fan club a+ boasts of a million followers on its Chinese social media handles Weibo and Douyin. It organises events related to Khan and his movies in various cities.This year marked the first time that a+ held Khan’s birthday event at the Indian embassy.Khan’s Dangal and Secret Superstar were big hits in China - even as the Doklam standoff raged in 2017. Many of his followers also fondly remember hit flicks such as 3 Idiots and PK.In the letters that were read out at the event, fans wrote about how Khan’s movies had a positive impact on their lives.Yang Ajie, who calls herself the “leader” of the fan club, said Khan is like a “cultural bridge” between India and China. Yang said most of his movies “emotionally” connect with Chinese audiences.Citing the example of the theme of 3 Idiots, she said Chinese college students face similar problems such as tough competition in academics and competitive exams, which are not easy to crack.In Secret Superstar’s plot, a tender mother-daughter relationship found empathy among the Chinese, she said.“Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to call him a cultural bridge between China and India. At the same time, he has a huge fan base in China and also maintains good interactions with fans from all over the country,” the fan club said in a message ahead of the event.Though his Chinese fans will love it, it remains to be seen if Khan will visit China ahead of his next release Laal Singh Chaddha, a remake of the critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning Forrest Gump, later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/birthday-cake-lots-of-letters-and-love-for-aamir-khan-from-his-chinese-fans-101615729307462.html
14-03-2021||World||Ireland temporarily suspends Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine after new information on blood clotting||Ireland temporarily suspended AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine on Sunday following new information received from the Norwegian Medicines Agency regarding blood clotting in some recipients there, the country's health ministry said.Three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets, its health authorities said on Saturday.Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland have suspended the use of the vaccine over the issues, while Austria stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots last week while investigating a death from coagulation disorders.Ireland's National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended the temporary deferral of the administration of the vaccine "out of an abundance of caution", pending the receipt of more information from European regulators in the coming days."The decision to temporarily suspend use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine was based on new information from Norway that emerged late last night. This is a precautionary step," Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said on Twitter.AstraZeneca vaccinations make up 20% of the 590,000 shots administered among Ireland's 4.9 million population, mainly to healthcare workers after its use was not initially recommended for those over 70 and the firm supplied far fewer vaccines to the European Union than agreed.NIAC said that if it could be ascertained that the events were coincidental and not caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine, it would reassess the situation.Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had sought clarification from the British region's health minister about the temporary suspension of the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine elsewhere.Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is much further ahead in its programme and has inoculated more than 40% of the adult population, relying heavily on AstraZeneca's vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-temporarily-suspends-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-after-new-information-101615726638098.html
14-03-2021||World||US female firefighters fight discrimination with lawsuits||The highest ranking female firefighter in Asheville, North Carolina, says she was repeatedly discriminated against because of her sex and fought to keep her job while battling breast cancer. The first female chief of a municipal fire department in the state says she briefly pondered suicide after years of sexual harassment.Joy Ponder and Susanna Schmitt Williams are among numerous female fighters in the United States who have filed lawsuits against their employers alleging they were subjected to demeaning behavior that helped end their careers.Advocates say going to court is sometimes the only effective recourse in a field where women make up such a tiny part of the workforce. According to the National Fire Protection Association, 93,700, or 8%, of U.S. firefighters were female in 2018, the latest year for which data was available.Williams, who was fired in July 2019, told The Associated Press that she was “the subject of sexualized rumors (and) hostility in the form of insubordination by those who reported to me.”Williams said Carrboro Town Manager David Andrews overturned both her disciplinary and operational decisions, and for the latter, relied instead on the recommendations of men in the department who were lower ranked and had less experience and education. Andrews didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Ponder, who resigned from her post as Asheville Fire Department division chief in September, said she faced years of harassment and gender discrimination from Chief Scott Burnette after she led outside research on the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among city firefighters.Burnette did not return a phone call seeking comment. Peggy Rowe, an assistant to City Manager Debra Campbell, said the city doesn’t comment on ongoing lawsuits.Ponder filed her lawsuit in November and then an amended complaint last month. Williams filed her lawsuit in January. Both are still pending.Similar lawsuits have been filed — and won — by female firefighters in Illinois, Texas and Virginia.Court documents show a female firefighter in Country Club Hills, Illinois, won an $11 million verdict in 2018 after filing a lawsuit alleging that her colleagues openly watched pornography at the station house and broke down a shower door while she was bathing.The U.S. Department of Justice announced a $275,000 settlement with the City of Houston in October, after two female firefighters alleged their male co-workers urinated on the walls, floors and sinks, soiled their bathroom, and wrote race-based slurs on the walls of their work and living space at the fire station.The City of Norfolk, Virginia, last year agreed to an $87,000 settlement with a female firefighter who alleged a hostile work environment.Williams' lawsuit contends that a Charlotte, North Carolina-based law firm hired by the town of Carrboro to conduct a questionnaire of employees found up to 12 instances of harassment and discrimination against her that led to a hostile work environment. The law firm also found fault with Andrews, the town manager, for allowing fire department employees to go around Williams and take their complaints about the department to him, according to the suit.Williams said she filed two complaints of sexual discrimination against members of the fire department during her tenure as chief but neither was taken seriously. She says she became so distressed by the situation that one day after work she walked into her garage and considered taking her own life.“I thought ‘Oh, my God, I could crank up the car and just silently go and just be done with it all’ because I was that stressed and that depressed over everything that had happened,” Williams said.Instead, she thought of her sons and decided to see her fight through to the end. She received clearance from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to proceed with a lawsuit against Carrboro.Williams said she is the third female department head in Carrboro to file such a suit against Andrews, who recently announced that he would retire in July.Ponder, who became division chief in 2014, took a leave of absence in early 2019 to battle breast cancer. She said that when she returned at the end of the year, Burnette and the deputy chief “designed and executed an effective demotion and campaign to display me as a poor performer and divisive employee.”She was placed under her bosses' close supervision — “effectively surveillance,” she said — told to stay away from the firefighters under her command and moved to an isolated corner office from which she said she “was afraid to even walk to the restroom or copier.”“The continued harassment and abrupt disruption of my schedule and life that I had maintained successfully for many years led to a deterioration in my physical and mental health and I was forced to leave,” Ponder told the AP.Tina Guiler, a lieutenant for Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue and CEO of the national support group Fierce Female Firefighters, or Triple F, said she had two bad experiences as she advanced through the ranks, starting when a superior tried to get her to quit when she was still a rookie.“A lot of these women just don’t do the profession anymore" because of the harassment, Guiler said. “And their department isn’t professional enough to handle it and take care of it, so they end up leaving and having to file these lawsuits. ... The job’s hard enough without having to be harassed on top of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-female-firefighters-fight-discrimination-with-lawsuits-101615725723236.html
14-03-2021||World||With Andrew Cuomo under fire, second in line Kathy Hochul treads carefully||As a chorus of top Democrats demanded New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation over sexual harassment allegations last week, the woman who would succeed him if he stepped down did what she's done for most of her time in office: Kept a discreet profile.Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul delivered virtual remarks at an array of small events statewide. She sent tweets that hyped small businesses in the Adirondacks, reminded people to wear masks and urged them: “When it’s your turn, get vaccinated!” She herself got inoculated against the coronavirus Friday, drawing rare local TV coverage.If the Democrat's schedule hasn't changed lately, what may be different is the number of people tuning in to learn more about the politician who would become the state’s first female governor if Cuomo can't hold on to power.After two terms living deep in the shadow of a governor famous for demanding the spotlight, Hochul is an unknown quantity to most New Yorkers. Baruch College political science Professor Doug Muzzio said Hochul is probably preparing herself now in case she’s called on to step in.“The next stage of the game is if he resigns and Hochul becomes governor. What does that mean? Who is she? What does she think?" Muzzio said. “New Yorkers are totally, totally unaware of this woman. I mean, I spent half my life focusing on this stuff. And I don’t know that much.”Hochul briefly acknowledged the storm swirling around Cuomo on Tuesday in a statement expressing faith in an independent investigation into his workplace conduct, led by the state's attorney general.“I trust the inquiry to be completed as thoroughly and expeditiously as possible,” she wrote. “New Yorkers should be confident that through this process they will soon learn the facts.”Then she was back on message, tweeting out the latest vaccine eligibility criteria and plugging post-coronavirus pandemic revitalization efforts for overlooked upstate downtowns “oozing with charm & character.”“Kathy has the difficulty of being loyal to the governor, as she always has been unflinchingly, but also remaining steadfast in her leadership to ensure that there’s no sexual harassment anyplace, anywhere, anytime,” said former U.S. Rep. John LaFalce, whom Hochul has called a mentor after working as his legislative assistant in Washington for three years in the 1980s.“And to think, well, what would she do if all of a sudden she is governor, and then how do you begin to prepare for that?” said LaFalce, a Democrat who has remained close with Hochul and her husband, former U.S. Attorney Bill Hochul.The granddaughter of Irish immigrants and daughter of a steelworker, Hochul has leveraged an upbeat and approachable style to pull off challenging electoral wins over her career.Now 62, she was a town council member in Hamburg, New York, near Buffalo, for 14 years before becoming the Erie County Clerk in 2007.In 2011, she was the surprise winner in a special election for a vacant congressional seat in a conservative western New York district, one of only four in the state that had gone for Republican John McCain over President Barack Obama in 2008.In her unsuccessful run for reelection to Congress, Hochul was endorsed by the National Rifle Association and called herself a staunch advocate for sportsmen who would protect gun rights in Washington.Earlier as the Erie County Clerk, Hochul had strongly opposed a proposal to allow people to get driver's licenses without having to prove they are in the country legally.After Cuomo picked her as his choice for lieutenant governor, she moved to the left.She backed New York’s SAFE Act, one of the nation’s toughest gun-control laws, as well as the state's new Green Light Law, which has let unauthorized immigrants get driver's licenses.“Her willingness to shift politically does not suggest she would offer any kind of independent judgment,” the New York Times editorial board wrote in 2014 when it endorsed her primary opponent in the race for lieutenant governor, Columbia University law professor Timothy Wu.Hochul won that race, then won again in a close contest in 2018 against then-New York City Council member Jumaane Williams, now the city's public advocate.Republican Assembly member Angelo Morinello is among the many state lawmakers who want Cuomo to step aside, but he spoke favorably about Hochul and her ability to bring perspective from beyond politically dominant New York City.“Kathy is a very accomplished individual. For western New York, where she’s from and where I’m from, it would be a plus for us. She has experience and wherewithal and a staff that would be able to keep things going,” Morinello said.“I called her a Joe Biden Democrat," said Len Lenihan, the former Democratic chair in Hochul’s home base, Erie County. “She just takes joy in serving. She, in all of her races in western New York, appeals to the base Democratic voter, but also has the ability to go beyond that."“She's visited every every corner of the state, knows every town supervisor and village mayor,” Lenihan added. “She just has really leaned into this job and it’s a joy for her."Known as a tireless campaigner, Hochul delivered endorsements for dozens of candidates nationwide in the latest general election and just wrapped up a term as chair of the 24-member Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association, which offers help to candidates hoping to join their ranks.“She’s campaigning every minute of the day,” LaFalce said. “Nobody campaigns as tenaciously as Kathy does. Tenacious is the best word I can think of to describe her. When she sinks her teeth into something, whether it’s a campaign or an issue, she’s dogged.”But, said LaFalce, “The most important thing in politics is likability. And everybody loves Kathy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-andrew-cuomo-under-fire-second-in-line-kathy-hochul-treads-carefully-101615724691306.html
14-03-2021||World||Call me? US-Turkey reset faces long list of hurdles||Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has toned down his anti-Western and anti-US rhetoric in an apparent effort to reset the rocky relationship with his NATO allies, but so far he's been met by silence from U.S. President Joe Biden.Nearly two months into his presidency, Biden still hasn’t called Erdogan, which some in Turkey see as a worrying sign. By contrast, former President Donald Trump and Erdogan spoke just days after the 2016 election.Ties between Ankara and Washington — which once considered each other as strategic partners — have steadily deteriorated in recent years over differences on Syria, Turkey’s cooperation with Russia and more recently on Turkish naval interventions in the eastern Mediterranean, which U.S. officials have described as destabilizing.Despite tensions, many within Erdogan’s government were hoping for four more years of the administration led by Trump, who had a personal rapport with Erdogan and didn’t give him any lectures about Turkey’s human rights record.Biden drew ire from Turkish officials after an interview with the New York Times in which he spoke about supporting Turkey’s opposition against “autocrat” Erdogan.In public statements, Turkish officials have played down the lack of a phone call from the White House, noting that conversations are happening at other levels, but a senior Turkish government official told The Associated Press that Erdogan’s office “is not thrilled” about it. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said last week that there were many world leaders Biden still hadn’t talked to and that she was sure he would call Erdogan “at some point.”Left with few friends due to a spate of assertive foreign policy, anti-Western rhetoric and increasing authoritarianism, Turkey is now looking to attract foreign investments to rescue its troubled economy. Erdogan has been reaching out to the U.S., European nations and other former allies in a bid to patch troubled relations and end its international isolation.Biden, who has spoken about restoring international alliances and traditional ties as well as strengthening NATO, would have an interest in rebuilding ties and trying to pull Turkey away from Russia’s sphere of influence.But analysts say it's going to be very difficult to reset the relationship, given the range of issues where the two countries don't see eye to eye, including Turkey’s decision to acquire the advanced Russian S-400 anti-aircraft system, which Washington says poses a threat to NATO and to the U.S. F-35 fighter aircraft program. Washington kicked Turkey out of the F-35 production program and last year imposed sanctions on senior Turkish defense industry officials as well as bans on military export licenses.Turkey argues that the Russian system, which cost the country $2.5 billion, is not a threat to the NATO alliance and it has repeatedly called for dialogue to resolve the issue. Washington insists the sanctions cannot be lifted as long as the Russian system remains on Turkish soil.During a Senate hearing before his confirmation as U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken described Turkey as a “so-called strategic partner” and called it “unacceptable” for Turkey to be “in line with one of our biggest strategic competitors in Russia.”Merve Tahiroglu of the Washington-based Project on Middle East Democracy, said it would be difficult for Erdogan to backtrack on the S-400 “because he made such a big deal about the purchase and what this would mean for Turkey’s geopolitical independence.”American military support for Syrian Kurdish fighters to combat the Islamic State group is another point of contention. Turkey argues they are inextricably linked to a decades-long Kurdish insurgency and Defense Minister Hulusi Akar has said that ties cannot improve unless Washington halts its cooperation with the Syrian Kurdish group.In 2019, Biden accused Trump of betraying U.S. allies, following the latter's decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, which paved the way for a Turkish military offensive against the Syrian Kurdish group.The Biden administration is likely to put pressure on Turkey on its energy dispute with Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, which led to a tense standoff between two NATO members. Turkey has since halted its search for energy reserves in disputed waters while Erdogan has toned down his fiery rhetoric.Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute’s Center for Turkish Studies, said Turkey cannot give concessions in the eastern Mediterranean "because it is considered a national cause by a wide segment of Turkish society.”The Biden administration is expected to place more emphasis on democracy and human rights than Trump did. During a telephone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Blinken underlined the “importance of democratic institutions, inclusive governance and respect for human rights” for Turkey, according to a U.S. readout of the conversation.Last week, Erdogan pledged a series of reforms to improve human rights but analysts said they were unlikely to make a huge impact or lead to the release from prison of high-profile figures such as activist Osman Kavala, who is accused of ties to anti-government protests in 2013 as well as a 2016 failed coup attempt.“For a true reset to happen, the Biden administration needs to see more of a democratization process ... that can come in the form of major judicial reforms or by the release of some of the most contentious political figures,” Tahiroglu said.Turkey is also seeking the extradition of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup in 2016.

About 750 close contacts of people infected have been sent to quarantine, the Health Department said at a press conference on Sunday.Among the quarantined is playgroup of eight 11- to 18-month-old babies and their caregivers, according to parents. The measure was taken after the children attended a music playgroup last week, and a parent was later confirmed positive in connection to the gym cluster.The city reported 24 new cases on Sunday, 10 of which are linked to the gym outbreak. Authorities ordered compulsory testing at 90 residential locations and 60 work sites, and closed seven schools, as a result of the spread, the department said.Kylie Davies-Worley, a mother in quarantine with her 15-month-old son and husband, said that while conditions may be bearable for adults, “it’s just really not equipped for children.”“The menu is definitely not baby appropriate -- no designated baby food at all,” said Davies-Worley. “He literally will be living on snacks for the next 10 days.”Hospital Authority Chief Manager Dr Linda Yu said at the press conference that she needs more information on the quarantined infants before she can comment.“The disease has an incubation period of 14 days. We need to observe for at least one more week to know if the gym cluster is under control,” the Health Department’s Dr Albert Au said at the press conference. “There are also secondary transmissions at schools and workplaces, we will closely monitor.”Hong Kong Orders Tests for Class of Students, Quarantines SomeLater Sunday, two residential areas in the Central and Western neighborhoods were locked down to enforce Covid testing, including buildings on Pok Fu Lam Road and the residential property Dynasty Court at the Mid-Levels. The actions followed a lockdown on Saturday night of four buildings in the Mid-Levels, which ended early Sunday with no confirmed Covid-19 cases found.The government also said at the Sunday conference that some students and staffs at the Harbour School will be sent to government quarantine facilities after two confirmed cases and one preliminary case were found among school members.The government’s latest moves marked an escalation of a days-old campaign that’s already resulted in hundreds of people being sent to quarantine camps, dozens of offices ordered to conduct mandatory employee testing and several of Hong Kong’s most expensive schools halting in-person classes. While the city’s had bigger flareups, no outbreak has hit so close to home for many of the city’s expats since the pandemic began.Offices housing UBS Group AG, Chanel Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc are included on the list of buildings where people are subject to compulsory testing orders.Several banks advised staff last week to not come into offices. HSBC Holdings Plc vacated a floor of its main building Thursday after an employee tested preliminary positive, according to a memo to staff. UBS told some staff to work from home after an employee tested positive, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reverted to a policy of 50% of staff working from home.​The outbreak also affected legal firms, with Allen & Overy and Herbert Smith Freehills both closing their offices after employees tested positive. Clifford Chance asked staff to work remotely out of an “abundance of caution.”Hong Kong, which has one of the strictest quarantine regimes in the world, requires all who have had close contact with infected persons to enter mandatory isolation for a period up to two weeks.How One Gym Shook Hong Kong’s Finance Sector: Anjani TrivediSophia Chan, Secretary for Food and Health, said in her blog on Sunday that the government is considering further expanding the vaccine priority groups to satisfy demand. Hong Kong began its public vaccination campaign at the end of February, prioritizing people aged 60 and older, health-care staff and other essential workers. Last week, it expanded its priority groups to cover 3.7 million people, about half the population, adding those in high-risk contact positions like teachers, public transportation drivers and restaurant workers.Covid vaccination rates in Hong Kong have slowed amid concern over side effects from Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s shot, with reports of at least six deaths among the close to 150,000 people inoculated. None of the deaths have been linked to the Chinese company’s vaccine, but they’ve added to hesitancy about getting inoculated. The no-show rate for people who made appointments to get Sinovac immunizations rose to as high as 30%.“Although experts have pointed out some serious adverse events recently are not linked to the vaccines, I understand some residents are worried,” said Chan. “If you have doubts on your health conditions, you can consult with doctors before receiving the vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/infants-among-hundreds-in-hong-kong-quarantine-amid-covid-19-outbreak-101615725823083.html

14-03-2021||World||Daylight saving time: US clocks to 'spring forward' by an hour from Sunday morning||From March 14, the clock will 'spring forward' by an hour to 2am in the United States, according to the practice of daylight saving which generally begins on the second Sunday of March (after the Energy Policy Act of 2005 implemented in 2007) with the clock springing forward by an hour that continues till the first Sunday of November.However, the daylight saving time in the US commences at 2am and begins from the last Sunday of April of each year to the last Sunday of October of each year, as per the Uniform Time Act 1966. "During the period commencing at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of April of each year and ending at 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of October of each year," the act reads.Britain, France and Germany change their clocks on the last Sunday of March that continues till the last Sunday of October.No time change is observed in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas.Also Read | BJP announces names for 125 seats in Kerala; Sreedharan to contest from PalakkadDaylight saving time is practised in over 70 countries, as per dateandtime.com, and affects more than one billion people. The idea of implementing the clock change is to extend an hour of sunlight from early morning to the evening to increase productivity by making more use of the daylight.Benjamin Franklin is considered to be the father of the concept as he suggested to the editor of the Journal of Paris to economise the use of candles by waking people up at sunrise.There have been arguments that propose and oppose the concept of daylight saving. There are studies that show the implementation of clock change helps in saving energy cost. The New York Times cited a 2008 report of the Department of Energy that said the daylight time extension helps in saving 0.5 per cent of electricity per day.However, there have also been studies that show springing ahead increases the residential energy demand and pollution. The European Union and other US states like California and Florida are proposing to end the daylight shift. They argued that countries like India, China and Russia do not change their clocks. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine also demanded the abolition of the clock change as it said disrupts the body clock and affects the mental and physical that can lead to increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular incidents caused by the disturbed sleep pattern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daylight-saving-time-us-clocks-to-spring-forward-by-an-hour-from-sunday-morning-101615714172324.html
14-03-2021||World||Democrats bank on relief aid to win back wary working class||When Joe Biden visited this corner of southwestern Pennsylvania in the final weeks before the election, his goal wasn't to win it so much as to show the area's overwhelmingly white working-class electorate that his party was at least willing to try.“A lot of white, working-class Democrats thought we forgot them,” Biden said after touring a union training facility during a late September swing through Westmoreland County. "I get their sense of being left behind.”Democrats have offered paeans like that since President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered the New Deal and cemented an alliance with working-class voters. That bond was rooted in the notion that the Democrats' policies would improves workers' lives.But that relationship has steadily frayed, with working-class voters now casting Democrats as the party of cultural elites who talk down to them and reject their values. Such resentment has even driven workers to vote against their economic self-interest.Now Biden and his party are hoping that by muscling through passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief and economic stimulus bill — with benefits heavily weighted toward lower- and middle-income Americans — they can win back at least a larger share of working-class voters.The president is flying Tuesday to Delaware County, outside Philadelphia, to help promote the new aid.Still, that proposition — which Republicans dismiss as a “liberal wish list” — will be tested in places such as Westmoreland County. More than 250 miles west, the county was a Democratic stronghold until its industrial base withered.“These are the kind of issues that are a little bit more meat-and-potatoes and that we should focus on in this area,” said Paul Adams, a former county Democratic official.“Despite the fact that our sympathies may be with other issues,” Adams said, referring to larger efforts to tackle racism and promote gay rights, “it’s hard to get traction with that with the local population.”Democrats are banking on direct payments of $1,400 to most Americans under the COVID-19 law as a strong counter to that criticism. The package also dramatically expands tax credits for families with children, bolsters unemployment benefits, reduces taxes on student loan debt and lowers costs of the Obama-era health law's coverage.Ed Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said the legislation won't singlehandedly solve the party's problems with working-class voters but is “a good first mile down the road.”“It is incumbent upon us to make the case — which I believe has always been there to make, we've just done a (terrible) job — that we’re the party of the working guy," Rendell said. "And the Republicans are using smoke and mirrors.”By some estimates, the law could reduce the nation's poverty rate by one-third. That may have an outsize impact on Westmoreland County, whose under-65 population receives more federal disability benefits than the national average and where less than one-third of residents have a college degree, according to federal estimates.The town of Jeannette used to boast of being the “Glass Capital of the World,” but nearly all of those factories are long gone. A nearby Volkswagen plant shuttered in 1988, wiping out 2,500 jobs.But the strong economic incentives in the relief bill are colliding with the structural support here for former President Donald Trump. Trump 2020 yard signs and flags — often carefully preserved against winter snows — still line the hilly roadsides beyond the hulking husks of the abandoned bottle works. The Democratic county sheriff became a Republican last summer, saying his old party wasn't supporting law enforcement strongly enough during demonstrations that swept the country over police brutality and racism.Like Biden, Trump campaigned in Westmoreland County, and he won the county by nearly 30 percentage points. But Biden got about 11,000 more votes here than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. That's significant given that Biden won Pennsylvania by only about 80,500 votes.Bill Bretz, chairman of the county’s Republican Party, said the new direct economic benefits are canceled out by other Biden administration policies. That includes nixing the Keystone XL pipeline, which has raised fears that Pennsylvania's natural gas producers could face similar limits in the name of battling climate change.“There’s a lot of people who are still registered Democrats, who still hold on to those working-class Democratic values," Bretz said. "But their sensitivities are violated by the national Democratic platform.”Indeed, people like Mary Wilmes, who owns a gift shop in the county seat of Greensburg, doesn't like to rile customers with talk of politics. But she did offer praise for Biden and his work promoting the stimulus. “He's giving you the sense that he cares about people,” she said.“It's not like before," Wilmes added, “when what we had was, ‘It’s all about himself.'”The white working-class helped fuel Trump's 2016 rise, but those voters have actually been gravitating to Republicans since 1992, according to research by Noam Lupu, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. Working-class African Americans have remained steadfastly loyal to Democrats, but Trump saw his support among Latinos improve in 2020. That could indicate that a broader shift away from Democrats may be resonating with some Hispanics.“I think, for the Democratic Party, it’s a tough coalition to maintain: working-class voters who are really focused on their economic interests, but, at the same time, very progressive social positions for the urban, educated voters,” Lupu said. “I think Biden has an opportunity to rebrand the party a little bit."Working-class generally denotes people without college degrees who have lower wage jobs. It also can mean better educated, better paid middle-class earners who don’t like defining themselves as rich or poor. Trump won 62% of white voters without a college degree in November, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of the electorate.During the campaign, Biden tried to contrast what he called the working family sensitivities of his birth city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Trump’s Fifth Avenue, big city values. Biden also has pledged to be “ the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.”“A number of working-class people have seen politics not deliver for their families, and sometimes that’s when Democrats are in charge and sometimes that’s when Republicans are in charge,” said Rick Levy, president of the Texas AFL-CIO. "It creates an opening for demagogues who say, ‘I can fix it.'”Some top Republicans have begun arguing that theirs is actually the party of the working-class — mixing economic appeal with key social issues such as promoting gun rights and opposing abortion, along with emphasizing opposition to the cancellation of some Dr. Seuss books and dropping “Mr.” from Potato Head so the toy better promotes gender inclusivity.“We are a working-class party now," Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted on election night. Hawley also offered legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15, long a position of progressive Democrats.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently declared the GOP the “party of steel workers and construction workers and taxi drivers and cops and firefighters and waitresses.” He has proposed a $10,000 scholarship helping parents who live in areas where schools remain shuttered because of the virus to pay for education elsewhere.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., endorsed a union organizing drive at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama, accusing the online giant's leadership of waging a "culture war against working-class values.”Levy said Democrats can now point to concrete provisions of the relief law, which he said also shows that the GOP is "never going to support working-class people.”But some say the stimulus package may prove hollow over the long term."It’s a good thing now,” Lucas Szekely, a 19-year-old community college student from Irwin, west of Jeannette, said of getting another stimulus check. “But you can’t keep doing it forever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-bank-on-relief-aid-to-win-back-wary-working-class-101615724510171.html
14-03-2021||World||British-Iranian woman Zaghari-Ratcliffe back in court after 5 years in prison||A trial to present fresh charges against a British-Iranian woman detained for five years in Iran convened Sunday, her supporters said, casting uncertainty over her future following her release from prison.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe appeared in court in Tehran to face new charges of spreading “propaganda against Iran,” wrote Tulip Siddiq, a member of the British Parliament who represents her area of London and campaigned for her release. A verdict was expected next week, Siddiq added. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The new trial came a week after Zaghari-Ratcliffe completed her prison sentence on widely refuted spying charges. Although she was allowed to remove her ankle monitor and leave house arrest when her sentence formally ended, she remains unable to fly home to her family in London.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting the overthrow of Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups vigorously deny. While employed at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency, she was taken into custody at the airport as she was returning home to Britain after visiting family in the capital of Tehran in 2016.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s yearslong case has sparked international outrage and strained ties between Britain and Iran. Her supporters have described her as collateral in a long-running dispute over a debt of some 400 million pounds ($530 million) owed to Iran by London, a payment the late Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi made for Chieftain tanks that were never delivered. The shah abandoned the throne in 1979 and the Islamic Revolution installed the clerically overseen system that endures today.Rights groups accuse Iran of using dual-national detainees as bargaining chips for money or influence in negotiations with the West, something Tehran denies.Authorities released Zaghari-Ratcliffe from prison on furlough last March because of the surging coronavirus pandemic, and she was detained in her parents' home in Tehran. Last fall, Iranian state TV abruptly announced the new indictment against Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but her trial was adjourned until this week.Authorities in London and Tehran deny that Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case is linked to the repayment deal for the non-delivery of tanks. But a prisoner exchange that freed four American citizens in 2016 saw the U.S. pay a similar sum to Iran the same day of their release.In a call last week with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he stressed that Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s “continued confinement remains completely unacceptable.” Iran’s readout of the same telephone call made no mention of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case, instead claiming that Johnson had emphasized to Rouhani “the need to repay the country’s debts to Iran."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britishiranian-woman-zaghari-ratcliffe-back-in-court-after-5-years-in-prison-101615708259714.html

There are some harrowing stories to tell,” the newspaper quoted a royal source as saying.The complaint against Meghan dates back to October 2018 when an email was sent by a member of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's staff to a senior courtier. The email was forwarded to the HR department, but the complaint did not progress.The palace inquiry into the exact circumstances was announced days before Harry and Meghan’s explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey was aired last weekend, in which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a series of shocking claims around the lack of mental health support offered to a suicidal Meghan and unnamed royals raising concerns about the skin colour of their mixed-race son Archie."The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members," read a Buckingham Palace statement, days after the interview.Prince William, Harry's older brother, is the only senior royal to directly comment on the allegations as he responded to reporters' questions with: “We are very much not a racist family.”The relationship between the brothers has been strained for some time and it emerged this weekend that they had “been in contact” for the first time since the Oprah Winfrey interview, reportedly via text message.Meanwhile, their father Prince Charles is said to be "upset and cut up" after Harry had spoken of his hurt at the Prince of Wales not taking his calls after he announced his decision to step back as a frontline royal last year and cut him off financially.“It was a surprise to hear he'd been cut off, given the bank statements. The prince continued to provide Harry and Meghan with financial support after their move to America, while they found their feet,” a source close to Charles told ‘The Sunday Times’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buckingham-palace-to-get-law-firm-to-conduct-meghan-markle-bullying-probe-report-101615722392372.html

Many Omanis shared screenshots of the app showing "error message"."The government of Oman takes the authoritarian government of China as a role model and bans ... Clubhouse which has been used by Omanis as a space to express their opinions freely without government censorship," the Omani Association For Human Rights said in a statement.Access to Clubhouse was blocked in China last month.Launched in early 2020, the San Francisco-based app saw global user numbers soar after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev held a surprise discussion on the platform.The app has been popular in Arab countries where media is directly controlled by governments and commentators run the risk of being imprisoned for critical opinions.Clubhouse has faced criticism elsewhere over reports of misogyny, anti-Semitism and Covid-19 misinformation on the platform despite rules against racism, hate speech, abuse and false information.The app has said it is investing in tools to detect and prevent abuse as well as features for users, who can set rules for their rooms, to moderate conversations."I hope that the suspension of the Clubhouse app in Oman is a result of technical issues and not a formal ban," tweeted Omani writer Zakaria al-Muharrmi."Preventing people from speaking and listening to others does not protect societies, but rather increases tensions and pushes them into the abyss of chaos and confrontation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oman-blocks-audio-app-clubhouse-citing-lack-of-permit-some-fear-censorship-101615719691942.html

He uses one name.There was no immediate comment from state or federal government officials. The village is in Mizoram state.Ramliana did not give details as to when the people crossed over from Myanmar. Local media reports said that several of them were from Myanmar police and fire services.Last week, India’s Home Ministry told four Indian states bordering Myanmar — Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh — to take measures to prevent refugees from entering India except on humanitarian grounds.The ministry said the states were not authorized to accord refugee status to anyone entering India from Myanmar, as India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention of 1951 or its 1967 Protocol.Indian police have detained at least seven Myanmar police officers. They told Indian authorities they ran away because Myanmar's army was on their trail after they refused to obey orders.Indian police did not explain what orders the officers had refused. They wore civilian clothes and were not armed.Earlier this month, Myanmar asked India to return the police officers who crossed the border.India shares a 1,643-kilometer (1,020-mile) border with Myanmar, and is home to thousands of refugees from Myanmar in different states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-people-fleeing-myanmar-enter-indian-village-101615719231977.html
14-03-2021||World||German voters could punish CDU in regional elections over handling of Covid-19||German voters looked set to punish the ruling Christian Democrats in two regional elections on Sunday for a long coronavirus lockdown and face mask procurement scandal, denting their prospects of retaining power later this year.Chancellor Angela Merkel, in power since 2005, is not seeking re-election in September and her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is already missing the "Merkel bonus" she has brought them with four consecutive national election victories.The CDU went into Sunday's polling in the southwestern auto hub of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the neighbouring wine-growing region of Rhineland-Palatinate with its poll numbers sliding, exacerbated by the face mask corruption scandal.Support for the CDU at the national level slid to 31% this week, its lowest for almost a year, according to an opinion poll conducted by Kantar for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, although the next strongest party, the Greens, was stuck on 19%.While Merkel's government won plaudits last year for initially getting the coronavirus under control, it has faced mounting criticism due to the slow pace of vaccinations and a long lockdown as a third wave of infections now gathers pace.About a thousand opponents of the lockdown protested outside the health ministry in Berlin on Saturday while dozens of cars drove in convoy through the city to demand a lifting of restrictions, plastered with slogans like "Fear is contagious".Also read: German state polls open with tough test for Chancellor Angela Merkel's partyIn the once-safe CDU region of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the party risks being replaced as junior coalition partner to the Greens by the Social Democrats (SPD) and liberal Free Democrats.In Rhineland-Palatinate, where such a "traffic light" coalition of party colours already governs, the CDU was leading in opinion polls as recently as late February but has now slipped behind the left-leaning SPD.CDU leaders fear that if a traffic light alliance ousts them from government in Baden-Wuerttemberg, then such a tie-up could gain credibility at September's federal vote - and could leave the party in opposition at national level.Its image has been tarnished by the face mask scandal, which has seen conservative lawmakers quit over allegations they received payments for arranging procurement deals.Sunday's elections will also have ramifications within the conservative bloc of the CDU and its Bavaria sister party, which together run the federal government in coalition with the SPD.While new CDU leader Armin Laschet is in pole position to succeed Merkel, defeat in Baden-Wuerttemberg could help his Bavarian rival Markus Soeder in his bid to become the conservative candidate for chancellor in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-voters-could-punish-cdu-in-regional-elections-over-handling-of-covid19-101615716127862.html
14-03-2021||World||Pakistan: Hindu community pardons mob accused of vandalising temple||The Hindu community in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has decided to pardon the mob that vandalised and burned down a century-old temple in the province.The local clerics and members of the Hindu community held a meeting on Saturday to resolve the dispute.As per the dialogue, informally called 'jigra', the accused have tendered an apology over the attack and a similar incident in 1997. The Muslim clerics have assured full protection to the Hindus and their rights as per the country's Constitution.A reconciliation statement from the meeting would be presented to the Supreme Court, in a bid to secure the release of the accused from detention.On December 30 last year, a mob led by some local clerics and members of radical Islamist party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam vandalised the temple and an adjoining 'samadhi' and set it on fire in Terri village of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district.Speaking to the media after the meeting with the local Ulema, Pakistan Hindu Council Chairman Ramesh Kumar said the incident had hurt the feelings of Hindus across the world.Kumar, who is also a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmaker, said KPK Chief Minister Mahmood Khan had chaired the 'jirga' proceedings and thanked him for settling the matter amicably.Mahmood Khan, in his address to jirga members, had condemned the attack strongly, calling it an attempt to pollute the peaceful environment in the province.The attack on the temple had drawn strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders, prompting the Supreme Court to order its reconstruction.Nearly 50 people have been arrested in the case.Following the incident, India had lodged a strong protest with Pakistan. The Ministry of External Affairs had conveyed its serious concerns to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi over the repeated instances of similar incidents and atrocities against the members of the minority community.India had also called out the Pakistan government at the United Nations, saying the country's enforcement agencies stood as "mute spectators" when a historic Hindu temple was attacked.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.The controversy over the samadhi erupted many decades ago.According to the details submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014, in a case about it, the Hindus had been visiting the shrine till 1997 when it was dismantled by the locals.The apex court in 2014 ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to restore and reconstruct the Hindu shrine.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents.

Takaosan.The fire-walking was more tense than usual because participants were required to wear masks and maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic. The festival was also limited to 1,000 participants. Last year, it wasn't open to the public because of the Covid-19 pandemic."Passing your body through the flames cleanses your soul and delivers your prayers to Buddha," said Koshou Kamimura, a Buddhist monk from Takaosan Yakuouin Temple."Historically, Mt. Takaosan is an important place to pray for deliverance from plagues, so I felt we should hold the festival this year with certain precautions."The festival, called hiwatari matsuri in Japanese, has a history of about 50 years at Mt. Takaosan.The monks set fire to wood and Japanese cypress leaves, creating an intense bonfire. The monks then doused the flames with water, collected the embers and laid them out in two strips, over which they walked barefoot while chanting.Worshippers followed the monks, wearing masks due to the coronavirus. Some monks carried small children over the embers as dark smoke billowed into the air.Tokyo is preparing to host the Summer Olympics this year, delayed from 2020 because of the coronavirus, with domestic opinion polls showing people favour limiting the number of spectators at the games."Coronavirus infections are spreading globally, so I prayed that it doesn't spread any further," said Eriko Nakamura, 46, as Buddhist monks chanted in the background."The fire-walking event is held outside and there are restrictions on the number of participants. When it comes to the Olympics, it will be held indoors, so I hope they can limit the number of spectators by half."The number of coronavirus cases in Japan is relatively low compared to other countries such as the United States, although some areas including Tokyo are still under a state of emergency, with the country experiencing a third wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-worshippers-brave-smouldering-coals-to-pray-for-safety-101615717955016.html

It’s also possible that there will be no changes.The UK has a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and is increasingly looking to renewables for a greater share of energy.Oil output from the North Sea has dropped since the turn of the century as fields have got older. Still, the region is crucial for Scotland’s tax revenue and creating jobs. Some production from the area also make up the global Brent benchmark pricing.About 39% of the 270,000 jobs in the UK that the oil industry supports are in Scotland, according to the Telegraph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-lawmakers-mull-ban-on-new-north-sea-exploration-report-101615717965135.html
14-03-2021||World||Israeli PM avoided Saudi airspace because of Houthi missiles||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was deterred from flying to the United Arab Emirates through Saudi Arabian airspace last week because of the threat of missile fire from Iranian proxies in Yemen.Netanyahu, whose comments came Saturday, had called off a visit to the Emirates last week over a spat with neighboring Jordan, which had temporarily closed its airspace to the Israeli prime minister's flight.But rather than bypass Jordanian airspace and take a more southerly route across Saudi skies, Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 13 “there were also problems a week ago in the skies of Saudi Arabia,” referring to recent missile attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels.Netanyahu did not elaborate, nor did he say his plane was targeted by the Iran-backed Houthis.Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who control the capital and much of the country’s north, have escalated their cross-border attacks on critical Saudi infrastructure in recent weeks, crashing bomb-laden drones and missiles into the kingdom’s Patriot missile batteries and revealing gaps in the country’s defenses.Last week, missiles and drones hit one of the world’s largest oil shipping ports and halted air traffic toward the international airport in the port city of Jiddah. While Houthi-claimed attacks on Saudi Arabia rarely cause substantial damage, such strikes have roiled the world economy and raise the risk of a disruption in global oil supplies.Netanyahu was slated to make the first official visit by an Israeli leader to the United Arab Emirates, half a year after the countries established formal relations. He had hoped to use the audience with the UAE’s crown prince to boost his reelection campaign less than two weeks before Israel's March 23 parliamentary elections.The Prime Minister’s Office said it had difficulties coordinating the flight over Jordanian airspace after Jordan’s crown prince canceled a visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a sensitive holy site under Jordanian custodianship, due to disagreements over security arrangements.The prime minister insisted that relations between the two countries were positive, adding that “Jordan needs good relations with us no less than we need good relations with Jordan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-avoided-saudi-airspace-because-of-houthi-missiles-101615716823492.html
14-03-2021||World||Two more shot dead during anti-coup protests in Myanmar||At least two people were shot dead during protests in Myanmar's largest city on Sunday, as security forces continued their violent crackdown against dissent following last month's military coup.One of the victims was shot in the head and the other was shot in the abdomen, according to local media covering the demonstrations in Hlaing Thar Yar Township in Yangon.Video posted on social media showed crowds of people, some wearing hard hats and gas masks, running down a street amid sounds of gunfire. The demonstrators quickly sprayed vapor from fire extinguishers as they retreated.The use of fire extinguishers — common now in protests across Myanmar — is intended to smother tear gas and also create a vapor screen that makes it harder for police to pursue or shoot demonstrators.There were also reports of injuries from live rounds and rubber bullets.Billows of black smoke could be seen after security forces reportedly set roadblocks on fire.On Saturday, the civilian leader of Myanmar’s government in hiding vowed to continue supporting a “revolution” to oust the military that seized power in the Feb. 1 coup.Mahn Win Khaing Than, who was named the acting vice president by Myanmar's ousted lawmakers and is a member of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, addressed the public on Saturday for the first time since the coup.“This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close,” he said in a video posted on the shadow government’s website and social media.“In order to form a federal democracy, which all ethnic brothers who have been suffering various kinds of oppressions from the dictatorship for decades really desired, this revolution is the chance for us to put our efforts together," he said.He added: “We will never give up to an unjust military, but we will carve our future together with our united power. Our mission must be accomplished.”At the end of the message, he flashed the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to the military rulers.Also Saturday, security forces again opened fire on demonstrators, killing four in Mandalay, the country's second-biggest city, two in Pyay in south-central Myanmar, and one in Twante, a suburb of Yangon. Details of all seven deaths were posted on multiple social media accounts, some accompanied by photos of the victims.The actual death toll is likely to be higher, as police apparently seized some bodies, and some of the victims suffered serious gunshot wounds that doctors and nurses working at makeshift clinics would be hard-pressed to treat. Many hospitals are occupied by security forces, and as a result are boycotted by medical personnel and shunned by protesters.The independent UN human rights expert for Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said last week that credible reports indicated that at least 70 people had died so far, and cited growing evidence of crimes against humanity by the military.Other unofficial but carefully compiled tallies put the number of deaths since the coup at around 90.Saturday’s killings did not faze demonstrators in Yangon who crowded a downtown commercial area past the official 8 p.m. curfew to hold a mass candlelight vigil and sing about their cause. The mostly young protesters rallied at an intersection where they usually gather for daytime protests.After-dark rallies were also held in Mandalay and elsewhere.The nighttime protests may reflect a more aggressive approach to self-defense that has been advocated by some protesters. Police have been aggressively patrolling residential neighborhoods at night, firing into the air and setting off stun grenades as part of intimidation.They have also been carrying out targeted raids, taking people from their homes with minimal resistance. In at least two known cases, the detainees died in custody within hours of being hauled away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-more-shot-dead-during-anti-coup-protests-in-myanmar-101615716461553.html

Sources told Reuters the decision had been taken after the deaths of two men in Sicily. Aifa said earlier that the ban was a "precautionary" measure, adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent "serious adverse events."Italy on Saturday released its national vaccination plan, aiming to vaccinate at least 80% of its population by the end of September and administer 500,000 doses a day at full capacity.Speranza said that Italy is expecting the delivery of 52 million doses in the second quarter of the year and that the vaccination campaign would be accelerated even with further supply delays.So far, 6.6 million Italians have received at least one vaccine dose, with just under 2 million of them having received the required 2 doses, health ministry data shows.(Reporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Nick Macfie)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-expects-covid-19-cases-to-start-falling-in-late-spring-health-minister-101615713426817.html

The last NASA crewed landing was in 1972.Chinese rockets currently do not have sufficient thrust to send astronauts to the moon, Wu said, but China aims to make breakthroughs in rocket design in 2021-2025.In China's next mission to the moon, lunar samples of the south pole will be retrieved, he said.Subsequent missions will involve a detailed survey of resources in the south pole, and the testing of key technologies in preparation for the construction of the research station, Wu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eventually-wants-astronauts-to-stay-on-moon-for-long-periods-of-time-101615713731781.html

The cartoon was published days after the Duchess of Sussex, and her husband, Prince Harry, alleged racism within the royal family during a tell-all interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey.In the cartoon titled 'Why Meghan left Buckingham Palace', the Duchess of Sussex, with the Queen kneeling on her neck, is depicted saying, “Because I couldn’t breathe any more”. Last year, Floyd, a Black man, had uttered “I can’t breathe” more than 20 times and was told by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, who was kneeling on his neck, to stop “yelling”, according to the transcript of the minutes leading to his death.French magazine Charlie Hebdo mocks George Floyd's murder and Meghan's racism concerns. The cover reads: 'Why Meghan left Buckingham Palace', 'Because I couldn't breathe'. pic.twitter.com/3Fuj789xn7Floyd’s final words heard in a video captured by a bystander became a rallying cry at Black Lives Matter protests and triggered discussions around systemic racism across the globe. Markle’s interview has also prompted discussions on institutional racism and some even questioned the relevance of monarchy in Britain.Read | 'We're not racist', Prince William says after Meghan and Harry interviewBut critics have found Charlie Hebdo’s cartoon depiction problematic and some Twitter users said that it was “plain racist”. Dr Halima Begum, the chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, the UK’s race equality thinktank, said that the cartoon was “wrong on every level”. Sharing the cartoon on Twitter, Begum said it not only “demeans the issues” but causes offence across the board.“#CharlieHebdo, this is wrong on every level.

14-03-2021||World||Covid-19 mutated from bats to humans with 'very little change': Scientists||The progenitor of the novel coronavirus underwent "very little change" to adapt to humans from bats, according to a new study which suggests that the ability of the virus to spread from one person to another likely evolved in the flying mammal prior to it jumping to its new human host.The study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, assessed hundreds of thousands of sequenced genomes of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and found that for the first 11 months of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been very little 'important genetic change' observed in the coronavirus.However, it noted that some changes such as the D614G mutation, and similar tweaks in the virus spike protein has affected its biology."This does not mean no changes have occurred, mutations of no evolutionary significance accumulate and 'surf' along the millions of transmission events, like they do in all viruses," explained study first author Oscar MacLean from the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research in Scotland.But the scientists said it was "surprising" how transmissible Sars-CoV-2 has been from the outset."Usually viruses that jump to a new host species take some time to acquire adaptations to be as capable as Sars-CoV-2 at spreading, and most never make it past that stage, resulting in dead-end spillovers or localised outbreaks," said Sergei Pond, another co-author of the study from Temple University in the US.Also watch: Covid update: India ranking falls; China vaccine discrimination; fake test scamAnalysing the mutations undergone by the novel coronavirus and related sarbecoviruses -- the group of viruses the Covid-19 virus belongs to from bats and pangolins -- the scientists found evidence of fairly significant change, but all before the emergence of Sars-CoV-2 in humans.Based on this observation, the researchers said Sars-CoV-2 came with a ready-made ability to infect humans and other mammals, with these properties likely evolving in bats prior to it jumping to humans."While an undiscovered 'facilitating' intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of Sars-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human–human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus," the scientists wrote in the study.Although the novel coronavirus is still cleared by the human immune response in the vast majority of infections, the scientists cautioned that it is now moving away faster from the January 2020 variant used in all of the current vaccines to raise protective immunity.The current vaccines will continue to work against most of the circulating variants, but as more time passes, and the bigger the differential between vaccinated and not-vaccinated numbers of people, they said there will be more opportunity for the virus to escape vaccines."The first race was to develop a vaccine. The race now is to get the global population vaccinated as quickly as possible," said David L Robertson, lead author of the study from the the University of Glasgow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-mutated-from-bats-to-humans-with-very-little-change-scientists-101615707206273.html

There are reports that the lending under the BRI has come down from USD 75 billion in 2016 to just USD 3 billion in 2020.Besides, the BRI projects are embroiled under different problems such as corruption, lack of financial transparency, unfair loan conditions, fears of debt-traps, and negative social and environmental impacts.Even in China's all-weather ally Pakistan, just 32 of the total 122 projects announced under the BRI could be completed so far, reported The Kabul Times.The reduced growth rate has forced the Beijing government to tighten fiscal discipline and work on financial risk, which would translate into lower prospects of China pumping money into the BRI projects now.According to an independent research organisation Rhodium Group, the progress or growth of BRI projects had begun decelerating even before the COVID-19 outbreak. It asserted that Chinese investment became stagnant and even decelerated in most of the developing world in the past three years, reported The Kabul Times.China had been wooing developing or poor African and Asian countries since the inception of BRI projects through loans and investments. The Covid-19 outbreak however has caused millions of Chinese businesses to go bankrupt and cash flow to be disrupted, thus making a huge impact on the country's economy.Now the contraction in Chinese lending is going to widen the overseas lending gap as well. As the BRI stumbles, China's diplomatic image as a dependable development partner would be dented, reported The Kabul Times.Independent research groups are not much hopeful about the BRI getting back on track. James Crabtree, associate professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore said China has to walk on the tight rope since BRI loanee countries want their loans to be cancelled while Chinese people are against overseas spending in such difficult times.Bradley Parks, executive director of research lab AidData cited difficulties in construction activities, which would lead to "a significant slowdown" in the implementation of the BRI."With the sustainability of financing for the BRI projects already posing a challenge and Chinese capital expected to be mobilised to first meet its domestic needs, the pandemic as well as its induced economic slowdown will be a further setback and may even sound the death knell for some BRI projects," said global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-belt-and-road-project-stalls-as-china-s-economy-shrinks-report-101615711615553.html

With 11,439,250 cases and 277,216 deaths, Brazil is now one spot behind the United States, which is the worst-affected globally with more than 30 million cases and 546,605 deaths, according to figures by worldometers. Brazil on Saturday recorded 76,178 fresh cases and 1,997 deaths and the Indian figures of infections and fatalities stood at 24,882 and 140 respectively.Brazil is currently facing the worst phase of the pandemic. Infections and deaths have spiked after the year-end gatherings and clandestine carnival festivities, according to news agency Bloomberg. On Friday, the Latin American nation saw deaths crossing the 2,000-mark or 2,216 for the third consecutive day and 85,663 were found out to be positive for the infection, the second-highest single-day count.Since 2020 when Covid-19 became a global health crisis, President Jair Bolsonaro and his government has been criticised for not handling the pandemic properly. Restrictions and curbs in Brazil are different for different cities and are often found to be eased only to be re-imposed weeks later, according to Bloomberg. No stringent norms have been laid out yet to combat the outbreak and the Brazilian president on the other hand, is telling governors to allow business activities to re-open across the country with a logic that the economic toll of the pandemic overshadows the effects of the disease if people don’t go to work.Also Read| These are the 5 most-affected countries with highest number of Covid-19 casesWorld Health Organization’s (WHO) director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that all residents of Brazil should take the situation seriously and pointed out neighbouring countries might be affected. Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, Tedros stated, “Unless serious measures are taken the upward trend now flooding the health system and becoming more than its capacity will result in more deaths. ”As countries are rushing towards administering vaccine doses to their fellow citizens with a view to preventing the resurgence of the virus, Brazil has been behind on this count as well. Inoculations started very late in the country with a limited number of doses, which were not sufficient to even administer to the priority groups. Just over 4 per cent of the total population of 211 million has been inoculated till now.“Brazil is one of the few countries in the world with the capacity to make vaccines, and we want that,” Bolsonaro, who has refused to get vaccinated, said.

14-03-2021||World||Dubai sees population surging 76% on lure of beaches, greenery||Pandemic or regional competition, Dubai doesn’t plan to slow down.The Middle East’s business and tourism hub has unveiled an ambitious urban plan that predicts population will surge 76% over the next two decades as it eyes growth amid stiffening competition with neighbors looking for life after oil.Under the plan published on Saturday, Dubai aims to boost its beach capacity by 400% and more than double hotels and green spaces in the desert metropolis that attracts millions of tourists each year. An expansion of public transport, economic and industrial zones is expected to help drive new residents into the city, known for its man-made islands.The plan was released as the city reels from the fallout of the pandemic and amid increased competition from the region’s biggest economy, Saudi Arabia, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is driving a strategy to double the size of the capital Riyadh.Dubai grew at a breakneck speed since the 1960s as its “build it and they will come” model bore fruit. The city’s rulers succeeded in turning a small desert town into a global metropolis that draws more tourists than India, with man-made islands, luxury hotels and sandy beaches.But the expansion wasn’t without hiccups. A decline in oil prices has driven down property prices by nearly a third since 2014 and the key travel industry was slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. Amid job losses in sectors ranging from aviation and construction, Dubai’s population dropped by 8.4% last year -- the steepest decline in the Gulf region -- according to S&P Global Ratings.Expatriates make up the majority of the population in the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part. Residency permits in the country are usually tied to employment and many expatriates have to leave if they lose their jobs.Dubai’s government, however, refutes the reports of a decline in population and says population in fact grew 1.6% in 2020. Policymakers now project population will surge to 5.8 million people in 2040 from about 3.3 million.Under the plan, the government envisages that more than half of the population will live within 800 meters (0.5 miles) of public transport and 60% of the desert emirate’s land will be protected as a natural reserve. A new urban planning law will be issued to support sustainable development at a time the government is looking to provide better housing for citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-sees-population-surging-76-on-lure-of-beaches-greenery-101615710982705.html
14-03-2021||World||China fires back at UK charges of Hong Kong treaty violation||China accused the UK of “groundless slanders” after the British government said Beijing’s crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong wasn’t in compliance with a treaty that paved the way for the city’s return to Chinese control.“The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong after the handover, and it has no so-called ‘obligations’ to Hong Kong citizens,” China said in a statement posted Sunday on the website of its London embassy.The statement came after UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Saturday said China is in a “state of ongoing non-compliance” with the key treaty that paved the way for Hong Kong’s return to Chinese control.In recent days, Chinese lawmakers approved an overhaul of the city’s election system that threatens to stack its legislature with pro-Beijing loyalists. The move was the culmination of a series of steps to curb challenges to Chinese rule, including passage of a national security law that led to the arrest of dozens of democracy activists and prompted many to flee the city.The election overhaul “is part of a pattern designed to harass and stifle all voices critical of China’s policies and is the third breach of the Joint Declaration in less than nine months,” Raab said. The UK decision was a “demonstration of the growing gulf between Beijing’s promises and its actions.”The statement gave no indication of what the UK government would do if China doesn’t return to compliance with the Joint Declaration.“The UK will continue to stand up for the people of Hong Kong,” Raab said. “China must act in accordance with its legal obligations and respect fundamental rights and freedoms in Hong Kong.”China fired back in a 500-word statement asserting its control over the city.“Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China,” it said. “How to design and improve its electoral system is purely China’s internal affair and brooks no external interference.”Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years until its return to China in 1997 after the two countries signed the Joint Declaration. The agreement gave control back to China in return for the city maintaining a “high degree” of autonomy. Yet under President Xi Jinping, China has moved to tighten its grip on the city; the crackdown accelerated after massive pro-democracy demonstrations broke out in 2019.After passage of the national security law, the UK responded by offering a path to British citizenship for eligible Hong Kong residents.China’s overhaul of Hong Kong’s legislature will give Beijing virtual veto power in the selection of the city’s leaders. China says the national security law was necessary to punish acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities or collusion with foreign entities.

Amid discontent over a sluggish start to Germany’s vaccination drive, and with coronavirus restrictions easing only gradually, Merkel’s Union bloc has been hit over the past two weeks by allegations that two lawmakers profited from deals to procure masks early in the coronavirus pandemic.The CDU already faced a challenging task against two popular state governors from rival parties.In Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany's only Green party governor, Winfried Kretschmann, has become popular with centrist voters in 10 years running a region that is home to automakers Daimler and Porsche. The region was long dominated by the CDU until Kretschmann won power shortly after Japan's 2011 Fukushima reactor disaster, which accelerated the end of nuclear power in Germany.Kretschmann, 72, a fatherly figure with a conservative image, features on Green election posters with the slogan “You know me.” That is a slogan that Merkel famously once used in a pre-election debate to underline her own largely ideology-free appeal.In Baden-Wuerttemberg's last election in 2016, the Greens overtook the CDU to become the strongest party in the state. Polls suggest they can hope to widen their lead Sunday.That would be a hopeful signal for the national election campaign, in which the traditionally left-leaning environmentalist party is expected to make its first bid for the chancellery. Merkel isn't seeking a fifth term after nearly 16 years in power.About 7.7 million people are eligible to vote in Baden-Wuerttemberg and some 3.1 million in Rhineland-Palatinate. The center-left Social Democrats have led that region for 30 years — currently under governor Malu Dreyer, whose personal popularity has kept her party’s support above its dismal national ratings. Dreyer is the favorite this time, though in a close race.It's an awkward moment for new CDU leader Armin Laschet to face his first major test since being elected in January. Laschet has sought to pre-empt any fallout, saying that state elections “always have their very own character” and the outcome won't affect the stability of his leadership. However, bad results may raise questions over his hopes of running to succeed Merkel in September.Many people had already voted by mail, so it’s unclear how far the scandal — over lawmakers in the CDU and its Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union, allegedly enriching themselves through mask deals — will impact Sunday’s vote. Nikolas Loebel, a CDU lawmaker from Baden-Wuerttemberg, and the CSU’s Georg Nuesslein have both quit their parties and say they won’t run for parliament again.The Union bloc of CDU and CSU benefited from Merkel’s perceived good management of the pandemic over the past year. It still leads national polls by a distance, but this year has started badly. Germany’s vaccination campaign has been significantly slower than those of Israel, Britain and the U.S.Laschet says that he and Markus Soeder, the CSU leader and Bavarian governor who is the other serious contender to run for chancellor, will decide on the center-right candidate to succeed Merkel in April or May. Soeder has gained in stature during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-state-polls-open-with-tough-test-for-chancellor-angela-merkel-s-party-101615710201813.html
14-03-2021||World||Chinese city Tangshan to punish firms straying from anti-pollution plan||Tangshan, China's top steelmaking city, said it will punish firms that either have not taken the steps spelled out under its emergency anti-pollution plan or have illegally discharged pollutants, following weeks of smog in northern China.All enterprises must strictly meet the requirements of the city's environmental protection plan, Vice Mayor Li Guifu said in an emergency municipal meeting on Saturday night.Firms in the city's heavy industry, including the steel and cement sectors, have been told to limit or halt production during heavily polluted days to reduce overall emissions of air pollutants - such as sulphuric dioxide or nitrogen oxide - by 50%.Tangshan, the economic centre of northern Hebei province, is historically one of China's most polluted cities due to its heavy industry. It is also a source of smog for the region, which includes nearby Beijing.For companies that do not meet the environmental requirements, all their pollutant discharge permits will be revoked and their discharge performance rating will be cut to "D", which would demand them to suspend production.Last week, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment urged Tangshan to severely crack down on violations of atmospheric environment rules after it found four steel mills had failed to implement production curbs during heavy pollution.China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from the record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of the country's total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-city-tangshan-to-punish-firms-straying-from-anti-pollution-plan-101615696703155.html
14-03-2021||World||Hong Kong completes testing after mini-lockdown in city center||Hong Kong completed coronavirus tests in four buildings locked down in the heart of an upmarket residential area popular with expatriates, taking one of its most dramatic steps yet to contain a super-spreading event that began in a gym.Authorities cordoned off two towers each at the Robinson Place and Blessings Garden residential complexes in the exclusive Mid-Levels neighborhood on Saturday. As of 2 a.m. on Sunday, 1,855 residents in the buildings had been tested and no confirmed Covid-19 cases were found, the government said in a statement. The screening was completed at 9 a.m. and the enforcement operation concluded at around 11 a.m.Police vans and officers arrived on Saturday evening to seal off the area around the buildings with red tape and metal barricades. Nearly a dozen makeshift tents lined the sidewalk as government workers in protective gear began setting up specimen collection stations.On Sunday, the government announced more workplaces, schools and residential buildings were subject to compulsory testing orders. The updated list includes offices housing UBS Group, Chanel Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc.Screening will also be required at six schools and universities including the Kowloon Bay campus of Kellett School, whose Pok Fu Lam branch was closed last week, as well as at more than a dozen residential buildings in the central area of Sai Ying Pun where sewage samples tested positive for the virus.The government’s latest measures marked an escalation of a days-old campaign that’s already resulted in hundreds of people being sent to quarantine camps, dozens of offices ordered to conduct mandatory employee testing and several of Hong Kong’s most expensive schools halting in-person classes. While the city’s had bigger flareups, no outbreak has hit so close to home for many of the city’s expats since the pandemic began.The number of confirmed cases linked to the outbreak ballooned to 99 after the first case was reported on Wednesday.Several banks advised staff last week to not come into offices. HSBC Holdings Plc vacated a floor of its main building Thursday after an employee tested preliminary positive, according to a memo to staff. UBS Group AG told some staff to work from home after an employee tested positive, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reverted to a policy of 50% of staff working from home.​The outbreak also affected legal firms, with Allen & Overy and Herbert Smith Freehills both closing their offices after employees tested positive. Clifford Chance asked staff to work remotely out of an “abundance of caution.”Hong Kong, which has one of the strictest quarantine regimes in the world, requires all who have had close contact with infected persons to enter mandatory isolation for a period up to two weeks. More than 300 people have been sent to quarantine in the latest outbreak, which started with a trainer at Ursus Fitness in Sai Ying Pun, a gym popular with western expats.On Saturday, health officials clarified there would be compulsory Covid tests for a group of eight- and nine-year-olds in an international school after their teacher tested positive for the virus. Some will be required to be quarantined with a parent or caregiver. An earlier directive was said to have ordered all the children to be quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-completes-testing-after-mini-lockdown-in-city-center-101615696858113.html

14-03-2021||World||US workers faced harrowing year on the front lines during pandemic||One year ago, workers across the United States learned they'd been divided into two categories: those who would work from home, and those who would have to keep showing up to workplaces where they risked exposure to Covid-19.Matt Valentin was among the latter, and in the months that followed, the Starbucks cafe where he worked in Monroe, Michigan became an increasingly anxiety-ridden environment."From my perspective, it went from 'get these drinks and orders done as fast as possible' to 'do all of that, and try not to bring a deadly virus home to your vulnerable family,'" the 21-year-old said in an interview.As Americans mark the one-year anniversary of the beginning of the pandemic that transformed how business is done in the world's largest economy, those whose jobs required them to show up to work as the virus raged told AFP of a year of fear and uncertainty."It seemed like it went from zero to 100 in a matter of days," said Julie Mann, a midwife at a Boston-area hospital."We didn't have (personal protective equipment), we didn't have testing. We didn't know who was infected, we didn't know if our colleagues were infected."Also read: Growing number of UK firms face bankruptcy as lockdown drags- Divided workforce -Tens of millions of people lost their jobs after US states closed or restricted businesses as the pandemic intensified in March 2020.Among those who stayed employed, the division between those who could work from home and those who couldn't became one of the first of many inequalities widened by the pandemic.A study from the University of California, San Francisco found that working-age adults in the state experienced a 22 percent overall increase in mortality during the pandemic, with larger jumps seen in industries like agriculture, transportation and others where in-person labor is common.Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to hold risky positions. The Urban Institute think tank found that more than half of Black, Hispanic and Native American workers do their jobs in-person, compared to 41 percent of white workers."It's just the patterns that are baked into our society in terms of who we value and who we don't, and how we pay people," Lisa Dubay, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said of the findings.- 'A spacesuit look' -At Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the 44-year-old Mann works, the pandemic began with a terrifying two-week period where protective gear was needed yet was in short supply, forcing staff to take unheard of steps like reusing or jury-rigging equipment.Something like normalcy returned once those shortages were resolved and Covid-19 testing became widespread, but Mann had to wear a gown, mask and glasses during visits with patients -- a "spacesuit look" she tried to soften by attaching a family photo to her scrubs to give the interactions a bit of the intimacy they once had.A thornier problem was how to take care of mothers who were Covid-19 positive, particularly in the days after giving birth."If you want zero risk, then you isolate fully from the baby and the baby isn't with you," she said. "No mom that I know of chose to do that."- Mask wars -The Starbucks where Valentin works part-time while studying for his college degree also faced trouble with masks, but in his conservative county the issue was not supply but suspicion."Even to this day, we have people walking in with no mask, or barely trying to keep it on. They'll walk in and say, 'Oh, I forgot to wear one,' which we all obviously don't believe because it's been over a year," Valentin said.Some customers would take one of the free masks on offer, wear it improperly, or rip it off before leaving the store. Entire families would make no effort to mask up.One time, a maskless customer screamed at Valentin's co-workers that they "can't control him," shouting expletives until the staff called the police."To react that way over something so minimal is still shocking to me, but these are the kinds of people we get to encounter every day since last March (or) April," he said.- Wait for vaccines -Two of Valentin's co-workers came down with Covid-19 after the store temporarily closed early in the pandemic, but it managed to avoid further infections even when the country's outbreak was at its worst.Despite an entire year of tense in-person shifts, Valentin expects he will have to wait for weeks to be eligible for his vaccine."I'm very frustrated that my line of work that was once considered 'essential' has been put on the backburner," he said.In the meantime, Mann, like many healthcare workers, has already been vaccinated.Despite the relief that brought, she can't forget the disaster of the past year, when the United States saw the world's worst Covid-19 outbreak, leaving more than 530,000 people dead.We are "not as great as we think we are," Mann said, "and it's been humbling."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-workers-faced-harrowing-year-on-the-front-lines-during-pandemic-101615696955883.html
14-03-2021||World||Despite US economic recovery, Federal Reserve firm on keeping interest rates low||Skittish investors have see-sawed between celebration about the expected US economic recovery and nail-biting over a possible price spiral, but the Federal Reserve is standing firm on keeping interest rates low.In the balance between allowing faster growth -- and rising prices -- in order to restore some of the more than nine million jobs still missing due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Fed Chair Jerome Powell's message has been clear: he wants to see more people back to work.Analysts are expecting the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain its very "dovish" stance when it holds its two-day policy meeting next week.Powell on Wednesday is expected to stress once again that the Fed is willing to accept higher inflation to get back to full employment, a goal that took a decade to achieve following the 2008 global financial crisis."I think it's 'markets be damned' at this point," said Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union."The Fed has said that until the real improvement in employment and in the economy, they're not going to budge," Frick told AFP. "I really don't think they're going to waver."From a 50-year low of 3.5 percent unemployment before the pandemic lockdowns began in early 2020, the jobless rate spiked as millions of workers were sent home, but gradually fell back to 6.2 percent in February amid businesses reopenings.Also read: Increase in US crude oil prices makes oil, gas firms best performing areasAs vaccine rollouts have picked up speed and President Joe Biden signed a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package, boosting the chances the world's largest economy can soon reopen, investors have begun to fear an inflationary spiral.That is reflected in the spike in government debt yields, particularly on 10-year Treasury notes, a canary in the coal mine for coming price increases.- Hot but not boiling -While the jump back to its early 2020 level could be viewed as something of a market freak-out, there are real-world consequences of rising Treasury yields, since lending rates for home mortgages and car loans are linked to them.Mortgage rates have begun to creep up, which could price some buyers out of an already-hot housing market, while existing homeowners will find it harder to refinance their loans, said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics.Inflation is expected to rebound, as the economic engine revs up, especially compared to the depressed prices seen during the pandemic closures, but any sharp spikes are expected to be temporary."The reopening economy is going to be turbocharged by this $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus, so there's no doubt" inflation will rise, Bostjancic told AFP.The critical question is how high "and for how long," she said."It's going to feel warmer, but we don't think it's an overheating situation."Over more than a decade inflation has rarely pushed above the Fed's 2.0 percent target, and the central bank's preferred price measure was up only 1.5 percent in January compared to a year earlier.Bostjancic and Frick agree with many economists who say there is a lot of slack in the economy which will dampen price increases.- Signal to markets -Powell has acknowledged that prices will move up but he pledged the Fed would not withdraw stimulus until the economy had returned to maximum employment -- which is unlikely this year -- and inflation was both above the 2.0 percent goal and on track to remain there "for some time.""We're not intending to raise interest rates until we see those conditions fulfilled," Powell said.However, the Fed is not impervious to the market jitters, and Powell could try again to calm inflation fears by sending a stronger signal that the central bank will use its tools to address any worrying price increases or bond yield spikes.While he has been noncommittal about specifics he could provide more details in his press conference Wednesday, including on his willingness to change the mix of debt the Fed buys each month.And Bostjancic notes the Fed could make another technical move that could ease pressure on yields, by extending the pandemic exemption on banks holding of Treasuries without having to have a cash buffer.That exemption expires at the end of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-us-economic-recovery-federal-reserve-firm-on-keeping-interest-rates-low-101615696984892.html
14-03-2021||World||People gather for rally marking 1 year of Breonna Taylor's killing||Hundreds of demonstrators gathered for a rally and march in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday to mark the one-year anniversary of the killing of Breonna Taylor, whose death helped fuel US protests against police brutality.Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was shot six times and killed by police in her Louisville home during a botched raid on March 13, 2020.A grand jury in September recommended no homicide charges against the three white officers in the case. One of the officers, Brett Hankison, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing into a neighbor’s apartment, and a juror said later those charges were the only ones brought to the grand jury by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.Hankison and two other officers were fired by the police department.The incident, along with the police killing in May of George Floyd in Minnesota, sparked demonstrations against racism and excessive use of force by law enforcement across the nation last summer.During Saturday's rally in Louisville, speakers called for justice for Taylor and reforms to the criminal justice system."This is about our power to change this world for our children, for my daughter," said Sadiqa Reynolds, president of the Louisville Urban League. "This is so we make sure that not another person dies at the hands of the police.”Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker also spoke briefly to the crowd.Also read: No charges against officers involved in Daniel Prude's death"They dropped the charges against me, but that is not where we finish," he said, referring to charges that were filed and later dismissed against him for shooting at the police officers during the incident. "We got to keep going. Keep going."Demonstrators then marched through downtown Louisville, chanting "Black lives matter" and "no justice, no peace" while waving signs showing Taylor's face.Louisville Mayor Greg Fisher said his city has made significant reforms in policies and priorities, but that there was still "a good deal of work ahead."Taylor's "death resonates still in our city and around the world, underscoring the need to reform systems and act more urgently to advance racial justice and equity," he said on Twitter.Walker filed a federal lawsuit against the police department on Friday, one of his lawyers said. It alleges that the officers violated Walker's civil rights by conducting an unlawful search and using excessive force. A police department spokesman could not be reached for comment.Louisville in September agreed to pay $12 million to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed by Taylor's family.Protests were held in other cities across the United States on Saturday to mark Taylor's death, including in Atlanta and New York. President Joe Biden said on Twitter that he remains committed to signing a police reform bill into law."Breonna Taylor’s death was a tragedy, a blow to her family, her community, and America. As we continue to mourn her, we must press ahead to pass meaningful police reform in Congress," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-gather-for-rally-marking-1-year-of-breonna-taylor-s-killing-101615688543044.html
14-03-2021||World||North Korea 'unresponsive' to Biden admin's diplomatic outreach: US official||North Korea has not responded to behind-the-scenes diplomatic outreach since mid-February by President Joe Biden's administration, including to Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations, a senior Biden administration official told Reuters on Saturday.The disclosure of the so-far unsuccessful US outreach, which has not been previously reported, raises questions about how Biden will address mounting tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.It also adds a new dimension to a visit America's top diplomat and defense secretary will make next week to South Korea and Japan, where concerns over North Korea's nuclear arsenal are expected to be high on the agenda.The senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, offered few details on the diplomatic push. But the official said there had been efforts to reach out to the North Korean government "through several channels starting in mid-February, including in New York.""To date, we have not received any response from Pyongyang," the official said.North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Biden administration has so far been cautious in publicly describing its approach to North Korea, saying it is carrying out a comprehensive policy review following former President Donald Trump's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Also read: UN says major world powers ignoring North Korea's crimes against humanityTrump's efforts failed to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.The Biden administration official said it appeared there had been no active dialogue between the United States and North Korea for more than a year, including at the end of Trump's administration, "despite multiple attempts during that time by the United States to engage."The US official declined to speculate about how the silence from Pyongyang would impact the Biden administration's North Korea policy review, which was expected to be completed in the coming weeks.During his election campaign, Biden described Kim as a "thug" and said he would only meet him "on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity."US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held out the possibility of additional sanctions, in coordination with allies, to press North Korea to denuclearize.Sanctions have so far failed to convince Kim to give up his nuclear weapons.Blinken is slated to host the first face-to-face discussions between senior Biden administration and Chinese officials on March 18 in Alaska. The Trump administration accused China of failing to enforce sanctions against North Korea.A confidential UN report found that North Korea maintained and developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020 in violation of international sanctions, helping fund them with some $300 million stolen through cyber hacks.The report by independent sanctions monitors said Pyongyang "produced fissile material, maintained nuclear facilities and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure" while continuing to seek material and technology for those programs from abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-unresponsive-to-biden-admin-s-diplomatic-outreach-us-official-101615688520265.html
14-03-2021||World||Canada: Armed forces veterans’ body seeks to end rift over India’s farm laws||A group of armed forces veterans in Canada has started a campaign to try to mend a growing rift between various communities in the country over farm laws passed in India last year that have sparked protests.The Veterans’ Association of Ontario, which comprises Indian-origin members who have served in the armed forces in India and Canada, is bringing together representatives from Hindu and Sikh organisations to resolve differences over the farm laws that have divided the Indo-Canadian community.Brigadier (Retd) Nawab Heer, chair of the association, told HT he was “hopeful” the situation will be “defused”, adding, “I don’t know why we should be creating tensions among ourselves. Views should be respected on both sides. If the Indian diaspora has to flourish here, we have to be together.”The association has facilitated dialogue between some leaders of the two communities, while religious establishments like gurdwaras have also been brought into the process of trying to create harmony.Among the initiatives the entity has planned is a cultural fair this spring, to be organised jointly by the Sikh and Hindu communities. Heer says the plan is to have a physical fair, but if Covid-19 curbs continue, it may have to be held virtually. Also on the agenda is counselling and orientation for international students from India, some of whom have participated in the protests against the laws that have taken place in Canada. Heer, who is Sikh, said such students were often “gullible and vulnerable” and need to be “insulated” from elements that “instigated” them.The protests in Canada against India’s farm laws, including a rally in front of the Indian High Commission in Ottawa on Saturday, have seen the involvement of pro-Khalistan groups. There have also been several reports of threats and intimidation of individuals considered pro-India by separatists. This has also led to violence, including assault and harassment during a “Tiranga-Maple” car rally organised by the Indo-Canadian community in the Greater Toronto Area on February 28. On the other hand, some extreme voices within the Hindu community have given calls for boycotting Sikh establishments such as stores and restaurants, and confronting them outside gurdwaras.Having received “positive” feedback for their efforts so far, Heer is optimistic that negativity can be “curbed” except among those “with vested interests” to keep the divisions in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-armed-forces-veterans-body-seeks-to-end-rift-over-india-s-farm-laws-101615701646743.html

President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of U.S. policies toward China.Top diplomats from both nations are set to meet in Alaska on March 18 in the first high-level, in-person contact between the two countries under the Biden administration.Singapore has close ties with both countries, and the tiny but wealthy nation wields strong economic and political influence in the region.Lee said it was not possible for Singapore to choose between the United States and China.When asked about the risk of a military conflict, he said: "It could happen before you expect it, if there is a mishap. If the countries are careful, it will not happen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/considerable-risk-of-severe-us-china-tensions-singapore-pm-101615700116338.html
14-03-2021||World||China, North Korea threats loom as Blinken, Austin head to Asia||Threats from China and North Korea will loom large over the Biden administration's first Cabinet-level trip abroad, part of a larger effort to bolster US influence and calm concerns about America's role in Asia.A senior administration said Saturday that US officials have tried to reach out to North Korea through multiple channels since last month, but have yet to receive a response, making consultations with the reclusive country's neighbors, Japan, South Korea and China, all the more critical.Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are heading to Japan and South Korea for four days of talks starting Monday as the administration seeks to shore up partnerships with the two key regional treaty allies. Blinken and Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will then meet with senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska,Their first official overseas visits are intended to restore what Biden hopes will be a calming and even-keeled approach to ties with Tokyo and Seoul after four years of transactional and often temperamental relations under the previous president, Donald Trump. He had upended diplomatic norms by meeting not once, but three times, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.In addition to their official talks, Blinken and Austin plan virtual meetings with journalists, civil-society members and others. After reassuring their counterparts of US commitments to Japanese and South Korean security, they plan to focus their talks on cooperating to confront an increasingly assertive China, the nuclear challenge from North Korea and the coronavirus pandemic.In his first months in office, Biden has already signaled his desire to return the Asia-Pacific — or Indo-Pacific, as has become more common in officialese — to the top of the US foreign policy agenda. In keeping with his broader “America is back” diplomatic theme, Biden has pledged to keep stability in the region at the core of his international initiatives.On Friday, Biden participated in a virtual summit with the leaders of India, Japan and Australia. “A free and open Indo-Pacific is essential,” Biden told his fellow members of the so-called Quad. “The United States is committed to working with you, our partners and all of our allies in the region to achieve stability.”As part of that effort and “to reduce the risks of escalation,” the senior official said efforts had been made to connect with the North Koreans since mid-February, including through what is known as the “New York channel.” To date, the official said, "we have not received any response from Pyongyang.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic outreach.As the administration plots its strategy, the official said it would continue to consult with the Japanese and South Koreans, as well as with the Chinese, and had also reached out to numerous former US officials involved in North Korea policy, including from the Trump presidency.Biden's meeting with the Quad came less than a week after US and South Korean negotiators overcame years of contentious discussions under Trump to reach a tentative deal on paying for the American troop presence in South Korea. That agreement, along with a similar one for Japan, will be front and center in Blinken and Austin’s meetings.As he had done with allies in Europe, Trump threatened to reduce security cooperation unless host countries paid more, sparking fears of troop withdrawals at a time of particular uncertainty as China boosts efforts to dominate the region and North Korea’s nuclear weapons remain a major source of angst.“Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy, and we are working to strengthen America’s relationships with our allies as well as the relationships among them,” said Sung Kim, a career diplomat who is the top US diplomat for Asia. He served in the Philippines and Indonesia during the Trump administration and was also previously the special envoy for North Korea.Yet, for all of Biden's suggestions that he will reverse Trump's overt hostility to China, he has yet to countermand a single one of his predecessor's policies. He has, in fact, reaffirmed several of them, including maintaining sanctions in response to human rights abuses in western Xinjiang and Hong Kong and restating a Trump-era decision to reject outright nearly all of China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.And, many of China's policies that the US finds objectionable — including its crackdown in Hong Kong, stepped up rhetoric against Taiwan and actions in the South China Sea — began during the Obama administration. The previous Democratic administration took office promising a “pivot to Asia” after a period of what many saw as American neglect for the region during George W. Bush's presidency, which was consumed by the onset of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.In fact, although some obvious circumstances have changed since 2009, Blinken and Austin's trip mirrors in many ways the initial overseas journey of President Barack Obama's first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, when she traveled to Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and then China in a bid to re-assert U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific. Obama's engagement with China, however, did not produce the desired results, and the North Korean threat grew.Although China is not on Blinken's itinerary, after wrapping up the stop in Seoul, he will fly back to Washington via Anchorage, Alaska, where he and Sullivan, will meet senior Chinese officials. Austin, meanwhile, while fly from Seoul to New Delhi, where he'll meet top Indian leaders.Still, the administration is convinced that its domestic efforts to revitalize the US, economy and step up the fight against Covid-19 have put it in a better position both to blunt Chinese ambitions directly and leverage its partnerships to do the same.“After the work of the past 50 days, Secretary Blinken and I will enter the meeting with senior Chinese representatives from a position of strength,” Sulllivan said on Friday.How that strength will play with rivals like China and North Korea, let alone allies like Japan and South Korea, remains to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-north-korea-threats-loom-as-blinken-austin-head-to-asia-101615698846667.html

Seventeen out of Japan's 47 prefectures were affected by the outbreak.Bird flu outbreaks have also been detected in the prefectures of Chiba, Kagawa, Fukuoka, Hyogo, Miyazaki, Hiroshima, Nara, Oita, Wakayama, Okayama, Shiga, Kochi, Tokushima, Gifu, Kagoshima, Toyama and Ibaraki. According to the Ministry for Agriculture, some 9.7 million domestic birds have already been exterminated to prevent the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-cull-77-000-chickens-over-new-bird-flu-outbreak-in-tochigi-101615698664566.html

Calls to the prime minister's office were not answered.The number of hospital beds in use to treat Covid-19 patients is falling gradually, which is justification to end the state of emergency as scheduled, the Sankei said, citing an unnamed government official.Restrictions such as shorter business hours for restaurants and bars have helped reduce new daily cases in Tokyo to roughly a tenth of a peak of 2,520 on January 7, but the number of new infections in Tokyo has been creeping up in recent days, raising concerns that the state of emergency might be extended.There is growing consensus among government officials and advisers, though, that even if the state of emergency is kept in place it would not lead to a further improvement in the number of infections, the Sankei said, citing an unnamed member of the government's advisory panel.The Japanese government extended the emergency declaration for Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures on March 5 by 14 days, saying Covid-19 cases hadn't fallen far enough and that new, more infectious coronavirus variants posed a threat.Japan is trying to bring coronavirus cases under control and get vaccinations well under way as it prepares to host the delayed Summer Olympics, now scheduled to start on July 23.Japan has so far recorded 446,923 coronavirus cases and 8,573 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-leaning-towards-ending-tokyo-state-of-emergency-on-march-21-report-101615698132658.html

The detentions are the latest in a series of crackdowns sustained by members of the opposition following Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny's arrest and imprisonment.Taking to Twitter, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken call for an end to the "persecution of independent voices.""Today, the Russian government detained almost 200 municipal leaders and politicians, including political activists Vladimir Kara-Murza and Yuliya Galyamina, on dubious grounds. We call for an end to the persecution of independent voices," Blinken wrote in a tweet.CNN reported that on Saturday, municipal deputies from Russia's regions gathered in the Russian capital to discuss parliamentary and local elections -- which are scheduled for September -- at a forum held by United Democrats, a project aimed at supporting competitive election, according to their website.On February 2, a Moscow court substituted Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's suspended sentence in corruption case with a real prison term of 3.5 years for multiple violations of his probation terms. A Moscow city court reinstated the ruling but reduced the sentence to 2.5 years.Also read: Police detain dozens of opposition leaders, deputies at Moscow conferenceFor months, opposition activists have been met with a harsh show of force, demonstrated most clearly on January 31, when over 5,000 people were detained during nationwide protests in 85 cities in support of Navalny.The Ministry of Internal Affairs said that "checks are being conducted" on the activists detained on Saturday, and that "a decision will be undertaken in compliance with the law."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-on-russia-to-release-those-detained-in-moscow-amid-pro-navalny-protests-101615686083366.html

Over 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.At least 13 people were killed on Saturday, one of the bloodiest days since the Feb. 1 coup, witnesses and domestic media said.Five people were shot dead and several injured when police opened fire on a sit-in protest in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city, witnesses told Reuters.Two people were killed in the central town of Pyay and two died in police firing in the commercial capital Yangon, where three were also killed overnight, domestic media reported."They are acting like they are in a war zone, with unarmed people," said Mandalay-based activist Myat Thu. He said the dead included a 13-year-old child.Si Thu Tun, another protester, said he saw two people shot, including a Buddhist monk. "One of them was hit in the pubic bone, another was shot to death terribly," he said.A truck driver in Chauk, a town in the central Magwe Region, died after being shot in the chest by police, a family friend said.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment. Junta-run media MRTV's evening news broadcast labelled the protesters "criminals" but did not elaborate.PROTESTSSaturday's protests erupted after posters spread on social media urging people to mark the death anniversary of Phone Maw, who was shot and killed by security forces in 1988 inside what was then known as the Rangoon Institute of Technology campus.His shooting and that of another student who died a few weeks later sparked widespread protests against the military government known as the 8-8-88 campaign, because they peaked in August that year. An estimated 3,000 people were killed when the army crushed the uprising.Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a democracy icon during the movement and was kept under house arrest for nearly two decades.She was released in 2010 as the military began democratic reforms. Her National League for Democracy won elections in 2015 and again in November last year.This year, the generals overthrew her government and detained Suu Kyi and many of her cabinet colleagues, claiming fraud in the November elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-seek-to-give-people-the-right-to-defend-themselves-myanmar-civilian-leader-101615692753272.html
14-03-2021||World||Police detain dozens of opposition leaders, deputies at Moscow conference||Russian police on Saturday arrested around 200 opposition politicians and municipal deputies at a Moscow conference as authorities tighten the screws on Kremlin critics ahead of parliamentary elections.A police raid on an opposition conference dedicated to running for municipal office came after President Vladimir Putin's top critic Alexei Navalny was jailed for two and a half years last month and more than 10,000 protesters detained across the country.While Russian police routinely break up opposition protests, the mass arrests of municipal deputies at a conference in Moscow were unprecedented.Participants from more than 50 of Russia's regions had gathered to discuss parliamentary and local elections in September at a forum organised by a project backed by prominent Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Forty minutes into the conference police broke up the event and detained the participants."The ENTIRE forum of Russian municipal deputies has been detained in Moscow!" Khodorkovsky said on Twitter, calling the detentions "unconstitutional".As news of the detentions emerged, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for an end to "persecution of independent voices", noting the Kremlin had detained these people "on dubious grounds".A number of well-known opposition figures including Ilya Yashin, Vladimir Kara-Murza, Yulia Galyamina, Yevgeny Roizman and Andrei Pivovarov as well as journalists have been detained."A very symbolic end to a short forum: deputies in police vans, and masked police are twisting people's arms," Yashin said on Facebook.'Undesirable' organisationMoscow police said in a statement that around 200 people had been detained.Many of the conference participants did not wear masks, while some were members of an organisation whose work had been declared "undesirable," police said.Pivovarov, speaking to AFP from a police station, said the forum participants had been detained because authorities believe the conference was organised by Open Russia, a movement founded by Khodorkovsky and designated as an "undesirable organisation".The municipal forum -- the first of its kind -- was organised by United Democrats, another project backed by Khodorkovsky, Pivovarov said. The authorities had appeared to look for a pretext to interrupt an opposition event, he said.A number of the detained activists said Saturday evening they had been released but ordered to appear in court at a later stage.Kara-Murza said he had been freed, adding that a probe had been opened into the work of an undesirable organisation.Taking to Twitter Saturday night, Pivovarov said police admitted to him that they had been under pressure to clamp down on the Kremlin critics."Cops are laughing at what they are doing," Pivovarov said.Khodorkovsky's Open Russia was banned in Russia in 2017 in line with a controversial law targeting foreign groups accused of political meddling.People cooperating with "undesirable" entities could be hit with fines and Russian entry bans.Khodorkovsky, who owned the oil giant Yukos before he was convicted in two controversial cases and spent a decade behind bars, now lives abroad.'Politics is crime'The team of jailed Kremlin foe Navalny accused authorities of seeking to further intimidate critics ahead of the September elections."It is clear why the forum has been broken up -- authorities are afraid of any competition during elections," the team said on the Telegram messaging app.The ruling party United Russia was getting increasingly unpopular, it claimed, adding: "Winning even rigged elections is becoming ever more difficult."Kremlin critics accuse Putin of steadily ramping up pressure on critics during his two decades in power, sidelining the opposition and tightening control on everything from the main television stations to parliament.The mass detentions of local deputies could mark a new chapter in the authorities' crackdown on dissent, political observers said."Politics in Russia is a crime, now it's official," tweeted Kirill Martynov, politics editor at Russia's top independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta.Analyst Abbas Gallyamov said the forum could have gone unnoticed if it were not for Russia's law enforcement."No one is really interested in the subject of local governance," Gallyamov wrote. "Now it's a full-fledged political event."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-detain-dozens-of-opposition-leaders-deputies-at-moscow-conference-101615690344017.html
14-03-2021||World||Norway sees 3 cases of blood clot post AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot||Norway, among the countries that have suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine, said three people who received its shot are being treated for severe blood clots and cerebral hemorrhages but that it’s too soon to say if there was a connection.The people, who were all “of younger age,” had a reduced number of platelets in their blood, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a statement on Saturday.Health authorities in Norway are telling people under the age of 50 who’ve received the AstraZeneca shot in the last 14 days to see a doctor if they feel ill or detect skin hemorrhages more than three days after vaccination.Norway on Thursday followed countries including Denmark in pausing use of the vaccine over concerns about blood clots, after a person in Austria died and others fell ill after being inoculated.“We can’t say if there is a connection with the vaccine, but we will investigate thoroughly,” Sigurd Hortemo, a doctor at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, said at a press conference from Oslo.Fiona Cookson, AstraZeneca’s director of global media relations, said safety data covering more than 17 million doses administered “has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia.”The reported numbers of these types of events for people who’ve had the AstraZeneca shot “are not greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the unvaccinated population,” Cookson added in an emailed statement. A review of available safety data is ongoing, she said.The European Medicines Agency said Wednesday in a statement referencing the Austrian cases said that it was investigating the concerns but had initially found no indication that the vaccine caused the clots. The European Commission has said it will follow EMA’s recommendation.A group of experts from the World Health Organization is also assessing the reported blood clots and looking at two specific batches of the vaccine, WHO officials said Friday. Unless a clear link is established, the WHO said there is no reason to stop injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-sees-3-cases-of-blood-clot-post-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-shot-101615686333219.html
14-03-2021||World||Britain must boost its cyber-attack capacity, says PM Boris Johnson||Britain needs to boost its capacity to conduct cyber attacks on foreign enemies, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said before the publication of a national security review next week."Cyber power is revolutionising the way we live our lives and fight our wars, just as air power did 100 years ago," Johnson said in a statement released by his office on Saturday.Johnson is due to present a long-term review of national security strategy to parliament on Tuesday which media reports suggest could lead to a reduction in armed forces personnel."The review will set out the importance of cyber technology to our way of life - whether it's defeating our enemies on the battlefield, making the internet a safer place or developing cutting-edge tech to improve people's lives," Johnson's office said.In 2019, Britain spent $59 billion, or 2.1% of national income, on defence, more than any other large European country but far below the 3.5% of income spent by the United States.Britain has invested heavily in costly aircraft carriers in recent years and maintains nuclear weapons, but its ground forces have shrunk since the Cold War ended.Some British media have reported that the review will call for the number of army personnel to be reduced by a further 12,500 to around 70,000.The defence ministry said on Saturday that talk of cuts "at this stage is speculation".Johnson said the National Cyber Force - including spies, defence officials and scientists - would have a permanent base in northern England as the government tries to boost regional development outside London.The NCF targets threats including foreign air defence systems and the mobile phones of people the government views as serious criminals or terrorists.It was created last year alongside a dedicated army regiment focused on cyber warfare. In 2016 a National Cyber Security Centre was set up to advise the government and public on how to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-must-boost-its-cyber-attack-capacity-says-pm-boris-johnson-101615685988935.html
14-03-2021||World||'When I die...': For Joe Biden, there's no place like a weekend home in Delaware||As he stood in the Rose Garden celebrating his first big legislative win, President Joe Biden gestured to the White House and said it's a “magnificent building” to live in.Except on weekends.Of the eight weekends since Biden took office, he has spent three at his longtime home outside Wilmington, Delaware, including this weekend. Tentative plans for another weekend visit were scrubbed due to Senate action on Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Biden also spent a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.Many presidents have complained at one point or another about feeling confined in the White House. Biden already has echoed earlier presidents in comparing the experience to living in a “gilded cage.”So trading the 132-room executive mansion for a less confining, more relaxing weekend hangout can help presidents unwind, said University of Chicago political scientist William Howell.“What he wanted to be was president,” Howell said. “It is not the White House per se that is the draw.”The White House defends Biden's leisure travel at a time when both he and federal health officials have been pleading with the public to take the coronavirus pandemic seriously, including by avoiding unnecessary travel.“The president lives in Wilmington. It's his home. That's where he's lived for many, many years," press secretary Jen Psaki said recently. “And as you know, as any president of the United States does, he takes a private airplane called Air Force One to travel there.”“I think most Americans would also see that as a unique circumstance,” she said of the government aircraft available to Biden.No president travels alone, though, no matter how private the plane. It requires that lots of other people travel as well. And the costs mount quickly.Besides the Air Force flight crew, a president's travel party includes Secret Service agents, White House staff, journalists and family. Depending on the destination and purpose of the trip, lawmakers, Cabinet secretaries or other guests may fly with the president.Biden occasionally brought some of his six grandchildren on trips when he was vice president, as well as during last year's presidential campaign.Presidential travel doesn't come cheap.Federal agencies spent an estimated $13.6 million on four trips that then-President Donald Trump took to his waterfront Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in February and March of 2017, the Government Accountability Office reported in 2019.The figure includes $10.6 million to operate government aircraft and boats, and $3 million for transportation, lodging, meals and other expenses for government personnel supporting the president on the road, the report said.But not all presidential travel is the same.Trump took the more familiar version of Air Force One, a modified 747, on the two-hour-plus flight to the commercial airport in West Palm Beach, Florida. Biden has flown a smaller version of the aircraft for the roughly half-hour flight to the Delaware Air National Guard Base. He made this weekend's trip on the Marine One presidential helicopter.Trump's Florida home is on the water, which required the addition of Coast Guard security patrols.Biden goes back to his longtime home near Wilmington, where he lived as a senator before being elected vice president in 2008 and where he returned after his time in that office was up.Now serving as Biden's weekend refuge, the home is where he watched Tom Brady, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' new quarterback, win a record seventh Super Bowl ring in February. While there, Biden often meets with advisers, attends church and enjoys Sunday dinner with the family.“We try to keep the Sunday night dinners,” Jill Biden told TV talk-show host Kelly Clarkson. “I mean, it's been a little busy lately. We still do it, and the kids look forward to it.”Biden owns a second home in the seaside community of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He has yet to visit it since becoming president but it could see more action as the weather warms up.During a tearful farewell in January as he left Wilmington for Washington, Biden credited the state with helping shape his values, character and world view. “It all comes from Delaware,” he said.Biden lived the majority of his 78 years in Wilmington after his parents relocated from Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was a boy. He represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for 36 years, and was a regular passenger on the Amtrak train to and from Washington.“Getting out of the White House was more cumbersome than it is now,” said Doug Wead, a former White House aide and author of books about presidents and their families.Early presidents were consigned to bumpy trains, he said. But motorcades, Air Force One and Marine One all help to ease a modern president's path out of the nation's capital.But there is no presidential playbook for how and where to spend the weekend.Trump spent many weekends at Mar-a-Lago or his Trump golf club in central New Jersey, leading critics to accuse him of trying to profit off the presidency.Barack Obama spent most Saturdays and Sundays in Washington because his young daughters belonged to weekend soccer and basketball leagues.George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Texas.Howell said Biden — who has cultivated his image as a “regular Joe” — has strong connections to his family, many of whom are in Delaware, that he wants to maintain.The president's first wife, Neilia, and their baby daughter, Naomi, who were killed in a 1972 car accident, and their son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46, are buried in a cemetery at the church where Biden attends services.People close to Biden also note the strong affection he has for Delaware.As he left the state in January, Biden, who is of Irish descent, alluded to an Irish poet who is believed to have said Dublin will be written on his heart when he dies.Overcome with emotion, Biden said, “when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-i-die-for-joe-biden-there-s-no-place-like-a-weekend-home-in-delaware-101615685721178.html
14-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca’s EU Covid-19 vaccine disaster deepens on clots, nationalism||AstraZeneca Plc’s European vaccine nightmare is worsening, with a number of countries halting shots over safety fears as further delivery delays prompt governments around the world to hoard doses they’ve already got.At least 10 countries including Italy and Norway reacted after Austria, and later Denmark, raised concerns over the possible side effects from two batches. While Europe’s medicines regulator said there was no indication of issues, it led to a spate of suspensions stretching as far as Thailand.The health scare emerged against a backdrop of further supply woes. The drugmaker’s efforts to make up for the European Union shortfall by sourcing shots elsewhere have hit a wall as governments around the world protect their own supplies. The US rebuffed pressure to share doses and is holding on to its Astra stockpile, even though the shot isn’t yet authorized for use there.The drama keeps Astra at the center of a political storm in Europe, weeks after manufacturing issues first put the two sides into conflict. Meanwhile, the EU is falling further behind the UK and the US in vaccinations, creating a political crisis for the bloc’s leaders.In addition to low yields producing less vaccine than planned, one plant in the Netherlands is still awaiting regulatory approval to deploy doses. The site, owned by the manufacturer Halix, is making the vaccine drug substance for Astra and forms part of both the EU and U.K. supply chains.An Astra spokesman said the approval timing is in line with original plans and hasn’t had any impact on EU deliveries. Halix didn’t respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours.But the various issues mean Astra will only be able to deliver about 100 million doses to the EU in the first half of the year, it said Friday, about a third of the number originally planned. Thirty million doses are due to be delivered by the end of this quarter, with the rest coming in the next three months.Italy has already responded with direct action, making use of a new EU measure to stop Astra from shipping some doses to Australia. Prime Minister Mario Draghi hinted on Friday that he’ll do that again if he has to.“The European Union has taken clear commitments with pharmaceutical companies and we expect they will be respected,” Draghi said. “We have taken some strong decisions against companies which have delayed the deliveries and we will continue to do so.”The latest developments will do little to encourage take up of the Astra vaccine in the EU, which had already encountered issues in recent weeks in light of the varying efficacy rates, potential loss of protection against new virus variants, and questions on its effectiveness in older adults. Until recently, a number of countries had restricted use of the shot to those aged under 65.In a March 7 YouGov survey, perceptions in EU countries of the safety of the shot from Astra and the University of Oxford were lower compared with vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, and Moderna Inc. By contrast, Britons viewed Astra’s as the safest of the three.The suspensions may further embed negative views, despite the guidance from the European Medicines Agency.The number of incidents reported -- about 30 from a group of around five million -- is no greater than what would have occurred naturally in that size of population, according to regulators and scientists.“Genuine problems with a batch are very rare and almost always relate to contamination by bacteria or physical” particles like glass detected by the manufacturer, said Stephen Evans, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Pausing the use in this case is not evidence-based.”Astra said an analysis of safety data of more than 10 million records had shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in any age group, gender, batch or country.The Astra vaccine has become an emblem for growing pandemic nationalism as countries race to inoculate populations as quickly as possible. The U.S. has already ordered nearly enough vaccines from the three manufacturers with authorization from the Food and Drug Administration to immunize its adult population twice over.“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of, first, but we’re then going to try to help the rest of the world,” President Joe Biden said on Wednesday.Meanwhile, back in Europe, the EU spent much of the past week in yet another war of words with the UK after it accused Britain of blocking vaccine exports. The EU itself has exported millions of doses, though it also has controls it can use to ensure drug companies honor contracts.“I think there’s an incredible irony with the European Union complaining about other countries being protectionist,” said Mark Eccleston-Turner, a law and infectious disease specialist at Keele University in England. “At the start of this pandemic they were referring to this vaccine as a public good, and then sought to buy up as many doses as they can and put export controls” in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazenecas-eu-covid-19-vaccine-disaster-deepens-on-clots-nationalism-101615685330967.html
14-03-2021||World||US urges end of 'persecution' after Russia opposition arrests: Blinken||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday called for an end to "persecution of independent voices" after around 200 opposition politicians and municipal deputies in Russia were arrested.While Russian police routinely break up opposition protests, the mass arrests of municipal deputies at a conference in Moscow were unprecedented."We call for an end to the persecution of independent voices," Blinken wrote in a tweet as authorities tightened the screws on Kremlin critics ahead of parliamentary elections.He noted "the Russian government detained almost 200 municipal leaders and politicians, including political activists Vladimir Kara-Murza and Yuliya Galyamina, on dubious grounds."Participants from more than 50 of Russia's regions had gathered to discuss parliamentary and local elections in September at a forum organized by a project backed by prominent Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.A number of the detained activists said Saturday evening they had been released but ordered to appear in court at a later stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urges-end-of-persecution-after-russia-opposition-arrests-blinken-101615685028115.html
14-03-2021||World||Myanmar protests: At least 12 killed as police open fire on sit-in||Myanmar security forces killed at least 12 people, witnesses and media reported, as the acting leader of a civilian parallel government vowed in a first public address on Saturday to pursue a "revolution" to overturn the Feb. 1 military coup.Five people were shot dead and several injured when police opened fire on a sit-in protest in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city, witnesses told Reuters.Another person was killed in the central town of Pyay and two died in police firing in the commercial capital Yangon, where three were also killed overnight, domestic media reported."They are acting like they are in a war zone, with unarmed people," said Mandalay-based activist Myat Thu. He said the dead included a 13-year-old child.Si Thu Tun, another protester, said he saw two people shot, including a Buddhist monk. "One of them was hit in the pubic bone, another was shot to death terribly," he said.In Pyay, a witness said security forces initially stopped an ambulance from reaching those who were injured, leading to one death.A truck driver in Chauk, a town in the central Magwe Region, also died after being shot in the chest by police, a family friend said.A spokesman for the junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.More than 70 people have been killed in Myanmar in widespread protests against the military's seizure of power, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group has said.The deaths came as the leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan vowed to work together to restore democracy in the Southeast Asian nation and the acting leader of the country's ousted civilian government addressed the public for the first time.Mahn Win Khaing Than, who is in hiding along with most senior officials from the ruling National League for Democracy Party, addressed the public via Facebook, saying, "This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close".He was appointed acting vice-president by representatives of Myanmar's ousted lawmakers, the Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), which is pushing for recognition as the rightful government.The group has announced its intention to create a federal democracy and leaders have been meeting representatives of Myanmar's largest ethnic armed organizations, which already control vast swathes of territory across the country."In order to form a federal democracy, which all ethnic brothers, who have been suffering various kinds of oppressions from the dictatorship for decades, really desired, this revolution is the chance for us to put our efforts together," Mahn Win Khaing Than said.He said the CRPH would "attempt to legislate the required laws so that the people have the right to defend themselves" and that public administration would be handled by an "interim people's administration team".A civil disobedience movement that started with government employees such as doctors and teachers has expanded into a general strike that has paralysed many sectors of the economy and taken a large portion of the workings of government out of the military's hands.ProtestsSaturday's protests erupted after posters spread on social media urging people to mark the death anniversary of Phone Maw, who was shot and killed by security forces in 1988 inside what was then known as the Rangoon Institute of Technology campus.His shooting and that of another student who died a few weeks later sparked widespread protests against the military government known as the 8-8-88 campaign, because they peaked in August that year. An estimated 3,000 people were killed when the army crushed the uprising.Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a democracy icon during the movement and was kept under house arrest for nearly two decades.She was released in 2010 as the military began democratic reforms. Her National League for Democracy won elections in 2015 and again in November last year.On Feb. 1 this year, the generals overthrew her government and detained Suu Kyi and many of her cabinet colleagues, claiming fraud in the November elections.The coup in Myanmar, where the military has close ties to China, is a major early test for US President Joe Biden.The US President held a virtual meeting with the Indian, Japanese and Australian leaders on Friday, the first official summit of the group known as the Quad, as part of a push to demonstrate a renewed US commitment to regional security."As longstanding supporters of Myanmar and its people, we emphasise the urgent need to restore democracy and the priority of strengthening democratic resilience," the four leaders said in a statement released by the White House.South Korea cuts defence tiesUnited Nations human rights investigator Thomas Andrews on Friday dismissed as "absurd" comments by a senior Myanmar official that authorities were exercising "utmost restraint".Addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, he called for a united approach to "strip away the junta's sense of impunity".Former colonial power Britain on Friday warned its citizens in Myanmar to leave and South Korea said it would suspend defence exchanges and reconsider development aid to Myanmar.The Kremlin said Russia, which has close ties to Myanmar's military, was concerned over the mounting violence and was "analysing" whether to suspend military-technical cooperation.The U.N. Security Council this week dropped language from a statement that condemned the army takeover as a coup, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-at-least-12-killed-as-police-open-fire-on-sitin-101615684575919.html

14-03-2021||World||'Hope some time this year': Australia working on travel bubble with Singapore||Australia is "working with Singapore" to create a travel bubble between the two nations as early as July, officials said Sunday, in an effort to restart tourism and travel put on hold by Covid-19.Early in the pandemic Australia effectively closed its international border to slow the spread of the coronavirus, with non-citizens banned from visiting except in special circumstances.Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said Australia was "working with Singapore at the moment potentially for a bubble (beginning) in July"."As the vaccine rolls out, not only in Australia but in other countries, we will reopen more bubbles," he told public broadcaster ABC.The Sydney Morning Herald reported the deal would allow Singaporeans and Australians who had been vaccinated to travel between the countries without quarantining.The newspaper said Canberra is also hoping that people from third countries -- such as international students, business travellers and returning citizens -- could complete two weeks' quarantine in Singapore before flying to Australia.Singapore has already opened its border to a handful of countries that have controlled the virus, including Australia, and officials have said the city-state would like to establish reciprocal travel corridors."If only others start to do it, then we'll have a bubble, you have reciprocity, you can start to travel. And I hope some time this year we can do that," transport minister Ong Ye Kung told local radio Friday.Australia's 14-day hotel quarantine requirement for arrivals has left tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas, with caps on returnees introduced as the limited system has been unable to cope with large numbers.International tourism -- worth about Aus$45 billion (US$35 billion) a year to the country's economy before the pandemic hit -- has evaporated.Australia already has a one-way "travel bubble" with New Zealand, allowing Kiwis to visit without quarantining, though the scheme has been suspended a number of times in response to virus outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-some-time-this-year-australia-working-on-travel-bubble-with-singapore-101615684130186.html
14-03-2021||World||Police, protesters clash as hundreds gather for slain Sarah Everard in UK||Clashes broke out Saturday between police and people who gathered in defiance of coronavirus restrictions at an unofficial vigil for a London woman whose killing has spurred a national conversation in the UK about violence against women.The hundreds who gathered on Clapham Common, near where marketing executive Sarah Everard last was seen alive on March 3, defied a police request to disperse and a judge's order to honor her and to draw attention to the fear and danger many women see as a daily part of British life.Everard disappeared while walking home from a friend's apartment and was found dead a week later. The slaying sent shockwaves across the UK because a police officer is charged with her kidnapping and murder.Video of the informal vigil turned rally showed showed officers tussling with participants. Male officers grabbed hold of several women and led them away in handcuffs to screaming and shouting from onlookers, Britain's Press Association reported.Many participants laid flowers at a bandstand in the park. Among them was Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who was seen pausing for a moment in front of the sea of flowers. Other people held signs reading “We will not be silenced” and “She was just walking home,” and the crowd chanted, “Sisters united will never be defeated.”The gathering happened hours after Metropolitan Police constable Wayne Couzens, 48, appeared in court for the first time since his arrest in Everard's death. As Metropolitan Police officers approached the Clapham Common bandstand on Saturday evening, boos, jeers and shouts of “Shame on you” came from the crowd, according to the Press Association.Organisers had hoped to hold “Reclaim the Streets” vigils in Everard's memory at the south London location and in other U.K. cities on Saturday but canceled the in-person events after a judge refused to grant an order allowing them to go on despite despite coronavirus restrictions that bar mass gatherings.Hundreds of people showed up nonetheless.London Mayor Sadiq Khan decried the police response.“The police have a responsibility to enforce Covid laws, but from images I've seen it's clear the response was at times neither appropriate nor proportionate,” Khan said on twitter.Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that he had asked Metropolitan Police for a full report on what happened.In the wake of Everard's disappearance and killing, many women have taken to social media to share their own experiences of being threatened or attacked while walking outside.A 33-year-old nurse who works in the Clapham area, Mel Clarke, said she felt “very conflicted” about attending Sturday's gathering because of pandemic restrictions, but in the end "just felt that I needed to be here.”“I'm really pleased that there are a lot of men here. I hope that this is kind of an opportunity for men to learn how women feel, how vulnerable we are," Clarke said. “I hope that this is the start of justice being served for Sarah.”The Metropolitan Police has expressed shock and horror that one of its own was a suspect in the case. The London police force said Couzens joined its ranks in 2018 and most recently served in the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, an armed unit responsible for guarding embassies in the capital and Parliament.During his court appearance earlier in the day, Couzens stood wearing a gray tracksuit as the charges were read to him. He was remanded into custody and has another appearance scheduled Tuesday at London's Central Criminal Court.Everard was last seen walking home from a friend's apartment in south London at about 10:30 p.m. on March 3. Her body was found hidden in an area of woodland in Kent, more than 50 miles southeast of London, on Wednesday. A post-mortem examination is underway, police said Friday.TV and radio presenter Sandi Toksvig said at the start of a vigil held online that a “cultural shift about how women are viewed and treated both in the public and private space” was needed.“I am filled in equal measure with profound sorrow and rage, and I know there are many who share this rage, and I think it is entirely justifiable," Toksvig said. "But I also know that it will harm rather than help us if we don't try and direct that anger to good purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-protesters-clash-as-hundreds-gather-for-sarah-everard-in-uk-101615681032105.html

They have said they plan to meet in person later in the year.The leaders had launched launch a 'Vaccine Initiative' under which India would produce up to 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022, financed by the US and Japan, for last-mile distribution by Australia in the South-East Asian nations of the Indo-Pacific“Over the course of these past months, each of us has grieved the suffering that our people and the world have endured. But in this dark hour, our partnership offers a spark of hope to light the path ahead,” the leaders wrote in the joint Op-Ed published in the Washington Post.“We summon from tragedy the strength and resilience to unify and overcome. And we recommit ourselves, once again, to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure and prosperous,” they added.The article listed the announcements made on Friday, and much of what appeared in the joint statement and the fact sheet that were released after the summit. It also recalled the history of the grouping from being founded in the aftermath of the 2004 Tsunami and being turned into a dialogue in 2007 to being reborn in 2017.The leaders described the Quad as a “flexible group of like-minded partners dedicated to advancing a common vision and to ensuring peace and prosperity”. And the member countries, the leaders added, were “a group of democratic nations dedicated to delivering results through practical cooperation”.Since the 2004 Tsunami, the world has come to face other challenges such as climate change, which has grown more perilous; new technologies, which have “revolutionized our daily lives”, geopolitics which has become ever more complex, and a pandemic that has devastated the world”, they wrote, adding, “Against this backdrop, we are recommitting to a shared vision for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, resilient and inclusive.”The leaders also wrote about the Quad Vaccine Experts Group, which they had announced Friday to support cooperation in the long term. They also reiterated their commitment to cooperating as a group to combat climate change and deal with emerging technologies, which will be led by the Quad Climate Working Group and the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group.But they will not be an insular group and will work with other countries and groups. “We welcome and will seek opportunities to work with all of those who share in those goals,” they wrote. Other countries and groups of countries have expressed the desire to work with the Quad, which was discussed at the summit but decision were taken, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-modi-morrison-and-suga-pen-joint-op-ed-say-quad-offers-spark-of-hope-101615669643690.html

Criticising the handling of Michel’s case by the governments of the UAE and India, the report said both countries should “accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”.Even before the formal release of the report, the external affairs ministry last month rejected the group’s reported findings and said the conclusions were based on “limited information, biased allegations from an unidentified source and on an inaccurate understanding of India’s criminal justice system”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the report. The WGAD said: “In the current context of the global Covid-19 pandemic and the threat that it poses in places of detention, the Working Group calls upon the Government of India to take urgent action to ensure the immediate release of Mr Michel.” It concluded that Michel’s detention violated both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and referred his case to the UN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expert-panel-seeks-release-of-agusta-case-accused-christian-michel-101615666957632.html
14-03-2021||World||India to review AstraZeneca shot side effects next week||India will carry out a deeper review of post-vaccination side effects from the AstraZeneca shot next week although no cases of blood clots have been reported so far, an official told AFP Saturday.New Delhi decided to conduct the review after several countries suspended rollout over blood clot fears even as the World Health Organization said there was no reason to stop using AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jab.Denmark, Norway and Iceland paused use of the drugmaker's shot as a precaution after isolated reports of recipients developing blood clots."We are looking at all the adverse events, particularly serious adverse events like deaths and hospitalisation. We will come back if we find anything of concern," N.K. Arora, a member of India's national task force on Covid-19, told AFP.India has given at least 28 million shots in its vast vaccination programme, most of them AstraZeneca's which are produced at the Serum Institute of India.New Delhi has also gifted and allowed exports of millions of these jabs to around 70 countries over the last few weeks as a part of its vaccine diplomacy.Arora said there was "no immediate issue of concern as number of adverse events (in India) is very, very low. We are relooking at (adverse events that were reported) to see if there was any issue of blood clotting.""As of yesterday there were 59 or 60 deaths, and they were all coincidental," the doctor said, adding hospitalisation cases were being re-examined."In fact there is a real effort from our side that once complete investigation is done, to put its results in public domain, on the ministry of health website," Arora added.India has been using AstraZeneca and indigenous vaccine giant Bharat Biotech's Covaxin in its rapidly expanding vaccination drive at home.At least two million people were vaccinated on Friday alone, and this ramp up comes at a time when Covid-19 cases are rising across different Indian states after weeks of decline.The western state of Maharashtra has announced fresh restrictions and a week-long lockdown in one of its big cities, Nagpur, after the recent spike across the region.Fresh restrictions including curbs on movement and public gatherings were also reintroduced in some pockets of the state, which is also expected to impact the economic recovery in its industrial belt."Some states in the country have been reporting very high number of daily new Covid cases. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu continue to report a surge in Covid daily cases," the health ministry said in a statement on Friday.India had registered 23,285 new cases in the last 24 hours, with the six states accounting for 85.6 percent of the new infections, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-reviews-astrazeneca-side-effects-after-concerns-in-europe-101615624583358.html
14-03-2021||India||YSRCP sweeps Andhra local body elections||Hyderabad The ruling YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh on Sunday won 10 out of the 11 municipal corporations after the March 10 elections. The party was also leading in Vijayawada where the votes were still being counted. The YSRCP also won 73 out of 75 municipalities and nagar panchayats. In four of the municipalities – Pulivendula, Punganur, Macherla and Piduguralla – the party’s candidates were elected unopposed. The opposition Telugu Desam Party drew a blank in the municipal corporations and won just two municipalities – Tadipatri in Anantapur district and Mydukur in Kadapa district -- with small margin. The YSRCP, however, said that the party will capture the Tadipatri and Mydukur municipalities with the votes of co-option members. State municipal administration minister Botsa Satyanarayana said, “We shall not allow the TDP to rule any municipality in the state.”“It is a historic win for the YSRC and an endorsement of the welfare schemes taken up by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government,” senior YSRCP leader Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said.The Congress failed to win even a single ward. The BJP-Jana Sena combine also failed to register victory in any ward or division.The TDP, which was aiming to regain the ground it lost in the 2019 general elections, suffered a huge setback as the party. Ahead of the elections, party president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu campaigned extensively, banking on the ongoing agitation against the privatisation of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and the strong sentiment in favour of Amaravati being retained as the state’s capital. However, the TDP lost heavily in these districts. In Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, the TDP could win only in 30 out of 98 divisions, while the YSRC won 58 divisions. In Vijayawada, which Naidu developed as part of Amaravati, the YSRC won 23 seats in 64-member corporation, while the TDP won just eight seats. Even in Guntur, the hotbed of agitation for Amaravati capital city, the YSRC won 44 out of the 57 divisions. The TDP won just nine divisions. “The victory in Viskahapatnam, Guntur and Vijayawada municipal corporations is a clear indication that the people have endorsed the chief minister’s decision to form the three capitals for the state with executive capital at Visakhapatnam,” YSRC general secretary and MP V Vijay Sai Reddy said. Following the announcement of the votes, TDP spokesman Varla Ramaiah accused the YSRCP of misusing election machinery to win the elections. “It has completely bulldozed the elections, misused the official machinery, used the ward volunteers as party workers, spent thousands of crores and cared a damn for the state election commission,” he alleged. The counting was suspended in the Eluru municipal corporation following a high court direction due to an election petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrcp-sweeps-andhra-local-body-elections-101615746467970.html

At the same time, he has a huge fan base in China and also maintains good interactions with fans from all over the country,” the fan club said in a message ahead of the event.While earlier events organised by the club were held both online and offline, this year was the first time that “a+” held Khan’s birthday event at the Indian embassy.Though his Chinese fans will love it, it remains to be seen if Khan can visit China ahead of his next release “Laal Singh Chaddha”, a remake of the critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning “Forrest Gump”, later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-strained-lac-ties-cultural-bridge-aamir-khan-s-chinese-fans-ring-in-his-56th-birthday-101615746408045.html
14-03-2021||India||AIADMK pledges free houses, opposes CAA||ChennaiThe ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) released its election manifesto on Sunday to seek a third consecutive term in Tamil Nadu’s April 6 assembly elections by promising free washing machines, offering dual citizenship to Sri Lankan refugees and pledging free housing to people.The AIADMK, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it would urge the Centre to scrap the Citizenship Amendment Act and work to bring education to the state list from the concurrent list of the Constitution.While the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has vowed to abolish the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), the AIADMK has offered providing training to students appearing for competitive exams such as NEET, UPSC and JEE. NEET is an emotional issue in the state as several students have died by suicide either because they failed to clear the exam or they feared they couldn’t realise their aspirations of studying medicine.The AIADMK manifesto, coming a day after the DMK released its poll promises, bore several similarities. Both parties have tried to appeal to youngsters, women and the Tamil sentiment. They have promised waiving education loans, providing milk for school students and making Tamil a compulsory language.Increase in maternity leave for women government employees from nine months to one year and construction of new buildings with modern medical facilities for about 2,000 Amma Mini Clinics also found mention in the AIADMK manifesto.To those who don’t own houses, the government has promised building and providing houses free of cost in rural and urban areas under the ‘Amma Illam Thittam’ (Amma Housing Scheme) and interest on housing loans availed from cooperative housing societies would be waived on loan repayment.It also said that ₹1,500 per month would be disbursed to all ration card holders and the amount would be credited to bank accounts of woman family heads, senior AIADMK leader C Ponnaiyan said.While the DMK retained its 2016 assembly poll promise of free tablets with internet for students, the AIADMK has promised 2G data to students. The AIADMK has also promised to lower fuel prices.While the DMK promised to enact a law to reserve 75% jobs for Tamils in the public sector and pursue it in the private sector, the AIADMK also promised a government job for every family that doesn’t have one person employed in the public sector. The manifesto reiterated that reservation in public education and jobs will be allotted based on the report of the caste-based census. Keeping the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils alive, the AIADMK manifesto promised steps to ensure dual citizenship and voting rights for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. “Both manifestos are meant to attract voters which they have but compared to the DMK’s manifesto, the AIADMK has more sops,” said J Jeyaranjan, who researches political economy of Tamil Nadu.After releasing the manifesto at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the party has ensured protection for farmers and students through loan waivers even before the election. The DMK’s key campaign against the incumbent has been a charge that the ruling government didn’t protect rural students who were at a disadvantage competing at a common national test. Chief minister Palaniswami introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for government students who clear NEET.While the DMK swept the 2011 polls when late M Karunanidhi promised free colour television sets for all, the AIADMK has this year promised free cable connection provided by the state Arasu Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmkpledges-free-houses-opposes-caa-101615746347475.html
14-03-2021||India||BJP fields 4 MPs, TMC defectors||Kolkata The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday named Union minister of state Babul Supriyo, two other Lok Sabha members and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta alongside four actors and several former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders in its list of candidates for the third and fourth phases of the Bengal assembly elections.The party named 63 candidates; 27 for the third phase and 36 for the fourth phase. The polls will be held on April 6 and 10, respectively. The state has 294 constituencies. The party did not name four candidates for the third phase and eight candidates for the fourth phase.Supriyo has been fielded from the Tollygunge seat in south Kolkata where the TMC has fielded current incumbent and minster Aroop Biswas. Dasgupta, a nominated Rajya Sabha member, has been fielded from Tarakeswar in Hooghly district against the TMC’s Ramendu Sinha Roy.Senior journalist Rantideb Sengupta, the editor of one of the mouthpieces of the right-wing camp, refused to contest after he was fielded from the Howrah south constituency. “I was not consulted. I only want to campaign,” Sengupta said. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls unsuccessfully. Sengupta changed his mind later in the day after calls from senior party leaders.Subir Nag, former president of the BJP’s Hooghly district unit, said he would like to step out of politics for a while after the BJP central leadership in Delhi named Locket Chatterjee, the MP from Hooghly Lok Sabha constituency in Hooghly district, as candidate for the Chinsurah seat against the TMC’s Asit Majumdar. “Probably the leadership is not satisfied with my performance,” Nag said. “The BJP is a party where people follow the directions that come from the top. We will win all 18 seats in Hooghly district,” said Chatterjee. The announcements were made by BJP national general secretary Arun Singh and Union minister of state Debasree Chaudhuri, the MP from Raigunj in north Bengal. Alongside Supriyo, the MP from Asansol in West Burdwan district, Nisith Pramanik, the Lok Sabha member from Cooch Behar constituency in Cooch Behar district, has also been named as a candidate.While Supriyo is a two-time MP, Chatterjee and Pramanik went to the Lok Sabha in 2019 when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. Pramanik will contest from Dinhata against the TMC’s Udayan Guha, who was a minister during the Left Front era and left his party, the Forward Bloc, to join the TMC in 2011. The BJP fielded four actors, some of who joined the party less than a month ago. Yash Dasgupta, a young and popular star, who joined the BJP on February 18 has been fielded from Chanditala in Hooghly district against the TMC’s two-time MLA Swati Khandokar. “I have been given a huge responsibility. I am a bit nervous too,” said Dasgupta. Actor Tanusree Chakraborty, who joined the BJP a week ago, has been fielded along with actors Anjana Basu and Payel Sarkar. Sarkar joined the BJP on February 25. She will contest from Behala East against the TMC’s Ratna Chatterjee, the estranged wife of the ruling party’s former mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Chatterjee is now the BJP’s poll observer for the Kolkata zone. Former minster Rajib Banerjee has been fielded from the Domjur seat in Howrah district from where he had won twice. Prabir Ghosal, the TMC MLA from Hooghly’s Uttarpara seat, who joined the BJP along with Banerjee, has been fielded from the same seat. Similarly, octogenarian Rabindranath Bhattacharya, the TMC’s sitting MLA from Singur in Hooghly district, who joined the BJP on not being nominated, will contest the adjoining Haripal seat.“Fielding as many as four sitting MPs in an assembly poll is unprecedented in Bengal and surprising at the same time. This was probably done to address the discontent among old-timers of the BJP whose differences with leaders who defected from the TMC in recent months is well known,” said Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay. TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “The lists expose the bankruptcy of the BJP. A party fields a Rajya Sabha member and three Lok Sabha members in state elections only when it cannot find candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-fields-4-mps-tmc-defectors-101615746292891.html
14-03-2021||India||UP cops probe ‘assault’ on journos by Akhilesh||Lucknow Moradabad Police on Sunday began a probe into a case of rioting against Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav over an alleged incident of violence against a group of journalists in the district on March 10.A police team visited the spot of the alleged attack and recorded the statement of the staff present there. “The case is being investigated by a team of local police headed by the station house officer (SHO). The team has also collected the CCTV footage of the place. The statements of the concerned parties are being recorded,” superintendent of police (city) of Moradabad Amit Kumar Anand said. Yadav and 20 unidentified party workers were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the FIR filed on the basis of a complaint by the journalists on Saturday. According to news agency PTI, the FIR claimed that Yadav was irked by a few personal questions posed by some journalists during an interaction with him at a hotel, following which he allegedly instigated his security guards and aides to attack the journalists.Taking to Twitter, Yadav said: “Today, the manner in which the Constitution is being attacked, false cases are being registered against party leaders and physical assaults are taking place after probes by agencies are an adverse effect of the BJP’s violent political thought. Those who level allegations against others of running a syndicate are in fact themselves running a ‘sanghicate’.”A counter-FIR was filed against one Ubaid-ur-Rehman and Fareed Samsi, believed to be journalists, by SP Moradabad district president Jaibir Singh Yadav. The case was filed under sections 160 (committing affray), 353 (deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. Condemning the FIR against his party chief, SP leader Shafiqur Rahman Barq said: “The FIR is equivalent to a fake FIR. Yadav ji is our president. This move by the complainants is not acceptable. Instead of covering his press conference, the media is busy covering his FIR-related stories. Yadav ji too has lodged an FIR against the complainants.” Barq added that the party will stage a protest against the FIR in the coming days. In an attack on the SP chief, Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister and BJP leader Keshav Prasad Maurya said: “The SP has crossed all limits by attacking journalists for asking questions. Akhilesh Yadav ji, the violence against journalists in your presence is condemnable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-probe-assault-on-journos-by-akhilesh-101615746167421.html

14-03-2021||India||CM Thackeray responsible for the Sachin Waze episode, says Maharashtra BJP chief||Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Chandrakant Patil on Sunday held Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray responsible for the entire Sachin Waze episode.Speaking to the reporters, Patil said, "It is extremely shameful that a police officer who was till yesterday strongly defended by the chief minister of our state has today been arrested by the National Investigation Agency in a terror conspiracy case. Do you (Uddhav Thackeray) even realise that your public statements in favour of a tainted officer have perhaps done irreparable damage to the reputation of our state?""I can't really understand why Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had defended Shiv Sainik Sachin Waze this brazenly. Any political party in our democratic setup first pledges allegiance to our constitution and then seeks public support, but here was Shiv Sena supporting those who wanted to harm industrialists and destroy peace in society," the BJP leader said.He further stated, "There are many questions to which Mansukh Hiran's family and the people of Maharashtra seek answers. Why was Waze being supported to the hilt? Which ministers, MLAs and political leaders knew of the entire episode and still chose to remain silent? Which police officers knew of it all and remained silent?""Bear in mind that this is not just a murder case. This is a terror attack case where a police officer has been found involved in the financial capital of the country. The people have full faith in Maharashtra Police, Mumbai Police and the NIA and hope that the true masterminds behind this will be unmasked soon," said Patil here today.Certain police officers need to focus on reducing crimes especially against women in the state rather than trying to cover up a terror conspiracy or shielding those suspected in murder cases, he added.Sachin Waze, who was Assistant Police Inspector in the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) and later transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre at Mumbai Police Headquarters after his name came up in Mansukh Hiran death case, has been sent to NIA custody till March 25, in connection with his role and involvement in placing an explosives-laden vehicle near Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai on February 25.On February 25, a car carrying unassembled explosive materials was found abandoned at Carmichael Road in South Mumbai on February 25, near the house of Mukesh Ambani.The owner of the vehicle, Mansukh Hiran, was found dead in a creek in Thane last week. Now, ATS Maharashtra is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-thackeray-responsible-for-the-sachin-waze-episode-says-maharashtra-bjp-chief-101615741002727.html
14-03-2021||India||Follow safety measures to avoid another lockdown: Karnataka CM Yediyurappa||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday said that he would be forced to announce another lockdown if people did not cooperate and take safety precautions against the spread of Covid-19.“For the last one month, Covid-19 is getting beyond control and numbers are going up. I have called a meeting with experts on Monday. I have just one request that if you (people) do not want a lockdown, if all activities should continue like now, people should cooperate,” Yediyurappa said.The statements come on a day when Karnataka reported 934 new Covid-19 cases (on Saturday) of which Bengaluru accounts for 628 positive cases and two deaths, taking its total number of active cases to 6107 and death toll to 4519, according to government data.Bengaluru is among the ten worst-hit districts in the country with 6017 active cases.CM Yediyurappa has convened a meeting with experts in Bengaluru on Monday where he is expected to discuss measures to contain the growing spread of the coronavirus which continues to remain a potent threat in India’s IT capital and other large cities.“From now on, we will fix the total number of people at weddings, events and other places,” he said, adding that the government will come down heavily on those who violate these provisions.Though Karnataka was one of the most impacted states till almost the end of last year, government data showed a significant decline in cases since then. However, the rise in cases has sparked fears of a possible second wave in one of the most populated cities in the country where safety measures like physical distancing, masks and washing hands or sanitising them are followed by few.Senior ministers and bureaucrats have warned of a relapse into another lockdown if Covid-19 protocols are violated.In the last one week, Bengaluru has recorded 3175 new cases of the total 4945 across the state.The deaths per million (as on March 13) in Bengaluru is 469.4 as against the state average of 177.0, that emphasises the surge in Karnataka's capital.However, politicians are among the biggest violators of these safety procedures as they continue to host large gatherings, organise protests and even invite thousands to marriages within the family.Bengaluru also has 10,203 people in active quarantine. But poor data collection and lack of random testing and other factors have added to the challenges in fighting the virus, according to the government.The city administration has mooted proposals to conduct tests at markets, malls and marriage halls among other places where large crowds gather.According to the Covid-19 state war room data, there were 37,820 tests per million conducted in Bengaluru in the last 10 days as against 10,356 across the state.The state has also successfully vaccinated (first and second dose) to over 13.40 lakh people, data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-safety-measures-to-avoid-another-lockdown-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-101615740591231.html

They will be moving from door-to-door to motivate the beneficiaries to get the doses of the vaccine administered,” he said.The Department of Social Justice and Empowerment has several schemes running for the senior citizens, and already has a database in this regard, he said.“The vaccine is also being administered at Health Sub Centres located in the villages across the state,” Arora said.Divulging details of the present status of the ongoing vaccination drive, Mission Director, National Health Mission, Haryana, Prabhjot Singh said till March 13, first dose of the vaccine has been administered to 1.68 lakh Health Care Workers (HCWs) and 97,410 HCWs have been administered the second dose.He said 83,338 Frontline Workers (FLWs) have been given the first dose.

14-03-2021||India||65% voters exercise franchise in Telangana MLC elections; polling peaceful||Nearly 65 per cent of voters exercised their franchise in the elections to the two vacant seats in the Telangana state legislative council from graduates’ constituencies on Sunday.The polling percentage in Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar graduates’ constituency was 64.87 per cent, it was around 65 per cent in Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda constituency at the closing hour of polling at 4 pm.In all, 10,36,565 graduates including 3,67,808 women were enrolled as voters in the elections for the two MLC seats in these six districts. Polling took place in 1,530 polling stations in these districts.“The polling percentage is extremely satisfactory. There were still a large number of voters at the polling stations in both the constituencies and they would be allowed to cast their vote. This might increase the polling percentage slightly,” Telangana chief electoral officer Shashank Goel said.Goel said the polling was by and large peaceful, barring stray incidents of clashes between the cadres of the two different political parties. At Nellikuduru town of Mahabubabad district, the Bharatiya Janata Party alleged that its candidate G Premender Reddy was assaulted by the activists of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, when he opposed distribution of money by the TRS among voters at a function hall. Reddy was shifted to a private hospital in Khammam town.Senior TRS leader and panchayat raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao, however, denied the BJP leaders’ allegations. “Reddy was not assaulted at all. They are enacting a drama to gain sympathy,” he said.The chief electoral officer said he had received a complaint from the BJP on the alleged attack on its candidate. “We have called for a report from the district administration and shall take appropriate action,” he said.All India Congress Committee spokesperson Dasoju Sravan alleged that the TRS had resorted to large-scale violation of election rules during the MLC elections. He demanded action against state home minister Md Mahmood Ali, who openly divulged the candidate’s name he had voted for.He also alleged that the chief electoral officer had remained blind to the blatant violation of norms by TRS leaders, who had displayed party flags, flex boards, caps and scarfs at various polling stations. The CEO did not take any action though videos of the TRS leaders distributing money went viral on social media.“Shashank Goel is a representative of the Election Commission of India, but he was acting as an agent of TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao,” he alleged.TRS working president and state industries minister K T Rama Rao thanked the party workers and leaders who worked hard in the electioneering. He also thanked the voters for their overwhelming response to his call to exercise their franchise in these crucial elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/65-voters-exercise-franchise-in-telangana-mlc-elections-polling-peaceful-101615732513753.html

Humans get hungry two times a day, 700 times a year. When the food grains will be in their control, they will start the hunger business," Tikait said.He said in places in Rajasthan and Haryana, land was being bought by businessmen for paltry sums, and massive godowns, with storage capacities of 14 lakh metric tons, had come up, after which the Centre's new farm laws came in."This means this government at the Centre is not run by a party, but by businessmen. It is not only farmers who are in trouble, the railways are being sold, but the opposition is weak, and young people who should have opposed such moves are sleeping," Tikait claimed.He asked people to come out and protest at the district level to get the new laws repealed, adding that farmers must sit at the collectorate and ensure their wheat is sold at ₹1,975 per quintal.Tikait is scheduled to address a farmers' rally in Jabalpur on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-government-is-run-by-businessmen-cashing-in-on-people-s-hunger-rakesh-tikait-101615731910740.html

He belongs to Hisawda village of the district.He said that he had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah about the ongoing farmers' agitation but it remained unresolved.Visibly perturbed over the stir, he said that a governor was supposed to be quiet on certain issues but “I went against this norm because I am also the son of a farmer and understand the pain and problems of farmers.”He said that he opposed the arrest of farmers and advised the government not to use force against them but ensure that they did not go back empty-handed.The farmers’ protests against three farm laws have been raging for more than a hundred days.“The farmers' demands are genuine and the government must listen to them,” Malik said.Western Uttar Pradesh has been one of the regions from which many farmers had headed to the border with Delhi to stage their protests.He also recalled his tenure as governor of Jammu and Kashmir when Article 370 was repealed. He appreciated the decision of the Modi government and said that a better kind of democracy was established there after conducting panchayat elections.Malik (75), who was transferred as governor of Meghalaya in August last year dropped a hint that he may not be in that post for long.“I don't know how long I will remain in the Raj Bhawan," he said, and added that he would write books after retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-demands-are-genuine-govt-must-listen-says-meghalaya-governor-sp-malik-101615731430232.html

There has been a steady rise in the number of infections in all districts in Maharashtra, but Nagpur stands conspicuously as the district is reporting more daily cases than Pune, Mumbai — believed to be busier districts than Nagpur. With an unabated rise in the number of daily infections, Nagpur is Maharashtra's first district to bring back lockdown.Here is how Nagpur came to the lockdown situation> The district has been reporting around 1,900 new Covid-19 infections daily in the past few days.> According to the Union health ministry's data, this is the district with the second-highest active Covid-19 cases in India. The first is Pune. The active number of cases refer to the number of people who are presently infection with the disease.> Pune has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the country, but its daily rise is lower than Nagpur. On Sunday, Pune recorded 1,780 fresh Covid-19 cases.> What is being called the second wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra started from the Vidarbha region and Nagpur being in this region saw no exception. Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal — other districts of this region — went for restrictions in February itself when the spike was detected. Nagpur too had imposed weekend restrictions in February. But cases did not come down after the weekend lockdown.> An overall disregard to Covid-19 rules, pandemic fatigue, crowding are being blamed for the rise of cases. These are applicable to Nagpur as well. In fact, ahead of the lockdown from March 15, people were seen flocking to liquor stores flouting social distancing norms.As Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has clarified, the government is not in favour of bringing back a complete lockdown.

14-03-2021||India||Congress raises concern over spike in Covid-19 cases, asks govt to scale up vaccination drive||Raising concerns over the recent surge in coronavirus cases, the Congress on Sunday demanded that the government speed up the nationwide vaccination campaign and asked what was its strategy to complete the drive within 12 months.Citing Chhattisgarh's demand of more Covishield doses, the opposition party also urged the government to decentralise the vaccination drive and provide adequate vaccines to the states.India on Sunday recorded 25,320 Covid-19 infections, the highest daily rise in 84 days, taking the case tally to 1,13,59,048, according to Union health ministry data. Also, the death toll increased to 1,58,607 with 161 new fatalities, the highest in 44 days.Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil raised concerns over the rising coronavirus cases and said experts have stated that another wave of Covid-19 is starting."The government is trying to hide facts by giving a maze of vaccination figures. If you look at the government's claim of total vaccinations till now, it is 2,82,18,457. If you look at the 11 days of March, it is 95,90,594. Of the over 135 crore people in the country, only 1.5 per cent have got vaccines, including those who have got just the first dose," Gohil said.Only 47.29 lakh have got both doses of vaccines which means only 0.35 vaccination has been done, he said."By this rate 70 per cent people will get vaccinated in 12.6 years. For 100 per cent vaccination, it will take 18 years. We have vaccines, enough of it is there. Why is the government not giving it?" he posed and accused the government of being busy in elections and not caring for the people.Raising questions from the Narendra Modi government, Gohil asked that with experts and scientists suggesting the emergence of various coronavirus mutants, has the government scaled up genome sequencing to identify newer variants. "What is the government's plan to complete nationwide vaccination within 12 months and not 13, 16 or 18 years," he asked.Gohil also asked whether the government was conducting faster and sufficient RT-PCR tests."As it has been established worldwide, test, track and isolate is the gold standard to fight coronavirus. Is the Modi government pursuing it in the right direction?" he askedGohil also demanded that journalists, delivery persons, and government servants who were engaged in essential services be considered a priority group for vaccination. He also demanded decentralisation of the vaccination programme and scaling it up on priority. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers getting inoculated and vaccination of the frontline workers started from February 2.The next phase of Covid-19 vaccination commenced on March 1 for those who are above 60 years and for people aged 45 and above with specified comorbid conditions.Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield are the two vaccines that are being administered in the country. According to the health ministry, over 2.91 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-raises-concern-over-spike-in-covid-19-cases-asks-govt-to-scale-up-vaccination-drive-101615728414975.html

She was accompanied by other senior district officials and unfurled a red flag atop the temple.Mahant Rajinder Giri of the temple was also present on the occasion.Chanting religious hymns, thousands of devotees offered foodgrain, cash and ghee on the occasion.Women paid their respects to Baba Balak Nath from a platform raised for them and men were allowed to go to the holy cave to offer prayers.The deputy commissioner said necessary arrangements have been made for smooth “darshans” at the shrine as lakhs of people from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are expected to visit the place.“There are eight inns in the temple's vicinity, more or less adequate to accommodate the pilgrims. Over a million pilgrims from Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh and abroad are expected to visit the temple during the fair,” she said.The temple will remain open round the clock till the ending of the fair, the deputy commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himachal-month-long-chaitra-fair-begins-in-hamirpur-s-deotsidh-101615727366419.html

Earlier in the day, when asked if Pawar was upset with Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and sought his removal, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut in Mumbai said, “Pawar is the guiding light of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). It was because of him that this (Maharashtra) government was formed.”The NCP president also said Maharashtra has not seen a governor like Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who has not followed the responsibility given by the Constitution.To a question on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari not clearing names recommended by the state cabinet for nomination as MLCs under the governor's quota, Pawar said, it is the responsibility of the governor to implement the cabinet's recommendation.“In the history of Maharashtra, the state has not seen a governor who has not followed the responsibility given by the Constitution. However, the present governor has done that magic, which is unfortunate,” he said.Pawar said when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, the latter had complained about hurdles being created by the then governor.“Today, the same thing is happening in Maharashtra and the Centre is merely a spectator, which is worrying,” said the NCP chief.Pawar on Sunday claimed that barring Assam, the BJP will face defeat in four other poll-bound states and the election trend in the five states will give a new direction to the country. Pawar was speaking to reporters at his hometown Baramati.The NCP chief, whose party is an alliance partner of the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government, also accused the Centre of misusing its power in poll-bound West Bengal. The Assembly elections in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Puducherry (Union Territory) will be held in March-April this year and votes will be counted on May 2.“...It is wrong to talk about results of the five states today as people of these states will take the decision. As far as Kerala is concerned, the Left parties and the NCP have come together and we are sure that we will get a clear- cut majority,” he said.In Tamil Nadu, people will support DMK and its chief MK Stalin, and they will come to power in the state after the polls, the former Union minister said.“In West Bengal, the Centre, especially the BJP is misusing power and trying to attack a sister (referring to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) who is trying to fight for the people of the state,” the NCP chief alleged.The entire state has rallied around Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee since it is a matter of Bengali pride and self-respect, he said.“I have no doubt that the TMC will retain power under the leadership of Banerjee,” he said. Pawar further said he knows the situation in poll- bound Assam, and as per the inputs received from his party people, the BJP, which is currently in power there, is in a “good position” compared to others.“In a nutshell, the BJP will retain power in Assam, but will face defeat in other poll-bound states, and other political parties in those states will come to power. I am confident this trend will give a new direction to the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-issue-says-sharad-pawar-on-vaze-s-arrest-criticises-governor-koshyari-101615726932522.html
14-03-2021||India||Farmers’ stir may continue till December, says BKU leader Rakesh Tikait||The Bhartiya Kisan Union-led farmer agitation against the three central farm laws may continue till December this year, the outfit national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said here on Sunday. Tikait made the statement while talking to reporters here after his recent visit to the poll-bund West Bengal.“This agitation possibly will stretch up to November or December this year,” he said. Talking about his West Bengal visit, Tikait said during their poll campaigning there, the central government people have been asking farmers to give them one feastful of rice.“I have advised Bengal farmers to ask grain seekers to fix an MSP of ₹1850 per quintal for paddy before giving them a single grain of rice,” Tikait told reporters here. He said after Bengal, he was planning to visit other parts of the country to press for the enactment of a law guaranteeing an MSP for various crops.“In Bihar, the paddy is currently being bought by traders at an abysmally low rate of ₹750 to ₹800 per quintal. I want a law guaranteeing the minimum support price for various crops,” said Tikait. He said he was not going to sit in Delhi alone but was planning to visit all over the country, including Madhya Pradesh on March 14 and 15, Ganga Nagar in Rajasthan on March 17, Ghazipur’s UP Gate border in Delhi on March 18, Odisha on March 19 and Karnataka on March 21 and 22.During his visit here, Tikait also garlanded a statue of his late father and farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait at Tikait Park in Jhalwa near here. The BKU spokesperson claimed the three central laws will lead to the closure of all small-time neighbourhood shops, leaving only big commercial malls to survive.“These farm laws will ruin traders and lead to the closure of small business utilities and the collapse of small industries. These laws will bring in big multinational firms like Walmart," claimed Tikait. “Had this government belonged to a political party, it would have talked to farmers and resolved the matter,” Tikait said. “But this government is being run by big business houses. It is bent upon selling the entire country,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-may-continue-till-december-says-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-101615727100205.html

They also claimed that a wheel and jack of a car were found from the spot. They allegedly tied him to an electricity pole and beat him brutally.After getting information of the incident, police rushed to the spot around 3 am on Sunday but Mubarak had died by then. The body was brought to the police station.“The body has been sent for postmortem and we have started investigation into the matter,” said Ranchi’s superintendent of police (rural) Naushad Alam.Mubarak’s elder brother Tabarak Khan has lodged a complaint of murder against 19 named persons and 15-25 unknown persons at Angara police station.Alam said, “We have also detained few people in this regard and they are being interrogated.”He said prima facie it doesn’t seem to be a case of theft but some kind of a dispute. “The locals claimed that wheel and battery of a bike was being stolen. But it is doubtful. Will somebody come on a bike to steal wheel and battery of another bike in a neighbouring village? Why would he take risk of being caught by opening the wheel and battery in somebody’s house? Had he been a thief, he would have rather stolen the bike as it was unlocked,” Alam said.The SP said, “We suspect there had been any internal dispute. However, anything concrete could be said only after investigation is completed.”Meanwhile, villagers ghearoed the Angara police station demanding immediate arrest of the accused behind the murder. They were also demanding compensation for the family of Mubarak.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Silli, Christopher Kerketta said, “Mubarak has two children and wife. His wife is ill.”When asked if Mubarak had any criminal records, Kerketta said, “We have not so far found any trace of criminal record of him.”This was the second lynching incident in a week in Ranchi district. On March 8, a 22-year-old youth, identified as Sachin Verma, accused of stealing a mini-truck from Ranchi’s wholesale market, was lynched by labourers.Jharkhand’s mob lynching incidents have hit the national headlines several times. The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) claimed that a total of 29 people were lynched by mob in Jharkhand from March 2016 to September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-lynch-man-after-accusing-him-of-theft-near-ranchi-101615725492653.html

The NIA produced him before the special NIA court on Sunday afternoon and sought his custody for further investigation.The prosecution asked for Vaze’s maximum custody for further investigation. The agency pleaded that the case has so far traveled by three agencies- Mumbai Crime Branch, ATS and later NIA. Hence they would want to probe the role played by the accused.The prosecution, however, refused to share the copy of remand application with the lawyers of Vaze citing privilege and confidentiality.Vaze’s lawyer Sudeep Passbola objected to it and claimed that the agency has no evidence to implicate the police officer.On the right to have access to the remand application, the court will hear the defence team's (Vaze) arguments on MondayA senior officer said that NIA has also seized an Innova car from Motor transport (MT) department situated in Nagapada bearing the registration number MH01- ZA- 403 which was seen escorting the Scorpio SUV found parked near Ambani’s residence Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks. The Innova was used with fake number plate and later it was parked in Motor transport department, Nagpada for repair.NIA officials visited the MT department at night and the Innova was confiscated brought to NIA office in South Mumbai around 3 am on Sunday.At the time of his arrest a top NIA official told HT, "Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive-laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25."Vaze was the lead investigator in the case before the investigation was handed over to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and then to the NIA, The NIA recorded Vaze’s statement to find out the sequence of events as he was initially heading the probe and also for his connection to the man linked to the vehicle found with 20 gelatin sticks near the billionaire’s residence in Mumbai.Vaze was named in a statement to police by Vimla Hiran, the widow of Thane’s Mansukh Hiran, who claimed ownership of the vehicle parked outside Ambani’s house and was later found dead in a creek on March 5. The 48-year-old auto parts dealer’s widow told the police that the explosives-laden Scorpio belonged to one Dr Peter Newton and had been with them for the past three years.She said that Hiran lent the SUV to Vaze in November 2020 and the vehicle was sent back to his shop in Thane on February 5. It has been alleged that Vaze was also forcing the Thane businessman to take the blame for the case on him and surrender to the police.On Friday, the Thane sessions court had rejected Vaze’s anticipatory bail application and set March 19 as the next date of hearing in connection with a separate case registered by the ATS in Hiran’s suspected murder last week.People familiar with the developments said Vaze has also moved an application in the Bombay high court challenging the grounds of his arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-gets-sachin-vaze-s-custody-till-march-25-in-ambani-security-care-probe-101615722273558.html

His goal is to ensure that the BJP is defeated," Yadav said."We have come with one message that the BJP should be ousted for the way it has treated farmers and taken decisions against their interests and welfare," the Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader said.Yadav said that he had met Gogoi in jail in February last year and his health condition has deteriorated considerably since then."He has been subjected to considerable mental torture and his medical condition has deteriorated but still the ideological clarity, mental resolve and the courage shown by him is a model," he said.Yadav alleged that Gogoi has been put in jail to ensure that he cannot interact with the people during the elections."This is not a criminal trial but a political trial," he alleged.Yadav said that he had not gone to discuss politics but Gogoi was very interested to know how the farmers' agitation was progressing and was very clear about the urgent need to defeat the BJP.Sunilam alleged that the way NIA is investigating the cases against Gogoi it appears that they are acting at the behest of the government."It is obvious that false cases have been slapped against him to silence peoples' voice, which he represents, but now that the elections are here, the people of the state must make a decision," he said.He appealed to the Congress to reconsider their decision of fielding a candidate against Gogoi.Sunilam said that he would go to Sibsagar to campaign for Gogoi.Gogoi was arrested in December 2019 during the protests against CAA in the state and was booked under the stringent UAPA.He had tested positive for Covid-19 some months back and shifted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital where he is still lodged with a board of doctors monitoring his condition.Sibsagar goes to the polls in the first phase on March 27 along with 46 other constituencies.Elections to the 126-member Assam legislative assembly will be held in three phases with 39 constituencies in the second phase on April 1, and 40 in the last phase on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogendra-yadav-meet-jailed-raijor-dal-president-says-goal-is-to-defeat-bjp-101615721438933.html

14-03-2021||India||Upendra Kushwaha returns home to JD (U), merges RLSP with Nitish Kumar’s party||After months of speculation, Upendra Kushwaha merged his Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) with the Janata Dal (United) in the presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday.Kushwaha had left the JD (U) in 2013 and formed the RLSP that year.A formal announcement about merger was made by Kushwaha himself after RLSP’s national council meeting Sunday morning. Kushwaha, later drove to the JD (U) office where he was welcomed by Kumar.Soon after the merger, Nitish Kumar announced appointment of Kushwaha as Chairman of National Parliamentary Board of JD (U), with immediate effect.“I am personally very happy with the development. It is a historical decision. We were together earlier and again we are back. He is a big leader and will work together for state’s development,” said Kumar, while welcoming Kushwaha back in JD (U).“We were in talks with the RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha for quite some time. When I discussed it with my party members, they expressed their joy on his thought of merging the party with ours,” said Kumar.Earlier in the day, Kushwaha, after the meeting of the RLSP national council announced the decision of the party to merge with the JD (U). “The entire RLSP will merge with the JD (U) from today. The decision has been taken in the interest of the state and country. Seeing the people’s mandate and the prevailing political scenario, it was decided that leaders with similar political ideology should come on one platform. This is the demand of the current political situation,” said Kushwaha.“People’s mandate was a clear message that we should go together. This is neither going to benefit me nor Nitish Kumar. It will benefit the state and strengthen Bihar,” said Kushwaha and ruled out that any political bargaining for the merger.Kushwaha, a former Union minister made it clear that his role in the party would be decided by Nitish Kumar. Heaping praise on Kumar, Kushwaha said, “He is my bade bhai (elder brother). I have always respected him. I will continue to serve people and party irrespective of the role assigned to me and strengthen the JD (U).”“JD (U) is the only party which is committed to state’s development whereas some parties are more interested in their own development. I will serve under Nitish Kumar and strengthen the party,” said Kushwaha.JD (U)'s alliance partners, the BJP and the HAM-S welcomed Kushwaha’s homecoming.Former chief minister and HAM-S leader Jitan Ram Manjhi said that Kushwaha’s return to JD (U) is in the interest of the state and country. “He was a Union minister in NDA government. He went to Grand Alliance where he felt insulted,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.The RJD took a dig at the merger. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said Nitish Kumar should handover the chief minister's position to Kushwaha. "The way BJP insulted Nitish Kumar in Bihar Assembly elections using Chirag Paswan it was obvious that it somewhere niggled Nitish Kumar as well as Upendra Khushwaha. However, it is time that "Luv" should handover the CM position to his brother Kush as 'Luv-Kush' was the base of the JD(U)'s formation, said Tiwari.JD (U) leaders feel that the Luv-Kush unity in Bihar (a term used in reference to Kurmi and Koeri caste) can become a potent factor in revival of the JD (U). The Kushwahas and Kurmis together for nearly 12% of Bihar’s population and had been a major vote bank of Nitish Kumar.The RLSP had exited the RJD-led grand alliance in September last year and fought the Bihar assembly election in partnership with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) but drew a blank.Political experts, however, are not excited with the development and feel that it would hardly help JD (U) which is trying to consolidate itself.“The reason is simple. Kushwaha has lost clout. All his community grassroot leaders have joined the RJD. The Kush (Koeri community to which Kushwaha belong) is a divided house. The message has gone loud and clear that Kushwaha is fighting for his survival,” said D M Diwakar, political analyst associated with A N Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upendra-kushwaha-returns-home-to-jd-u-merges-rlsp-with-nitish-kumar-s-party-101615720259651.html

In the same way, if the society and the country has to move ahead, then the forest dwellers' community has to be first taken ahead," Kovind said.He also said that Sonbhadra shares borders with four states, and the schools and hostels operating at such a place will benefit students of the forest dwellers' community of Uttar Pradesh and bordering areas of the adjoining states."The soul of India resides in areas of the tribal community and forest dwellers. If anyone wants to get introduced to this culture, then he/she should spend time in districts like Sonbhadra," he said.Kovind also said that for him 'vanvaasi' area is like a pilgrimage place, and if the forest dwellers feels encouraged, then they will make the country proud.Laying stress on the development of the backward castes, Dalits, tribals and forest dwellers, he asked Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to co-ordinate with the Centre, and contribute in taking the forest dwellers ahead.The president also said, "Without the development of the tribal community, holistic development is incomplete. The Centre and the state governments are running a number of programmes for them. Talented people hailing from the forest dwellers' community have done good things in the country."He also said that work is being done to preserve the memories of the great personalities, folk art and songs.The governor and the chief minister were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/growth-of-country-cannot-be-done-without-development-of-tribal-community-forest-dwellers-president-kovind-101615719309890.html

As far as Kerala is concerned, the Left parties and the NCP have come together and we are sure that we will get aclear- cut majority," he said.In Tamil Nadu, people will support DMK and its chief M K Stalin, and they will come to power in the state after the polls, the former Union minister said."In West Bengal, the Centre, especially the BJP is misusing power and trying to attack a sister (referring to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) who is trying to fight for the people of the state," the NCP chief alleged.The entire state has rallied around Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee since it is a matter of Bengali pride and self-respect, he said."I have no doubt that the TMC will retain power under the leadership of Banerjee," he said.Pawar further said he knows the situation in poll- bound Assam, and as per the inputs received from his party people, the BJP, which is currently in power there, is in a "good position" compared to others."In nutshell, the BJP will retain power in Assam, but will face defeat in other poll-bound states, and other political parties in those states will come to power. I am confident this trend will give a new direction to the country," he said.Asked about the arrest of Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze by the NIA in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, Pawar dubbed the issue as "local" and did not comment, saying it is not related to the state's policies.Earlier in the day, when asked if Pawar was upset with Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and sought his removal, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut in Mumbai said, "Pawar is the guiding light of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). It was because of him this (Mahrashtra) government was formed."To a question on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari not clearing names recommended by the state cabinet for nomination as MLCs under the governor's quota, Pawar said it is the responsibility of the governor to implement the cabinet's recommendation."In the history of Maharashtra, the state has not seen a governor who has not followed the responsibility given by the Constitution. However, the present governor has done that magic, which is unfortunate," he said.Pawar said when Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, the latter had complained about hurdles being created by the then governor."Today, the same thing is happening in Maharashtra and the Centre is merely becoming a spectator, which is worrying," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barring-assam-bjp-will-face-defeat-in-elections-in-4-other-states-sharad-pawar-101615717166359.html

It can be a big place of profit for criminal organizations and companies as it can be made a market for selling counterfeit and fake vaccine. Such organisations adopt a very smart technique of publicity which can attract several innocent citizens of our nation for buying the vaccine."Online fraud has become a regular criminal act committed and our nation is also facing this challenge," the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-seeking-strict-guidelines-to-prevent-chances-of-fake-covid-19-vaccine-101615713570289.html

In an addendum to the party manifesto unveiled on Saturday, he said DMK had all along opposed the CAA and campaigned against it and he even ran a campaign in Tamil Nadu collecting one crore signatures pressing for scrapping the law. "The Central government will be urged to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019," Stalin said in the addendum. The DMK in its manifesto has said that the Centre would be requested to include Sri Lanka in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and give citizenship to Lankan Tamil refugees living in camps in India. Making the addition, Stalin said his party had all along opposed the CAA and campaigned against it and he even ran a signature campaign in Tamil Nadu collecting one crore signatures seeking the scrapping of the legislation. "I would like to reiterate again that a resolution will be passed in the assembly (if DMK is voted to power) and will raise its voice for scrapping CAA," he said in a statement. The DMK top leader also added two more points to the manifesto, an assurance that the "anti-farmer" Chennai-Salem expressway project would not be implemented and the Kattupalli port shall not be allowed here and the draft environment assessment report for it would be rejected. The DMK released its 505-point manifesto featuring a host of highly populist promises. Waiver of crop and jewel loans in cooperative banks and a one-time assistance of ₹4,000 for Covid-19 hit rice ration card holders were among the assurances. Protests were held in various parts of the state against the CAA, which expedites citizenship applications from religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. DMK had questioned why Muslims and Tamil refugees of Sri Lanka were kept out of the ambit of the act and alleged it 'divided' people on the basis of religion. The expressway project witnessed several protests by farmers and others over land acquisition and environment concerns. The greenfield corridor was challenged in the Madras High Court which quashed the land acquisition proceedings and Pattali Makkal Katchi (an ally of the AIADMK now) leader Anbumani Ramadoss was among the petitioners against the project in court. However, the Supreme Court had in December last year upheld the notification for land acquisition for the ₹10,000 crore eight lane project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mk-stalin-says-dmk-would-continue-to-urge-centre-to-scrap-caa-101615712418652.html

14-03-2021||India||$5 trillion economy goal more aspirational than carefully computed: Ex-RBI Guv||As the economy slowly comes out of the pandemic blues, former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Sunday cautioned that "drastic changes" in India's monetary policy framework can upset the bond market as the current system has helped in containing inflation and promoting growth.Rajan, also a noted economist, opined that the government's ambitious target to make India a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25 was "more aspirational, rather than a carefully computed one even before the pandemic"."I believe the (monetary policy) framework has helped bring inflation down, while giving the RBI some flexibility to support the economy. It is hard to think of what would have happened if we had to run such large fiscal deficits without such a framework in place," Rajan told PTI in an interview.His remarks were in response to a query on whether he was in favour of reviewing the 2-6% target band for inflation under the monetary policy framework.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the mandate to maintain retail inflation at 4% with a margin of 2% on either side. The central bank's six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor decides on policy rates keeping this target in mind.The current medium-term inflation target, which was notified in August 2016, ends on March 31. The inflation target for the next five years starting April is likely to be notified this month.Against this backdrop, Rajan said, "We risk upsetting bond markets if we make drastic changes in the framework"."I think the framework has been beneficial in bringing down inflation, I don't think it has been costly in slowing growth, and this is probably the wrong time to make drastic changes," he pointed out.With the government embarking on substantial borrowing plans to boost the coronavirus pandemic-hit economy, there are concerns among certain quarters about the overall financial health, and bond yields have also been on an upward trajectory.The latter trend indicates that government borrowings could become more costly.About reform measures, Rajan said that while the 2021-22 Budget has placed a lot of weight on privatisation, the history of the government delivering on this is checkered, and he wondered how it will be different this time.He pointed out that in the latest Budget, laudably, there is more transparency about the true extent of spending, as well as a degree of conservatism about budget receipts that has not been seen in recent budgets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-trillion-economy-goal-more-aspirational-than-carefully-computed-ex-rbi-guv-101615710508977.html

Twitter initially did not fully comply but fell in line after the government showed the rule book that contained penal provisions.The IT Ministry went on to state that the recent guidelines pertaining to social media simply require the platforms to put in place a robust grievance redressal mechanism for users."None of the government communications, either written or oral, have ever threatened the employees of any of the social media platforms of jail term," it said."The government welcomes criticism and dissent. However, of late, repeated instances of abuse of social media to foment hate, discord and violence by terrorist groups from outside India and circulation of morphed images of women, revenge porn posing threat to the safety of users especially women users have become grave concerns," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-govt-communication-threatened-social-media-platforms-staff-of-jail-ministry-101615709399192.html

14-03-2021||India||BJP's Kapil Mishra moves SC seeking strict action against fake complainants||A BJP leader has moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre for framing guidelines to ensure strict action against fake complainants in criminal cases and for compensating victims of such wrongful prosecutions.The PIL has been filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra in the backdrop of a sensational case in which the Allahabad High Court, on January 28, declared rape convict Vishnu Tiwari innocent, observing that the motive behind the FIR was related to a land dispute.Tiwari was arrested on September 16, 2000 after being booked for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and was in jail for 20 years.The PIL, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, has also sought "adequate compensation" for Tiwari for his wrongful conviction and life imprisonment in the fake case. "Direct the Centre to fame guidelines and to make a mechanism to take strict action and to prosecute fake complainants as well as to frame guidelines to pay adequate compensation to victims of wrongful prosecutions and implement the recommendations of law commission Report ...on miscarriage of justice," the plea said. The BJP leader has made union ministries of Home Affairs and Law and Justice, the Uttar Pradesh government and the Law Commission as parties to his PIL. It has also sought direct for setting up of a mechanism for speedy disposal of cases pertaining to undertrial prisoners prosecuted in special Acts and to frame guidelines for undertrial prisoners to decide their cases in a time bound manner."Direct the respondents (Centre and others) to frame rules to release poor persons who are victim of malicious and vague prosecution who are facing jail in the absence of not furnishing the adequate sureties/bonds," it said.Mishra, in his PIL, submitted that the SC/ST law is being misused and abused by filing fake and malicious complaints and no action is taken against the culprit in the absence of effective statutory/legal scheme."False cases lead to suicides of innocents who are victims of police and prosecutorial misconduct, who lose hope and lives of their families destroyed after years of delayed trials due to the non-effective machinery...,” the plea said.The PIL has made the Union ministries of Home Affairs, Law and Justice, the Law Commission and state of Uttar Pradesh as parties. On March 11, a similar plea was filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay seeking a direction to the Centre, all states and Union territories (UTs) to frame and implement guidelines to compensate victims of "wrongful prosecution" through government machineries.Upadhyay urged the apex court to "use its plenary constitutional power to frame guidelines for compensation to victims of wrongful prosecutions and direct the Centre and states to implement them till recommendations of the Law Commission on miscarriage of justice are implemented religiously".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-kapil-mishra-moves-sc-seeking-strict-action-against-fake-complainants-101615704611834.html

Initially the vaccination using Covaxin will be implemented only in medical colleges and district hospital premises in a separate facility. As I had stated earlier, as soon as I recover from Covid and I am eligible for vaccination, I will be taking my first dose of it,” said Singhdeo in a tweet. Singhdeo tested Covid-19 positive last week and is in home quarantine.Last month, Chhattisgarh asked the Centre to halt the supply of Covaxin to the state, claiming phase-3 clinical trials for the vaccine had not been completed and the results had not been published. Deo then said he was not in a position to tell people in the state to take Covaxin until its efficacy was proven. Covaxin was recently taken out of the clinical trial mode by the DCGI and its manufacturers claim it showed 81% interim clinical efficacy and significant immunogenicity against Covid-19 variants, in phase 3 trials.Also Read: 5 policemen among 8 arrested for possessing tiger skin in ChhattisgarhDeo said while he was “proud of our indigenous vaccine”, but “strictly” believed that due process as per international norms need to be adhered to before bringing it into general use. “Our primary concern is the well being of our citizens and only implement any vaccine once its efficacy is proven,” he said.He also said that there was no shortage of vaccine supply to the state.“At no point has there been any shortage in supply of vaccines for our people in the state. As a matter of fact, Chhattisgarh has constantly been performing among the top 5 states of the country in terms of vaccination,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-health-minister-says-state-seriously-considering-allowing-covaxin-101615701842559.html

14-03-2021||India||No technical link between Israel embassy blast, Ambani security scare: Officials||Counter-terrorism agencies have found no link between the improvised explosive device (IED) blasted outside the Israeli embassy in New Delhi on January 29 and the explosive-laden sports utility vehicle found near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani a month later on February 25. While in both cases, a non-existent organisation called Jaish-ul-Hind has taken responsibility for the cyber message posted in case of Mumbai, the agencies have informed the government that there is no technical link between the two cases. “The posting of the message on February 27 night on Telegram messaging app in the Mumbai case with Jaish-ul-Hind taking responsibility is an after-thought. The Mumbai case has no link with IED blast outside Israel embassy,” said a former Mumbai Police commissioner.Also read | Iran rejects allegations linking it to blast outside Israeli embassyInvestigators have traced the Mumbai message to a phone number used by Indian Mujahideen terrorist Tehseen Akhtar, who is currently lodged in high-security Tihar Jail. While serious questions are being raised as to how a known jihadist had access to a smartphone in Tihar Jail, CT agencies are quite clear that there is no revival of the IM group even though its founders—Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal—are active in Karachi. It is not very clear whether another founder member Amir Raza Khan is dead or alive but he was last sighted in Karachi two years ago. Tehseen Akhtar was the head of the Ranchi module of IM, which was responsible for targeting the election rally of then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi at Gandhi maidan in Patna on October 27, 2013.According to the agencies, the Mumbai case is a local affair while the Israel embassy bomb blast has cyber markers in Syria and Afghanistan. Even in this case, the so-called Jaish-ul-Hind group is a cyber creation to off-track the investigation with Islamists known to constantly change the name like Jundallah or Ansar-ul-Hind etc.Also read | Govt upgrades probe into Israel embassy blast after Iran link. NIA moves inWhile the IED used in the Israel embassy attack was remotely triggered through a line of sight device, there was no detonator found in the parked SUV in Mumbai. This means that Mumbai was just to scare perhaps part of an extortion racket with incarcerated IM terrorists trying to revive the homegrown terror by taking responsibility for the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-technical-link-between-israel-embassy-blast-ambani-security-scare-officials-101615697498145.html

The SSC under the scanner for malpractices is located in the Kapurthala district of Punjab."Based on a proactive operation by Army intelligence agencies, a case of possible malpractice in selection procedures at a centre has come to light. Since the scope of investigation involves multiple agencies including civil entities, the Indian Army has decided to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation," Army officials told ANI."Indian Army has zero-tolerance towards corrupt practices in the recruitment process for selection of suitable candidates for Indian Army," they added.Sources said the probe started after complaints were received against a junior officer for being involved in malpractices. Later on, it emerged that many other insiders and civilians could be involved including some high ranking officials."That is why it was decided that the investigation should be handed over to the CBI which can prove all entities involved," they said.The initial probe by the military intelligence comes at a time when the force has been probing cases of malpractices in the recruitment of jawans at different centres and two serving officers have been allegedly found involved in the scam.Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has also clearly told his commanders that there would be zero tolerance towards cases of financial wrongdoings and moral turpitude."The dealing with officers involved in such cases has been very strict in recent times and some of them have been packed home without pension too," sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-asks-cbi-to-probe-alleged-malpractices-in-officers-selection-101615697082040.html

14-03-2021||India||Bengal assembly elections: Amit Shah to hold rallies; TMC may release manifesto||With the first of the eight-phase assembly polls in Bengal to be held in 13 days, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have planned to boost ongoing preparations from Sunday.Union home minister Amit Shah will arrive at Kolkata airport on Sunday afternoon and fly straight to Kharagpur in West Midnapore district in a chopper, the Bengal BJP has announced. He will address a rally at Kharagpur town around 5 pm and meet district and block-level leaders in his hotel in the evening. On Monday, Shah will fly to Jhargram and Bankura districts to address back-to-back rallies. He will fly back to Kolkata on Monday afternoon and leave for Delhi.Polls in these three districts will be held in the first phase on March 27 and second phase on April 1.Kharagpur Sadar is an important seat for the BJP. On Wednesday, the party fielded Bengali actor Hiranmoy Chattopadhyay from the seat, which Dilip Ghosh, the BJP state president, won in 2016. The BJP lost the seat in the 2019 by-election which had to be held because Ghosh contested and won the Midnapore Lok sabha seat earlier that year. Kharagpur Sadar went to the TMC for the first time. The winner, Pradip Sarkar, secured 47% votes against 39.29 % that Ghosh got in 2016. Sarkar has been fielded again by the TMC.For Chattopadhyay, popularly known as Hiran, the contest is a tough one. “I am grateful to the local people for the love they have shown me. They have enormous respect for Dilip Ghosh,” Chattopadhyay said on the sidelines of a rally on Saturday.Jhargram and Bankura districts, that Shah will visit, have a sizeable number of tribal voters who backed the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls.The TMC plans to release its election manifesto on Sunday, party leaders said. The document may include some social welfare measures that Banerjee will promise to implement if she comes to power. “Some of these promises will focus on the public distribution system and employment that the BJP is highlighting in its ongoing campaign,” a TMC leader said on condition of anonymity since Banerjee is supposed to make the announcements.“Though the chief minister is unable to walk, she insists on addressing a rally in the districts either on Monday or Tuesday,” the TMC leader added.Also Read: EC may take a call on Bengal reports todayThe ruling party had planned to release its manifesto on Thursday but it had to be postponed following Banerjee’s ankle injury at Nandigram in East Midnapore on Wednesday evening.On Sunday, the BJP may also release the list of 75 candidates for the third and fourth phase, if the party's central leadership clears it after final scrutiny. Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the central election committee’s meeting in Delhi on Saturday evening where the list was discussed. Several former TMC leaders and ministers, who joined the BJP recently, are likely to be fielded from the constituencies they represented.Former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who was elected twice from the Domjur constituency in Howrah district, was among other leaders who were flown to Delhi on Friday. “I told the leadership that I want to contest from Domjur. The party will take the final call,” Banerjee said on Saturday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-assembly-elections-amit-shah-to-hold-rallies-tmc-may-release-manifesto-101615690111702.html

Vaze was arrested by the central agency after questioning him for nearly 12 hours. He was the lead investigator in the explosives case before it was transferred to the Mumbai Police’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and later to the NIA.“Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive-laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25,” a senior official of the NIA told HT. The officer also alleged Vaze had confessed to his role but declined to share more details at this stage.Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer in Thane, had claimed ownership of the abandoned vehicle and told the police that it was stolen a week earlier. He was found dead in a creek in Mumbai on March 5. Hiran’s wife Vimla blamed Vaze for the murder and claimed that her husband had given the SUV to the police officer in November, which he returned in the first week of February.Also read | Forcible entry not seen on SUV with explosives found near Ambani's house: PoliceVaze joined the Maharashtra police force in 1990 as a sub-inspector and his first posting was in the Maoist-affected area of Gadchiroli. He was moved to Thane city police two years later and came to be known as a good criminal investigator. He was later inducted in the Special Squad of Thane Police’s crime branch, where he gained a reputation as an encounter specialist.Vaze was transferred to the Powai unit of the Mumbai Police’s crime branch in 2000. It was during his stint here when, together with three other policemen, he faced a charge of murdering Khawaja Yunus, an accused in the December 2, 2002, Ghatkopar blast case. Yunus, a 27-year-old software engineer, was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch, and later reportedly died in police custody. The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) charged Vaze and three other police personnel -- Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai -- with murder and destruction of evidence on March 3, 2004. Vaze was placed under suspension after this.Also read | Bomb threat to death: Decoding the caseVaze resigned from service on November 30, 2007, and joined the Shiv Sena the next year. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said earlier this week Vaze was a member of Shiv Sena till 2008 but no longer related to the party. "Sachin Vaze was in Shiv Sena till 2008 but he did not renew his membership and has no connection with Sena any longer," Thackeray said while addressing a press conference.He was reinstated in the police force on June 6, 2020. The assistant police inspector was with the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Police's crime branch. Vaze handled a few high-profile cases, including the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case in which 15 people, including Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) were arrested. The case pertained to Republic TV, owned by ARG Outlier Media, which had allegedly benefited from purported manipulations of TRPs. The CIU filed a charge-sheet against Vikas Khanchandani, CEO of Republic TV, Dasgupta and Romil Ramgarhia, former CCO of BARC, earlier this year in January.Also read | 'Something fishy': Uddhav after NIA asked to take over Ambani bomb threat probeVaze was also part of the police team that arrested news anchor Arnab Goswami in November 2020, in connection with designer Anvay Naik’s suicide.

Apart from these four cases, he also has 24 other criminal cases pending against him. But the high court, Thakur told the top court, still suspended his sentence and let him out on bail. Thakur said that his client’s father was killed while Singh was out on bail.The bench said that it was startled by the inability of the Madhya Pradesh police to arrest Singh for almost a year despite such grave facts.“The material which has been placed on the record makes startling reading... We take serious note of the manner in which the Additional Sessions Judge, Hata who is in charge of the criminal case has been harassed by the law enforcement machinery in Damoh,” said the court in its order which was released on Saturday.The judges took a grim view that the trial judge had to record his apprehensions in his judicial order on February 8; that he might be subjected to an “unpleasant incident” in the future as the accused are “highly influential political persons”.“We have no reason to disbelieve a judicial officer who has made an impassioned plea that he was being pressurised as a result of his orders under Section 319 of the CrPC. The State, which had moved the High Court for cancellation of the bail which was granted to the second respondent (Singh) as an incident of the suspension of sentence on 3 February 2016, has failed to apprehend Singh who continues to evade arrest,” rued the bench.It ordered the state DGP to “immediately ensure the arrest” of Singh and report compliance by filing a personal affidavit in the court.“The DGP shall also enquire into the allegations levelled by Singh against the Superintendent of Police Damoh by the Additional Sessions Judge in his order dated February 8, 2021,” directed the bench. It has also sought an explanation from the SP while fixing the matter for hearing on March 26.The top court has also ordered for providing adequate security to the trial judge in Damoh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-probe-into-alleged-threat-to-judge-101615673724791.html
14-03-2021||India||‘Pay staff using surplus’: Two govt-funded colleges||Two Delhi government-funded Delhi University (DU) colleges on Saturday passed a resolution directing its administrations to use surplus funds to pay salaries and meet other expenses.The Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) saw the move as the Delhi government forcing colleges it funded to change the pattern of financial assistance.The governing bodies (GBs) of Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and the Sports Sciences and Maharishi Valmiki College of Education on Saturday passed the resolution that read, “Special audits show that all 12 colleges have surplus grant aid excess is drawn and available with them. Consequently, the colleges are directed to use the same minus student society fund for the purpose of the salary, allowance and other approved and admissible recurring expenses.” It further said that the colleges cannot undertake any activity that entails financial liability for the government, like creation of posts and infrastructure projects over ₹2 crore, without taking prior approval from the government.The other 10 colleges were yet to pass the resolution.DUTA said in a statement, “It’s shocking that these twelve colleges are being forced to adopt in their GBs a document called ‘Pattern of Assistance’ issued by the directorate of higher education, government of Delhi. The provisions ... are designed to ... divest Delhi government of its funding responsibility by coercing them to gradually become self-sufficient.”GBs have 10 members, both from the college as well as government-nominated .Deepanshu Srivastav, the government-appointed chairperson of Maharishi Valmiki College, said, “The resolution was passed after proper discussion. None was forced to sign it. We know that the 12 Delhi government colleges have enough funds to pay their employees, and that’s why we passed the resolution.”Prabhanjan Jha, a government-appointed GB member at Aditi Mahavidyalaya College, said, “The Delhi government is liable to the deficit only after the utilization of reserves as per the pattern of assistance.”Principal of one of the other 10 colleges, who wished not to be named, said, “Only those colleges having government-appointed GB chairpersons are in favour. We are against it. How can we pay salaries from the money released under different heads for different purposes?”A Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The pattern of assistance is already applied to all Delhi government fully-funded colleges in DU… Besides, the government has already released pending grants to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pay-staff-using-surplus-two-govt-funded-colleges-101615672473574.html
14-03-2021||India||Inclusivity and evolution are inherent traits of Indian culture||The term culture is varyingly understood, often encompassing different manifestations of human intellectual and other expressions, particularly of ideas, beliefs, customs and social behaviour. At a more granular level this conception incorporates different art forms, languages and literature, traditions and values and even religious norms and practices. At times, urbane lifestyles and discerning tastes of material subjects are also considered archetypal of what culture embodies.India, with its near continuous history of more than 5000 years as an evolving civilisation, has a dynamic and living culture. It is justifiably proud of this unique heritage which is often considered a key element of its own national identity. However, there are questions as to what is the true Indian culture and which hue in this multitude of cultural-chroma can be said to be quintessential representative of the Indian civilisation. But this begets some more queries, as to what is civilisation, what is the wider domain of culture, how has it evolved in India, how inextricably is it linked to our religious thoughts and practices and most importantly what is nationhood itself. For capturing even a glimpse of the vibrant Indian culture, behoves conceptual appreciation of these integral institutions. But first, what is culture?The connotation of the word culture is vast and cannot be restricted to a singular definition. However, it can be understood as the collective values of a society, manifested through its numerous institutions as well as, in the disposition, attitudes, manners of its individual members. Those in turn find expression in various material objects, abstract ideas and beliefs of individuals and society.Thus, culture includes certain aspects of collective institutions, such as morality, religion, spirituality, law, custom, art etc. which are not restricted to an individual and which are handed over from generation to generation. Evidently, the institutional elements of culture are evolutionary and dynamic.Culture also includes intellectual and knowledge elements pertaining to languages, literature, human learning, social norms, customs and behaviour. Human and social aesthetics are another key aspect of culture, encompassing within it, the numerous manifestations of tangible and intangible art forms, viz, music, dance, sculpture, painting and architecture etc. The new-age theatre and cinema are as much a reflection of the modern culture as are the cave paintings of a prehistoric society, of which we know so little. The Bhakti and Sufi movements were the embodiment of the spiritual elements of the medieval culture, as were the imposing forts and grand palaces of this age, a reflection of its societal and corporeal cultural constituents. The Sangam literature was the manifestation of the human intellectual and socio–ethical elements of a culture at its zenith nearly two millennia ago. Folk art and traditional lifestyles are also as much indicative of the culture of a society as is urbane lifestyle and transient tastes. Thus, our habitat, cuisine, costumes, physical objects, apart from performing arts and architecture, are all reflective of the material or tangible elements of culture, as are religions, customs, festivals, traditions, social practices and ethics, philosophy and law, reflective of non-material or intangible elements.But Culture in itself is never static or an isolated mass of homogenous attributes. It is pervious and dynamic, with fresh waves of socio-cultural influences sprouting pristine cultural milieus. Inclusivity and evolution are its inherent and integral traits. It is this very indispensable characterisitc which is reflected in Mahatma Gandhi’s words, “No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive.”But given its transient nature, what is that abiding essence which provides continuum and sustenance to a culture, to maintain its integrity over epochs? At the very core of the myriad cultural manifestations, lies the element of goodness of the civilisation and its people. It is the enduring element. Narrow canons of the self, do not restrict it, nor is its domain limited to a specific society. It is all encompassing and its ethos best exemplified in the aspirational Upanishadic hymn, sarve bhavantu sukhinah (may all be happy).Indeed, its universality extends even beyond the human dominion, to all the sentient beings and in its noblest manifestation, endeavouring even for the sustenance of the biotic world and the abiotic realm. Civilisations may somewhat assimilate this element as ethics and law, while religion may perceive it as the principles of morality or the essence of spirituality. But goodness, irrespective of its classification, is the only and truly the eternal soul of any culture, bereft of which, its external trappings no matter how seemingly glorious and glitzy, are a little more than a lifeless mass.The writer is an IRS officer and author of the book, ‘Indian Heritage, Art and culture’.

More than 20 lakh (20,53,537) vaccine doses were given on Day-56 of the vaccination drive (12th March, 2021) through 30,561 sessions. This is the highest single day vaccine administration so far,” said the Union health ministry.Drugs Controller General of India VG Somani has currently approved two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – in the fight against Covid-19. Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian council of Medical’s research and the other vaccine is developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and is locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.First doses have been administered to 1,639,663 health care and frontline workers, and 413,874 health care and frontline workers have received the second dose of vaccines so far, according to government data.Also Read: Hyderabad firm to produce Covid-19 vaccine jabs with US fundingSince the vaccination was opened in the second phase on March 1, 7,291,716 people above 60 years of age and 1,254,468 between 45 and 59 years with specified comorbidities have been vaccinated in the country. Eight states constituted 74% of the 2,053,537 doses administered in last 24 hours, the Union health ministry said. Uttar Pradesh topped the list with at least 330,000 vaccine doses.“Covering 10 million people a day will ensure that we will cover the entire vulnerable population within a month. This will prevent any sort of second wave in India. Given the proactive and strong leadership shown by India so far in tackling Covid-19, the ambitious goal to cover them within 30 days will take us ahead of the virus. This ambition is a necessity, not for any records,” Dr Babu said. India’s caseload stood at 202,022 on Saturday, according to government data. The current caseload is 1.78% of the total positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-million-vaccinated-in-a-day-tally-reaches-28-2-million-govt-101615668088816.html
14-03-2021||India||Ahead of polls, farmers’ unions embark on anti-BJP campaign||On January 18 this year, a prominent leader of the ongoing farmers’ protest against three new agricultural laws, Gurnam Singh Charuni, “clarified” before a platform of farm unions leading the agitation that he would never organise political meets without permission after having done so once.Charuni, the firebrand leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, an influential farmers’ organisation and key force behind the protests in Haryana, had organised an all-party meeting to rally support for the farmers. The move went against the promise of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a collective of farm unions, to keep the movement “strictly apolitical”.Also Read | ‘Going to Nandigram…’: BKU’s Rakesh Tikait says ‘BJP has robbed the country’However, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha appears to have dropped its stand of being equidistant from all parties, campaigning against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, especially in five states going to the polls in a few weeks.Influential farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who is spearheading the protest against the contentious farm laws, is in West Bengal, where a fierce election campaign battle between the BJP and Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress is underway. On Saturday, Tikait urged people at Nandigram not to vote for the BJP, while mounting attack on the BJP-led central government. “There are elections ahead in Bengal. You need not come to Delhi. You ensure that the BJP is defeated in the polls. Don’t vote for them. Vote for only that party which can defeat the BJP,” he said.He was addressing a rally attended by a few hundred people at Nandigram, which goes to the polls on April 1. Political experts suggest it could be the fiercest of the constituency battles, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee taking on her protege-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, who has been pitted against her by the rival BJP.“This movement (farmers’ agitation) has to be spread throughout the country across all districts. You will have to break barriers and barricades. This movement will continue till the time the kala-kanoon (contentious farm laws) is withdrawn,” Tikait said, while projecting Nandigram as a citadel of the farmers’ movement. Back in 2007-2008, Nandigram became the epicentre of a farmers’ movement that propelled Banerjee to power in the state in 2011, uprooting the 34 years of the Left Front government.Analysts say that there has seldom been voting on purely farmers’ economic issues, and farmers rather tend to vote along caste and religious lines.However, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s call for a campaign against the BJP has opened a new front of challenge for the ruling party, which is looking to unseat Banerjee in West Bengal.In a far cry from being an apolitical body, the SKM last month gave a nationwide call to “teach the BJP a lesson”. “We continue to be equidistant so far as support to any particular party is concerned. But we are against the government and it will be ridiculous to claim that we are not against the party that rules it,” said Avik Saha, national secretary of the SKM.In Nandigram, a “mahapanchayat” spearheaded by Tikait on Sunday is expected to draw large crowds and is being supported by six constituent organisations of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the Left’s All-India Kisan Mahasabha and a clutch of civil society organisations.“We have been compelled to campaign against the BJP because the government has rejected all out demands and that is the only language it understands,” Saha said.Tens of thousands of farmers are protesting since last year, demanding a scrapping of three agricultural laws to deregulate markets and which promise to offer farmers more market access for farmers to sell their produce.Farm unions, however, say the laws will allow large corporations and supermarkets to dictate terms to growers and leave them at the mercy of big firms.Tikait has been holding a series of “kisan mahapanchayats”, which are respected village institutions of the Jat community in northern states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, where social decisions taken by elders are considered binding.In these mahapanchayats, leaders such as Tikait and Charuni have built a groundswell of support for the agitation by raising local farm issues such as the problems of sugarcane growers aside from the larger demand of scrapping the farm laws.Analysts say the farmers’ campaign against the BJP may not influence the elections in a big way but it matters. “No state is going to the polls on the issue of farm laws. But the farmers’ agitation comes as an opportunity for the opposition,” says Barun Mitra, a teacher at the Calcutta University.With HTC inputs from Kolkata||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-farmers-unions-embark-on-antibjpcampaign-101615664210457.html

The virtual summit was convened by US President Joe Biden and joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe initiative will create additional manufacturing capacities in India, the world’s largest producer of vaccines, to make doses developed in the US, including the Johnson & Johnson candidate. This will be done with financing from the US and Japan.Australia will help overcome last mile and logistical delivery issues, and assist in delivering the vaccines to countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Islands.The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) has announced it will “finance increased capacity to support Biological E’s effort to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022”.This will be done with Stringent Regulatory Authorization (SRA) and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Emergency Use Listing. The move is part of DFC’s Global Health and Prosperity Initiative, under which it is increasing manufacturing, production and distribution capacity for vaccines.The Quad Vaccine Partnership was seen as the most significant deliverable of the first summit of the leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the US. Observers believe the move will help counter China’s influence across the Indo-Pacific while at the same time signalling that the Quad is evolving from a group that only discusses strategic approaches to cooperating in definite areas.Also Read | Quad makes its first big move: Joint vaccine pushDFC chief operating officer David Marchick said: “It is hard to conceive of an investment with a greater developmental impact than using our financial tools to increase the capacity of vaccine manufacturing to help developing countries in Asia and around the world respond to Covid-19 and other diseases.”He added, “Expanding vaccine manufacturing, especially the Covid-19 vaccine and boosters, will help increase vaccination rates and protect communities around the world.”“The vaccines Biological E plans to produce with the assistance of DFC’s financing complement existing efforts to vaccinate as many people in the world as possible in the shortest amount of time,” DFC’s released said.Partnering with Biological E, which is a woman-run business, will also advance DFC’s “2X Women’s Initiative” to promote global gender equity.Mahima Datla is currently the managing director of Biological E, which was founded in 1953, and became the first Indian private sector company to enter the vaccines business in 1962. The firm launched commercial operations in the US in 2019.DFC is also working to strengthen the vaccine supply chain and last mile logistics for distribution. Under its Global Health and Prosperity Initiative, DFC will invest between $5 million and $500 million on eligible projects, including equity and debt financing, political risk insurance and technical development.The announcement came on a day Union health minister Harsh Vardhan announced that more than six coronavirus vaccines will come up in India.“India has developed two vaccines, which have been given to 71 countries. Many more nations are seeking the vaccines, and these are not little-known nations...Canada, Brazil and other developed countries are using Indian vaccines with a great zeal,” he said. “More than half a dozen vaccines are going to come up,” he said.“Till Saturday morning, 1.84 crore vaccine shots have been given in the country and 20 lakh people were inoculated yesterday (Friday),” the minister added.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-firm-to-produce-jabs-with-us-funding-101615659083503.html
14-03-2021||India||Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party likely to merge with JD(U) today||The merger of former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) with his parent party JD(U) seems imminent and could happen as early as Sunday, people familiar with the developments said.A senior JD(U) leader, on condition of anonymity, said the merger would take place on Sunday afternoon after the meeting of JD(U)’s state executive committee. “The state committee of the RLSP has authorised the national executive to take a decision on the merger and its decision will be announced on Sunday morning,” said senior RLSP leader Fazal Imam Malik.A senior RLSP leader confirmed that the announcement was a mere formality, and the merger would take place on Sunday.Kushwaha would be returning to the JD (U), a party which he left in 2013. The same year, he formed the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and was part of the NDA during 2014 Lok Sabha polls. His party contested on three seats and won all the seats. Kushwaha was made the Union minister of state for the human resource department. His party also contested on 23 seats during the 2015 assembly elections as an NDA ally and won on three seats. He, however, left NDA in 2018.A section of leaders of the RLSP were not pleased with Kushwaha’s decision to become part of the JD (U) and some state and district level office bearers of the party joined the RJD on Friday. The RLSP leaders who joined the RJD in the presence of Tejashwi Yadav included state working president Virendra Kushwaha; state principal secretary general Nirmal Kushwaha and state head of women's cell Madhu Manjari Mehta.The Kushwaha-led party has a sizable support among the Kushwaha voters and its exit from the NDA fold cost JD(U) its traditional votes. Kushwaha had been to assembly and Rajya Sabha on a JD(U) ticket. The RLSP quit the NDA in December 2018 after the BJP refused to offer more than two seats to the RLSP for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections even as it went out of the way to accommodate Nitish Kumar’s JD(U).A JD(U) leader feels that the Luv-Kush unity in Bihar (a term used in reference to Kurmi and Koeri caste) can become a potent factor in the revival of the JD (U). The Kushwahas and Kurmis together account for nearly 12% of Bihar’s population and have been a major vote bank of Nitish Kumar’s party.Post-elections, Nitish Kumar has been busy consolidating his hold over the Kurmi-Koeri-Kushwaha vote bank in the wake of JD(U)’s dismal performance.The RLSP chief is understood to have sensed the mood and sent feelers to the JD(U) camp through emissaries as well as during numerous meetings with Kumar in the recent past. In fact, no less than six meetings took place between the chief minister Nitish Kumar and Kushwaha in last two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upendra-kushwaha-s-rashtriya-lok-samata-party-likely-to-merge-with-jd-u-today-101615660822704.html
14-03-2021||India||'Worrying that SC now has just one woman judge': Chandrachud||The Supreme Court’s senior judge DY Chandrachud said on Saturday it was “deeply worrying” that the apex court was left with only woman judge after the retirement of justice Indu Malhotra, adding that the institution “must do better”.Speaking at an event organised by the Supreme Court Young Lawyers Forum to bid farewell to justice Malhotra, justice Chandrachud said the diversity of India must also find reflection in the composition of the Supreme Court.“Justice Malhotra’s retirement means that Supreme Court now has only one female judge on the bench. As an institution, I find that this is a deeply worrying fact and must promptly receive serious introspection and reflection... As an institution whose decisions shape and impact lives of everyday Indian, we must do better. We must ensure the diversity of our country finds reflection in the makeup of our court,” said justice Chandrachud.Justice Malhotra, the first woman lawyer to be elevated to the Supreme Court directly from the Bar and the seventh woman judge to be appointed at the Supreme Court, retired on Saturday following a tenure of about three years. With the retirement of justice Malhotra, the Supreme Court now has only one woman judge, justice Indira Banerjee, who will retire in September next year.Justice Malhotra encouraged young lawyers to keep working hard and keep chasing their dreams as she quoted Michelle Obama: “The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.”Justice Chandrachud is not only in line to become the Chief Justice of India in November 2022 but he is presently also a member of the Supreme Court collegium that picks judges for appointment to the top court.Diversity in judiciary has both intrinsic and instrumental values, said justice Chandrachud during the virtual farewell event, adding that having a more diverse judiciary ensured that diversity of perspectives was fairly considered in decision-making process, instilled high degree of public confidence in decisions, and helped the institution to be more attuned to the people it served.He added that the reason why justice Malhotra adorned the bench was not because she was a woman or because she was one of the best women lawyers of her time but because she had capacity to become the best judge of her time, man, woman or others.Justice Chandrachud also recalled that at an event in October 2020, justice Malhotra spoke about the discrimination she faced even after joining the bench when some of her colleagues doubted her competence, making it necessary for her to work twice as hard.“I can only tell you from bottom of my conscience and with my hand on my soul that I wasn’t one of them... I hope that as we celebrate today, justice Malhotra’s career and accomplishments, we use this opportunity that stories such as hers become more common place and as members of legal fraternity we do our bit to ensure, that it no longer remains as hard as it was for justice Malhotra for women to climb upper echelons of our profession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worrying-that-sc-now-has-just-one-woman-judge-chandrachud-101615660423934.html
14-03-2021||India||‘Communal forces will never be welcome in Kerala’: Pinarayi Vijayan||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is in the midst of a fierce battle for survival as the state readies for the polls. Vijayan is eyeing a second term, which is against the general political cycle of the state. He spoke to Ramesh Babu on a range of issues. Excerpts:Of late you have repeatedly said the Union government is out to weaken your government and portray it in bad light. It happened when you are sure about a second term; why do you say that?Attacks on the LDF government in Kerala started in July 2020, as we were gearing up for the panchayat elections. Accusations were made on the government by BJP leaders regarding matters which fall under the purview of the Centre. The opposition in the state lapped them up. It translated into a full-fledged media trial and witch-hunt by investigation agencies. That is why I’ve said that there is an orchestrated effort to topple us. However, it needs to be noted that the first person who accused the CMO has now backtracked. I don’t want to name him now.You wrote to the PM for a central agency probe into the gold smuggling case and initially you said the investigation was in the right direction. Where did it go wrong?Yes, I did. Smuggling of contraband articles including gold is a serious offence that adversely affects our economy. So, I had requested for a comprehensive inquiry. But, as soon as a proper investigation seemed to be closing in on the real culprits, it came to a standstill. And then, the focus was shifted towards our government’s policies and projects.You often say the Congress and the BJP talk in the same voice in Kerala. But your party is in alliance with the Congress in West Bengal and neighbouring Tamil Nadu?I do, and that is based on their actions. We have umpteen examples across the country which would justify people perceiving the BJP and the Congress as two sides of the same coin. However, there is no fascist organisation like the RSS to control the Congress, so as to realise their goal of a Hindu Rashtra. Hence, where they are genuinely opposed to the BJP and the Left can use such allies – albeit cautiously – we do.What are your government’s biggest achievements in five years?I would present them in three broad areas. One, development. We aimed at infrastructure projects worth ₹50,000 crore in five years. We are at ₹63,200 crore already. Two, welfare. From ₹600 per month, welfare pension has been hiked to ₹1,600 per month. Plus, we have ensured that nobody went hungry even during this pandemic. Three, saving lives. As you know, Kerala has been battered by disasters one after the other. Yet, in protecting our people we have cut no corners. There are several other specific programmes like LIFE, Aardram and so on. But I’m not getting into the details right now.Unlike West Bengal, the party’s foundation is very strong in Kerala. It is the only Left government in the country. Would you foresee a united move to oust it?As a government, we have been pursuing an alternative to the existing models of development, welfare and governance. You see, we have published a progress report every year and been accountable to the people. We have promoted co-operatives and protected PSUs. For us, food, education, health, pension, housing, connectivity, development and so on are rights of the people, they are not handouts. So, naturally, people would want such an approach to be emulated elsewhere too. And those who have scant regard for the principles of democracy and our Constitution that governs us, they would surely want to oust an alternative that challenges their very existence.The BJP has been trying to get a foothold in Kerala and it used all opportunities including Sabarimala for this. Is Kerala fertile for saffron forces?Kerala is a land known for and committed to secularism. We think in terms of humanity, not in terms of faith. Therefore, communal forces will never be welcome here. I don’t see any future for it.Looking back, do you feel the emotional Sabarimala issue could have been tackled with caution? The party was forced to do a campaign later saying we are with the believers and a minister expressed regret the other day?We have always been with the believers. Just look at the allocation we have made for Dewaswom boards. We have even provided enough funds for temples that ran out of income during the lockdown. In fact, we are implementing the Sabarimala Master Plan with higher allocation than earlier. So, I don’t think anyone can blame us saying that we’ve not been with the faithful. And, as far the government is concerned, we have to abide by the judgments of the highest court; we are constitutionally bound to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/communal-forces-will-never-be-welcome-in-kerala-vijayan-101615660364017.html
14-03-2021||India||'Pronounced guilty by seekers of TRP': Disha Ravi||Bengaluru: Climate activist Disha Ravi, who was arrested by the Delhi Police in February in relation to a ‘toolkit’, an online document intended to help amplify the ongoing farmers’ protest, on Saturday hit out at the “seekers of TRPs” for “violating” her autonomy, and added that no matter how long it takes, the truth “always reveals itself”.The 24-year-old, who is a part of the Indian wing of Fridays for Future, a global climate change movement founded by Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, was arrested in Bengaluru on February 13 and charged with sedition, criminal conspiracy and inciting to riot. Police said Ravi, along with two other activists, created a ‘toolkit’ to spread misinformation and incite unrest as part of a global conspiracy. A Delhi court granted her bail on February 13, saying there was “scanty” and “sketchy” evidence to back the charges leveled against her and adding that citizens couldn’t be jailed simply because they disagreed with government policies.In a statement published on her social media accounts, Ravi said: “My autonomy was violated; my photographs were splashed all over the news; my actions were pronounced guilty - not in the court of law, but on flat screens by seekers of TRPs. I sat there, unaware of the many abstractions made of me in order to satiate their idea of me.”Ravi, whose arrest triggered widespread outrage, added that it wasn’t a crime to draw attention to the climate crisis. “At the end of the five days I was shifted to Judicial Custody for 3 days, I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs,” she wrote.She thanked all the people who supported her and added that there were many others who continued to languish between bars without the legal assistance that she had.“Although their physical forms are trapped behind bars because of our collective silence, their ideas continue to live on as will the united resistance of the people. Ideas do not die. And, truth, no matter how long it takes, always reveals itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pronounced-guilty-by-seekers-of-trp-ravi-101615660243968.html
14-03-2021||Today's||The rationale and future of Quad||United States (US) President Joe Biden is credited with taking the initiative for the summit-level meeting of Quad that took place on March 12. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, thanked Biden for taking this initiative in his opening comments at the summit. This is the second high-profile foreign policy initiative taken by Biden in his first 100 days in office. Earlier, he addressed the Munich Security Conference on February 19 where he tried to win back European allies such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom, by proposing a transatlantic alliance to counter China. However, the mood in the European Union (EU) is not for confrontation with China. Both the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron seemed less enthusiastic about taking on China directly.Biden’s next stop was Quad. Here too, his focus was to contain China. But he did not betray the aggression of his predecessor. The last time when the foreign ministers of Quad countries met in Tokyo, they could not even issue a joint statement, primarily because of the strident anti-China rhetoric of then US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. India was particularly reluctant to agreeing with the Obama-time vocabulary of “Free and Open Indo-Pacific — FOIP”. It insisted on adding another I — inclusive. India deserves credit that there was not only a joint statement this time, but it even stated that: “We strive for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion.”The elephant in the room, China, could not be ignored. India’s insistence on an inclusive approach was in keeping with the sentiments of many smaller countries in the region, which may not take an explicit anti-China position. On the other hand, the Americans are clear about their containment policy. Both have met midway. The joint statement highlights maritime challenges in the region and calls for “collaboration, including in maritime security, to meet challenges to the rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas”. It is a clear indication of possible future joint action by Quad countries in the region, although India was never forthcoming about it in the past.Quad may not be a full-scale alliance yet, but a new “minilateral” is taking shape. Quad’s immediate focus on vaccines and sharing of responsibility was welcomed by India. India is already supplying 60% of the world’s vaccines. The initiative will further boost its vaccine manufacturing capacity. This could also pave the way for India to become the manufacturing destination for Quad countries, thus reducing dependence on China. Quad partners such as Japan and Australia were unhappy over India’s decision to stay out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. If Quad emerges as an economic powerhouse, it will be beneficial to the entire region.The region has had several multilateral and minilateral alliances in the past. East Asia Summit (EAS), Asean Security Forum, and the decades-old APEC are some of them. But these forums have become lazy talking shops without any discernible results. If Quad were to not go down that path, it should be willing to take the bull by its horns. The Indo-Pacific is heating up. A new Cold War has already started. Xi Jinping, the supreme leader of China, believes that time and momentum are on his side. He is flexing his military muscle aggressively. The grand display of military might on the streets of Beijing on October 1, 2019, on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), was intended to send out a clear message about China’s military preparedness. China has built extensive infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region from Djibouti to Kyaukpyu in Myanmar. Its Maritime Silk Road is as much strategic as economic. Its economic might is its potent weapon too.In order to tackle a belligerent China, other countries are also actively upping their strategic activity in the region. The US has bases from Hawaii to Guam to Okinawa to Diego Garcia to Djibouti. Japan has a base in Djibouti and is increasingly seen patrolling in various Indo-Pacific sites. Australia has its outposts at Cocos and Christmas islands. It undertakes surveillance operations from Butterworth base in Malaysia and is also operationalising its facility in Manus island of Papua New Guinea. France has its bases in Reunion and New Caledonia. Britain has Diego Garcia. India too is building ports in Chabahar, Chittagong, Colombo and Sittwe. It has an agreement with Japan for access to its facility in Djibouti. India is also building a military base at the North Agalega island in Mauritius.Militarism is, thus, very much in the air in the Indo-Pacific. China has dozens of nuclear submarines under the ocean. India has its own Arihants. The US and others have their own too. Nuclear Armageddon is not an impossible reality. Avoiding it requires keeping the levels of engagement below confrontation. The two big powers in the region — India and China — have thus far avoided any military alliances. It is important to keep the competition non-militaristic. As suggested by the Australian scholar Rory Medcalf, “development, deterrence and diplomacy” should be the way forward for Quad.Lastly, Quad must keep in mind the warning given by the Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong: “Asia-Pacific countries do not wish to be forced to choose between the United States and China”.Ram Madhav is a senior BJP leader and member, board of governors, India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-rationale-and-future-of-quad-101615738967822.html
14-03-2021||Today's||In India, the weakening of the institution of grand inquest||Legislatures have been called the “grand inquest of the nation”. About 270 years ago, British parliamentarian, William Pitt used the expression to describe the House of Commons. The occasion was the proposed investigations into Sir Robert Walpole’s government. Pitt told his colleagues, “We are called the grand inquest of the nation, and as such it is our duty to inquire into every step of public management, either abroad or at home, in order to see that nothing has been done amiss.” Parliament, this institution of the grand inquest, continues to weaken in India. Last week, protests by the Opposition, demanding a discussion on rising fuel prices, led to disruptions in Parliament. The two Houses were barely able to work for three hours each over the first three days. The fourth day was a holiday, and parties agreed to cancel the proceedings for Friday. Media reports suggest that parties now want the budget session cut short for campaigning in assembly polls. The first casualty of a non-functioning Parliament is accountability of the government. Question Hour, where Members of Parliament (MPs) quiz ministers about the functioning of their ministries, is the most visible mechanism for this. Last week, Question Hour barely took place. The second casualty is Parliament’s ability to debate the budget and scrutinise pending bills. Last week, Parliament passed a bill in each House, after discussing them for only half an hour. Suppose disruptions continue, and the session ends early, crucial bills will either get passed in the din without adequate discussion or get delayed till the monsoon session. Upset by interruptions, Rajya Sabha chair M Venkaiah Naidu asked MPs whether they wanted discussion or disruption. The key here is strengthening the scrutinising and deliberative ability of Parliament, which requires an overhaul of some parliamentary processes. For example, Parliament passed an amendment to the arbitration law last week. Since 2015, this is the third amendment to the principal act of 1996. The legislative journey of the three amendments is similar. Parliament passed the first amendment in 2015 in less than 30 days. It resulted in some “practical difficulties”, leading to the second amendment in 2019, which was approved in under 20 days. The third amendment sailed through during this session in less than a week. Multiple changes to a law suggest that just a debate on the House floor does not have the thoroughness required for scrutinising a bill. Parliamentary committees did not examine any of the three amendment bills. Its scrutiny has multiple advantages. The process builds a bridge between Parliament and citizens. Experts and concerned citizens can make their voices heard before the committee. It can also allay fears about the intent and the working of the law. Requiring all government bills to be looked at by a parliamentary committee is an easy step in strengthening Parliament’s deliberative ability. Another low-hanging fruit is significantly increasing the meeting days of Parliament and making its calendar inviolable. It will provide more time to debate laws. MPs and presiding officers have, often, suggested that Parliament should sit for at least 100 days a year. But more time for deliberation in itself will not solve the problem of disruptions, for the behaviour of parties is crucial. Meaningful discussions in Parliament hold the key to India’s democracy. In 2003, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, “In a democracy, there are bound to be differences among political parties, and there is bound to be vigorous debate among divergent viewpoints in Parliament. Differences and their well-researched, articulate expression both inside and outside Parliament is the very stuff of democracy.” He went on to say, “But the vitality of democracy also demands discipline, constructive approach, and a readiness to contribute to consensus-building on pressing issues before the nation — and adherence to rules.” He also championed the need to protect the institutions of democracy. He said, “Our ancient seers taught a guru mantra: Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitah. Dharma, protected, protects. In the same way, institutions, protected, protect.” Heed the message.
