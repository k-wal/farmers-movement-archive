22-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses woman’s petition to withdraw workplace harassment case||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently dismissed a petition filed by a woman teacher who sought to quash a case filed by her in 2019 against physical harassment by a male teacher from the same school. Observing that the petition seemed to be filed by her under pressure and an attempt was being made to sweep the dirt under the carpet, the court rejected the petition. It further held that the school management should have resolved the issue by adopting the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in the Vishaka judgment to curb sexual harassment of women at workplace.A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Bhalchandra Debadwar, while hearing the petition, was informed by advocate Ashok Raut that the woman consented to quash the case and said that she had filed the complaint due to some misunderstanding which was now cleared. In view of this, Raut said, the petitioner did not wish to pursue the case anymore.Based on her complaint, the first information report (FIR) was registered on January 16, 2019 at Chawani police station. The woman had alleged that the male teacher had allegedly asked the woman to accompany him for a movie in the presence of other teachers. She said that when she declined the offer, the male teacher allegedly caught her hand to indicate that if she was not willing to go to the movies, he could take her by force. She also alleged that the male colleague had been following her for some time and used to wink at her too.While noting the discomfiture of advocate SP Koli, who represented the woman and submitted her affidavit which consented to quashing of the FIR, the court observed that the informant may have been compelled to file an affidavit and tender a compromise undertaking. The bench referred to the part of the affidavit which stated “she assures that in future she will not file a criminal complaint against the applicant”.The court then observed, “This speaks volumes about the pressure possibly exerted on her, either by the applicant or the educational institution. In fact, we would have appreciated if the educational institution would have taken recourse to Vishaka Committee recommendations and Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 so as to initiate action against him.”In light of this, the bench said as the FIR and charge sheet clearly spelt out the offending acts of the male teacher, it was not willing to accept the compromise. “We find it unconscionable to accept such compromise as it would surely not be in the interest of justice and would be counter-productive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-woman-s-petition-to-withdraw-workplace-harassment-case-101616437791712.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Law aspirants concerned over delay in admissions||Law aspirants who are yet to be allocated a seat have expressed dissatisfaction with the admissions schedule recently released by the state common entrance test (CET) cell. According to the schedule, admissions to first-year law colleges will end on April 9. Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) has approached state minister of higher and technical education Uday Samant with its concerns about the academic calendar. “Most colleges, including law institutes, conduct their end-of-semester exams in April and May. However, first-year law students will have to follow a different academic schedule now because colleges will start lectures only in mid-April. When do they plan to hold exams then?” said Vaibhav Ekde, president of MSWA. Admissions to most professional courses were delayed this year due to the lockdown and the ongoing case challenging the constitutionality of the quota for Marathas in jobs and academia. The first list of the three-year and five-year law courses had to be postponed after the CET cell received complaints that students had submitted false information at the time of registration. A senior official from the state CET cell said, “We want to make sure that after all this time, no student is left without a seat so we will conduct admissions until all seats are filed up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-law-aspirants-concerned-over-delay-in-admissions-101616437611569.html
22-03-2021||Noida||Delhi-Meerut e-way: Phase 4 will be greenest with plantation of 40,000 trees by monsoon||Ghaziabad: The phase 4 of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) project will be the greenest among the four stretches of the expressway as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to plant about 40,000 trees on the 32km stretch (Dasna to Meerut) before the monsoon this year, officials said. The DME comprises four phases, of which phase 1 (Akshardham to UP Gate) and phase 3 (Dasna to Hapur) are operational. Phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) and phase 4 are scheduled to get complete by March 31, the officials said. The NHAI officials said that they have targeted plantation of about 40,000 trees of different species like neem, amla, amaltas, among others, on the sides of the expressway under phase 4. They further said that the median of the six-lane stretch will have dense plantation of bougainvillea. “The phase 4 has a lot of vacant areas which will help us plant about 40,000 trees as against about 500 under phase 1, about 1,000 under phase 2 and about 1,200 under phase 3). We have very less space available under phases 1, 2 and 3 and also there is no central verge having soil for plantation,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. He said that the watering at the central verge of the stretch under phase 4 will be taken up through the drip irrigation system while tankers will be deployed for watering plants on sideways. The plantation will be maintained for 15 years under phases 1, 2 and 3 while it will be maintained initially for four years under phase 4 and thereafter an agency will be hired for taking up further maintenance, the officials said. DME to link NH-235The completion of the DME project will help commuters get fast connectivity between Delhi and Meerut and will also be highly beneficial for long distance commuters travelling to western UP and Uttarakhand. The NHAI officials said that they have also planned to give additional connectivity from the phase 4 to National Highway 235 (60km stretch linking Meerut, Hapur and Bulandshahr districts), which will be a part of the proposed 594km Ganga Expressway project proposed to connect Meerut to Prayagraj with the help of six access-controlled lanes. “It has been planned that we will connect a 14km four-lane link from DME’s phase 4 in Ghaziabad to NH-235 in Meerut. This will largely help long distance commuters who wish to go to eastern UP areas. The linking project is scheduled to get complete within two and half years,” Garg said. “The 14km link road will start at Jainuddinpur in Ghaziabad where we have also planned an interchange which will help commuters reach NH-235 in Meerut,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/delhimeerut-e-way-phase-4-will-be-greenest-with-plantation-of-40-000-trees-by-monsoon-101616437251041.html

22-03-2021||Lucknow||UP’s water regulatory commission has chairman but no members since inception in 2014||The Uttar Pradesh Water Management and Regulatory Commission (UPWMRC), has been lying almost defunct since its inception in 2014 even as the state celebrated the World Water Day on Monday, people in the know of things said. The commission is entrusted with important functions, including regulating water usage for various purposes.It took four years for the commission to get its first chairman in 2018. He will demit office after completing his extended term on March 31, having ploughed a lonely furrow for around two-years-and-a-half with no other member or regular staff to assist him.The otherwise independent commission operates from the irrigation department’s three-room “borrowed” building in the Telibagh area here and has no member, no secretary and no staff of its own.“It is true the UPWMRC has no member and secretary to assist the chairman,” commission chairman and retired IAS officer Susheel Kumar said.“Though I took the help of the State Water Resources Agency’s (SWRA) technical staff from time to time, it would have certainly been better if the commission had its members and other staff too,” he added.Kumar, a 1982-batch IAS officer, was appointed the commission chairman in July 2018 after he retired as secretary, coal the same year. His appointment as the first chairman came around four years after the state government issued a gazette notification providing for setting up of a water commission under the amended “The Uttar Pradesh Water Management and Regulatory Commission Act, 2014”.The Act mandated the government to set up a full-fledged commission, comprising a chairman and members, not exceeding five, within three months from the commencement of the Act that came into being in March 2014 with issuance of the gazette notification.According to the Act, one member shall be expert in the field of water resources, one in the field of water resources economy, one in drinking water and wastewater management, one in agriculture/land management and one in the field of water tubewells/pump canals/ground water exploration and studies/minor irrigation works.“But the commission does not even have clerical staff of its own and has to depend on the SWRA for the same, leave alone appointment of members, and this has badly defeated the purpose for which the commission was set up. The commission could not discharge important functions assigned to it due to the lack of expert members,” said an irrigation department staffer working in the commission.The same Act also provides that the government would appoint chairman and members on the selection committee’s recommendations and the selection committee will be headed by the chief secretary and consist of eight other members, including the agriculture production commissioner and industrial infrastructure development commissioner.“Under the law, the commission has nothing to do with the appointment of members. I, as a chairman, could only request the government to fill the vacancies and this I did,” Kumar said.He said the government had initiated the process of filling all the vacant posts of members.“They have invited fresh applications for the vacant posts of members as well as the chairman’s post that is going to be vacant,” he said, hoping that a full-fledged commission might be in place soon.Additional chief secretary (irrigation) T Venkatesh, who is responsible for facilitating the process between the government and the selection committee for appointment of members and the chairman, could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.MAIN FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO THE COMMISSION UNDER THE LAWTo fix and regulate water tariff system and charges for surface and sub-surface water used for agricultural, domestic, industrial and other purposes.To determine and regulate the distribution of entitlement for various categories, periodically review and monitor the water sector costs and revenue.To determine the rate of cess charged from owners of land benefitted by flood protection and drainage work, help government form policies for sustainable management of water resources.To determine the allocation and distribution of entitlements for various sectoral water requirement, as per the state water policy.To promote competition, efficiency and economy in the activities of the water wastewater sector to minimise wastage of water, and enforce decisions and orders issued under the Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ups-water-regulatory-commission-has-chairman-but-no-members-since-inception-in-2014-101616436772136.html

22-03-2021||Pune||Health department employees allege they are being overworked||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department employees are upset due to overworking in the allotted Covid duties and conducting Swaccha Bharat surveys. Employees are tasked with handling critical duties like looking after Covid testing and centres, contact tracing, handling containment zones, taking action against those not wearing masks, and with the additional duty to conduct surveys for the Swaccha Bharat programme. Most of the staffers are tight-lipped and expressed their resentment in private to their superiors and public representatives. Currently, Covid-19 related work consumes between 10-12 hours of each of the staffers from top to bottom. The decision to entrust the health department staffers with the survey work will consume an additional three to four hours. Besides, they have another mandatory responsibility for cleaning and lifting garbage from different points the next day. The staffers play an important role in treating the newly infected patients including that of assisting family members in cremation. At this critical juncture, a vigilante squad of Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan competition already exists in the city. The squad carries surprise visits to any corner of the city where it checks the scale of cleanliness and performance of the health department. There are nearly 300 compliance points and currently, the health department staffers are facing the heat in fulfilling and completing the compliances. A ground staffer said “We are mostly occupied with Covid-19 duty for the entire day and it is tiring. We should not be overburdened as we need relief from our heavy duties. It will be around 14 hours that we are working at a stretch and it will impact our health.” A health department official said that staffers working around the clock for Covid-19 duty are being forced to work for the Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan which according to him has become taxing, cumbersome and tiring job. “We are already working for 12 hours and additional hours for the survey are being required from us. We are in a difficult situation as we already are on the frontline in our Covid-19 work. We request the authorities to relieve us of our suffering and ensure that our rights are protected,” he said.

22-03-2021||Pune||Tope: Vaccination could lead to herd immunity||The state government is now trying aggressively to vaccinate and use multiple modes to reach every corner. During his visit to Pune, health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government hopes to vaccinate about three lakh people daily in Maharashtra and increase the antibodies in most people and thereby bring in the ‘herd immunity in maximum people. Tope also said that the state hopes to permit smaller hospitals even those with 20 beds to carry out the Covid vaccination if they have enough Adverse Effects Following Immunization (AEFI) management in place. Tope said, “We will start the sub-centres in addition to the primary health care centres for vaccination in rural areas. We would ensure that if we get proposals from smaller private hospitals even if they are 20 bedded hospitals but have proper AEFI management infrastructure then we would send their proposal to the centre for approval.” Tope further said that the state has about 1.77 crore phase one, health care workers and frontline workers, and phase two beneficiaries, those between 45-59 years of age with comorbidities and senior citizens. For these, we would need about 2.20 crore vials and we aim to cover all beneficiaries under phase one and phase two within the next three months. Tope further said, “To control the spread of the infection those in home isolation must take special precautions to ensure that their family members do not come in contact with them. Also, society representatives must make sure that the person in home isolation and their family members follow all necessary protocols. We will also increase institutional quarantine facilities as needed.” The state administration has been pushing to begin universal vaccination for all above 18 as declared earlier by the district administration; however, they are yet to receive a response regarding the same. He said, “We understand that we first, need to vaccinate the most vulnerable population however we are following up with the administration to begin universal vaccination. First, we have asked the centre to permit vaccination for those below 45 with comorbidities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tope-vaccination-could-lead-to-herd-immunity-101616436532961.html
22-03-2021||Pune||Tope: Lockdown possible in cities with most cases||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope during a press meet in Pune on Monday hinted that a possible lockdown would be imposed in cities that continue to report maximum cases, including Pune. He said that discussions are underway with the chief minister, who is worried about the situation and will take a decision in the next two-three days. This comes at a time when Pune’s progressive Covid count has gone up beyond 0.471 million cases, of which 42,015 are active cases, the highest in the country. Tope said, “The chief minister said that if the daily Covid-19 case count continues to go beyond 25K-30K, then we will have to take strict action. The CM also opined that if needed restrictions could be further intensified, or a lockdown could be imposed in certain cities, and if need be, in the entire state,” Tope said. “On multiple occasions, the CM in his earlier conferences and addresses to the people has appealed, that unless restrictions and Covid- appropriate behaviour is followed, lockdown would be imposed. I appeal to citizens to respond to the restrictions and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour if we want to avoid a lockdown,” Tope added. Tope also said that it is likely that the number of cases will continue to grow at the current rate for the next two-three days, and then recede. He said, “We hope that this is the peak of the second wave and that the number of cases go down from here onwards. I would also like to point out that although it may seem that Maharashtra has the highest active cases in terms of absolute numbers, if we see the number of cases per million, then the state is at seventh position, with Delhi, Pondichery and Goa leading.” “We are completely transparent when it comes to testing and reporting and also, we are now emphasising tracing and tracking as per the guidelines set by the central team. Also the PM in his own conference with state heads said that states like UP and Kerala have more rapid antigen tests, which could lead to false negatives. Maharashtra is conducting at least 73% of its tests through RTPCR.” Earlier, due to the rapid surge in the number of cases in Amravati and Yavatmal, the government imposed a strict lockdown there. Following genome sequencing it was found that the mutations of the virus had led to a fast spread of the infection. The number of cases started to drop after a lockdown period of two weeks. In Nagpur, which saw a drastic surge, a complete lockdown was imposed on March 15 which has now been extended to March 31. Although lockdown effectively controls the spread of the infection it would leave a long lasting impact on the already reeling economy of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/topelockdown-possible-in-cities-with-most-cases-101616436531596.html
22-03-2021||Pune||Tope: Second dose of vaccine to be given 45 days after first||Following directives from the centre, state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday, in Pune, that the second dose of the Covishield vaccine is to be given 45 days after the first. “Whereas the Covaxin second dose will be given 28 days of the first dose,” the minister said. The central government, on Monday, wrote a letter to chief secretaries of states and administrators of union territories, asking them to increase the interval between the two doses of Covishield, one of the two Covid-19 vaccines being given across the country as part of nationwide inoculation drive. Earlier this week, state Covid expert Subhash Salunke had written to centre to increase the interval after he tested positive after taking the second dose of the vaccine. Tope said that till Monday, everything was the same for Covishield and Covaxin, including the interval between the two doses. “However, the Centre has issued fresh orders after a comprehensive study. Under this, the second dose of Covishield will be given after 45-60 days, instead of 28-45 days. For Covaxin, a second dose will be given after the 28th day,” said Tope, adding, “In the state, the second dose of Covishield will be given after 45 days.” Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and head of the CG Pandit National Chair of ICMR, said that this step will help inoculate more people as the second wave is hitting the State. “We are at the beginning of the second wave. And delaying the second dose will help the authorities inoculate more citizens. This will be helpful against the rising cases and will decrease the severity of the disease,” said Dr Gangakhedkar. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended two doses with an interval of eight to 12 weeks. Another report published in the medical journal Lancet, on March 6, 2021, also found strong evidence supporting “a longer-interval immunisation strategy”. Dr Subhash Salunke (73), advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 also tested positive on March 15, after taking the second dose of Covishield on February 23. He tested positive three weeks after taking the second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India (SII). In a letter to the centre earlier, Salunke said, for better efficacy, the second dose needs to be delayed. “This is as if the virus is avoiding antibodies among those vaccinated,” said Salunke. Earlier in March, two hospital staffers from the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital tested positive after taking both doses of the vaccine. Both the staffers tested positive 14 days after taking the second jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/topesecond-dose-of-vaccine-to-be-given-45-days-after-first-101616436531004.html

22-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: PHCs asked to vaccinate 200 people per day||Ghaziabad: Facing poor Covid-19 vaccination coverage in rural areas, the Ghaziabad administration on Monday took a slew of measures to bring more people to the vaccination centres. Besides, officials said that primary health centres (PHCs) have been directed to vaccinate 200 beneficiaries per day as against 100 at present.According to health department officials, the vaccination coverage in March so far is about 8-10% in rural areas with several primary health centres (PHCs) performing poorly. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey held a review meeting on Monday and directed for more vaccination coverage. “I have issued strict warning to medical officers in charge of four blocks in the district, and have asked the revenue department officials to mobilise people for vaccination. The PHCs have also been asked to take up vaccination of 200 beneficiaries per day. We will shortly take up another review about the performance,” Pandey said. “We have also asked our lekhpals (local revenue officials) and administrative officers to help out in creating awareness and taking up checks to ensure better coverage,” he added. The records of Co-Win portal suggested that some PHCs such as Tyodi PHC in Bhojpur (overall 13 vaccinations till Monday evening), Fareednagar (97), Ator (140), Bhowapur (127), Ghyaspur (115), Kakra (153), Farrukhnagar (141) and Mandola (111) were among the lowest performing centres.The health department at present is engaged in vaccination of senior citizens and people above 45 years having comorbid conditions. The vaccination is taken up majorly by 48 government health-care facilities across the district and another 31 private hospitals which are in urban areas. Officials of the health department said that they only have services of Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers to mobilise local population for vaccination. “More awareness is needed to bring people to the vaccination centres. We have asked the administration to help us out with active participation from administrative and police officers, besides the ration shop owners, to spread awareness among people and encourage them to come to the vaccination centres,” said an officer from the health department.In neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar, the vaccination coverage is much better as the district is among the top districts in Uttar Pradesh in terms of achieving their target for the month of March.According to Co-Win portal figures, GB Nagar has emerged as leader in vaccination coverage across the 75 districts in the state. GB Nagar has achieved 73.56% of its vaccination target (of 65,048) for March, while Ghaziabad has 49.7% coverage (of March’s target of 93480) till March 20. Officials of the GB Nagar health department said that they plan to open more centres to achieve the target by March 31. “At present, we are operating with 41 government health-care centres and 39 private hospitals. We have decided to add 12 more government centres soon. In GB Nagar, we have no clear demarcation of rural and urban areas, and many beneficiaries from rural areas come to get vaccinated at the nearest urban centres,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-phcs-asked-to-vaccinate-200-people-per-day-101616436351041.html

22-03-2021||Gurugram||Vaccine camps set up at condos, 250 receive jabs||To help senior citizens facing difficulties in travelling to vaccination centres and hospitals, the district health department on Monday held a day-long vaccination camp at two condominiums and administered vaccines to around 250 residents, officials said.“The response for Covid-19 vaccination camps in condominiums is yet to be analysed. It is a one-of-its-kind initiative to increase vaccination coverage. Therefore, our medical officers are coordinating with residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) that are approaching them. The expansion of the drive in condominiums will depend on the coverage over the next few days,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.On Monday, camps were set up at The Villas in DLF Phase-2 and Ridgewood Estate in DLF Phase-4, with private hospitals expected to set up camps at six more condominiums on Tuesday, officials said.Ritu Bajaj, a resident of The Villas, said she was informed about the camp on the society premises on Sunday. “The message was circulated on the society’s official group. It, therefore, became easy to take the shot. The entire process has been hassle-free as I got myself registered on the spot and got the vaccine shot within 10 minutes,” said Bajaj.At the site, a small registration counter was set up to register the residents on the Co-Win application, after which residents were given the jabs and made to wait for 30 minutes at a site designated for observation. However, the rooms were not separate, as specified in the guidelines.At Ridgewood Estate, the vaccination took place at a clinic within the premises of the society, while people registered themselves at counters outside. “There are 3000 people living in the society, of whom 45% are senior citizens. In the past, we have coordinated with the health department in getting our people vaccinated at the nearby health centre. We especially asked them to set up a camp in our society,” said Gurpreet Singh, president, Ridgewood Estate, RWA.According to him, at least 75 people took the shot on Monday. “Since a large percentage of the elderly population have already been vaccinated in the last 20 days, it is likely the second camp will now be held in mid-April. As the interval between two doses of Covishield has been extended by four to eight weeks, we have asked the health department to place the camp in mid-April for people who have already taken the shot in the first week of March,” said Singh.On Tuesday, camps are likely to be set up at Silver Oaks Society, Palm Springs, Mapple Heights, Pinnacle Club, Vatika Indianext and Ardee City in Sector 52.“Vaccination camps will be set up in at least one to two condos every day during this week. It includes Ardee City, Ireo Uptown in Sector 66, Park View City-1 in Sector 48, Uppal Southend in Sector 49), Ireo Skyon in Sector 60 and M3M Golf Estate. In most of them, our clinics are already functional, which makes it easy to set up the camps. A few RWAs have also approached for setting up camps,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, director and head of internal medicine at Medanta Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccine-camps-set-up-at-condos-250-receive-jabs-101616436111527.html
22-03-2021||Gurugram||Cloud cover gives respite from heat as fast winds clean up air||The city witnessed a cloudy day as gusty winds cleaned the air and provided some relief from the afternoon heat on Monday, even as rains give the city a miss.Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), who predicted light rain for Monday and Tuesday, said that while clouds had prevailed on Monday, rain-heavy clouds were missing. “We can see a cloud cover, but it didn’t rain in most parts of the NCR. In Delhi and Gurugram, there was hardly any rain. The prediction of light rain for Tuesday continues,” said an IMD official, adding the impact of the western disturbance is likely to subside by Wednesday.The minimum temperature on Monday was 21.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 34. 7 degrees Celsius. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 32 degrees and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday. A cloudy sky with one or two spells of rains and thundershower has been predicted on both Tuesday and Wednesday.The city’s air quality entered the moderate zone of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) with a reading of 170 on the daily bulletin, a significant improvement from Sunday’s AQI of 245 that was in the poor category.Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said that the strong winds with speeds of 30-40kmph on Monday aided the dispersal of pollutants. “Besides the wind speed, there is a rise in average temperature due to which hot air is rising. Most of the vicinities are clear, so pollutants are getting dispersed faster,” said Panwar.The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 136.72 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 242.41µg/m3.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality in the region is likely to remain in the moderate to the satisfactory category on Wednesday and Thursday. Subsequently, the air quality is likely to improve and remain in the moderate to poor category over the next five days. It also stated that the transported dust concentration had subsided significantly and no significant long-range transport of dust is likely for the next three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cloud-cover-gives-respite-from-heat-as-fast-winds-clean-up-air-101616436110986.html
22-03-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Over 25K vaccinated as Gurugram picks up pace||The district on Monday reported its highest single-day turnout for vaccination, at 25,005, under the second phase of vaccine roll-out that prioritises people aged above 60 years and those between 45 and 59 having comorbidities, according to the health department data.“The vaccination drive will continue at the same pace on Tuesday. The attempt is to curb the uptick in Covid-19 cases by vaccinating maximum people among the prioritised groups. The turnout remained low at private hospitals. Therefore, we have asked them to work on mobilising people and increasing their coverage,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Due to an uptick in coronavirus cases since the first week of March, the union ministry of health and family welfare called for an increase in the vaccination pace, along with testing and tracking new cases.On Monday, the district reported at least 121 new Covid-19 cases, taking the active case count of 973. The total tally reached 60,828, with a death count of 361.Given the rising cases, the state health department has designated a mega vaccination drive every Monday. As per the statewide data, over 248,312 people across the state received the shot, of which Gurugram administered the highest number of doses. The district has now administered 160, 253 doses since January 16.On Monday, over 80% turnout was recorded in more than 100 government facilities, as the district health department, under the mega vaccination drive, focussed on increasing coverage in rural and semi-rural centres.According to the district health department data, at least 17,794 people above the age of 60 years and 4,132 aged 45 to 59 years with existing illness took the vaccine jab. As many as 1,068 healthcare workers and 2,011 front-line workers also took the vaccine shot at 171 vaccination centres. Among them, at least 20,022 took their shots at government facilities while 4,983 did so at private hospitals.The health department had set a target of covering 20,000 people in a day but it exceeded the target by 25% due to more vaccination centres in rural areas, said officials. On the first day of the weekly mega vaccination drive last Monday, roughly 10,000 people were inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine in Gurugram.“Under each primary health centre, at least three subcentres were activated to reach out to people in rural areas who were finding it difficult to reach health centres due to distance. In all likelihood, people from semi-rural and rural blocks turned up in large numbers,” said Yadav, stating that details will be compiled in a day or two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-over-25k-vaccinated-as-gurugram-picks-up-pace-101616436053449.html

Any meat shop found open this Tuesday will be issued a warning but if the same shop is found open next Tuesday as well, then we will impose a fine,” he said. The MCG on Monday constituted 70 teams, each comprising four officials, to ensure closure of shops and identify violators, officials familiar with the developments said. The decision to close meat shops was taken in MCG’s budget meeting last Thursday. Two councillors raised the issue citing religious sentiments and after long deliberation, the proposal was approved. There are nearly 129 licensed meat shops in the city, with as many as 150 more operating illegally, according to MCG officials. “After a first warning, they will be penalised ₹5,000 for a subsequent offence, and if they continue to remain open for at least four consecutive weeks, there is a possibility of sealing their shops,” Singla said. Pritam Bhagat, the president of Jacobpura meat shops association, said that the association will abide by the order and close the meat shops. “We are not left with any other option. We have to face the brunt of the new rule and will have to suffer losses. We have already requested the officials but no one is paying any heed to it. We are helpless,” he said. Senior police officials also directed all station house officers to ensure law and order situation in their area on Tuesday. “We will take action against those who try to take the law and order situation in hand and is found violating peace in the city. We have received the order for the same and would ensure better coordination with the MCG teams,” said Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police, headquarters.

22-03-2021||Lucknow||NGT notice to factories causing pollution||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has taken note of air pollution caused by around 36 small and big factories operating within city limits in Bahraich district.The Bahraich Nagar Palika too had carried out an air pollution test in the city that pointed out increasing pollution level in the city due to smoke bellowing from factories. This pollution is causing respiratory problem among locals. Taking note of the issue after locals lodged a complaint; the NGT has sought a reply from the Pollution Control Board, Ayodhya, which covers Bahraich district. After the NGT’s tough stand, the Board has sent notices to factory owners warning them to cancel ‘no objection certificate’ issued to them if they do not comply with pollution norms. “These factories are in Dargah area which is within the city limit. In Chittaura block, just at city outskirts, Bhinga Road and Malhipur Road one can spot Dal and Rice mill units among other factories,” said lawyer Raman Kumar Singh, Bahraich district court. “None of these units have necessary equipment to check rising smoke carrying dust particles which cause respiratory problems. The Pollution Control Board has issued notices only after locals here lodged complaint with the NGT,” added Singh. Pramod Pandey of Irrigation Colony, Deepak Pal of Salarpur, Harish Yadav and Mukesh Yadav of Kalpipara among others have lodged a complaint with the NGT raising the issue. “Despite the Pollution Control Board issuing notices to factory owners, nothing has happened. Now, we are planning to file a writ at the Lucknow high court on the issue,” said lawyers Raman Kumar Singh and Nandan Srivastava. “One can easily spot dust particle in air in areas adjoining these factories. On days when strong wind is blowing, smoke carrying dust particles from factories covers several kilometres,” said Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ngt-notice-to-factories-causing-pollution-101616435990951.html

22-03-2021||Lucknow||Citing losses, UP liquor sellers seek return of licence fee, threaten stir||The liquor sellers association in Uttar Pradesh (UP) have threatened to hold demonstration if the excise department didn’t waive off the licence fee that were charged from them despite the fact that the shops remained closed for more than 45 days due to covid-induced lockdown. The excise department is among the highest revenue earners for the state government raking in ₹780 million ( ₹78 crore) per day for the state round the year, say officials. In UP, more than 4 lakh people are directly associated with liquor business.The government is yet to react to their demand. “No decision has been taken as yet,” an official said when asked if the government was aware of the liquor sellers’ demand. “Apart from lockdown losses, even when the shops opened, they were opened in a phased manner. At the moment the government coffers have crores of rupees that were realised as licence fees. We want to have it returned but nothing has happened so far,” said Kanhaiyalal Maurya, the general secretary of Liquor Seller Welfare Association of UP. Maurya said that more than ₹900 crore, realised as licence fee, have neither been returned nor accommodated as fees in the new session. Shiv Kumar Jaiswal and Devesh Jaiswal, both functionaries of the liquor sellers’ association said they would give representation to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and excise minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri in this regard. “They will also wear black bands as a mark of protest against the government indecision,” they added. This would be followed by a foot march of liquor sellers, they said. “The growing number of thefts that took place at liquor shops during lockdown dealt a double blow to liquor trade,” the liquor sellers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/citing-losses-up-liquor-sellers-seek-return-of-licence-fee-threaten-stir-101616435810934.html

22-03-2021||Ranchi||All Jharkhand Students Union party leader joins BJP||All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) party leader Ganga Narayan Singh on Monday joined the BJP which, in all likelihood, will field him from Madhupur assembly constituency to take on JMM-Congress-RJD grand alliance candidate in the by-poll scheduled on April 17.Speaking to media soon after joining BJP, Singh said, “I joined BJP to serve poor and downtrodden. Since my childhood, I admired Atal Bihari Vajpayee and now I am deeply impressed by prime minister Narendra Modi.”The election for this assembly seat is necessitated after the death of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha’s (JMM) sitting legislator and minister Haji Hussain Ansari in October last year.Singh, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly election on AJSU party ticket from Madhupur, embraced the saffron fold along with his supporters in presence of BJP’s leader of opposition Babulal Marandi and other state leaders at the party headquarters.Also read: Village heads in J’khand’s Kolhan set to get judicial powers under a British rule still aliveThe development is closely linked to the ensuing Madhupur by-election, nomination for which is to begin from March 23.In order to select its candidate, BJP’s state election committee, on March 20, had discussed on poll prospects of four probable candidates, including former minister Raj Paliwal and Singh who has also applied for the party ticket. According to sources, the BJP would announce its candidate name this week.Former minister Raj Paliwal had twice represented Madhupur assembly constituency in 2005 and 2014. He lost the election in 2019 at the hands of JMM’s Haji Hussain Ansari. However, AJSU party’s candidate Singh stood third in the 2019 election.With Singh’s joining the party, BJP insiders said that it has now become almost clear that the party would drop Raj Paliwal and choose Singh as its candidate for the by-poll.They said that the BJP wanted to keep NDA votes intact. “AJSU party, which is part of the NDA, may not field its candidate this time. If this happens, BJP candidate would get the party’s traditional votes and others as well,” the insiders said. On the other hand, JMM-Congress-RJD grand alliance is all set to field late Ansari’s son Hafizul Ansari, now a minister in the state, as its candidate.The grand alliance has taken a strategic move by elevating Hafizul Ansari as minister to give a message to the people of Madhupur assembly constituency that they would be voting to a person who is already a minister.Commenting on the grand alliance move, Marandi said, “Out of fear of losing the election, the JMM had made Ansari’s son as minister even before the poll. It, however, has forgotten what happened in Tamar when the then chief minister Shibu Soren lost the election. The same will happen in Madhupur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/all-jharkhand-students-union-party-leader-joins-bjp-101616432511788.html

The case is stated to be the first such one in Lucknow.“The doctor got his second dose on March 15, but he was suffering with cough and weakness. So, he was on leave after that. As he developed further sickness, he got his samples tested and the report came positive on March 20. So, he is in home quarantine,” said Dr SK Nanda, chief medical superintendent of the hospital.He also said, “The antibodies develop properly after 15 days of the second dose. Hence, a person may test positive shortly after vaccination. This is why following the Covid protocol is important even after the vaccine is administered.”“The doctor may have got infected by the day he got the second dose and the infection manifested a day or two after the second dose. But this can happen. Hopefully, the severity of the infection will be low in his case,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Lucknow.“It’s not a surprise and nothing to panic about. There have been several other such cases where a person got infected after a vaccine dose. This means the person has the virus, but with immunity he shall recover,” said Prof Kauser Usman, head of the department of geriatric medicine at King George’s Medical University (KGMU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/doctor-tests-positive-5-days-after-second-covid-vaccine-dose-101616432450770.html

22-03-2021||Ranchi||Police still clueless about stolen Gautam Buddha sculptures||Strap: Police conducted series of raids, search operations in hotels, suspected labourers’ houses, water bodies and hilly areas; Security beefed up at excavation site, borders  The Hazaribagh police was unable to find any clue in the ancient Gautam Buddha sculptures’ theft case despite a series of raids and search operations at hotels and suspect labourers’ houses, police said on Monday. “We are conducting raids and search operation at every possible place. We have not found any trace of the stolen sculptures so far. But, we will find it very soon,” Sadar SDPO Mahesh Prajapati, in-charge of the special investigation team (SIT) set up in the case, said. Recently on Saturday night, two of the ancient sculptures of Gautam Buddha out of nearly a dozen articles unearthed during an ongoing excavation by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on the foothills of Juljul hill at Sadar block were stolen in presence of security personnel and labourers working at the site. The SIT on Monday conducted a search operation in water bodies and the nearby hills. Meanwhile, security was beefed up around the excavation site in a bid to protect the remaining sculptures and artifacts. Checking was also tightened on borders to prevent transportation of the stolen articles from Hazaribag, police said. Besides, police were interrogating the five police personnel, who were on duty at the site on the night when the theft allegedly took place, to establish negligence that caused the theft. Responsible personnel might face suspension, police said. Suspecting international link to the crime, police also conducted search operations at hotels in the district on Sunday night. “Involvement of international gangs in the crime cannot be ruled out,” the SDPO said. Around 80 labourers were working at the excavation site. The houses of suspect labourers were also searched. However, nothing was recovered, police said. Meanwhile, excavation work at the site was temporarily suspended. ASI officials said they stopped work for two to three days to ensure basic security of the place such as barricading and entry gate. In its excavation so far, the ASI unearthed a complete shrine with a central and two subsidiary shrines, and a small Buddha Vihar-like structure. The team also discovered around a dozen sculptures, which expectedly belong to the 10th century, from the Buddha Vihar-like site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/police-still-clueless-about-stolen-gautam-buddha-sculptures-101616429870685.html
22-03-2021||Other||Village heads in J’khand’s Kolhan set to get judicial powers under a British rule still alive||Traditional tribal panchayat heads (Mankis) and village heads (Mundas) in Kolhan division of Jharkhand will soon get judicial powers back under the British-era Wilkinson Rule of 1837, which no legislation in Parliament has scrapped or amended to date. On a trial basis, West Singhbhum district administration has decided to transfer two civil dispute cases to Nyay Manch (judicial forum), officials said on Monday, adding that the two villages for the pilot project were yet to be chosen.Chief minister Hemant Soren, during his trip to Chaibasa in West Singhbhum in February this year, had announced to make Nyay Manch functional again under the Wilkinson Rule and directed the deputy commissioner to draft a Bill and rules for the same. “A meeting with Manki-Munda Samiti, superintendent of police, lawyers and other stakeholders on Saturday resolved to refer two old civil cases to a Nyay Manch on a trial basis. This will help us identify practical problems and formulate a Bill, rules and regulations for implementing the centuries-old system again on the ground in accordance with the present times and realities, as per the direction of the chief minister (CM),” Arava Rajkamal, West Singhbhum’s deputy commissioner (DC), said.The DC said the two cases would be dealt as per the draft bill prepared by them, under which civil disputes up to ₹5,000, title suits, division of assets and marital disputes can be referred to Nyay Manch by the DC and the divisional commissioner. Quasi-police forum of Mankis at the panchayat level and quasi-judicial forum and revenue collection by Mundas at the village level were in practice before India got independence from British rule on August 15, 1947. Mankis look after a group of villages, both in terms of civil, petty criminal cases and land settlement matters.Since no legislation in Parliament scrapped, amended or modified to define constitutional status of the Wilkinson Rule to date, the Manki-Munda system was still functional in Kolhan region, comprising West Singhbhum, East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts, mostly for revenue collection. In fact, the DC said Manki-Mundas collect and deposit land revenue of ₹25-30 lakhs annually to the district administration. Earlier, Mundas used to get a 6% commission on the revenue collected. Now, they were being paid a monthly honorarium of ₹2,000, he said. According to him, the trial will also help solve issues such as the limit of ₹5,000 that was impractical in current times, as even one decimal land was currently valued at ₹1-2 lakh. “The commissioner has proposed to hike the limit to ₹50,000. This trial will help remove such lacunae and we will send a modified draft bill to the government for formulating an Act in consultation with the law, and land and revenue department. Mankis used to help in resolving petty criminal cases such as theft and help police in grave crimes. Currently, the focus is on civil and marital disputes. A few divorce cases have come to my court in the past as tribal marriages are not registered under any existing Act,” said Rajkamal.Under the Wilkinson Rule, an agent to the Governor, who is the commissioner of Kolhan and his subordinate deputy commissioner in the current case, is vested with powers to form three-member and five-member Nyay Manch in every village and panchayat. “The three-member Nyay Manch operates on jury system, under which village Munda is the chairperson and both the parties in dispute elect one member each. In case of five-member Nyay Manch, either the commissioner or the DC appoints two Mundas and a ‘neutral’ person, while both the disputing parties will bring one member each. DCs are not supposed to overrule the judgment of Nyay Manch unless one of the parties files an appeal on charges of corruption,” the DC said.He said they were working on appointment and training process of Muharar (Peshkars) knowing tribal languages, besides preparing stamp of Nyay Manch and Manki-Mundas, as there will be no lawyers representing the disputing parties. The Wilkinson RuleChotanagpur came under British control after Robert Clive defeated joint forces of Nawab of Oudh and Bengal supported by Mughal emperor Shah Alam-II in the battle of Buxar in 1765. The British entered into agreement with local kings for revenue collection. Later, King of Porahat, a subdivision in West Singhbhum, gained control by offering a higher revenue. Kol rebellion took place in 1832 against high rent and usurpation of land by outsiders. The then British agent, Thomas Wilkinson, decided to declare Kolhan region as “Kolhan Separate Estate” with headquarters in Chaibasa and implemented the Wilkinson Rule in 1837.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/village-heads-in-j-khand-s-kolhan-set-to-get-judicial-powers-under-a-british-rule-still-alive-101616429810688.html

We are hopeful of completing the probe soon. If it is not completed in two months, we will take a call on roping in another agency,” said Alam. Roy, the Jamshedpur (East) legislator, through a short notice question sought to know if an “illegal” special branch office was functional between 2015 and 2019, wherein a private individual was “handling illegal operations” of the police’s special branch from a building that was provided by the buildings department on request of the home department. In its written reply, while the home department denied of any such operation, it accepted that two buildings were sought for office they were sanctioned in February 2018. While one of them was used as a special branch office, the other one was used as residence by a private individual. “Till now there is no evidence of any private individual handling illegal operations of the special branch. However, there is some evidence of the individual availing government facilities, that is being probed by the police department,” the department said in its written reply. Dissatisfied with the reply, Roy pointed out that the minister was not provided with the relevant details. He said he possessed information that the person who used the said premise was named Baidynath Prasad and investigators have already recorded statements of three police officers in the matter.The minister then assured the house that probe by the concerned authorities was likely to be over in two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/individual-used-office-meant-for-police-special-branch-govt-says-probe-on-101616429691376.html

The ISBT, being developed on a 50-acre plot with a parking facility for more than 300 buses at a time, has been opened with a limited number of buses originating from there.

22-03-2021||Patna||Bihar Diwas: Girls’ education, environment protection key focus areas, says CM||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said that Bihar was passionately and diligently engaged in reviving its past glory, drawing inspiration from its illustrious past to work on its road map for a developed and prosperous state. He was speaking at the Bihar Diwas function through video conferencing. Bihar was notified as a separate province on March 22, 1922, and soon after Nitish Kumar assumed power, he decided to celebrate it as “Bihar Day” to make people aware of the state’s rich legacy in different fields. This year’s theme of “Bihar Diwas” is the government’s ambitious programme for environmental conservation “Jal Jeevan Hariyali”. “Today is also the World Water Day and I thank the nodal department for the function, the education department, for making ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ the theme this year. Climate change remains the biggest challenge across the globe. In Bihar, we have been working on it, resulting in increase in the green cover from mere 9% to over 15% since 2012. Now, under the ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ programme, the objective is work on various aspects of environment and bring about required changes in our lifestyle, agriculture and approach before it is too late,” he said.“Bihar has been a land of knowledge and salvation. We must apprise our new generations of its glorious heritage. Education and environment are the keys and therefore, the government is working on both. While gender disparity in education has almost ended at the secondary level, with more and more girls now coming forward to contribute to societal progress in different ways, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali is at the nucleus of government planning with a slew of initiatives,” he said, adding that girls’ education also remained key to checking population explosion, as many studies had also pointed out. The CM said that every Tuesday of the month had been earmarked for stocktaking of the progress made under the environmental programme, which focuses on reviving water bodies, encouraging climate-smart agriculture, harnessing solar energy, ensuring rooftop water harvesting and creating environmental awareness. “So far, 15,229 water bodies like ponds, wells, ahar-paens and check dams have been revived and restored. Besides, around 12,000 water sources have been developed. The plan to take surplus Ganga water during flood season through pipeline to Nawada, Gaya and Rajgir is on in full swing and water harvesting facility developed in over 14,000 government buildings. Last year, against the target of planting 2.51 crore saplings despite the raging Covid-19 pandemic, 3.90 crore saplings were planted. Around 941 government building have been equipped with solar energy set-up,” he said. The CM, however, lamented that while Bihar’s progressive work, especially in the field of environment conservation, had drawn the attention across the country and abroad, which led to invitation at the UN roundtable last year, the awareness within the state had left a lot to be desired. “Maybe because I don’t believe in advertising my work, as many states do. It is for the departments and officers to take the message to the people, who need to change their approach as per environmental needs. In Bihar, agriculture remains the mainstay and climate-smart agriculture is the demand of time. The infrastructure development in Bihar is for anyone to see and match with what existed prior to 2005 in terms of roads, bridges and electricity,” he said. Warning against Covid-19 spurt Kumar said Covid-19 situation is Bihar was well under control, but had started showing signs of increase in the state too. “The number of active Covid cases was less than 300 till a few days ago, but now it has crossed 500 here also. Holi is approaching and we need to be extra cautious, as many people will return to their native places ignorant about whether they are infected or not. It can be known only through testing. I have done detailed meeting with officials in this regard and constant vigil needs to be maintained,” he said. Kumar said that without getting complacent, people need to draw lessons from the eight states, where the situation has worsened. “In Maharashtra, it seems to have crossed even the last year’s stage. Many other states are also witnessing increase. Awareness should be created to ensure that Holi celebration is restricted and not in mass gatherings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-diwas-girls-education-environment-protection-key-focus-areas-says-cm-101616429210620.html
22-03-2021||Other||HC asks law colleges to stop admissions for now, scraps B.Ed college appointments||PATNAThe Patna High Court on Monday stopped all the government and private law colleges in Bihar from taking admission for the time being due infrastructure deficiencies and lack of teachers, which, it said, were hampering proper education. In another case, the HC also quashed the appointment of assistant professors in the state’s B.Ed colleges, terming them illegal. Hearing a petition by Kunal Kaushal, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol has also sought replies from the Chancellor’s office, state government, universities concerned and others on the basis of the report of the Bar Council of India (BCI), which underlined that the law colleges did not have proper system for imparting education. Petitioner’s counsel Dinu Kumar later said that most of the 28 law colleges, affiliated to different universities in the state, were not following laid down provisions and there was no facility of proper education, which led to fall in quality. “The next hearing is scheduled on April 23,” he said. As per the Advocates Act, 1961, BCI is the regulatory authority for law education. Besides, there are legal professional rules, 2005. Though Kaushal had filed the petition with regard to TNB Law College (Bhagalpur) and sought direction to fill up the vacancy of principal, 10 regular teachers and eight part-time teachers against the sanctioned posts and remove infrastructure deficiencies, the HC had last month decided to take up the issue with regard to all law colleges, considering their pathetic state. The court also took cognizance of the attempt by the Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur university and the state to blame each other for large-scale vacancies in the TNB Law College and pathetic condition of the university. It also cited BCI rules for regular inspection of colleges. In its affidavit, the BCI attached the inspection reports of 26 of the 28 law colleges, which highlighted shortage of teachers and infrastructure. It also provided the status report of existing and required faculty members and class rooms of existing law colleges. “BCI has not approved the existing courses with existing sections for next or subsequent academic sessions. It can be done only after thorough examination of facts,” the affidavit said. B.Ed College appointments The single-judge bench of the Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay quashed the appointment of assistant professors in teachers’ training colleges of the state. The order came on Monday on a bunch of petitions by Ravi Kumar and others, which alleged that against the 478 advertised vacancies, appointments were made on 451 only and there was tampering in reservation roster. Earlier, the court had directed the state government to ensure appointments were made as per the advertisement, but there was no concrete action from the state government. Finally, the bench quashed the appointments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-law-colleges-to-stop-admissions-for-now-scraps-b-ed-college-appointments-101616429090650.html
22-03-2021||Other||‘Voters will give befitting reply to corrupt regime in Kerala’: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday hit out at the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala saying it was steeped in corruption and the intervention of the opposition only prevented it from gifting deep-sea fishing rights to a foreign firm. Addressing a series of election rallies in coastal areas of Kochi, Gandhi said people will give a befitting reply to the Left’s politics of vendetta, nepotism and corruption. In the midst of a stiff three-cornered contest in the April 6 assembly election, the party is relying heavily on the leader to retrieve its prospects. On a two-day visit, he will be addressing around 40 meetings and in the weekend Priyanka will also visit the state, said party leaders. “The government was on the verge of giving fishing rights to an American giant and it was stopped after the opposition leader raised it. Later, the government was forced to scrap the agreement,” he said. Gandhi said for youngsters in Kerala jobs were not a reality, but a dream. “The government’s primary responsibility is to give jobs to youngsters, not to their organization and cadres. The LDF government here and the BJP in Delhi have failed miserably on this. If you are a young person in Kerala, a job isn’t a reality but a dream,” he said. Earlier in the day, while interacting with students of St Theresa’s College, he said women are much more powerful than men. Later he showed some tips of Japanese martial art form Aikido to students as requested by them. “I will tell you a secret that men will never tell you, women are much more powerful than men,” he said. He asked girl students not to be under the illusion that they are less powerful. “Society wants to convince you that you are less powerful, but don’t buy it,” he said. But he asked women not to misuse this power. “Once you realized that you are powerful, then the tendency to misuse it also comes, it is not right,” he said. Last month, during his trip to Kollam, he swam with fishermen in deep seas. His frequent trips to the state worried the Left which is eying continuation of power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/voters-will-give-befitting-reply-to-corrupt-regime-in-kerala-rahul-gandhi-101616428131297.html

Although there are special squads and guards at all the three ST stands in the city – Swargate, Shivajinagar which is now shifted to Wakdewadi and Pune station, the officials will be helping them during the vacation season.“We ply extra buses on various routes from Pune during summer vacation. As the holiday season is approaching, students, working people and other passengers travel to their hometown or tourist places across the state. All our ST stands are crowded with passengers and so to give better service, help and guidance to passengers, we have decided to deploy office staff at these stands. Accordingly, our officers will be working throughout the day at the stands and also at various pick-up points, including Katraj, Wakad, Bhosari phata, Hadapsar and Yerawada. We are following all Covid safety precautions at ST stands and no passenger without mask is allowed entry in a bus,” said Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune division controller. “Also, we want to keep a close watch on private bus agents who take away our passengers from ST stands. Earlier, we had checkers at ST stand premises, but they can be recognised because of the uniform. Now these officials are in civil dress to check this illegal agent business at stands.” Gaikwad said. According to an ST official, touts and their travelling agencies park their buses and other small vehicles outside the ST stand and offer cheaper ticket rates to passengers visiting the ST stands. The MSRTC officials can only catch these agents and hand them over to local police stations.Shankar Jadhav, a passenger who often travels to his village near Nashik by ST buses, said, “Though there are additional buses plying from the stands, there is no coordination and proper management for reservations. A passenger new to the stand gets confused as to where to go for ticket reservation, parcel office and catch a bus for a certain destination. The stands should improve these facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-pune-division-to-deploy-officials-at-bus-stands-to-check-touts-101616426030399.html

As the number of Covid patients had declined in last few months we had relaxed this ratio. However, we held meeting with at least 40 private hospitals, in batches, and have asked them to reserve at least 50 per cent of their bed space for Covid patients. Otherwise, we will have to issue an order,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, PMC. Some hospitals have expressed a difficulty in increasing the number of beds for Covid patients, citing an increasing number of non-Covid patients. Abrarali Dalal, chief operating officer , Sahyadri Hospitals, said, “Considering the increasing number of Covid patients we are trying to increase beds across our units. However, on the other hand number of non-Covid patients is also intact and we have to give them required timely treatment and facilities. Therefore, it is going to be a challenge to keep a balance between both.”There are 23,000 active Covid patients in Pune, of which, 2,300 are in hospitals. Only 10 per cent of the patients are hospitalised. We have compared it to last year’s peak, when the hospitalisation rate was 18-20%,” said Vikram Kumar, PMC commissioner. “We are starting the Jumbo centres with the intention of keeping a backup ready. If required, the Jumbo facility can operate 800 beds. Last year, there were 3,500 beds available in private hospitals for Covid patients. We can still increase the bed capacity. We are monitoring the situation every day,” Kumar added. The COEP Jumbo centre has been operational from Monday, with 55 beds. Rubal Agarwal claimed that the bed capacity will be increased to 500 by Friday. Rajendra Muthe, head, PMC estate department, said the number of Covid care centres for isolation has been increased in the city. “We have started Covid care centres in Rakshaknagar, Shivajinagar, Balewadi, and Gangadham. Soon we will start a centre at the Agriculture College (400 beds); Babasaheb Ambedkar Hostel, Yerwada (300 beds); and the Marathwada Mitra Mandal College (250 beds). Currently, we are giving preferences to PMC and government infrastructure when starting Covid care centres,” Muthe said. MoU to ensure free treatment for the poorThe PMC has also signed a memorandum of understandings (MoU) with two more private hospitals on Monday, for the treatment of Covid patients from the lower economic strata. As per the MoU, this treatment will be free under various health schemes. PMC has signed the MoU with Symbiosis (Lavale) and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel hospital in Cantonment.

22-03-2021||Other||Many challenges for Uttarakhand govt in checking Covid-19 spread during Mahakumbh||A day after the Union health secretary wrote to the state chief secretary raising concerns over “inadequate” preparations to handle Covid-19 spread in Haridwar Mahakumbh amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country, the Haridwar district administration and mela authorities have stepped up the preparations for the same. The administration continues to face challenges given the pilgrim numbers that will turn up during the world’s largest religious congregation. The health department has decided to increase the number of tests during Mahakumbh mela which is scheduled to start from April 1 and go on till April 30. A government order on the same is yet to come. It has also decided to especially focus on the devotees coming from states, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where the cases have significantly increased in the past few days. Many experts are terming it the “second wave” of Covid-19 spread. Chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said that following the Centre’s instructions to ramp up Covid-19 precautions, the district health department has decided to increase the number of tests in the mela area by roping in private pathology companies also. “To ensure maximum random testing of pilgrims during the peak of Mahakumbh, especially during the Shahi Snans, we would increase the tests by about four times. We have also tied up with seven private pathology companies to conduct the Covid-19 tests,” said Dr Jha. He said that the administration has built a 1,500-bed Covid-19 facility for the purpose of isolating those devotees who test positive for the virus. “Apart from this, six temporary hospitals are also being built in the entire Mahakumbh area. Also, ashrams and medical colleges in Haridwar would also be utilised to ensure adequate beds for Covid-19 isolation during the fair which is expected to witness millions of devotees, especially during the Shahi Snans,” said Dr Jha. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had earlier eased out the Covid-19 restrictions in the Mahakumbh, including ending the mandatory Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report, saying that, “the mega-event is held after every 12 years, hence devotees cannot be stopped from coming.” He had also promised to run extra buses to ferry devotees from neighbouring states to Haridwar apart from requesting railways to run extra trains during Shahi Snans during the Mahakumbh. His move was questioned by many experts apart from previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat who had said that “lifting of restrictions would be highly risky for the state considering the rising number of cases in the country.” Later, on Saturday, during his visit to Haridwar, the chief minister had said that “the faith of devotees will overcome the fear of Covid-19” after which he tested positive for the virus on Monday. As part of precaution, the authorities would also conduct random sampling of people coming from public transport and private vehicles. “If any person is tested positive for the virus in public transport then he would be isolated in the Covid care centres as per the norms. However, if any person coming by his private vehicle tests positive, he would be turned back,” said Mahakumbh nodal health officer Dr AS Sengar. The official said that apart from trained doctors and nurses, medical students would also be deployed in the health facilities during Mahakumbh. He also stressed the strict adherence to Covid-19 precautions by those attending the mega-event. “To ensure compliance with the Centre’s guidelines, mela administration has started making relevant arrangements. Masks will be mandatory for all pilgrims which will be provided to them free of cost. Installing sanitiser dispensers, regular sanitization of Ganga ghats and water tap-soap facility for washing of hands is also being ensured by the mela administration,” he said. He also informed that during the first Shahi Snaan of Mahakumbh on March 11, around twenty teams of health department were formed for random checking of RT-PCR negative reports of pilgrims and tourists staying in hotels, lodges, ashrams, dharamshalas and guest houses. Amid the recent spike in Covid-19 positive cases, the administration on Monday held a meeting with dharamshala, hotels, tour-travel association, and traders to take adequate preventive measures regarding Covid-19. “From now onwards, the authorities would be checking hotels, lodges and dharamshalasas daily to ensure that they are adhering to the Covid guidelines,” said additional mela officer Ramji Sharan Sharma. Apart from the health administration, the police have also geared up to implement the Covid-19 precautions during Mahakumbh. Circle officer Kumbh traffic, Prakash Deoli, said, “Owing to a large number of pilgrims coming from buses and private vehicles, we have already enhanced the infrastructure at border check posts along with a ready to implement route diversion plan in case of pilgrim influx increasing during Mahakumbh.” He added, “The entry points to Haridwar from Narsain, Mandavar, Kali Nadi, Chidiyapur, Chila canal and Raiwala will be manned by state police and paramilitary forces personnel to ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines are followed by all.” The experts are, however, sceptical with the administration’s claims regarding the Covid-19 precautions, especially on the number of tests being done by it on a daily basis in Haridwar. Social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who had been keeping an eye on the pandemic situation in the state since the lockdown, said, “As far as the letter by the Union health secretary to state chief secretary is concerned, it suggests that the state has informed him that the government is conducting about 55,000 Covid-19 tests daily, something that is hard to believe.” “As per the daily health bulletin issued by the state health department, from March 1-21, a total of about 1 lakh tests have been conducted with about 5,000 tests every day, which is much less than what is claimed by the state before the Centre. With the number of cases rising again, the state should ensure foolproof facilities to handle the spread else it could prove very deadly for us considering the limited resources we have,” said Nautiyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/many-challenges-for-uttarakhand-govt-in-checking-covid-19-spread-during-mahakumbh-101616423990935.html

If everything runs smoothly, then a work order for 250 beds will be given. So, by Friday, 500 beds will be available at this Jumbo facility. This time, we do not want to take any chances,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner. After being made operational on August 23, 2020, there were several complaints regarding the Jumbo hospital. Major goof ups were reported, including critical Covid-19 patients facing a shortage of ventilators and inferior food, resulting in patients seeking an early discharge. The agency which had been initially appointed to operate the Jumbo hospital had to withdraw within 15 days, following the series of complaints. Officials said even as they have restarted the facility, walk- in admissions will not be allowed. Those who want to get admitted to the Jumbo facility will have to contact the PMC’s war room first. “Admission of patients to the Jumbo hospital will be done from the PMC war room. We will keep walk-in admissions at a minimum, putting them in casualty to complete the process. We emphasise admissions through our central procedure,” said Rubal Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/coep-jumbo-centre-opens-with-55-beds-to-increase-to-500-by-friday-101616422670288.html

The school management is also harassing students who have not paid fees during the online classes. Addressing a press meet on Monday, Jayshree Deshpande, president, Parents Association, Pune, said that Pune district does not have a district fee regulation committee (DFRC). “State education minister Varsha Gaikwad had assured us that DFRC will be formed for Pune district to address the issue of overcharging of fees, but no step has been taken yet despite one month.” The association reported that the education department does not have a list of affiliated schools in the district.“By law, it is mandatory for the education department to publish the list of affiliated schools in the district after March every month,” said Deshpande, adding that students of parents who are unable to pay full academic fees because of the pandemic face harassment during online classes. “Stress and depression are reported by many students. Now, the 15- 20 per cent parents who are unable to pay fees are given the option of financers by the school. Parents are asked to take the school fee as a loan from these financers at 3 to 4 per cent interest. And if a parent refuses, the child is harassed during online classes,” said Deshpande.The association said that the education department is yet to release the audit of 17 schools that are overcharging fees from parents. Audumbar Ukirde, deputy director of education, said that despite several show cause notices to education officers there has been a delay in giving the list of affiliated schools.“The department officials cite March-end as the reason for not submitting the report. Hence, we expect the list of schools that are affiliated after March,” said Ukirde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-schools-offer-loans-to-parents-unable-to-pay-fees-assn-101616419730109.html

Justice N Anand Venkatesh quashed a magistrate’s direction to the Coimbatore Police to register a case against those who cut a cake like that and said that “symbolisation of national pride is not synonymous with patriotism, just like how cutting a cake is not unpatriotic.”On December 25, 2013, a large cake iced with a tricoloured outline of India’s map with the Ashoka Chakra in the centre was cut, distributed and consumed by more than 2,500 people, including 1,000 children, in Coimbatore district. According to the complainant D Senthilkumar, the celebrations were also attended by the Coimbatore district collector, deputy police commissioner, various religious leaders and members of several Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The complainant’s grievance was that the representation of the Indian flag on the cake and the cutting of the same amounted to an offence under Section 2 of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Also Read | DMK leader humiliated lower caste people, judges: Madras HC“Patriotism is not determined by a gross physical act. The intention behind the act will be the true test,” the court observed. The justice said how the participants felt as they left the function must be considered. “Will they be feeling great pride in belonging to this great nation, or would the pride of India have come down on the mere cutting of a cake during the celebration? Without any hesitation, this court can hold that the participants would have felt only the former,” the court said. The judge compared the cake-cutting to people wearing the flag and discarding it after Independence Day or Republic Day celebration. “If persons are allowed to give such broad meaning to the word ‘insult’, many will become very uncomfortable and hesitant to handle the national flag,” the court observed. The court drew from the Rig Veda on the Indian ethos of tolerance and recalled Rabindranath Tagore’s remarks that, “Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter; my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live.” To underscore its judgement,, the court cited late jurist NA Palkhivala and American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson and said that “a patriot is not one who only raises the flag, symbolises his national pride and wears it on his sleeve, but also, a person who bats for good governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cutting-cake-with-tricoloured-map-ashoka-chakra-not-an-insult-madras-hc-101616418410719.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Lok Sabha clears bill which gives Delhi L-G more power||The Lok Sabha on Monday cleared the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to give more powers to the Lieutenant Governor in matters related to national capital’s governance. The bill was introduced by the central government in the Lower House of Parliament on March 15.Under the bill, the Delhi government will have to compulsorily seek the Lieutenant Governor’s approval before taking any executive action. The bill also says that the government in the national capital would refer to the Lieutenant Governor in context of any law to be made by the legislative assembly.Chief minister and AAP’s national convenor Arvind Kejriwal reacted sharply to the passing of this legislation and labelled it as an insult to Delhi’s people. Taking it to Twitter, he wrote, “The Bill effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by people & gives powers to run Delhi to those who were defeated. BJP has cheated the people.”Kejriwal had earlier too accused the BJP-led central government of seeking to drastically reduce the powers of the Delhi government by this bill. Echoing his concern, the opposition party Congress also criticised the bill. Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar said on March 16 that the Delhi government’s role will come down to a “mere puppet” at the hands of the L-G.Passage of GNCTD amendment Bill in Lok Sabha today is an insult to the people of Delhi. The Bill effectively takes away powers from those who were voted by people and gives powers to run Delhi to those who were defeated. BJP has cheated the peopleTrinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also joined the pack of leaders opposing the NCT bill. In a letter addressed to her Delhi counterpart on March 18, Banerjee expressed her full support to Kejriwal over the opposition of the bill and stated that the Centre’s move “devious, anti-democratic and anti-constitution “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has supported the bill by saying that it would ensure better coordination between the Centre and Delhi. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said last week the bill eliminates existing ambiguities and will ensure speedy development in the Capital. “The bill is aimed at promoting harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive. It clearly defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lt governor,” Gupta told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lok-sabha-clear-bill-which-gives-delhi-l-g-more-power-101616418091686.html

The HC agreed to the contention of the Election Commission that it cannot intervene after the poll notification was issued.Papers of three NDA candidates from Thalasserry, Guruvayur and Devikulam were rejected by poll officers on the last day of the scrutiny on Friday after they failed to carry their respective national president’s signature and other details. In Thalasserry and Guruvayur the form A, in which the party national president authorizes the party state leaders to allocate the symbol, lacked the signature of the president, EC officials said while rejecting their papers.In Devikulam in Idukki district, papers of an AIADMK (an ally of the NDA) candidate was rejected for alleged defects in Form 26, an affidavit submitted by the candidate. But the BJP alleged extraneous considerations and moved the court. The latest move has invited enough embarrassment to the NDA which will go to the poll without candidates in three constituencies. The Election Commission has questioned the maintainability of the petitions citing Article 359B of the constitution and argued that matter can be moved through an election petition and that too after the elections. The single bench of the court, headed by Justice N Nagaresh, later upheld its contention.Counsel for Thalasserry candidate, N Haridas, later said different yardsticks were applied by returning officers at different places. He pointed out that at many places, such lapses occurred and returning officers asked respective candidates to correct them but here no such opportunity was given.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) said these lapses were deliberate and it was a drama enacted by the BJP and the Congress. “Even a school student won’t commit such errors. Now BJP votes will be transferred to Congress candidates and in return, the party will do some favours to the saffron party,” said CPI(M) Kannur district secretary MV Jayarajan. The BJP said it will seek legal opinion to redress its complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-hc-refuses-to-interfere-in-ec-decision-to-reject-nomination-papers-101616416130670.html

He also said that no new liquor shops will be opened in Delhi."The legal age to drink in Delhi will now be 21. There will be no government liquor stores in Delhi. No new liquor shops will be opened in the national capital," Sisodia said at a press conference announcing changes to the national capital's excise policy."The new excise policy was approved by the Cabinet today on basis of the recommendations of the Group of Ministers. At present, 60 per cent liquor shops in Delhi are run by the government," Sisodia said."Government will ensure equitable distribution of liquor shops so that liquor mafia are thrown out of the trade. A revenue growth of 20 per cent is estimated after the reforms in excise department," he added.Delhi was one of only six states or union territories that pegged the benchmark at 25. An expert committee set up by the government recommended in December that the legal drinking age be changed to 21.In other cities such as Mumbai, only hard liquor is barred for those under 25, while wine and beer is allowed at 21. In major global cities such as New York and London, the drinking age is 21 and 18 respectively.This comes after the recent government data, which showed that the per capita income for a resident of Delhi in 2019-20 was ₹3,89,143. This is almost three times the national figure of ₹1,34,432.This indicates that the city has the required buying power inc ase the legal age is reduced.

More than 90 petitions are pending before the high court in various stages of hearing.“The hearing on these petitions, which could not be held for a long time due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, will resume on March 25. The principal bench of the high court will take up continuous hearings and we are hopeful of a favourable verdict soon,” a CMO official familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.According to him, the disposal of the case in the high court notwithstanding, nothing will prevent the chief minister from operating his office from Visakhapatnam. “A chief minister can work from anywhere in the state according to his convenience. Naturally, the administrative machinery should be available at his disposal. But legally, Amaravati continues to be the state capital till a final judgement is delivered by the court of law,” he said.“Several arrangements are being made in for the shifting of chief minister’s residence at Rishikonda and the camp office at Kapuluppada. There is talk of the CMO moving here in May, but nobody is confirming,” VV Ramana Murthy, a senior journalist in Visakhapatnam, said.AP Secretariat Employees’ Association president K Venkatrami Reddy, however, said they received no instructions from the government about shifting to Visakhapatnam.“The employees are ready to move to Visakhapatnam, but there have been no discussions with the government in this regard till now,” Venkatrami Reddy said. He, however, added the employees would prefer that the shifting take place before the commencement of the next academic year.The ruling YSRCP now has a strong argument to defend Jagan Reddy’s decision to shift the executive capital to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati, after last week’s stupendous victory in the municipal elections.The YSRCP recorded a massive victory in the municipal corporations in Guntur and Vijayawada and Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, the proposed executive capital with comfortable majority.“It clearly shows that the people have endorsed the chief minister’s concept of forming three capitals for holistic development of the state with the executive capital at Visakhapatnam,” YSRCP general secretary and parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy said.On the other hand, it was a big setback for the main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) which hoped to win Guntur municipal corporation by cashing in on the disgruntlement among the farmers of Amaravati over the capital shift. Following the defeat, the party has been silent on the demand to retain the capital at Amaravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-cm-likely-to-shift-his-camp-office-to-visakhapatnam-in-may-101616413130517.html
22-03-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal to legalise cannabis cultivation to boost economy||Himachal Pradesh hopes to earn ₹18,000 crore annually by undertaking the controlled cultivation of cannabis to ease its debt burden that has grown to ₹60,500 crore in the Covid-19 pandemic year besides generating job opportunities. Announcing the decision during the recent budget session of the assembly, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said, “The cannabis produced in the state is of high quality and there is potential to undertake its controlled cultivation. Under the NDPS Act, 1985, there are provisions for the cultivation, production, maintenance and transportation of cannabis.” Himachal Pradesh is not the first state to legalise cannabis cultivation for medicinal purposes and industrial use to boost its economy. Neighbouring Uttarakhand did so in 2017 followed by Madhya Pradesh, another BJP-ruled state. After two decades of debate, the hill state will draw up a policy for the cultivation of cannabis, which is otherwise exploited for making narcotics. Charas worth ₹960 cr smuggled out each year An estimated 2,400 acres in Himachal Pradesh is under organised illicit cultivation of cannabis. Charas worth ₹960 crore is smuggled out of the state each year and finds its way to western European and Scandinavian countries, while in Israel there is demand for Malana cream. The lower quality illicit charas cultivated in Shimla, Chamba and Sirmour districts has a market in Rajasthan. Hemp, the plant from which charas is extracted as resin, grows in the wild in all districts of the state barring Lahaul and Spiti. In the remote regions of Kullu district, hybrid hemp is sown clandestinely by foreigners to extract high-quality charas, which is sold at exorbitant prices abroad and at key destinations in India. Kullu legislator Sunder Singh Thakur, who had been advocating that cannabis cultivation be legalised, says “Cannabis extract is used in manufacturing medicines for the treatment of cancer and Alzheimer’s. It will generate employment opportunities.” Will generate 50,000 jobs, benefit 2.8 lakh families The decision to allow controlled cultivation of cannabis comes amid pandemic-induced unemployment and limited resources of income. Covid-19 hit primary sector mining, slowed down manufacturing and transportation and impacted tourism in the tertiary sector. Tourism, which contributes 7% to the state gross domestic product (GDP), is the mainstay of livelihood but it took a massive hit with tourist inflow down 76% last year as compared to a decade ago. “The state is facing a financial crisis. The controlled cultivation of cannabis will boost the economy as the government aims to earn ₹18,000 crore,” says Pradeep Chauhan, a retired economic adviser to the state government. The initiative will provide employment nearly 50,000 youngsters and directly benefit 2.8 lakh families in the low-income group, he says. Hemp, from tradition to mafia Traditionally, hemp was grown in parts of old Himachal, comprising Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Chamba and Sirmaur. Its fibre was used to make baskets, ropes and slippers and its seeds were used in traditional cooking. In the 1980s, foreign visitors or hippies taught villagers in Kullu district to extract the intoxicant resin or charas from the hemp plant. Foreign drug mafia operated behind them and soon scores of villages in Kullu started making a livelihood from charas extracted from the hemp or cannabis sativa plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-to-legalise-cannabis-cultivation-to-boost-economy-101616413074575.html
22-03-2021||Jaipur||Farmers’ protest: Rakesh Tikait to hold mahapanchayat in Jaipur tomorrow||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait will address a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Jaipur on Tuesday. Raja Ram Meel, president of the Jat Mahasabha, said the mahapanchayat will be held at Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium. It will also be the first such event in Jaipur to be addressed by Tikait, he said. “Earlier, he has held a few meetings in other districts, such as Hanumangarh and Ganganagar,” Meel said. “Farmers have understood that the Modi government has cheated them. The government is planning to hand over the agriculture sector to industrialists and farmers understand that. Therefore, there are countrywide protests against the farm laws,” he said. Meel said the BJP will suffer huge losses in elections, including the bypolls on three assembly seats in Rajasthan next month, over farmers’ issue. Earlier, Tikait held mahapanchayats in the districts of Alwar, Bharatpur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Nagaur, Jodhpur, Karauli. More than 250 organisations in the state have pledged support to the mahapanchayat so far. These include CPI, CPM, Bhim Army, Rajasthan Jat Mahasabha, Jamiat-Ulema-Ae-Hind, and Akhil Bhartiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad. BJP leaders say that through Tikait’s mahapanchayats, the Congress is only trying to make up lost ground. “The farmers’ protest and Kisan Mahapanchayat have completely become political. They [the Congress] want to keep the farmers’ issue alive so they are sponsoring and supporting Rakesh Tikait’s mahapanchayat but they should understand that the farmers of the state are not connected with them,” said Mukesh Pareek, BJP state spokesperson. However, state Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said, “BJP is frustrated because of the farmers’ protest. The mahapanchayat is being organised by the farmers, for the farmers. We are supporting it morally as our party also wants the black farm laws to be rolled back.” Tikait, who has been travelling to neighbouring states to garner support for the farmers’ protest, most of which is concentrated on Delhi borders since November 2020, has warned that the stir may continue till December this year.Speaking to mediapersons in Prayagraj earlier this month, the BKU national spokesperson said, “Had this government belonged to a political party, it would have talked to farmers and resolved the matter...But this government is being run by big business houses. It is bent upon selling the entire country.” Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national Capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/farmers-protest-rakesh-tikait-to-hold-mahapanchayat-in-jaipur-tomorrow-101616412890562.html
22-03-2021||Bangalore||I followed a boy to Bengaluru: Mayanti Langer||She is synonymous with sports anchoring in India, and her poise and grace has endeared her to millions who tune in to watch sports with love. Currently, she is being missed on TV as Mayanti Langer is on a break in Bengaluru after the birth of her baby boy last year.“My network was very supportive when I had told them of my plans to start a family. They moved a lot of things around for me; I continued to host till I was five months along, and I wasn’t really showing. I would have loved to continue anchoring till the end of my pregnancy, but the lockdown happened. I do believe that it would have been liberating to show on television that I was pregnant; it is a great message to all women out there who want to continue to work,” says Langer. The anchor, who started out as a guest sports anchor for a Football event before becoming one of India’s most prolific sports anchors, has had her share of detractors. Talking about dealing with trolls online, Langer says, “When I wasn’t pregnant, people used to fat shame me; surprisingly I lost a lot of weight post the pregnancy, and now people comment that I look malnourished. I’ve always believed you can’t make everyone happy, so it’s best to ignore the negativity.”Originally from Delhi, Langer’s work takes her to Mumbai, and she flies back to Bengaluru to be with her family. The sports anchor describes how she moved to the garden city, around a decade ago. “I followed a boy to Bengaluru (laughs). When I had met Stuart (cricketer Stuart Binny) and we started getting serious, we decided to stay together after we got engaged. That is how Bengaluru happened. I knew it was a long term commitment; my husband got an apartment for us and that is how I came to be here. I love the city, it has a charm about it,” says Langer. “From Cubbon Park to Chinnaswamy Stadium, there are so many places that I’ve come to like and we have a great group of friends here, so it feels like home,” she adds.But did she feel out of place when she first moved here? “Absolutely! I was a proper Delhiite. We would dress to the nines for an evening out with friends. But here, there is a calmer pub culture as opposed to Delhi’s clubbing scene. I remember being stared at when I once wore heels for an outing while everyone else was dressed down,” she reminisces. What’s next? “I’ve had what we call a pandemic pregnancy and my baby is a pandemic baby. I had to be completely isolated since I was in the high-risk category during my pregnancy, so as of now I am not thinking about a career or going back to work.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/i-followed-a-boy-to-bengaluru-mayanti-langer-101616412291667.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Deshmukh was in Nagpur hospital, couldn’t have met Vaze in Feb, says Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar said on Monday that the allegations against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh are incorrect and there is no reason to call for his resignation. He pointed out that contrary to former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter where he mentioned that Deshmukh met Sachin Vaze, a police officer who has been suspended in connection with the Ambani bomb scare case in February, the home minister was at a Nagpur hospital for Covid-19 treatment. He said a probe into the allegations was chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s prerogative.In his letter, Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of asking Vaze to “accumulate ₹100 crore per month from bars, restaurants and other establishments in the city”. Deshmukh has denied all the allegations. Pawar also said that the allegations were made to divert attention from the Antilia bomb scare case in which gelatin sticks were planted in a car parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani residence in South Mumbai.Even as Pawar claimed that Deshmukh was in a Nagpur hospital from February 5-15 and then in home quarantine till February 27, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised questions over the minister’s public appearance on February 15. Another BJP leader, Amit Malviya, said the home minister met a delegation of state Congress leaders on February 8, claiming that Indian celebrities reacted to international pop icon Rihanna’s tweet on farmers’ protest under pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Also Read | Ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh moves SC for CBI probe against DeshmukhParam Bir Singh, who was transferred from his post to Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17, made the charges in a letter a few days after Deshmukh told reporters that the transfer was not routine but due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by police officers in the Antilia security scare investigation.Defending the minister, Pawar showed a certificate issued by Alexis multi-specialty Hospital, Nagpur, where Deshmukh was admitted for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15. After being discharged, Deshmukh was home quarantined till February 27, following doctors’ advice, he said.“Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, in his letter, stated that Sachin Vaze, the controversial police officer arrested in Antilia bomb scare case, met the home minister (in Mumbai) in mid-February whereas the hospital certificate shows that Deshmukh was hospitalised for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15 in Nagpur. Later, he was home quarantined till February 27,” Pawar said.“In view of fresh evidence...it would not be fair to take Anil Deshmukh’s resignation… The BJP’s demand for home minister’s resignation has no substance… I am absolutely clear that allegations made against Deshmukh are incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” the NCP chief said.Meanwhile, in connection with Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death, ATS Mumbai have arrested two persons. The car parked near the Ambani residence with gelatin sticks was linked to Hiran. “There are some names which need to be investigated, which certain people may not like and thus, allegations were made against the home minister,” he said, adding, “I don’t want the probe to be diverted.” Also Read | Param Bir Singh takes charge as Director General of Maharashtra Home GuardThe BJP alleged that Pawar was misleading the public. “Shri Sharad Pawar ji said, from 15th to 27th February HM Anil Deshmukh was in home quarantine. But actually along with security guards & media, he was seen taking press conference!,” Fadnavis tweeted.Responding to Fadnavis, home minister Deshmukh said in a video statement that he met mediapersons before leaving the hospital. “I was infected with coronavirus and was admitted to Alexis hospital, Nagpur, between February 5 and 15. After being discharged on February 15, I answered a few media queries sitting on a chair because I was fit by then. Later, I left for my residence and was home quarantined till February 27. I stepped out of my home on February 28,” Deshmukh said.BJP leader Malviya also tweeted, “On 8th February, a delegation of the Congress party met Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, claiming that influential voices tweeted against anti-India voices, under pressure from the BJP. Where did the delegation meet Anil Deshmukh? In the hospital?” Racting to the claims, state Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the meeting was held online. “What @PawarSpeaks ji is saying is right. I had two online meetings with @AnilDeshmukhNCP one on 8th Feb with a demand to inquire into the tweets of celebrities and another on 24th February to demand investigation into the Delkar suicide case because HM was infected with covid and was hospitalized and then quarantined,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/deshmukh-was-in-nagpur-hospital-couldn-t-have-met-vaze-in-feb-says-pawar-101616406650048.html

She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".Directing the special judge (SC/ST Act) Hathras to conduct in-camera proceedings of the trial henceforth, the bench had warned that if any person tried to disturb the trial or attempted to threaten the life, liberty and property of the victim's family and the witnesses in any manner, it would take very serious action, including initiating contempt proceedings.The bench was hearing an application moved by the victim's brother who alleged that on March 5 that a mob, which included some lawyers, created a ruckus in the trial court and threatened the lawyer and two witnesses who had come to depose in the court on that date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-supremo-mayawati-attacks-uttar-pradesh-govt-over-hathras-case-101616403888630.html

Deshmukh has been accused by Singh of asking arrested assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze to “accumulate ₹100 crore per month from bars, restaurants and other establishments in the city.”“I won’t be making any such demand… I am absolutely clear that the allegations made against Deshmukh are incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” Pawar said addressing reporters at his residence in Delhi.In his letter to Shiv Sena chief Thackeray, Singh had mentioned meeting Deshmukh at his residence “in and around mid-February.” It was at this meeting, the senior police officer alleged that the home minister gave Vaze the target to accumulate ₹100 crore a month.Also Read | Param Bir Singh confirms he sent letter to Maharashtra CM Uddhav ThackerayThe senior NCP leader once again backed Deshmukh citing coronavirus disease. “Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter stated that Sachin Vaze met the home minister in mid-February whereas the hospital certificate clearly states that he was hospitalised for Covid-19 treatment between February 5 and 15 in Nagpur.

22-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM Rawat tests positive for Covid-19||Two days after Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said faith will overcome fear of virus, he tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. Rawat tweeted, “My Corona test report has come positive. I am fine and not facing any difficulty. I have isolated myself under the monitoring of doctors. Those of you who have come into contact with me in last few days, should be cautious and get their tests done. I wish good health to all”. Rawat visited Haridwar thrice after becoming the chief minister and mingled with huge crowds of pilgrims and ascetics, with hardly anyone following Covid-19 norms. Rawat himself was not wearing any mask, as is evident in the images taken of him in Haridwar during the shahi snan on March 11. Also Read | Now, Uttarakhand CM says US enslaved India for 200 yearsHaridwar recorded the maximum number of active Covid-19 cases out of all 13 districts in the state. After Rawat took charge as chief minister, he stressed that there should be no unnecessary restriction on pilgrims wishing to attend the Mahakumbh. Two days ago, during his visit to Haridwar, Rawat said, “Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus”. Worried over the situation in Haridwar in the context of Mahakumbh and Rawat’s recent statements,the Centre on Sunday directed Uttarakhand to take stringent measures to check the spread of Covid-19 during Mahakumbh. Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, wrote to chief secretary, Uttarakhand, Om Prakash, that currently over 12 states in India have shown a surge in Covid-19 cases during the past few weeks, and cases could rise in the local population after the shahi snan days during the Kumbh Mela. The secretary also noted that as per the report of the Central team that visited Haridwar a few days ago, 10 to 20 pilgrims and 10 to 20 locals are testing positive for Covid-19 every day in Haridwar. This positivity rate has the potential to rapidly turn into an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh, the secretary stressed. In January, the Central government had issued an SOP for Mahakumbh, with strict guidelines like mandatory negative Covid-19 test report, following which the state government also issues guidelines for Mahakumbh. But Rawat, who visited Haridwar thrice after taking charge,has been repeatedly saying there won’t be unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims. Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,448 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,566 cases are from the Haridwar district. Millions of pilgrims flock to Mahakumbh, especially on shahi snan (royal holy bath days) days. The first was on March 11 and the remaining three are on April 12, April 14 and April 27. Images of the first shahi snan showed visitors gathered in large groups as 3.3 million attended the event without following Covid-19 norms. In December last year, then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had also tested positive for Covid-19 and isolated himself at his residence. Rawat had also shared the development on his Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cm-rawat-tests-positive-for-covid19-101616402570121.html
22-03-2021||Other||Monday musings: Fatal flirt with Covid-19 will bring back lockdown||That the tally of Covid positive patients crossed the previous peak in Pune within 45 days of a surge was noticed, is indication enough a second wave of Covid-19 infections is here and likely to stay for some time. The blaring of ambulance sirens, similar to August-September last year, is just the reminder of the same.During the first wave, it took 202 days – starting from March 9, 2020, to September 16, 2020, - for the number of cases to reach its peak. During the second wave, the graph of Covid-positive cases began moving upward from early February, crossing the previous peak of 5,048 infections in 24 hours, on September 16 last year, with 5,098 cases on March 21. The district has been reporting close to 5,000 cases for the past few days with thee positivity rate hovering above 20 per cent. The district has once again earned a distinction of reporting the highest number of cases across India, with Pune alone accounting for 10 per cent of the country’s daily case load. Within the district, most cases are from Pune city with a population of around 50 lakh, followed by Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural parts. Between March 1 and March 20, the number of cases in these parts has risen by over 400%. The question many are asking is, why has Pune not been able to stop the spread of the virus despite measures in place? It’s been more than a month Pune is put under restrictions such as night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, capping of crowds inside restaurants and bars, and prohibiting social and political gatherings. Yet, Pune’s positivity rate is refusing to come down, let alone return to the mid-January level of 4.5 per cent. Positivity rate is the total number of cases that test positive for Covid-19 against the total tests done. The state’s positivity rate crossed 24% in September and October 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Maharashtra. With people still crowding, and super spreaders not being tested or being stopped from coming in contact with the public, the second wave is likely to be worse than the first. The Pune rural administration is testing super spreaders, though this is inadequate as the area is large and there’s a shortage of manpower. Pune city’s administration, therefore, immediately needs to follow the Brihan Mumbai municipal corporation’s initiative of random testing without citizens’ consent at crowded places like malls, railway stations, bus depots, khau gallis, markets, tourist places, and government offices.If a citizen refuses to get tested, they’d be booked under the Epidemic Act. However, testing people on a mass scale may not be enough as the infection has already spread and people are unwilling to shun stepping outside, that too without adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour.There’s visible complacency among most, over how Pune beat the first wave as they forget the peak had wreaked havoc with critical patients dying without beds and ambulances. The last option then is to curb people from gathering in public places. A lockdown, as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has repeatedly said, comes as a last resort to flatten the curve, which at this time is refusing to be tamed. However, there is collateral damage as a lockdown will halt economic activity, the result of which will be harsher for everyone. Earlier this month, the government had imposed a lockdown in places like Amravati and Yavatmal, where the tally had substantially risen, though the administration managed to contain the march of Covid after a strict lockdown of two weeks. Nagpur, Maharashtra’s other big city, has been through a week of complete lockdown. For Pune, it’s an option worth exploring. At the same time, vaccinations must be open for all without delay.Currently, there are 230 centres vaccinating 5,000-plus people every day. However, this is not enough for a district with population of over one crore. The administration has already mooted a proposal to the centre for inoculation of everyone in the district. For the city, where Covid vaccines are being produced on a mass level, and being consumed by the rest of India, the cry for increased doses is an irony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-fatal-flirt-with-covid-19-will-bring-back-lockdown-101616401609302.html

The CBI team visited the SEBI office in Bandra- Kurla- Complex at Bandra in the morning.“The CBI’s searches are going on at six locations in Mumbai including the residences of the three SEBI officials found allegedly involved in the scam,” a CBI source confirmed, adding that the agency will share more details once the search is over. The Saradha Group of companies allegedly duped people to the tune of ₹2,500 crore, promising higher returns on their investments. A CBI official said on the condition of anonymity that the senior officials’ role came under the scanner in connection with the operators of the scheme. These officials were posted at SEBI’s Kolkata office between 2009 and 2013.Also Read | Saradha scam: TMC’s Madan Mitra, Vivek Gupta depose before ED officialsThe Saradha Group scam began to unravel in 2013 when investors demonstrated in front of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) office, demanding government action against the group’s officials for defaulting on payments. There are multiple FIRs against the Saradha Group in West Bengal.The case finally blew up in April 2013 when the chairman of the Group, Sudipta Sen, and the company’s executive director, Debjani Mukherjee, were arrested by CBI from Jammu and Kashmir after a chase across north India during which they kept moving in an SUV.A multi-agency probe is on, including the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as well. Last week, the ED quizzed at least two TMC leaders, Madan Mitra, and Vivek Gupta, who have been fielded as candidates for the coming assembly elections. The ED has also summoned another former TMC MP, Ahmed Hassan Imran, and two former IPS officers, Rajat Majumdar and Surajit Kar Purkayastha, in connection with the case on March 24 and 25. Earlier last week, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh was summoned by the central agency. Both Madan Mitra and Ghosh had earlier been arrested in the case but later released on bail.

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Guv should submit report to President about ‘corruption’ in Maharashtra: BJP||Drawing a parallel between the current situation in the state with the one in 1980 when President’s rule was imposed, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded that Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari send a report to the President of India apprising him of the existing scenario in the state. The BJP, while clarifying that they do not want to demand President’s rule, has announced that its leaders will meet the governor to press this demand on March 24.Senior BJP leader and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar in a press conference held at the party’s Nariman Point office, also said on Monday that several government officials have been complaining about corruption in the administration and the pressure they have been going through to be part of the malpractices. Mungantiwar said that the officers should come forward and submit their complaints to the governor with proof. Also Read | ‘You’ll burn in that fire’: Raut warns against ‘President’s rule’ in Maharashtra“The allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh are very serious in nature, despite which the state government has been dismissing them. Singh, in his letter, said that he had apprised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about the home minister’s illegal demand of police officers collecting money from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Neither the officers, who have been quoted in Singh’s letter have denied it, nor have the associations of bars and restaurants come forward to do so. The state government has been taking it very lightly, which could lead to serious repercussions on the morale of the police force,” Mungantiwar said.He said that in such a situation, the governor should ask for a report from the chief minister and chief secretary of the state and send it to the President of India.“A similar report was sent in September, 1980, when the Sharad Pawar-led Progressive Democratic Front government was in power in the state, to the president. Based on that, President’s rule was imposed in the state. I think similar turmoil exists today in the state and it should be reported to the President by the governor.

A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh is likely to hear the plea. The single judge’s order had come after a plea by US retail giant Amazon sought action against the Kishore Biyani-led Future group for their violation of the EA’s order. The plea had also sought the detention of Future group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block Future group from selling retail assets to Reliance Industries.Also Read | HC restrains Future, upholds Singapore tribunal’s rulingOn March 18, justice JR Midha upheld the Singapore’s EA order stalling the deal.

Midha also asked FRL to file an affidavit declaring all its assets within 30 days.On October 25, 2020, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party. However, the FRL had contended that the EA’s award is not enforceable. On February 2, justice Midha had asked FRL to maintain “status quo” on its ₹24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail. The judge had also directed all the authorities like SEBI, NCLT to also maintain status quo regarding the deal while also asking them to list out all the steps and actions taken after the order of the Emergency Arbitrator of Singapore.The challenge to this order is pending adjudication in the Supreme Court. On February 8, a division bench of the Delhi high court had stayed the single judge’s findings and given a go-ahead for the deal.

I walked back to my home that is around 500m from the centre,” she said. She also appealed to people to avail the shot in order to beat the virus.However, health officials initially faced some problems in getting her vaccinated, as Co-WIN, the Union government’s vaccine portal, was not accepting her entry due to her age. District data manager (DDM) of National Health Mission (NHM), Koderma, Pawan Kumar said, “As per the Aadhaar card, her date of birth is 1914. So, we faced some technical problem in the system, as the portal was not accepting her date of birth. The portal doesn’t have the feature to accept date of birth of people born before 1920. We, however, have alternative options that we applied in this case.”Khatun’s eldest son Md Jamiruddin said her mother doesn’t suffer from any comorbid conditions. “She is fit and fine so far. She gets up at 4.30am in the morning daily and offer prayer five times in a day,” he said.Khatun was the beneficiary of state’s special Covid-19 vaccination drive launched by the state health department on the Panchayat level. The drive took off on Saturday and will conclude on March 27. The campaign will take place in three phases. The first phase that started on Saturday concluded on Sunday. The second phase was scheduled for March 23 and 24, while the third phase will begin for March 26 to March 27.State nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad, “The special drive is receiving good response. On Saturday, a total of 1.20 lakh people were given the shot. We are hoping to cross the figure on Sunday.” He said they have set a target to administer Covid-19 vaccine to 1.5 lakh people per day. “In six days of the drive, nine to 10 lakh people will be given the shot,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/107yrold-lady-takes-the-jab-in-koderma-district-101616381688266.html
22-03-2021||Ranchi||Two 10th century sculptures of Gautam Buddha unearthed during excavation in Hazaribag stolen||Two ancient sculptures of Gautam Buddha, reportedly from 10th century, that were unearthed during an excavation by Archeological Survey of India on foothills of Juljul hill at Sadar block of Hazaribagh district were stolen on Saturday night, officials said on Sunday. Hazaribagh deputy commissioner (DC) Aditya Kumar Anand, who visited the site on Sunday along with superintendent of police (SP) Karthik S and other officials said, “We have started investigation into the matter. I will not comment on the issue at the moment.” Last year, the ASI identified three mounds on the foothills having links to Buddhism. The excavation of the first mound led to the discovery of a complete shrine with a central and two subsidiary shrines, merely two metres below the surface. In the second round of excavation, beginning last week of January this year, the second mound, around 40m away from the first mound, was excavated and a small Buddha Vihar-like structure was discovered. Around a dozen sculptures of Gautam Buddha and Tara were also discovered during the excavation. However, two sculptures of Gautam Buddha in seated position were stolen despite deployment of security personnel at the site. The sculptures made of sand stone were less damaged, ASI officials said. Superintending archaeologist, excavation branch-III of ASI, Rajendra Dehuri, said, “The sculptures and artifacts unearthed during the excavation were kept in-situ (on site). There were security personnel and labourers at the site. The administration team is investigating into the matter.” Former deputy director at state archaeology department, HP Sinha, said, “The price of the sculpture is dependent on the period it belongs to. The two stolen sculptures belonged to somewhere between ninth and eleventh century, as per my knowledge. Their prices in the international market will go in crores, as they are antique and linked to Buddhism.” He said, “This is an organised crime having involvement of some locals. The ASI and district administration should have understood its value and enforced proper security.” Last week on Friday, some legislators during the ongoing Assembly session raised concerns that the sculptures and artifacts unearthed during the excavation will be taken to Bihar, as the excavation was done by the Bihar chapter of ASI. However, representing the government, agriculture minister Badal Patralekh told the legislators that the chief minister directed the ASI chief secretary to not send the sculptures unearthed in Hazaribag to Bihar. “They will be preserved at the same location and it will be developed as tourist spot,” he said. Meanwhile, Hazaribagh MP Jayant Sinha demanded a CBI probe into the matter. Sinha, while posting his comment on social media platform Facebook, alleged, “The Jharkhand government has failed to provide security to the ancient sculptures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/two-10th-century-sculptures-of-gautam-buddha-unearthed-during-excavation-in-hazaribag-stolen-101616381569455.html

Everybody knows Bihar is marching ahead on the path of progress and prosperity under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar.” He said the mistake would be rectified at the earliest.Meanwhile, while the DNB courses have been started at the government medical college at Purnia in obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and general medicine. Twelve seats have been allotted to each course.DNB course is a three-year postgraduate residency programme and is among the simplest post graduate or post-doctoral equivalent programmes.The launch of DNB courses is believed to be the beginning of the 500-bed with 100 students admission in MBBS courses every year. The government medical college in Purnia has not been yet inaugurated. Once ready, it will have 500-bed hospital and initial sanctioned intake of 100 students for MBBS course every year.

22-03-2021||Other||World Water Day: Parched patches growing in rain-fed Bihar||PATNADeclining annual rainfall and its erratic pattern are threatening water security in water surplus Bihar, a state crisscrossed by rivers.Kicking off the awareness campaign for “Jal Jeevan Hariyali” environment conservation programme on Earth Day in August 2019, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had underlined the vagaries of nature Bihar was grappling with due to constantly falling annual rainfall statistics, which dropped from 1200-1500 mm to 800-900 mm in 40 years. In some years in the last one decade, it fell even below 800 mm, though the state still witnessed floods in some areas and drought in others. What is distressing, according to a study by the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI) under Bihar’s water resources department, is that the state does not have enough storage capacity by way of dams and reservoirs to store water and prevent them from going waste. The study says Bihar has just 950 million cubic metres of storage capacity in its 22 dams, which is not even 5% of its requirement, so far mostly met by rain, and in the situation of scanty rainfall, seasonal fluctuations or erratic rain pattern, the largely rain-fed agriculture could suffer. According to the study, the per capita availability of water in Bihar is reducing progressively owing to increasing population. In 1991, the average per capita availability in Bihar was around 5,342 cubic metres/year, but it dropped alarmingly in the last 30 years to 1,594 cubic metres in 2001 and could reach 1006 cubic metres in 2025 and further to less than half at 635 cubic metres in 2050. The statistics were also shared in the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said anticipating the problem well in time, the CM has embarked on an ambitious programme to rejuvenate lost water bodies and ensuring optimal use of surplus water in rivers during floods by diverting them to parched areas, viz. project to take Ganga water to Gaya, Nawada and Rajgir and ensure water to every farm in the next five years. “Lakhandei river, which was the lifeline of Sitamarhi, had been lost to encroachment and garbage dumps, but now it has been revived up to 18 kms, while the work is on for the last leg of four kms. The CM has also consistently raised the issue of heavy siltation in the Ganga and called for the need of a national silt policy,” the minister said. He said with areas like Darbhanga in north Bihar feeling water stress, the alarm bell was truly ringing. “This is precisely what drew the attention of the CM and led to the big environmental programme that has even drawn praise from the UN. The CM was invited to UN’s high-level climate change roundtable on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last year,” he said. Prof Dilip Kumar at WALMI said irrigation sector consumes as much as 83% of available water resources. “With demand form other sectors rising at faster pace, the availability of water for irrigation is likely to reduce. It is, therefore, necessary to improve the performance of existing system. Highest degree of efficiencies in water use in irrigation sector may have to be achieved to meet the requirement of water in irrigation sector. It is high time all water using sectors treat water as a scarce resource and try to manage within the availability,” he said. On the occasion of World Water Day, celebrated on March 22 every year to raises awareness about 2.2 billion people living without access to safe water and to create a more comprehensive understanding of how water is valued by different people in different contexts so that we can safeguard this precious resource for everyone, Kumar said it was important for Bihar to learn its lessons fast. “This year’s theme is ‘valuing water’. It is all about how we manage and share it. Today, we have started feeling the pinch. Tomorrow, we the situation may get worse. We must remember water is fundamental to food security. Bihar was once known for its water bodies. Now time has come to work on the concept of river lakes, utilizing the vast river beds, to prevent flood water from going waste. The Bihar government has already started focusing on water management through a slew of schemes,” he said. A cause for alarmFalling annual rainfallAnnual rainfall in Bihar dropped from 1200-1500 mm to 800-900 mm in the last 40 years. Also, it’s become more erratic. Storage capacityBihar has just 950 million cubic metres of storage capacity in its 22 dams, which is not even 5% of its requirement.

The fermented bamboo shoot is available too, and what’s this long green veggie?“It’s stinky beans.... yongchak,” says Phungreingam Hungyo. He explains that “we call it stinky because of its strong smell.”Mr Hungyo founded the shop in 2013. The establishment is very small, and looks too simple against the razzmatazz of neighbouring Bengali Sweet House and Chaman General Store. Yet, Northeast is a more important landmark. Because you hardly see such a specialised store elsewhere in the city. Because its very presence highlights Chirag Delhi’s barely-acknowledged cosmopolitanism — there are enough people here from the northeastern parts of the country for this store to stay in business.In his 30s, Mr Hungyo arrived from his native Kasom Khullen in Manipur in 2005, to pursue his graduation in Delhi University. Like most of us migrants to Delhi, he stayed on, and at one time worked in a Gurugram call center. While living in Khirki Village in south Delhi, he made a survey of various neighbourhoods and concluded that Chirag and the adjacent areas were home to enough people from the northeast to make his new venture viable.At the moment there is no customer, but then it’s a sleepy afternoon. Mr Hungyo has enough leisure to help identify various items on the counter. “This is yam, which is like arbi. This is yam ka stem. This is smoked fish. This is a kind of rajma. This is fermented fish called Ngari...”Dressed in shorts and T-shirt, Mr Hungyo confirms that “80 percent of the stuff here comes from Manipur.” The fact that his home state is geographically much closer to India’s bordering countries than to India’s capital reflects in the presence of a coffee powder sachet from Myanmar and a rusk packet from Bangladesh—both of which he says are popular in Manipur.The shop itself has a very homey feel, and looks like the porch of a house where a family might sit in the evening to watch the street life. The door is scrawled with indecipherable drawings. “That’s the doings of Era, my daughter,” he explains. Mr Hungyo lives 200 meters away from the shop, with his family that also includes his son, Adrian, and wife, Christian.The shop’s hoarding has “Taste of home” painted on it.A quick Googling reveals that Manipur is 2,500 kilometres away from Delhi. But from this vantage point, it is Delhi that feels far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-manipur-0-km-a-one-of-its-kind-grocery-in-south-delhi-101616362133652.html

In just nine months since March, the district saw 344 fatalities related to the virus. As per the data of Mohali police, in 2020, of 254 deaths in road accidents, 32 took place in January followed by 29 in November and the lowest (11) were reported in May last year during the lockdown. As many as 136 died in Mohali city, while 118 lost lives in rural areas of the district. Also, 123 deaths were reported due to fog and misty weather, while 79 deaths were linked to the rainy season. Two-wheeler riders were the most vulnerable, accounting for 90 (35%) of the 254 people killed. Among them 32 were not wearing helmets. Fifty-six people died while travelling in cars, 35 of whom were not wearing seat-belts. The number of victims riding trucks was 33, cycles 24, autos 13 and buses five, while 33 victims were on foot. Fifty-nine persons died while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, 41 while speeding, 69 while driving on the wrong side and 49 while jumping of traffic signals. Sixty-three of those killed didn’t have driving licence while 45 had learners’ licence. According to the data, Airport Road witnessed around 129 deaths out of total 254, while 84 people died on national highways. In April 2019, Punjab traffic adviser Navdeep Asija, after conducting a three-dimensional safety audit using drones, had revealed major flaws in the design of Airport Road, and stated in his report that it is not pedestrian and cyclist-friendly. “Maximum accidents took place on Airport Road but now, we are installing sign boards at 92 black spots. We have already installed reflectors and constructed speed breakers at deadly S-curve on Airport Road near Sohana gurdwara. People have to change their mindset and follow the traffic rules for their own safety,” said Mohali superintendent of police, traffic, Gurjot Singh Kaler. “Most of the crashes occurred on junctions. The wider carpeted and empty roads instigated people to drive at high speed and the vehicles couldn’t be controlled at intersecting points. We must ensure that people don’t drive at high speed and follow latest speed management procedures. This will ensure autonomous process for traffic to observe slow speed. It is almost two years now, when the black spots were identified in various parts of the district, but action is still awaited,” said Harpreet Singh, president of an NGO named Avoid Accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-killed-more-people-than-road-mishaps-in-mohali-in-2020-101616356908218.html

During the state-level programme, the chief minister inaugurated and laid foundation stones of as many as 163 projects in 22 districts that includes inauguration of 80 projects worth ₹475 crore and laying foundation stones of 83 projects worth ₹935 crore. An official spokesperson said Khattar inaugurated nine projects and laid foundation stones of 24 other projects in Jind district, while Rohtak district got 18 projects worth ₹132 crore. The inability of the BJP-JJP leaders to move freely across Haryana and hold public functions due to the ongoing boycott call given by the agitating farmers had surfaced repeatedly in the budget session concluded last week. During the assembly session, the state government reached out to the Congress to intervene and persuade the farmers to withdraw their boycott calls. The chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also moved resolution in the assembly to condemn those giving a call to boycott “leaders of any political party”. The resolution was adopted with a voice vote and the Congress had walked out of the House as a mark of protest against the resolution.Farmers stage protest against MP Dharambir in RohtakFarmers and representatives of various khaps on Sunday protested against Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh outside the district secretariat when he came to take part in Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s video conference.After seeing the farmers protesting, the MP left the conference mid-way and took the back gate to leave the secretariat. The farmers continued raising slogans against Dharambir amid heavy security.Phogat Khap head Balwant Nambardar said had already announced a boycott of the BJP-JJP leaders and will continue to do so until the three farm laws are repealed. “We will continue our protests against the rulling party leaders,” he added.JP Dalal attended conference in BhiwaniHaryana agriculture minister JP Dalal attended the chief minister’s conference in Bhiwani amid heavy police security. “ Some people are misleading the farmers that mandis will be scrapped which is not true. Our government is committed to purchase farmers’ produce at the minimum support price in the mandis. This time, the rate of mustard and other crops is much higher than the MSP and this has given a chance to people to sell their crop outside the mandi too,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/boycott-call-forces-khattar-to-inaugurate-projects-via-video-conference-101616356847116.html

22-03-2021||Other||Mansukh Hiran murder mystery solved, Sachin Vaze the prime accused, says Maharashtra ATS||The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) in a press statement on Sunday named former Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze as the prime accused in Thane trader Mansukh Hiran’s murder case, while deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Maharashtra ATS Shivdeep Lande in a Facebook post claimed the “case was solved”, even as two persons were arrested in connection with the case. The agency, however, has not shared any details pertaining to the motive or how the trader was murdered. The developments came after the state received the Union home ministry’s order for the transfer of the murder probe on Sunday. The case is likely to be handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday. Hiran was initially alleged to be the owner of the car found with loose explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home, Antilia. He went missing on March 4, and the next day, his body washed ashore a creek in Thane. Three days later, his wife Vimla, 43, in her statement to the ATS team, suspected Vaze to be behind Hiran’s murder. She also revealed that Hiran knew Vaze well, and had lent him the car found near Antilia in November. Vaze had reportedly returned the car on February 5. ATS on Sunday arrested two persons – cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Ghor, 31, and cop Vinayak Balasaheb Shinde, 51 – in connection with Hiran’s murder, a day after they were called for interrogation. It is suspected that Shinde had called Hiran on the day he went missing, posing as a policeman from the Kandivli crime branch unit. Shinde allegedly asked Hiran to meet him at Ghodbunder Road, said police sources. However, ATS officers did not respond to the queries raised on this information from sources within the police.While Ghor supplied SIM cards to Vaze, Shinde helped him with other illegal tasks, ATS said. SIM cards procured from Gujarat by Ghor were allegedly used in the crime, said police sources. Ghor, who hails from Kutch, Gujarat, was introduced to Vaze by a former police officer, the sources said. Shinde was a constable in the same crime branch unit where Vaze was posted. He was serving life sentence after being convicted in the fake encounter case of Lakhan Bhaiyya, said to be an aide of gangster Chhota Rajan, and was out on furlough. The Thane court has remanded them to ATS’s custody till March 30. Vaze is already in NIA custody in Antilia case. Once the court sends Vaze in judicial custody in the Antilia case, NIA may arrest him for Hiran murder case too, a police source said. ATS’s official admission on Vaze being the prime accused in the murder case is a clear indication that the agency has managed to secure evidence which strongly indicates the suspended cop’s involvement in Hiran’s murder, said a police officer. Lande’s post, with a picture of him saluting (the tricolour), (in pic) stated, “The mystery of the highly sensitive Mansukh Hiran murder case has been solved. I heartily salute all my colleagues (in ATS), who had put efforts through day and night and completed the investigation in a lawful manner to achieve the result. This was one of the most complex cases of my police career till date.” ATS conducts searches at Shinde’s home On Sunday evening, an ATS team reached Shinde’s home. The team questioned his family for three hours and also conducted a search at Shinde’s home. They left with some documents, but refused to comment on it. Another ATS team questioned some others in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-mystery-solved-sachin-vaze-the-prime-accused-says-maharashtra-ats-101616356727335.html

There is no major labour shortage unlike last year and families of those who are camping at Delhi’s border are being helped byfellow-villagers in the fields.Haryana’s Bhiwani, Dadri, Mahendragarh, Fatehabad and some parts of Hisar and Jind have mustard as the main rabi crop. Raman Sheoran of Kakroli in Dadri said the mustard harvesting will be at its peak in the next 10 days. “Over 30 people from our village have been camping at Delhi’s border and we are helping their families in harvesting the crop,” he said.Sakuntla Devi from Barwala region in Hisar said she, her 16-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter were harvesting the mustard crop on their 4-acre land as her husband was camping at Tikri border for the last two months.“This time, we had to do all chores on our own. We have harvested the crop on 1.5 acres of land and for the rest our neighbours will pitch in the next 3-4 days. Villages will also help us in arranging transportation. After the procurement process, we will also join the stir,” she added.Ravin Dhaka, a student of MSc (physics) from Garanpura village in Bhiwani, said villagers helped his family in harvesting the mustard crop in the absence of his father, who is quite active and camping at Tikri border. “The villagers helped my mother and my brother in the fields. This stir has brought people closer,” he said.Dayanand Punia, Haryana secretary of Kisan Sabha, said most farmers are at the protest sites and those who are back home are helping their families so that crops are harvested and marketed on time. “There is no labour shortage. Getting mustard crop harvested on an acre of land costs ₹2,500-3,200.

22-03-2021||Other||Corruption in Mumbai Police highlighted earlier too, says Fadnavis||Reiterating the demand made by him a day earlier, former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday called for the ouster of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in view of the serious allegations levelled against him by ex-Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. “Deshmukh should resign from the post immediately or the CM should remove him so that an impartial probe is conducted into the matter,” said Fadnavis. He also said that it was not the first time when a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer has raised allegations against the home minister. According to Fadnavis, former director-general of police (DGP) Subodh Jaiswal, too, had earlier submitted a report to the government pointing out large-scale corruption in transfers and posting of police officers, before he shifted to central deputation. IPS officer Rashmi Shukla, who was in charge of state intelligence, had sent the report to the government. The chief minister’s office forwarded it to the home minister. However, no action was taken on the report by the home minister, alleged Fadnavis. “Thackeray didn’t act on Jaiswal’s report and the latter chose to take up a Union government deputation,” the former CM said.Fadnavis has been alleging that an extortion racket is being run by some people in the government and former cop Sachin Vaze, who is in the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) custody for his alleged role in placing the SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home, was being protected because of the same. He has also demanded that “Vaze’s political bosses must face the music”. The Opposition leader also questioned Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s “silence” on the issue. Dismissing the suggestion by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar that an “impartial” probe can be conducted through former Mumbai Police chief Julio Ribeiro, Fadnavis said a “court-monitored inquiry” be instated to probe the allegations against Deshmukh. “We have a great regard for Ribeiro but how can a former IPS officer and a retired DGP conduct an inquiry?,” said Fadnavis.He said as Pawar was the architect of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, he has to justify all the developments, including the alleged “misdeeds” by Deshmukh. “[Former Mumbai cop] Sachin Vaze was brought back in service on CM and home minister’s orders. Pawar sahab is fleeting away from the truth,” said Fadnavis. Earlier in the day, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) activists had staged a protest against Deshmukh before his Civil Lines residence at Nagpur, demanding Deshmukh’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/corruption-in-mumbai-police-highlighted-earlier-too-says-fadnavis-101616356366965.html

Upper caste families should install photo of Bhim Rao Ambedkar at their houses and Dalits that of farmer leader Chhotu Ram,” Charuni said while addressing a Bahujan Mahapanchayat organised by SC and BC Syunkt Morcha in Kaithal on Sunday.Charuni, who is also member of the 40-member committee formed to hold talks with the government, said the laws enacted by the Centre will not only affect the farmers but also people from all sections of the society as they will have to purchase grains from corporate houses at higher prices. “We are not fighting only for three anti-farmer laws but this is fight for every backward, poor and Dalit,” said Charuni.“The fight against these laws may last longer but the agitation to continue until these three laws are repealed and a law to guarantee MSP is enacted, later we will also fight for the rights of Dalits and government employees,” he added.He alleged the BJP was working on the behalf of the corporate houses and they have forgotten sacrifices of the freedom fighters. “But we will go in all poll-bound states to ensure the BJP’s defeat in all five states, including West Bengal,” he added. Charuni also targeted leaders of ruling parties of Haryana, saying deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala and former union minister Birender Singh have dented the image of their great grandfathers late Devil Lal and Sir Chhotu Ram, respectively, by not coming in support of farmers. ‘Corona is a big scam’ Replying to a question on organising a rally amid Covid-19 spread, Charuni said the ruling party was misleading people in the name Covid-19 and all political parties are organising rallies in the poll-bound states. “Corona naam ki koi cheej nahi hai, aur corona ke naam par bohat bada ghotala ho raha hai. Muje lagta hai corona ki vaccine ke naam par BJP kisano ko kahin aisi vaccine na lagwa de ki wo unke yesman ban jaye (There is nothing called corona. It’s a big scam.

The entire gathering was without masks, even as the AAP claimed to have installed three stalls to distribute these and physical distancing was non-existent. The AAP leadership on the stage also failed to make a single appeal to the crowd to follow covid-19 regulations. Even the majority of those on stage were without masks. The press gallery and other areas reserved for special dignitaries were also taken over by AAP supporters. Heavy police force was deployed, but they did not intervene or take action against violators.Gagandeep Singh, 29, a party worker from Bagha Purana, said, “We had printed around 1 lakh masks with party logos. Our workers were deployed at every entry point of the venue, where we are distributing masks to people to follow Covid-19 related safety guidelines.”Pushpinder Singh, 20, of Sangrur, said, “No one is asking us to wear masks. Therefore, nobody is following any safety norm.” The district health department had deployed a van and three teams at the venue to conduct RT- PCR and rapid antigen test. No one came forward for the test. Dr Manish Arora, district epidemiologist, said, “Three teams were there at the venue but nobody got tested.”Moga civil surgeon Amarpreet Kaur said, “We have sent our teams to conduct tests of the party’s supporters. It was the responsibility of the organisers to ensure the implementation of norms. We cannot force people to get tested, as they may target our staffers.”Jagatpreet Singh, SP (investigation), said, “We invested a lot of effort and appealed to people to wear masks and follow social distancing.

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Choosing the right kind of loan||Seeking a loan is not difficult. Taking the right loan, however, is what matters. Here’s a look at some of the different kinds of loans, and what you may need depending on your situation. Personal loans Don’t fall for the myths surrounding personal loans. The truth is that these loans are unsecured, i.e., they do not necessitate any type of collateral. This means that banks do not rely on borrowers’ assets but approve loans based on their creditworthiness. These loans can be procured for a multitude of reasons including house renovation, wedding expenses, medical emergencies, paying to fix car damages, business expansion, refinancing home loans, education, and debt consolidation among a host of things. Easy EMI facilities coupled with less paperwork is a bonus. Less paperwork means that the bank does not seek any papers from you other than making you fill a form containing your details, the amount of loan asked and the purpose of the loan. However, these loans are costlier than home loans or car loans and are available in the range of 10.50-24% every year. Home loans are available in the range of 6.5-10% while car loans can be had at interest rates falling between 7% and 9%. Loan approval is quick and easy in these cases, so opt for it in case of financial immediacy. Education loans Education loans are equally unsecured but beget low-interest rates and may be a better idea if you indeed want to finance your education. The education loan can be taken for a full-time, part-time or vocational course only. Gaurav Aggarwal–Director & Head of Unsecured Loans, Paisabazaar.com, online virtual debt syndication services said, “Education loans charge lower interest rates in the range of 6-15.20% and offer longer repayment tenure than personal loans. Banks also offer a moratorium period on education loans for up to one year after course completion during which the loan accrues interest on a simple interest basis. Interest paid on education loans availed from banks and other institutions qualify for tax deduction under Section 80E.” Financing homes Seeking home loans against your property are common. But, what if you have bought property on power of attorney (POA)? Are you still eligible for home loans from banks or NBFCs? Most banks avoid giving home loans to secure properties bought on POA as the law does not grant ownership title to the buyer. Many NBFCs are also wary of giving home loans in such cases. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online market place for financial products said, “If the property involves a POA, then you may need to opt for a vanilla personal loan or use some other collateral acceptable to the bank, as most banks may not be willing to accept property involving POA as a security for the loan.” Did you know that there is also something called a home improvement loan? If you need finances to refurbish or upgrade your home, opt for that. A home loan is restricted to the purchase of a constructed or under-construction property or the extension of the property. Compared to this, a home improvement loan is secured to renovate the structure without altering its basic structure. You can seek this kind of loan to fund renovation activities including tiling, flooring, internal/external plaster and painting, etc. Different types of loans also have varying loan terms, interest rates, EMI facilities, and time limits. Let’s also acquaint ourselves with these various aspects of a loan. Loan tenure Short-term loans availed to support a temporary purpose can be availed for a period between six and 18 months. Loans taken for tenure not less than three years and secured to meet prolonged expenses are called long-term loans. Short-term loans beget higher interest rates compared to long-term loans. This prompts people to repay loans over a long tenure not realizing the added financial outgo despite the limited interest rates involved. However, you must choose a short tenure loan provided it does not stretch you financially every month. Annual Percentage Rates Many people compare loan interest rates to determine which loan is cheaper. However, more than just the basic interest rate charged on loans, a borrower must find out the annual percentage rate (APR) of the loan sought. APR is the real cost of the loan, which includes the interest rate, processing fee, origination cost (also called loan application fees), etc. You can calculate the APR using the formula [{(Fees + Interest)/ Principal}/ n] × 365 × 100. Thus, APR is almost always higher than the interest rate. If you are unable to find out, ask the lender to share the APR to compare loans applied in other banks. Banks provide the APR on the loan when asked, thus, saving you the time to evaluate the same. However, some bank loans are available on floating interest rates. Before choosing to pay at floating interest rates instead of the fixed interest method, you must be mentally prepared for the sudden variations in interest amount over the loan tenure due to fluctuating interest rates. Floating interest rates are subject to revision every quarter. You must opt for a floating interest rate when there is a likelihood of falling interest rates in near future. Besides, lenders do not charge a penalty on prepayment of loans taken at floating interest rates. Total amount owed Checking the total amount owed is another way to find if you have chosen the right kind of loan. This is equal to the total loan amount plus interest and fee charges. Irrespective of loans taken at fixed or floating interest rates, the total amount you owe is the amount that you are likely to pay altogether. If the monthly loan instalments do not stretch you financially, try and go for the loan with the least amount owed over the tenure subject.

22-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab plans to double area under direct rice seeding this kharif season||The Punjab agriculture department is planning to bring under cultivation at least 20 lakh acres of a total of 62 lakh-acre paddy area through the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique in the upcoming kharif season. This will be twice the last year’s 10 lakh acres sowed through the water-conservation technique. This will be besides the targeted cultivated area of 12 lakh acres under the basmati. To achieve the target, the department has started organising camps in villages promoting the sowing. The sowing of paddy starts in Punjab in mid-June. State agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said, ““We will put all arrangements in place and identify the areas where cultivation through DSR will take place so that the crop is monitored closely. During the last season farmers experienced some problems when the DSR method was introduced for the first time. We want to help farmers rectify those hiccups this time.” He added, “We appeal to the farmers to sow the PR-126 variety of paddy as it is best suited for the DSR technique. The PUSA-44 variety should be avoided. Our objective is to bring at least one-third of the total paddy area barring basmati under DSR.” Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) vice-chancellor BS Dhillon said it will be a step towards water conservation and sustainable agriculture. “Our goal should be to save water through the method. We are helping farmers earn handsomely as well as save the environment,” said Dhillon.The DSR technique saves 15-20% of water consumed by the traditional method of puddling at time of transplanting paddy samplings. As per estimates of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, 1kg rice consumes 3,367 litre water.Makhan Singh Bhullar, head of the department of agronomy, PAU, said all 12,000 villages have been covered under DSR and 87% coarse paddy area in Punjab can be cultivated through the technique.“At the camps, we are also holding field demonstrations for farmers who have adopted the method,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-plans-to-double-area-under-direct-rice-seeding-this-kharif-season-101616355886681.html

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Climate change likely to affect Maharashtra’s agricultural productivity: Study||Rising temperatures and extreme weather events may adversely affect Maharashtra’s agricultural output after the year 2033, resulting in reduced yields of certain rain-fed food crops as well as irrigated cash crops, suggests a recent study published in peer-reviewed scientific journal Springer Nature.The study — Future Climate Change Scenario over Maharashtra, Western India: Implications of the Regional Climate Model (REMO-2009) for the Understanding of Agricultural Vulnerability — states that about 80% (or 29 out of 36) of Maharashtra’s districts are expected to witness a rise in annual mean temperature (AMT) between 2033 and 2050. This will, in turn, affect water security and agro-climatic conditions, leading to diminished yields of sugarcane, pearl millet, wheat, rice and jowar among other crops. “The present study indicates that the majority of districts may undergo a rise in temperature between 0.8 and 1.2 degrees Celsius by 2050... The mountain regions (of Western Ghats) in Pune, Satara and Raigad districts exhibit the highest increase (of 1–2.5 degrees Celsius) in AMT followed by Solapur (by 1.2–1.75 degrees Celsius),” said Rahul Todmal, assistant professor of geography at Vidya Pratishthan’s ASC College in Baramati, Pune district, who authored the study.Todmal’s analysis is based on projected climate data for the period between 2015 and 2100 obtained from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune, as well as projections provided by the International Panel on Climate Change in its Fifth Assessment Report published in 2014.Using applied statistical techniques, as well as results from past agronomic studies, Todmal arrived at future projections for temperature and rainfall patterns in Maharashtra and correlated them with changing crop patterns in the state.The study however, is limited by a lack of experimentation to corroborate these projections. Instead, it uses results from past experimental studies undertaken by government and non-government institutes, in Maharashtra as well as other parts of the country. Their applicability for Maharashtra is only in a broad sense, the study clarifies.Todmal’s findings suggest that along with an increase in AMT, Maharashtra is also likely to witness an increase in annual rainfall by 18% to 22% in the foreseeable future. Vidarbha and Konkan regions, in particular, should expect an assured increase in rainfall by 2050, Todmal pointed out. “This rainfall increase can be destructive and will pave way for extreme events. It may result in repetition of the catastrophic flood events as experienced in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara in August 2019,” he said.“Agronomic studies have confirmed that warmer climatic conditions never favour agricultural productivity. The future rise in temperature is very likely to reduce the productivity of traditional rain-fed crops like jowar, bajra and pulses, as well as irrigated cash crops like sugarcane, onion and maize. The rise in annual minimum temperature, particularly during the winter season, may adversely affect wheat productivity,” Todmal added. Simultaneously, a significant increase in the monsoon rainfall, particularly over Vidarbha and Western Ghats, may also increase the rate of leaching (nitrates) in soil and adversely impact the decomposition of organic matter due to water saturation. A combination of higher temperatures and increase in rainfall may also threaten agricultural productivity by catalysing an increase in fungal diseases and bacterial leaf-blight, the study notes.Future warming (up to at least 2.5 degrees Celsius) and increased rainfall (leading to more atmospheric and surface moisture) over Maharashtra is “inevitable” and has the potential to “negatively affect the productivity of agricultural food grains as well as cash crops”, the study concluded. The findings of this study found resonance among independent experts. “Under the circumstances presented in the study, temperature variations may marginally affect the productivity of principle crops like sugarcane, rice, sorghum and millet. However, it may have some major effect on wheat productivity,” said AN Ganeshamurthy, agriculture expert and emeritus scientist with the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) in Bengaluru.Ganeshmurthy clarified that these losses may also be offset through appropriate interventions, such as furrow bed irrigation systems for crops like cotton and sorghum, which would help them escape the kind of surface flooding that is projected to occur.Naman Gupta, a former climate change advisor to Maharashtra government who has reviewed the study, said these findings reaffirm the risks of climate change to valuable resources, such as food and water. “It is high time to integrate climate information in existing policies and programmes to ensure than impending risks can be minimised.” Such integration, Gupta said, is imperative not just in the sectors of agriculture and water, but also forestry, public health, infrastructure and disaster management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/climate-change-likely-to-affect-maharashtra-s-agricultural-productivity-study-101616355709368.html

In a show of strength at the kisan mahapanchayat at Moga district’s Baghapurana, the AAP chief said only his party was capable of providing a political alternative in the state. “In the run-up to the 2017 polls, Capt Amarinder Singh had made several promises. But after assuming power, the chief minister was unable to deliver on announcements such as debt waiver for farmers, jobs, providing smartphones and unemployment allowance. Now, it is time for the Punjabis to remember that they were cheated and get ready for ‘badla’ (revenge),” he said.He promised that if voted to power, jobs will be given to all those who have the employment card. “Until the job is given, unemployment allowance will be granted,” he added. He urged people to start working at the village and mohalla level for the victory of AAP in the assembly polls. “The AAP has set an example of governance in Delhi and pro-people policies like free power to majority of residents, free or cheaper medical facilities will be implemented in Punjab too,” Kejriwal added. Addressing the well-attended gathering, where no leader from any farmer union was present, the AAP supremo said farmers were deprived of opportunities and good governance for the last 70 years.While he took jibes at the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and the Congress, the AAP leader refrained from making any reference to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in his 25-minute address. ‘70 COMPLAINTS LODGED OVER DEFAMING FARM STIR’The AAP leader said the Delhi government has lodged nearly 70 complaints against the BJP leaders for allegedly trying to defame the ongoing farmers’ agitation. “Upset over our refusal to grant permission to arrest the protesting farmers in nine open jails, the Modi regime is now conspiring to reduce decision-making powers of the Delhi government. But I assure you that the AAP government will not let the Centre harm the farmers who are fighting for their survival,” he said.“True to its tradition, Punjab has again emerged as a leader for the oppressed farming community of the entire country. Our government worked to provide langar, water, toilets and free Wi-Fi to facilitate farmers at the Delhi borders,” he said.COVID-19 GUIDELINES FLOUTEDOrganised at the new grain market, Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining physical distancing and wearing face masks were blatantly flouted at the event. No one from the stage even once urged the gathering to follow the pandemic guidelines. Moga is among 11 worst-hit districts of Punjab with pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejri-sounds-poll-bugle-at-moga-kisan-mahapanchayat-says-take-revenge-on-congress-for-failing-to-keep-promises-101616355708230.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra home minister faces his biggest challenge yet||Fifteen months ago, Anil Deshmukh got the biggest opportunity of his political career as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was chosen to head the home department in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Till then, the five-time MLA had been a minister most of the time, but never the one holding a politically significant portfolio. Just when it looked like his stakes were up, Deshmukh, 70, faces the biggest challenge in his political life. “I never had a stain on me in my 30-year-long political career,” Deshmukh had said in a function organised by Lokmat Group on Friday. Within 24 hours, former top cop Param Bir Singh levelled serious allegations against him, alleging that he had asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month. Deshmukh, a fifth-time MLA from Katol in Nagpur district, is an NCP heavyweight in the region and belongs to an affluent family of ‘malgujar’ (big landholder) in the district. He started as a president of Nagpur zilla parishad in 1990. Five years later, he contested the Assembly election as an independent. He was one of the 40-odd independent MLAs who supported the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance government and was rewarded a ministerial berth. With a masters in agriculture, Deshmukh later joined the NCP, when it was formed in 1999. When the Congress-NCP alliance government came to power in Maharashtra in 1999, he initially served as a minister of state for school education and was later promoted as a cabinet minister in the state government. From 2001 to 2014, he handled different ministries, including excise, food and drugs (2001 to March 2004), public works (public undertakings; 2004 to 2008), food and civil supplies (2009 -2014). He lost the Katol seat to his nephew, Ashish Deshmukh, the then BJP nominee, in 2014 assembly elections. Later, he regained the Katol seat as the NCP candidate in the 2019 state assembly elections and was appointed the home minister when the MVA came to power in November 2019. In addition to his portfolio, Deshmukh is also the guardian minister of Gondia district, a bastion of influential NCP leader, Praful Patel. As a home minister, he tabled the proposed ‘Shakti Act’ to curb violence against women and children in the Assembly on the first day of the winter session. He also took a decision to ask for feedback from women’s rights organisations, legal experts, and citizens before the implementation of the Shakti Act. As a cabinet minister for food and drugs during the regime of Congress-NCP coalition government, he enacted the law in the state to ban gutkha, a type of chewing tobacco. Ashish, who had defeated him in 2014 Assembly elections from Katol, felt Deshmukh was framed in the “scandal.” “Why should he demand huge money of ₹100 crore every month from an assistant inspector? It seems the allegations are politically motivated,” Ashish remarked. Deshmukh’s cousin Ranjit was president of Maharashtra Congress and a minister in the first Congress-NCP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-home-minister-faces-his-biggest-challenge-yet-101616355587056.html

Khan has made numerous complaints regarding such rackets in the past, but even after several FIRs, it was still operating. Mumbai Police’s Grievance Redressal Day, to be observed every Saturday, provided Khan with a platform to flag the issue to superior officers.Like Khan, 1,150 people took their issues to the police during Grievance Redressal Day, which started on Monday with an aim to make police service more transparent and responsive to the general public. Every Saturday, one police station in each of the 12 zones in the city will hold the event. Between 9am and 11.30am, each deputy commissioner of police, assistant commissioner of police will visit one police station in their zone, and address complaints and issues raised by the public. Senior inspector of the police station, inspector (crime) and two investigating officers will also be present and will brief about the current status of already lodged complaints. Police officers said they received 311 complaints and 391 non-cognisable complaints across the city on Saturday. “Apart from receiving complaints, we also address problems of the people. On Saturday we addressed 31 complaints and returned stolen booty recovered in two robbery cases,” said Shashikant Mane, senior inspector, Juhu police station.In 2012, then Mumbai commissioner of police Satyapal Singh had started Grievance Redressal Day. However, it was discontinued. How to approach Every Saturday, the deputy commissioner and assistant police commissioners of all 12 zones in Mumbai will be present at one police station in their zone along with the senior police inspector of the police station from 9am to 11.30am, where people can come and register their complaints. People who have filed complaints earlier can also visit to enquire about the progress of their case. The police will have to state as to what steps have been taking to solve the cases.Police will notify which police stations will be implementing the scheme on which Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-get-1-150-complaints-on-grievance-redressal-day-101616355467157.html

At some of these places, residents were also seen standing in long queues without observing distancing while waiting for their orders. Many of eatery owners even claimed ignorance over whether they are covered under the restaurant category, and hence if the rule of allowing only takeaways and home deliveries applied on them. The hotels and restaurant association members, meanwhile, cried foul, stating that curbs were only being imposed on them even as small eateries were openly flouting the norms. Punjab hotels and restaurant association president Amarvir Singh said, “We will soon writing to the district administration over the “discrimination” against us.”Administration officials clarified that no restaurant, dhaba or eatery owner will be allowed to serve food on the premises on Sundays. Additional deputy commissioner Amarjit Bains said, “All eateries, dhabas, chowpattys are covered under the restaurant category and no one is allowed to serve food on premises. Police will take action against the violators as per the norms.”Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “Cops are strictly monitoring the situation in the city and action is being taken against the violators. The owners of eateries situated at different points of the city were also directed to stop serving food on Sunday and residents are expected to follow the norms to help stop the spread of the virus.”Many rued that their business has already been hit due to the ongoing night curfew, and the weekend curfew would only add to their woes.Bhavpreet Singh, the owner of a restaurant in Sarabha Nagar, stated, “We are already suffering as we have to close our establishments before 9pm on weekdays, and now, we will lose out on business even on weekends. Allowing takeaways is a good idea but the government should still reconsider its decision of Sunday restrictions as otherwise, it will be very difficult for us to meet our fixed expenses such as salaries, electricity bill etc.” Similar views were echoed by the managements of malls and multiplexes in the city. Ajay Nayar, director, FMI Limited and Silver Arc Mall, said, “We are already witnessing a low footfall due to fear of infection. Our business had been slowly coming back on track post the lockdown as residents had started coming out for shopping, movies and dining, but the fresh restrictions mean even more losses for our establishments. Instead of imposing such restrictions, the government must focus on speeding up vaccinations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/malls-closed-due-to-sunday-curbs-ludhiana-residents-flock-to-local-markets-101616355406801.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze-Deshmukh row: Won’t touch murky case, says former Mumbai Police officer||While Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar on Sunday recommended that Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray could entrust the responsibility of carrying out a probe into the serious allegations against home minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with police officer Sachin Vaze row to retired officer Julio Ribeiro, he has refused to take up the probe. Ribeiro said, “Nobody has approached me and if they do, I will certainly not accept it. I would not like to touch this murky situation where money and encounters are involved.” Singh has accused Deshmukh of running a bribe ring and even asking Vaze to collect ₹100 crore. Deshmukh has denied all allegations. Vaze is under arrest in connection with his role in the security scare at industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home, Antilia, and the death of trader Mansukh Hiran, in whose car the loose gelatin sticks were found. Ribeiro, 91, who has the image of a clean and honest retired IPS officer and is known for raising voice for police reforms, had referred to Singh as a “bad cop” in 2018. Singh had demanded an apology and threatened to sue Ribeiro for using “contemptuous and defamatory language” against him. Singh did not respond to HT’s phone calls and messages. Ribeiro in a newspaper article in The Indian Express on chief minister Devendra Fadnavis appointing Subodh Jaiswal as the new CP, had said, (referring to no one in particular) how two aspirants were rumoured to be vying for the job and how the CM “withstood all pressures from unsuitable contestants”. Ribeiro had then not taken Singh’s name in the piece. But Singh was one of the contenders for the post. Singh, who was then the Thane police commissioner, had said, “It is clear that the primary purpose of publishing the article was to defame me by insinuation and more importantly irreparably harm my goodwill and bring about wilful disrepute to me again through insinuation. You have caused irreparable damage to my reputation and interfered with the dispensation of public duties by me and the Thane police force.” NCP chief Pawar on Sunday tweeted, “He (Rebeiro) has a great reputation and if he accepts this responsibility then the truth will definitely come to the fore and public at large will start believing more in the police and in the government in particular.” An in-depth inquiry should be conducted by an officer or an individual who enjoys utmost respect of the police administration and public at large, Pawar added. Ribeiro was the Mumbai police commissioner from January 25, 1982 to June 6, 1986. He was praised for curbing the menace of smuggling mafia that had made Mumbai its hub. He also served as the director general of police Gujarat and Punjab. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1987 for his services. Ribeiro is also one of the former retired DGPs and police commissioners of Maharashtra and Mumbai Police who had moved the Bombay High Court last year when the “unfair, malicious and false media campaign against Mumbai Police” was carried out during the Sushant Singh Rajput death controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vazedeshmukh-row-won-t-touch-murky-case-says-former-mumbai-police-officer-101616355347234.html

22-03-2021||Chandigarh||Covid case surge not a classic 2nd wave, says Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the current rise of Covid-19 cases in the country is not a “classical second wave” and if appropriate safety precautions are taken, the number of cases can come down within a month. “You can give it any name, but I don’t think it is some classical second wave or something. The treatment and precautions of this virus is not difficult and there is nothing powerful wearing a mask properly. If people follow this norm for one month, the virus transmission can be broken. The virus cannot remain in the air for long as it needs a host and masks will save us,” Dr Harsh Vardhan said during media interaction at the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO), where he inaugurated the Centre of Excellence for Intelligent Sensors and Systems. The minister said that no link has been established between the deaths and Covid-19 vaccination in the cases which have been investigated and proper mechanism is in place to deal with such urgencies. “There has been no death attributed to the vaccination till now. Any death which has happened (after vaccination) is being investigated from the grassroots-level to the national-level. Every death which is linked with the vaccination is being investigated properly and no link of vaccine side effect leading to death has been found so far,” he said during media interaction at an event at Central Scientific Instruments Organisation in Chandigarh. Responding to the queries on expanding the drive for other groups, the minister said that the vaccination process is very dynamic and is based on a scientific process. “As the need for prioritising more groups will arise, the vaccination drive will be expanded. Presently, we are aiming at better coverage of the priority groups, “.He however did not presented any timeline for the expansion. On the cumbersome process of signing a certificate for certifying the specific comorbidites for getting a jab for age group between 45 and 60, the minister responded that the process is “simple”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-case-surge-not-a-classic-2nd-wave-says-harsh-vardhan-101616355287082.html

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Amid high demand for nurses, courses see many vacant seats||At a time when the world is depending on healthcare workers and nurses who are being hailed as heroes at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19, nursing institutes in Maharashtra are facing high number of seat vacancy year after year.At present, admissions are on at the institutional level, and as per figures shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell, over 64% seats remain unclaimed across nursing institutes in the state. This, experts said, is the status of nursing as well as physiotherapy courses across the state because of the secondary importance given to all courses other than medical and dental courses.“For the past few years in the state of Maharashtra, admissions to all para medical and other courses including bachelors in Ayurveda, physiotherapy, nursing, etc take place only once admissions to medical and dental courses end. This leaves students, even who were interested, running to book seats in institutes in other states,” said Dr Ramling Mali, member of Indian Nursing Council and former president of Maharashtra Nursing Council.This year, admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months; first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. Then in December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission forms after the state decided to continue admissions without SEBC quota.Admissions to medical and dental courses had started in November last year and the National Medical Commission (NMC) had extended admissions to January 31, 2021. This deadline was further extended till mid-February for dental courses in order to fill up vacant seats in colleges. “So, admissions to courses other than medical and dental started only post February. Meanwhile, other states had already finished admissions to courses including nursing. We are now left with 64% vacant seats,” said the principal of a Nanded-based nursing institute.Statistics shared by the state CET cell shows that in nursing courses seat vacancy stood at 56% in 2016-17, 42% in 2017-18 and 30% in 2019-20.In the peak of fight against Covid-19 last year, Maharashtra had requested for nurses to be brought down from Kerala to help in state hospitals. Experts said the dearth of nurses is a result of years of under-paying nurses in several hospitals in the state.“Anyone who has spent three-four years, especially with the hope of joining a noble profession, is expecting a decent salary. But several nursing homes in Maharashtra pay not more than ₹8,000- ₹10,000 per month to nurses. Even maids make better money,” added Mali. He said that over the years, more nursing students have been moving to other states or countries with hopes of better pay.A student has to clear the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) to be eligible for any medical or para-medical courses. For years now, principals of nursing institutes have been demanding that admissions to all medical and para medical courses be conducted at the same time in Maharashtra, just like other states in the country.“Every year, students used to hold on to seats in nursing courses, and then withdraw the admission if they found even a management quota seat in medical or dental institutes. This led to bifurcating of the admissions process. However, pushing non-medical admissions until after admissions to all medical and dental seats are over has not helped our institutes either,” said Ramesh Pawar, management member of a nursing institute in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-amid-high-demand-for-nurses-courses-see-many-vacant-seats-101616355106970.html

22-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze-Deshmukh row: Maharashtra govt may announce probe into allegations||Amid former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations that home minister Anil Deshmukh ran a bribe ring, the Maharashtra government is expected to announce a probe into the allegations by a retired IAS or IPS officer. Although Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar suggested probe by former Mumbai commissioner and retired IPS officer Julio Ribeiro, the latter has refused to head any such probe. Deshmukh has refuted the allegations, saying he will file a defamation suit against Singh.Singh, the commandant general of home guards and former Mumbai police commissioner, alleged in his letter emailed to CM Uddhav Thackeray, that Deshmukh had asked some of the officers from Mumbai Police to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars, pubs and hookah parlours. Alleging that the home minister had indulged in interference in the police force and malpractices, Singh in his eight-page letter also said that he was under pressure to probe Mohan Delkar case in Mumbai.“There could be a probe committee appointed under a retired IAS or IPS officer to look into the allegations. The committee may not be brought under the Commission of Inquiry Act to ensure that its recommendations are not binding on the government. The government will also not want to give undue importance to the letter by Singh,” said a minister, requesting anonymity.According to an official from Mantralaya, the decision over constitution of the committee may be taken after taking the view of the home department into consideration. The officer said the department may ask for an explanation from police officers and personal secretary of the home minister named in the letter by Singh to verify the claims. “At the same time, there could be a departmental inquiry against Singh for violating the All India Services Rules by levelling allegations against the home minister and the leakage of the letter,” the officer said.Leader of opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis has demanded a probe into allegations by a central agency or a court-monitored probe. He disapproved of Pawar’s suggestion saying that a retired IPS officer cannot probe an incumbent home minister. “We have great regard for Ribeiro, but how can a former IPS officer and a retired DGP conduct an inquiry against the home minister? Deshmukh should first resign from the post for an impartial probe,” he said.Water resources minister and Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil said, “If not Ribeiro, another officer of similar integrity can conduct the probe. We will have to first go into the allegations levelled by Singh to find out the truth.” He also said that the letter was an “afterthought” and an attempt to divert the attention from the main probe into the bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vazedeshmukh-row-maharashtra-govt-may-announce-probe-into-allegations-101616354930073.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||No need for Anil Deshmukh to resign, decides NCP||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo and chief architect of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government Sharad Pawar on Sunday held a closed door meeting with party members including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, water resources minister Jayant Patil, member of Parliament Supriya Sule and Praful Patel, in which it was decided that the party would not recommend home minister Anil Deshmukh’s resignation a day after the former Mumbai police commissioner addressed an unsigned letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray accusing Deshmukh of setting extortion targets of ₹100 crore for select police officials.Former CP Param Bir Singh, who was transferred from his post to Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17, brought up the charges in a letter a few days after Deshmukh told reporters that the transfer was not routine but due to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by police officers in the Antilia security scare investigation.An explosives-laden vehicle was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February. The prime suspect in that case, currently in custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which took charge of the probe on March 9, is a Mumbai Police Assistant Inspector, Sachin Vaze, who was reinstated in the force in 2020 after the MVA, a coalition of the Shiv Sena, Congress, and Nationalist Congress Party, took over.Emerging out of a three-hour long meeting, state NCP chief Jayant Patil said that it was decided that there was no need for Deshmukh to resign.He said the allegations against Deshmukh were an attempt to divert the attention from investigation in Antilia explosives case, which the MVA government wanted to be completed.“There is no question of Deshmukh’s resignation. We don’t want to give in to the attempt to divert attention from the incidents and investigation into the same,” Patil said.Patil indicated that the party top brass was convinced that the allegations made by Singh were motivated and were “an attempt to divert the attention.”Pawar also met politicians from coalition partners Shiv Sena and Congress on Sunday to explain the NCP decision to back Deshmukh. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Kamal Nath met Pawar separately.After the meeting, Raut said: “There cannot be resignation of chief minister or any other minister just for the sake of demand from the Opposition. Let there be an inquiry into the allegations by Param Bir Singh, after which the truth will come to the fore. If the resignations of the ministers are taken on the demand of opposition, half of the union cabinet will have to go.”Following the allegations made in the letter leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis sought Deshmukh’s immediate resignation. He also demanded an impartial probe into the allegations.“There should be an impartial probe by central agencies or a court monitored probe,” he said.“For the first time in the history of Maharashtra, a director general level officer has made such allegations and that too with chats in which demand for money was made. The chat is an evidence to what Singh has said. We are of the view that the home minister should immediately resign from his position and if he is not ready then the chief minister should take his resignation,” former chief minister Fadnavis had said on Saturday.On Sunday, BJP leaders and workers staged protests in various cities demanding Deshmukh’s resignation in view of allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Singh.Speaking at a press conference in Delhi on Sunday Pawar said that he would hold meetings with party leaders on Monday as well, and speak to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is currently under quarantine as his son, state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray is Covid-19 positive. Pawar said that the decision to remove the home minister from his post will be taken by the CM.“Being head of the state cabinet, Thackeray has every right to take action against any minister after a fair investigation. I will speak to him about the allegations against Deshmukh, though the decision over it (resignation of the minister) will be taken by the CM. I am also meeting my party leaders from the State on Monday to discuss the entire episode,” Pawar said.Pawar defended Deshmukh at the press conference and said that Singh made the allegations only after he was transferred and asked why he did not speak out about this issue during his time as commissioner of police. Pawar admitted having met Singh as mentioned in the letter but said that Sachin Vaze, the cop who has been arrested in connection with the Antilia security scare case and has been named prime accused in a related murder probe, was reinstated and given a key posting by Singh. Neither the home minister nor the chief minister had asked Singh to do so, Pawar said.Vaze, who led the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch was initially the lead investigator when a Scorpio with 20 loose gelatin sticks was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. Hiran Mansukh, a Thane-based businessman linked to the SUV was found killed on March 5.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said on Sunday the issue surrounding Deshmukh concerned Thackeray and the NCP as the minister in question is from that party.“Sharad Pawar has commented on what is essentially concerning a minister from that part of the coalition. I think it would not be fair for me to say anything, much of what has been said by Pawar in consultation with the CM,” Singhvi said.“The NIA as well as state’s Anti Terrorism Squad are investigating the case and we are sure the investigation will reach a conclusive step soon. The culprits in this case will be caught. It doesn’t matter how big the officer is,” Patil said, speaking to reporters after the NCP meeting on Sunday.“The allegations by the former Mumbai CP are shocking and sensational. Its time to take corrective measures and time for the ministers and everyone in the government to introspect and check if their feet are on the ground. I must agree that the entire episode has dented the image of the MVA government as the police force of our state has always been the matter of pride. The police force is backbone of the system,” Raut had said before the meeting with Pawar in Delhi.In the letter, which the Chief Minister’s Office has confirmed receiving, Singh accused state home minister Anil Deshmukh of “corrupt malpractices” for instructing police officers to “carry out official assignments and collection schemes including financial transactions”, as well as setting targets for them “to collect money” from establishments such as hookah bars and restaurants.Deshmukh, who denied the allegations in the letter in a series of tweets, said late on Saturday that he would file a defamation case against the former Mumbai police commissioner, who was transferred on March 17.Singh did not respond to calls and messages for a comment.While the NCP may have decided to not recommend Deshmukh’s recommendation, there is a possibility that he would be shifted to other department.“Pawar saheb is not happy with the way the entire episode was handled by the home department. Now with the allegations, there will be question of propriety as there will be a probe. As such a better option would be to take away home department from him and hand it over to another minister. Any such decision would be announced by CM Uddhav Thackeray,” said a key NCP leader said speaking on the condition of anonymity.The options that are being considered to head home department includes Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil, labour minister Dilip Walse-Patil and health minister Rajesh Tope, the leader said.When asked if Deshmukh will be diverted of home department without taking his resignation, Patil avoided replying. “The change in the responsibilities in the state cabinet is taken by chief minister,” he said.Patil also pointed out that several ministers in previous Devendra Fadnavis government faced allegations, but nobody was sacked by himTaking the cognisance of the letter, the state government is expected to announce a probe into the allegations. “There could be a probe committee appointed under a retired IAS or IPS officer to look into the allegations. The committee may not be brought under commission of inquiry Act to ensure that its recommendations are not binding on the government. The government will also not want to give an undue importance to the letter by Singh,” said a minister requesting anonymity.According to an Mantralaya official, the decision over the constitution of the committee may be taken after taking a view of the home department into consideration. The officer said that the department may ask for an explanation from the police officers and personal secretary of the home minister named in the letter by Singh to verify the claims.“At the same time there could be a departmental enquiry against Singh for violating the All India Services Rules by levelling allegations against the home minister and the leakage of the letter,” the officer said.Pawar on Sunday recommended that Thackeray consider entrusting the responsibility of carrying out a probe into the allegations against Deshmukh to retired cop Julio Ribeiro.The former Mumbai police commissioner however, later refused to get involved in the probe.NCP chief Pawar on Sunday tweeted, “He (Rebeiro) has a great reputation and if he accepts this responsibility then the truth will definitely come to the fore and public at large will start believing more in the police and in the government in particular,” Pawar tweeted on Sunday.An in-depth inquiry should be conducted by an officer or an individual who enjoys utmost respect of the police administration and public at large, Pawar added.Fadnavis who has demanded a probe into allegations by a central agency or a court monitored probe disapproved of Pawar’s suggestion, stating that a retired IPS officer cannot probe an incumbent home minister. “We have a great regard for Ribeiro but how can a former IPS officer and a retired DGP counduct an enquiry of a home minister? Deshmukh should first resign from the post for the impartial probe,” he said.Ribeiro told news channel that he “would not like to touch this kind of murky situation” and that the state government, as such, may find another retired officer for the job.Fadnavis said Singh’s allegations were not the only instance of corruption. He said that the former director general of police Subodh Jaiswal had submitted a report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray revealing about a racket active in political circles dealing with the transfers of the senior police officers.“A probe into a nexus of middlemen was conducted by the then commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla. Phone calls were intercepted to unearth the racket and a report was submitted to the chief minister. But no action was taken into the report. Had the government acted on it, today’s damage could have been averted,” Fadnavis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-need-for-anil-deshmukh-to-resign-decides-ncp-101616354928837.html
22-03-2021||Mumbai||Man accused of raping minor gets bail||The Bombay high court (HC) on March 17 granted bail to a 24-year-old Dombivli resident who was arrested on charges of raping a minor in 2018. The bail was granted based on the grounds that the medical reports and forensic report of the victim had failed to prove sexual assault by the applicant and the prosecution had prima facie failed to prove the man’s involvement in the crime. The single-judge bench of justice Sandeep Shinde, while hearing the plea by the man booked for rape and sexual assault under the Indian Penal Code and of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, was informed by senior counsel Manoj Mohite that the man was young and was in custody for nearly two and a half years and as he was willing to cooperate with the investigation he should be granted bail.According to the complaint, the survivor was 16-years-old when the incident took place on August 5, 2018. It was Friendship Day and hence met the applicant whom she knew for a year along with a co-accused, a juvenile-in-conflict with law. The three went for a ride on the scooter and after the ride went to a room allegedly belonging to the applicant’s family where the duo committed forcible sexual assault on her. The complaint states that as she was allegedly threatened with dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone, however, after reaching home the victim narrated her ordeal to her mother and a first information report (FIR) was registered with the Dombivli police station. The applicant was arrested the next day and a charge sheet was filed in due course.While referring to the medical and Forensic Science Lab (FSL) reports of the victim Mohite submitted that material on record did not indicate that the victim was sexually assaulted by two persons. He then referred to the WhatsApp chats between the two and submitted that the chats suggested intimacy between the applicant and the victim.Advocate Anjani Kumar Singh for the complainant however opposed the application and said that WhatsApp chats suggested that the applicant had lured the victim to the place with a premeditated plan and hence the court should not grant him bail. Singh also sought the trial to be expedited.After hearing the submissions the bench noted, “I refrain myself from commenting on the Whatsapp chats. However, chats also suggest, a habit of the victim and the applicant of smoking ganja (or colloquially smoking pot).”With regards to the material on record, the bench observed, “Thus, the medical reports and the FSL report together leads me to infer that prima-facie, allegations of penetrative sexual assault by the applicant and the co-accused on the victim was not likely.” The bench then noted that while the minor had alleged that she was thrown to the ground before being sexually assaulted the medical examination of the and Forensic Science Laboratory report should have suggested and corroborated her assertion, but it did not do so.While granting bail on these grounds the court noted that the trial could not be expedited in view of the pendency of cases before the special court. The court directed the man to furnish a personal bond of ₹30,000 with one or more sureties in like amount and also asked him to attend police station once a month till framing of charges against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-accused-of-raping-minor-gets-bail-101616354867164.html

The petition has contended that the restraining notice issued under the Maharashtra Forest Rules, 2014, is ultra vires of the other enactments related to wildlife and prevention of cruelty to animals, hence should be quashed and set aside.The petition which came up for hearing before the bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice Milind Jadhav on March 15 was informed by advocates Kalyani Tulankar and Ajinkya Udane that the petitioners were pet parents, and each had two dogs. As the petitioners are residing in flats in Pune, they or their family members took the dogs for brisk walks on the tekdi behind ILS Law College regularly. However, on January 4, a notice issued by the forest department officers prohibited the entry of the dogs on the tekdi.The petition averred that on inquiry the petitioners learnt that as the tekdi was home to peacocks, hares, snakes, birds and other animals, the notice had prohibited dogs as they can frighten or kill the wild animals. The petition states that the assumption was not valid as the pets were on a leash, hence they would not be able to frighten or kill the wild animals.The petition also stated that as per the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 the officers were not empowered to issue any prohibitory orders and as per and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 such a prohibition would entail that they (petitioners) would be punishable for not exercising their pets. In such a scenario the prohibitory notice of January 2021 should be set aside and quashed and the petitioners and other pet owners should be allowed to take their pets to the tekdi for exercising their pets.After hearing the submissions the bench directed that Pune Municipal Corporation should be added as a party to the petition and also directed the forest department represented by their officers in HC to file their response to the petition in a week and posted further hearing fo the petition on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petition-in-hc-by-pune-pet-owners-seeks-quashing-of-order-prohibiting-pets-on-hills-101616354809964.html

So far, most cases recorded in a day in Mumbai were 3,063 last Friday, followed by 2,877 on Thursday. These high figures are being reported after the first peak that was witnessed in Mumbai in October 2020, and now civic authorities are calling this the next peak. However, a strict lockdown, as witnessed by the city in the beginning of the pandemic a year ago, is not on the cards for Mumbai yet, authorities said.On Sunday, Mumbai also reported 10 more Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 11,586. There are 362,675 cases in Mumbai so far, of which 22,081 cases are active ones. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the city has gone down to 3.1%, from 3.3% reported last week.In the past week since March 14, active Covid-19 cases have increased by 76%, to the present 22,081 cases from 12,535 reported on March 14.

These crossed the 20,000 mark on March 20 with 20,019 active infections up to March 20.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) public health department, said, “We can sustain this spike in cases because of our available medical infrastructure. Lockdown is not being planned in Mumbai as it brings all activities to a complete halt. We are going to increase the city’s bed capacity. Testing is being scaled up, and vaccination is being accelerated.”On Friday, BMC asked private hospitals to activate all Covid-19 beds, as were available at the beginning of the pandemic. From the present 2,400-odd hospital beds available in private hospitals for Covid-19, the capacity will be increased to approximately 4,800 beds in private hospitals. Kakani said, “As a majority of cases are from residential buildings, the patients prefer to get admitted to a private hospital instead of a municipal hospital. Our municipal hospitals have already activated their beds, but these will also be increased.”Presently, Mumbai has 12,694 hospital beds for serious, moderate and complicated Covid-19 cases, 820 beds for asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients, 1,539 ICU beds, 966 ventilator beds, and 8,461 beds are equipped with oxygen points.The total number of hospital beds will increase to around 16,000 in the next two days, and to around 20,000 beds within the next week, Kakani said.BMC has also planned to scale up testing from the present average of 25,000 tests per day, to 50,000 per day. Rapid antigen tests will also be conducted at random, for visitors at public places such as malls, super markets, municipal markets, at railway stations and bus depots for inbound passengers on long-distance trains and buses. For Sunday’s figures, Mumbai conducted 24,220 tests.The positivity rate has drastically increased in the city in the past few days. On Sunday, the positivity rate was 15.6%, up from 9% - 10% reported earlier this week, and 4% - 5% reported in the beginning of March. BMC has asked all private hospitals, which are vaccination centres, to increase vaccination targets to 1,000 beneficiaries per day. Overall in the city, BMC plans to vaccinate 100,000 beneficiaries per day.First female loco pilot recovers from Covid-19 Surekha Yadav, the first female loco pilot, has recovered from Covid-19 and was discharged on Sunday. Yadav was undergoing treatment at Global Hospital, Thane.Yadav became the first Asian woman to drive a train in 2000. She is also the first woman to pilot the Deccan Queen.“ While on duty, I got infected. I am urging all people out on the field, kindly act promptly if you realise that you have the symptoms of Covid-19.

22-03-2021||City||People in Odisha's two panchayats want to be part of Chhattisgarh. Here's why||Upset over the Odisha government’s indifference towards them, over 25,000 people in two gram panchayats of Odisha's Nuapara district on Sunday wrote to the district collector of neighbouring Gariabandh district in Chhatisgarh to take steps for including them in his district after passing a resolution to that effect.“For years we have been living without basic facilities like electricity and water as our homes are situated in inaccessible hilly terrains. The Odisha government has also not taken any steps to uplift our status. From birth to death, we depend on Chhatisgarh and identify with it. So it's better that the panchayats of Sunabeda and Soseng are included in Gariabandh district," Sunabeda GP sarpanch Tilsingh Jhakkar wrote to the district collector of Gariabandh.Jhakkar, who belongs to the Chuktia Bhunjia tribe in Sunabeda plateau of Nuapada district, alleged that since independence, the people of 23 villages in those two panchayats have never been considered as part of Odisha. There are no doctor and other staff at Sunabeda primary health centre. There is no ambulance service. Permanent land pattas are yet to be distributed to villagers while minor irrigation facilities have not been provided to different villages," he said.Also read: Odisha forest official charred to death while trying to save saplings from fireOf the 25,000 villagers who passed the resolution seeking to merge their villages with Gariabandh, 300 Paharia families are in Sunabeda plateau. Though they were counted as tribals in Odisha before independence, they were excluded from the ST list of Odisha after Independence. But Paharias in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have been included in the ST list."All the Paharias belonging to different villages of Sunabeda and Soseng panchayats are now planning to migrate to the bordering villages of Chhattisgarh to avail tribal status because in Odisha, they are deprived of their rights," said Biju Jhakkar of Sunabeda. "In these two panchayats, people are yet to get power and road connectivity as it is situated inside the Sunabeda wildlife division. But in Chhattisgarh, there are pucca roads inside sanctuaries. Many people in Sunabeda have to walk 23 kilometres to catch a bus at Barkote on the foothill of Sunabeda," said Jhakkar.The resolution of the villagers in the two panchayats has come at a time when three villages in Odisha's Koraput district bordering Andhra Pradesh have been claimed by the latter as part of its own. The Supreme Court is now hearing a contempt of court petition of the Odisha government against the Andhra Pradesh government over the latter holding panchayat polls in one of the villages of Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district last month.On February 13, over 80 per cent of the 1,025 voters of Patusinri village under Kotia gram panchayat in Koraput district had voted for electing the sarpanch of Pattuchennuru gram panchayat of Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-in-odisha-s-two-panchayats-want-to-be-part-of-chhattisgarh-here-s-why-101616353430276.html

The two have been identified as Mehtab Singh, alias Khandewala, 50, and Gurdev Singh, 40, of Ganda Singh colony, Amritsar. They were accused of murdering a Sikh granthi, Baba Santokh Singh, 65, in Nanded city of Maharashtra on March 11. The two were companions of the victim and had fled to Punjab, Maharashtra police had told Punjab Police.The encounter took place at Singhpura village with SHOs of Khemkaran and Valtoha, namely SI Narinder Singh, and inspector Balwinder Singh also suffered life-threatening injuries. On Saturday, Nanded police shared inputs with Tarn Taran Police on the presence of the two wanted criminals in Dera Bidhi Chand, Sursingh village. SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said, “We had information that both had taken shelter in a religious Dera at Sursingh village. We conducted a search operation in the area on Sunday morning, but they had fled. We asked our network of informers to be on the lookout for the two nihangs having four-feet Khanda and two kirpans.”“A DSP and three SHOs were also put on the job. In the afternoon, we were informed that the Nihangs were moving around Singhpura village. We prepared and sent a team to the area. Both tried to flee when they saw the police,” he said.“At about 3.30pm, (near village Singhpura), the two Nihangs attacked our SHOs, when they asked them to stop. They inflicted life threatening injuries on the two police officers. DSP Bhikhiwind led a force to their hiding place, but the Nihangs again attempted to attack the police party, which had a narrow escape. Finally police fired from their service weapons to save and protect themselves from the attackers,” he added.The injured SHOs have been referred to a private hospital in Amritsar. At the time of filing of this report, they were being operated upon. An FIR has been registered under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 333 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or using criminal force on public servant), 186 (obstructing public servant) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Bhikhiwind police station. Fact-finding inquiry orderedWith questions being raised on the killing of the accused, Tarn Taran deputy commissioner Kulwant Singh has deputed SDM Patti Rajesh Sharma to conduct a fact-finding magisterial inquiry.Senior Congress leader and Punjab Mandi Board’s senior vice-chairman Tejpreet Singh Peter had alleged that the encounter was suspicious. Demanding an inquiry from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) or the CBI, he claimed it was surprising that two SHOs, a DSP and their team could not arrest two men, who were not armed with firearms. He added the encounter purportedly happened at a desolate spot, which was also suspicious. “This is a clear violation of the human rights,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-murder-accused-shot-dead-in-tarn-taran-encounter-101616353666663.html

22-03-2021||Kolkata||Adhikari’s father joins BJP as Modi, Shah tour Bengal; CM call him 'traitor'||Mamata Banerjee’s aide since the birth of Trinamool Congress (TMC) and her adversary Suvendu Adhikari’s father, Sisir Adhikari, ended all speculations and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the last Sunday before the eight-phase election in Bengal. The development came at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah held back-to-back rallies to counter the chief minister’s campaign.Octogenarian Adhikari, the TMC’s eldest Lok Sabha member who represents the Contai seat in East Midnapore, attended Shah’s rally at Egra in the same district. He delivered a speech before Shah addressed the crowd but, surprising many, did not take the BJP flag from Shah’s hand, a custom seen at such events.Banerjee, who addressed two rallies in East Midnapore district on Sunday, did not hide her displeasure and, for the first time, accused the Adhikaris of swindling funds.“I am foolish as a donkey. I trust people easily. Now I hear that the gaddars (traitors) made ₹5,000 crores. The money is kept in a cooperate bank,” Banerjee said in a veiled attack on Adhikari and his family while addressing a rally at Contai.Also read: From CAA to family income, BJP’s Bengal poll manifesto leaves out nothingSuvendu Adhikari, who vacated the Nandigram assembly seat which he is now contesting against the chief minister, joined the saffron camp in Shah’s presence on December 19 last year. His youngest brother Soumendu, who headed the TMC-run Contai municipality, switched camps a few days later. The only TMC leader left in the family is Sisir Adhikari’s eldest son Dibyendu who is the ruling party’s Lok Sabha member from Tamluk.“I have not taken my decision yet,” Dibyendu Adhikari said. His father however squarely accused the TMC of “pushing” him into the BJP.“The party pushed me into the BJP. I will do what Suvendu asks me to. He will win the Nandigram seat with a record margin and the TMC will be wiped out in all 16 assembly seats in East Midnapore district. I had a word with Shah. I told him we will work with the BJP,” said Sisir Adhikari.Asked why he did not go through the custom of accepting the BJP flag, he said, “I am with the BJP since the day Suvendu joined it.”Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Adhikari did not accept the BJP flag in public possibly because he thought photos and videos of that moment would be used by the TMC to seek his removal from the lower House under the anti-defection law. The TMC can still move the Speaker. Adhikari may argue that he only shared the dais with BJP leaders as a disgruntled TMC leader.”At her rallies, Banerjee repeatedly asked her party workers to be careful about the traitors but did not name the Adhikaris. She even alleged that local TMC leaders were receiving threat calls.At his rally in Bankura district, Modi targeted Banerjee.“I came here for the last time before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Didi (Banerjee) blocked all roads to the rally ground. Vendors were told not to supply chairs. But on the day of polling you ensured our victory,” said Modi. The BJP won two Lok Sabha seats in Bankura districts.“I see images being painted on walls, showing Didi playing football with my head. This goes against Bengal’s culture. I always bow before the people. Didi, you can kick me but I won’t let you kick the dreams of the people of Bengal,” said Modi while reiterating his attack on extortion by TMC workers.No TMC leader commented on Modi’s statements. The BJP however complained to the Election Commission of India on Sunday, saying the chief minister should be cautioned for calling the Prime Minister “demon” and “rioter” at her rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/adhikaris-father-joins-bjp-as-modi-shah-tour-bengal-cm-call-him-traitor-101616352491532.html
22-03-2021||Lucknow||Centre’s proposed power scheme aims at prepaid metering for all by March 2025||A new power scheme of the Centre aims at 100% prepaid metering for all consumers by March 2025 to make discoms (distribution companies) financially viable to supply 24x7 electricity to all.Known as the Revamped Reforms-Linked Result-Based Distribution Sector Scheme, the project is proposed to be launched by the month-end.The scheme also seeks installation of communicable meters integrated with advance metering infrastructure (AMI) for all distribution transformers (DTs) and feeders. There will be a unified billing and collection system.As per the draft guidelines circulated to the states, including UP, the scheme will have a total outlay of ₹3,03,758 crore with an estimated gross budgetary support (GBS) from Central government to the tune of ₹97,631 crore subject to the performance of a discom that wants to participate in the scheme.The scheme lays a lot of focus on metering, and that too prepaid meters or smart meters in prepayment mode, for all the consumers as a tool to reduce discoms’ aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and eliminating the gap between the per unit average cost of supply (ACS) and the average revenue realization (ARR). “The discoms inter alia should lay down the roadmap for bringing down AT& C losses to 10-15% and ACA-ARR gap to zero by 2024-25 and project the requirement of financial support required from the state government towards payment of government dues and subsidies each year for the entire scheme duration,” the guidelines for the scheme say.The new scheme will be in effect for five years beginning 2021-22. March 31, 2026 will be the sunset date beyond which no Central funds will be released. Under the proposed scheme, the Central government grant will be 15% of the cost per meter subject to the maximum of ₹900/meter for consumer metering.“If a discom does not submit the action plan, detailed project report (DPR) for metering component and other infrastructure work by September 2021, then the total eligible sanction amount may be restricted to 50%,” the guidelines say.The funding, they further clarify, will be available only if the discom agrees to operation of prepaid meters or smart meters in prepayment mode for consumers, and in accordance with the uniform approach indicated by the Central government.“All discoms that have initiated their smart metering tenders after January 1, 2020 will be eligible for funding, only if the prepaid smart metering works are done,” they say.The scheme requires all applicant discoms to prepare individual action plans for strengthening their distribution system and to improve their performance by way of various reform measures.Discoms are also supposed to spell out major works like metering and distribution infrastructure works, along with their estimated cost, giving priority to distribution measures that are required for AT&C loss reduction.There is also a provision for the appointment of a Project Management Agency (PMA) by each discom..A tripartite agreement, under the scheme, will be signed among the state government, discom and the Central government for undertaking and agreeing to their stipulated roles and responsibilities. Intermittent assessment of performance of discoms will be done.People dealing with the issue here in the energy department said the government and UP Power Corporation Ltd will send their comments on the scheme by March 24 as told by the Centre. OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW SCHEMEImprove the quality, reliability, and affordability of power supply to customers through a financial sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.Reduce the AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% by 2024-25.Reduce per unit average cost of supply and per unit average revenue realisation gap to zero by 2024-25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/centres-proposed-power-scheme-aims-at-prepaid-metering-for-all-by-march-2025-101616352045735.html

On Saturday, the positivity rate breached the 1% mark for the first time since December 27.The Capital’s positivity rate had been below 1% for 82 days before Saturday.The increase has been particularly sharp since March 15, when the city saw 368 cases.The trend is in tandem with similar rise in infections in several other states, particularly Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana. Overall, the weekly average of new cases a day across India has risen from around 23,500 on March 15 to over 31,600 on March 19.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, “The number of tests being conducted in Delhi is much higher than the national average. We are in the right direction in terms of testing, tracking, isolating and vaccination… Around 46,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday, which is the highest so far… The situation in Delhi is under control. I still appeal to residents of the city to wear masks, follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and adhere to social distancing norms especially in the light of the Holi festival ahead. We will further scale up enforcement in public places for the safety of people.”So far, Delhi has recorded 647,984 Covid-19 cases, of which 633,410 people have recovered, government records showed.In 2020, Delhi witnessed three distinct phases of severe uptick in Covid-19 cases.

It is quite likely that they are getting infected now. Also, the proportion of asymptomatic cases is much higher in the ongoing phase of increase in cases. The government should go for a strong containment policy and club that with aggressive tracing, testing and isolation. The government should not only aggressively identify contacts of Covid-19 cases, but ensure they are all tested and isolated on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive.”As many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey -- in late-January -- were found to have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-records-800-covid-cases-for-second-day-in-a-row-101616350365561.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||IMD forecasts rainfall, thunderstorms in Delhi today; mercury may plummet||Delhi and its neighbouring satellite towns are expected to receive light to moderate rainfall, coupled with thunder and dust storms, on Monday and Tuesday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Sunday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that under the influence of a western disturbance, strong winds and rains have already begun in parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh.A western disturbance is an extratropical storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings sudden winter rain to the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent.“Its impact will lead to rain and dust storm in Delhi and NCR, also leading to hailstorm in some parts of Haryana. There is also a possibility of thunderstorm in some parts of Delhi,” Srivastava said.This is the fifth western disturbance to pass over the region this month. The last time the city received rain and thunderstorm was on March 12, when the city woke up to light to moderate showers, with hailstorm in parts of NCR.Strong winds, touching the speed of around 40kmph, are also expected to blow on Monday. This is also likely to help improve the air quality of the city. On Sunday, the overall air quality index of the city was 244 in the ‘poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings.On Sunday, Delhi’s Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the entire city, recorded a maximum temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius — four degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature of the day was 16.2 degrees Celsius.Met officials said that while the rain on Monday and Tuesday is likely to cause a dip in temperature, this respite will be short-lived.“Till March 24, Wednesday, the maximum temperatures are likely to hover around 31-32 degrees Celsius. However, after that there is a forecast of a steep rise in maximum temperatures,” a senior IMD official said.IMD forecast said that after Wednesday, there is a possibility of the mercury levels touching 37-38 degrees Celsius. This season, the highest maximum temperature to be recorded so far was 35.3 degrees Celsius, recorded on March 18. The mean maximum temperature for March is 29.6 degrees Celsius.According to IMD data, Delhi had in 1945 recorded the highest temperature ever, with the mercury touching 40.5 degrees Celsius. IMD officials said that while there are no signs of this record being broken this time, the mercury levels will come close to the 40 degree mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/light-rain-dust-storms-expected-today-may-bring-temperature-down-101616350245562.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||BJP endorsing idea of L-G ruling Capital, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government for introducing a Bill in the Lok Sabha that proposes to give overarching powers to the lieutenant governor (L-G) over administrative affairs of the Capital, and alleged that the Delhi unit of the BJP has been going door-to-door endorsing the idea of the L-G ruling Delhi instead of an elected government.“The BJP has been sending volunteers door-to-door across localities telling people that it will be better for the L-G to rule Delhi and not an elected government. The BJP has lost assembly elections in Delhi. At the municipal level they are failing too. That is the only reason why they endorse the idea of the central government taking away the rights of an elected government in Delhi. I challenge Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta for a debate on this issue,” said the AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had called the Bill “unconstitutional” and “anti-democracy”.Delhi-BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We have never endorsed the idea of L-G ruling Delhi. We have been going door-to-door highlighting the failures of the AAP government in Delhi. They have misled people on the governance front and used communal tactics to win polls. Instead of challenging our unit president, Mr Bhardwaj should prepare for a debate on how the AAP has performed on the governance front.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-endorsing-idea-of-l-g-ruling-capital-alleges-aap-101616350185618.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||AAP stalled central schemes in Capital: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday asked the BJP’s Delhi unit to deploy more people at the booth level to strengthen the party ahead of the municipal polls in Delhi.Speaking at the state executive of Delhi BJP on Sunday, Singh said it was regrettable that the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi stalled the implementation of Ayushman Bharat, Pradhanmantri Awaas Yojana, Ujjawala Yojana, Mudra Yojana and many other central government schemes, depriving millions of Delhiites from their benefits. He asked party workers to launch an awareness drive about this.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that in the coming days the party will step up its activities on the ground, especially at the booth-level.“We have been working at the booth level. But we will step up the campaign to make people about central government’s schemes. We have passed a political resolution today about how the Delhi government has failed to deliver on its promises. We will also take up these issues during our campaign at the booth level,” said Gupta.With municipal polls scheduled next year, the BJP, which is ruling all the three municipal corporations for the past 14 years, is working on strengthening its base in slum clusters and unauthorised colonies. In the recent municipal bypolls, the party suffered a setback as it lost all the five seats.The AAP did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-stalled-central-schemes-in-capital-rajnath-singh-101616350186230.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Tenders to revive 200 more water bodies to be floated by next month||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s flagship initiative to turn the national capital into the ‘city of lakes’ might have sounded farfetched back in 2018, when chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the project. The city, however, now is on its way to reviving 600 out of the total 1,000 water bodies that had either become local dumping grounds or lay severely polluted.Officials of Delhi Jal Board (DJB), the city’s water utility agency, said that the ‘city of lakes’ project now had 600 water bodies that will be revived in the coming years. Officials said that the tender for 150-200 among these will be floated in the next one month.When the project was launched in 2018, the agency had enlisted just around 200 water bodies. Later, on the recommendation of local citizens, legislators and land-owning agencies, the DJB started adding more such local ponds, lakes and water reservoirs that will receive a facelift in the coming months.“In the next one month, we will float tenders for the revival of 150-200 water bodies. What we have done is that we have standardised the designs for the water bodies, which will ensure faster and more efficient work. Site specific tweaking of design will continue, when and where required,” said Ankit Srivastava, technical advisor to DJB.Srivastava added, “We are getting a lot of requests from local citizens and legislators to revive local ponds or lakes in their areas, but in many cases we have faced challenges like the said water body either not existing in government records or other residents in the area not wanting the water body to be revived there. Delhi has around 1,100 water bodies, out of which around 600 can be revived and we are working towards it.”A report prepared by Delhi Parks and Gardens Society in 2014, said that at least 200 out of 1,000 water bodies in Delhi were either encroached upon or lost because of excessive waste dumping or instances of land grabbing. It was noted in the report that water bodies were illegally turned into cremation grounds, government buildings, schools, and even private houses.DJB officials said that the revival of water bodies in Delhi will perform the primary function of turning these into recharge points, which will help increase ground water levels in a radius of at least 4-5 kms around the revived water body.A working example for this can be seen at the Dwarka sub-city, where a seven-acre barren land in Sector-16 was converted into a lake in seven months by the DJB. Treated water, to the tune of nearly 50 lakh litres, is currently being fed to the lake every day as the soil is absorbing large amounts of it. This according to experts is indicative of ground water getting recharged with this water, and is also a sign of large depletion of ground water in this region over years, which is now being regained.Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, said that this project will go a long way in increasing the city’s depleting ground water levels and must be emulated in a large scale.“With each sewage treatment plant (STP) in the city, there should be a water body where at least some percentage of the treated water can be released. Historically Delhi was never barren, it had over 600 water bodies within the city itself, but these were wiped out due to intense urbanisation or waste dumping. Our aim should be to increase input into the ground and reduce extraction,” Thakkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/world-water-day-tenders-to-revive-200-more-water-bodies-to-be-floated-by-next-month-101616350065552.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 precaution not in stock at Lajpat market||Rampant violations of rules imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 at the popular Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi has set off alarm bells with both the number of fresh cases and positivity rate in the national capital climbing up, sparking fears of yet another outbreak.During a spot visit on Sunday, HT found the market crowded with hundreds of shoppers jostling for space, most of them without a mask or wearing it improperly. Social distancing was neither being observed on the streets, nor inside the shops. The street vendors occupied the roads with usual rush of shoppers around them. Civil defence volunteers who have been deployed by the administration to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour were hard to find, also there were no public announcements to alert people about maintaining a safe distance.The market association said they have written to the district administration to deploy more civic defence volunteers to ensure social distancing and also requested them to increase vigil and screening of visitors to the market. The association said it has also issued circulars to shopkeepers to not allow visitors without masks and asked them to discourage crowding in their shops.“The crowd in the market has grown in the last few weeks and it is likely to increase further because of Holi. We do not want a Diwali-like situation again, so we have written to the district administration to deploy more staff in the market to enforce social distancing norms. We have requested them to increase vigil and patrolling in the market and challan those who do not wear masks,” Ashwani Marwah, general secretary Traders Association Lajpat Nagar, said.Delhi recorded 813 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the most since December 24, and the test positivity rate rose beyond the 1% mark for the first time since December 27. On Sunday, Delhi reported 823 cases with a positivity rate of 1.03%. The increase has been particularly sharp since Monday, March 15, when the city saw 368 cases. With very few people now observing Covid rules, experts have warned that large gatherings in markets, weddings and public events may turn superspreaders.Marwah said the association was planning to deploy their own teams to tell people to maintain social distancing and ensure thermal screening of visitors in the market area.Manish Kumar Saikia, a shopper, said, “It is a complete chaos here. There was a time when people had to wait to enter shops to ensure social distancing but just in one year things have changed completely. Hardly anyone is seen following social distancing now.”At a few shops though visitors were being screened and hand sanitisers were seen outside some shops. However, there were no checks at roadside vendors.Traders also complained that roadside vendors don’t follow rules and add to crowding. “The number of street vendors have also increased in the market and they do not follow any Covid-19 guideline. People throng at roadside makeshift eateries where they do not even keep sanitisers, so this is a cause of concern,” Praveen Gupta, a shopkeeper, said.In a circular issued to the shopkeepers, signed by association president Sanjeev Madan, the body has said, “Please do not entertain people who are not wearing masks. Ensure that social distancing norms are followed even if we have to ask our customer to wait for few minutes. Please ensure that thermal checking of all visitors is done and also make sure that they sanitise their hands before entering our establishments.”District administration said necessary measures were being taken and violators fined. Vishwendra, district magistrate (southeast), said that 179 challans were issued on Saturday in the district against violators for not wearing masks. “This number was 34 till last week. As coronavirus virus cases are increasing, we have also increased our vigil. We have dedicated one enforcement team only for Lajpat Nagar area. We will further increase our vigil and deploy more people,” Vishwendra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-precaution-not-in-stock-at-lajpat-market-101616350005516.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Tepid demand chokes small-scale industries||In May last, when thousands of factories in the capital’s industrial areas were allowed to open after lockdown, imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, their operations were hamstrung by labour shortage, cash crunch, disruption of supply chains, and lack of demand.A year on, these Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs) continue to be beset by many of these problems — and a few new ones. While the supply chains remain disrupted and the demand is far from reaching pre-pandemic levels, the rising cost of raw material and transportation has added to their woes.Shashi Mahajan, a shoe manufacturer in Udyog Nagar in Delhi, one of India’s biggest footwear manufacturing hubs with about 200 factories, says that he is working at only 40% capacity compared to pre-Covid days. “Earlier, I used to make 10,000 shoes a day, now I make about 4,000 only,” says Mahajan.It is an unusually hot March afternoon and inside Mahajan’s factory about 50 men are working at the conveyor production line — where the stitched uppers of shoes are moving from a counter moulding machine to toe- lasting and then to sole- pressing machines. “We are majorly into school shoes and most schools continue to be closed across the country. We had our biggest market in Gujarat and Maharashtra, where Covid cases are rising fast again,” he says. The factory has stickers on the walls warning employees that not wearing a mask will result in a deduction of ₹2,000 from their salary.Mahajan says that most of his 100 employees who had gone to their villages have returned, but he has been able to re-hire only half of them, as demand continues to be tepid. Gian Dhamija, another shoemaker, says that he is working at 60% capacity. “ Eighty per cent of my business comes from schools; I am still sitting on almost 1 lakh pair of unsold shoes from last year,” says Dhamja.The factories here source raw material used in the production of shoes — such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC ), polypropylene ( PP), ethyl-vinyl acetate ( EVA) as well as shoe colours — both domestically and from countries such as Austria, China, and South Korea. “But their rates have almost doubled, and we have to wait for the supply for much longer, ” says Ashok Gupta, president, Udyog Nagar Factory Owners Association. “Right now, the cost of raw material is the highest that it has been in 10 years,” says Kamal Kiran Seth, another factory owner.“The high cost and the disrupted supply of raw material are delaying recovery,” says Virender Nagpal, owner Sportsline, an original equipment manufacturer for some of the top sports brands, such as GM and Slazenger. He makes a range of products, including cricket helmets, batting pads and abdominal guards.The demand for his products, he says, started picking up in August, but is nowhere near the pre-Covid levels. “Fifty per cent of our products are exported. Since many countries in Europe are still under lockdown restrictions, and sporting events are yet to resume fully, the demand is only 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels,” says Nagpal, who also manufactures skateboards, roller skates, cycle helmets, under his own brand name Yonkers.“ Here in Udyog Nagar, we have proved that we can match any country in terms of quality; otherwise, we would not be manufacturing for top global brands.”Framed pictures of Nagpal with past and present cricketing greats such as Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, and Virat Kohli, among others, adorn the stair walls of his office. “Almost every top cricketer has worn our helmet and batting pads,” he says.In Okhla, the city’s oldest and the largest industrial estate, a majority of factories are operating at 50% capacity says Sunil Malhotra, president, Okhla Industries Association. “The garment factories are among the most badly hit. The pandemic has hastened the decline of Okhla, which is an important part of the city’s industrial heritage,” he says.For the uninitiated, Okhla Industrial Estate, which derives its name from Okhla village, was set up by the National Small Industries Corporation ( NSIC), and is one of the 12 such estates developed across the country to encourage small industries after Independence. The construction began in 1952, and it was was inaugurated in 1958.Okhla, a symbol of industrialisation in Delhi post-Independence, has been home to some of the biggest electronics companies, including early television manufacturers, garment manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, plastic and packaging industries, printing presses, among others. As imports from China increased, many factory owners here became traders and importers, turning their factories into warehouses, office spaces and automobile showrooms.Today, Okhla’s factories manufacture garments, cardboard boxes, speciality plastic films, and electric items, among others. Besides, it is also a hub of printing presses.Anil Varma, a garment manufacturer, says that Covid-19 has ripped through the garment industry in Okhla that has about 200 manufacturers, which make garments for many international apparel brands. Most say their orders have dwindled sharply and they are working at 40 to 75% capacity. “The lockdown was sudden and all manufacturing had to stop overnight. There were shipments in warehouses, in transit and heaps of half-sewn garments that were wasted,” says Varma, who makes garments for top apparel brands in Australia and France. “ Many manufactures here have lost clients to Bangladesh, Cambodia and Sri Lanka. “What is also not helping is the fact that the cost of cotton has gone up by 25% in the past few months.”Things are no better in Narela, which is home to over 3,500 factories. Like elsewhere in Delhi, most factories here are working at reduced capacity. “I am operating at 50% capacity as demand continues to be a problem,” says Basant Somani, who runs a plastic factory in Narela. “The continuing blockade of the Singhu border due to the farmers’ protest has also led to a rise in transport costs and has disrupted supplies,” he says. “The road to recovery is going to be much longer than we had thought”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tepid-demand-and-rising-cost-of-raw-material-delay-recovery-for-delhi-s-small-scale-industries-101616349946675.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Vaccination numbers drop at pvt facilities as most head to govt centres in Delhi||Covid-19 vaccination sites at government facilities in Delhi have seen higher turnout rates than those in private facilities since last week, government data shows, an increase that state government officials attribute to a host of measures put in place to increase the number of jabs administered at centres in hospitals and clinics run by them. Senior officials said they expect this gap to widen as state-run facilities add more vaccine sites and extend the window for on-spot registrations by four hours from Monday.Data seen by Hindustan Times showed that on March 15, the turnout rate at vaccination sites in government facilities was 64%, while this was 72% in private ones. However, the trend turned from the next day. On March 16, government facilities recorded a turnout rate of 65%, against private ones logging 61%. On March 17, government sites saw a 69% turnout, and private facilities 54%.This gulf stretched the next day, with a 72% turnout at government facilities, 49% at private sites.To be sure, the number of vaccinations in absolute terms have dropped at private facilities over the previous week, and increased significantly at government centres. While 15,917 vaccine doses were administered in private centres on March 15, this fell to 11,179 by March 18. In comparison, this number went from 23,285 in public facilities on March 15 to 29,385 on March 18.“The trend has continued so far. Earlier, such instances were rare and never happened for two or more consecutive days till last week,” said a senior government official.State officials put this trend down to authorities engaging with residents, especially in low-income group colonies, as well as eased registration rules and timings.“The Delhi government last week issued directions asking state-run hospitals to allow on-spot registration between 3pm and 5pm every day. This strategy, along with district administrations engaging in door-to-door drives — especially in low-income group colonies — to convince eligible beneficiaries to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest and arranging for transport facilities if needed, has led to higher turnout rate in the government facilities as against the private ones,” said a senior health department official.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said that he hoped the turnout will increase as Covid-19 vaccine centres in the city open for 12 hours a day (from 9am to 9pm) — from eight hours currently (9 am to 5 pm) – from Monday. He said the window for on-spot registrations will also be increased in state-run centres starting the same day.“It has also emerged that a large number of beneficiaries who register themselves for vaccines on a particular time slot fail to arrive at the centre in time. So, on-spot registrations will be allowed from 3pm-9pm in all state-run centres. Currently, they only allow on-spot registration between 3pm and 5pm. We shall request private centres to follow the same protocol,” said Jain.The rule regarding 12 working hours, however, will apply to both state-run vaccination centres and the private ones, as per government orders that have already been issued.Delhi currently has 550 vaccination sites – of which around 325 are in government facilities. While vaccines are administered for free in the government centres, private ones are allowed top charge up to Rs.250 per dose.With most government centres now allowed to vaccinate up to 200 persons per day, the city’s total daily vaccination capacity is currently around 64,000 doses. Of these, around 41,000 shots can be administered in government facilities, while 23,000 is the cumulative capacity of centres in private facilities.Experts said costs concerns and the relative ease of on-spot registrations, which don’t require residents to sign up online, has skewed the turnout in favour of government facilities.“Delhi has a large population which will find it difficult to shell out ₹250 for each vaccine dose. But it is important to note that there is also a mass perception that government facilities are more equipped to deal with potential cases of adverse effects, compared to the less-known private hospitals,” said Dr Namrata Makkar, deputy medical superintendent at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said, “Most vaccine centres at government facilities opened on-spot registration from March 15. That has come as a major relief for people who are not comfortable with technology or those who do not own smartphones.”Dr Kishore also welcomed the government’s move to extend the vaccination and spot registration windows.The decision to extend timing of vaccination centres from Monday was taken by the Delhi cabinet on Thursday. After the cabinet meeting, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press briefing that the government also plans to double vaccine sites in the city – with which vaccines administered per day would increase from 45,000 to 125,000 – and urged the central government to relax norms and allow vaccination of all adults.Currently, the vaccination is open for health workers, front line workers, people aged over 60 years and individuals aged over 45 years who also have co-morbidities (among those on a list prepared by the central government). The vaccine drive was launched across India on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-numbers-drop-at-pvt-facilities-as-most-head-to-govt-centres-in-delhi-101616349945596.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||Woman held for killing 3-year-old in Budh Vihar||A woman strangulated a three-year-old boy to death, stuffed his body in a sack and dumped it on the roof of a building in outer Delhi’s Budh Vihar on Saturday, the police said on Sunday after arresting the suspect.Pranav Tayal, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), quoted the suspect as having confessed that she would be taunted by her in-laws and others for having not conceived in eight years of marriage, and she killed the boy as a “sacrifice” in the hope that she would bear a child. “She said she worked on the advice of a self-styled godman she met four years ago,” said Tayal.Local enquiry, eyewitness accounts and loopholes in the woman’s statements to the police gave her away, said the DCP. “We arrested the woman. She told us that she killed the boy as a sacrifice as she was under pressure due to constant taunts of her in-laws and the society in general for not being able to conceive,” the DCP said.Investigators said the three-year-old lived with his parents and two siblings on the second floor of a five-storey building in Budh Vihar, near Rohini.In the same building, on the top floor, lived Pankaj Gupta, husband of the 25-year-old suspect Neelam Gupta.According to the police, Neelam and Pankaj were married since 2013, but did not have a child. “They sought medical help, but to no avail,” Tayal said.About four years ago, Neelam had also visited a godman, who apparently told her to sacrifice a child if she wanted to conceive.The investigators are undecided about whether they should book the alleged godman, as they said Neelam had met the man only once, four years ago.Neelam, police said, allegedly killed the boy sometime around 9am on Saturday.The boy’s father, Daya Ram, said,“My wife sent my son to call his sister who was playing on the terrace. My daughter came down, but my son stayed back,” said Daya Ram.By 9.30am, the family, when the boy did not return, the family began a search and called the police for help around 2pm.The police checked CCTV footage in the building and ruled out the possibility of the boy leaving the building. Then, one team searched every room in the building, while another began checking the terrace and water tanks. “It was at that time that a police team looked at the roof of a four-storey adjacent building, where they found a large sack lying on one side,” said the boy’s uncle, Rahul Gupta.That aroused suspicion and the police checked the sack to find the missing boy’s body stuffed inside around 4pm. There were injuries on the boy’s neck suggesting that he had been strangulated.Several people told the police that Neelam was the last person to be seen with the boy.She was then picked up for questioning, and by late Saturday night she allegedly confessed to killing the boy. She has been arrested and booked for murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-kills-three-year-old-dumps-body-on-roof-in-budh-vihar-arrested-101616349946117.html
22-03-2021||Delhi||JNUTA accuses V-C Kumar of ‘abuse of extended tenure’||The Jawaharlal Nehru University teachers’ association (JNUTA) on Sunday alleged that the decision to organise a meeting of the university’s academic council on Monday was a “brazen abuse of temporary extension” by vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar.The academic council is expected to discuss matters of appointment, admission policies, including conduct of Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) among other things, university officials said. While Kumar’s tenure was set to end on January 26, the education ministry on January 22 directed that Kumar be allowed to continue in his position “until further orders”.JNUTA said the continuation of Kumar as the vice-chancellor as per the order of the education ministry is not an extension of his term and places him only in a position of an “interim administrator” until the appointment of a successor.“Implicit in this arrangement is the understanding he will not indulge in exercising powers in this interim period that are otherwise part of the official duties of a regular vice-chancellor. These include all powers related to appointments, introduction of new academic courses and programmes, amendment of rules and ordinances of the university and other such matters,” the teachers’ body said in a statement.Alleging “administrative overreach” by Kumar, JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said the association had sent a letter to the secretary of education ministry and University Grants Commission on the powers of interim vice-chancellor.Despite repeated attempts, the ministry and UGC officials did not comment on the matter.“Tucked away in the agenda, are papers and items that hold significance for the future. Specific examples include items for discussion such as finalisation of academic ordinances in relation to new programmes of study, including writing to UGC requesting for teaching positions that would be needed; recognition of post graduate diplomas offered by an institution presently outside the institutional framework of JNU; changes in admission policies of the university, conduct of Central University Common Entrance Test in future etc,” JNUTA said.The teachers’ body also questioned the agenda item “that seeks to review the criteria for nomination of faculty to the academic council” and said it was against university statutes for any authority to take decisions on the matter.Kumar and Rector-I Chintamani Mahapatra did not respond to the allegations by JNUTA despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnu-v-c-abusing-temporary-extension-allege-varsity-teachers-body-101616348205310.html

22-03-2021||Pune||BJP steps up pressure on Uddhav Thackeray to act against Anil Deshmukh||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stepped up pressure on Uddhav Thackeray’s government to act against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, a day after shunted Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that the minister had asked arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze to extort ₹100 crore a month from Mumbai’s bars and restaurants. The BJP workers led by state unit chief Chandrakant Patil staged a protest at the Deccan area in Pune, demanding the resignation of Deshmukh. BJP workers also staged protests at Kolhapur, Nagpur and Aurangabad. Former chief minister and leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that protests will continue across Maharashtra until Thackeray acts against Deshmukh. Param Bir Singh, in his letter written on Saturday to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleged that Deshmukh had tasked assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze with collecting ₹100 crore when the latter was the chief of Mumbai’s crime intelligence unit. The letter has added another sensational twist to the case of an explosives-laden car found in front of Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai recently. “The new revelations have shown how corrupt this government is. Uddhav Thackeray should immediately sack Deshmukh and initiate inquiry against him,” said Patil. The BJP state unit chief also appealed to Raj Thackeray-led MNS and Prakash Ambedkar led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi to join the protests. Param Bir Singh enclosed various chat messages to support his allegations purportedly exchanged between himself and assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil during March 16th and 19th. The latest revelations have put further pressure on the MVA government to act against Deshmukh, who is already facing allegations of mishandling the Antilia explosives case, which has resulted in an embarrassment for the Mumbai police and the state government after NIA arrested Sachin Vaze, the investigating officer in the case, alleging he was himself involved in the plot. The state government then shunted Param Bir Singh to fix accountability for the fiasco; however, Singh’s bombshell has now left the government red-faced, once again. While Deshmukh has threatened to sue Singh, Sharad Pawar convened an urgent meeting in Delhi on Sunday evening to deal with the fallout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-steps-up-pressure-on-uddhav-thackeray-to-act-against-anil-deshmukh-101616347485277.html

His Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe 43 (CH01-CA-1869) was moving at a speed of 140km per hour when he crashed into a taxi and then ran over two cyclists. The collisions had killed two occupants of the taxi and one of the cyclists, while three were left critically injured.“His family runs Weldon Opticians store in Sector 17, Chandigarh. He doesn’t have a driving licence and was drunk at the time of the accident. His two friends travelling in the car with him, identified as Arjun and Prabhnoor Singh, have also been booked. They are at large,” senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh said, adding that liquor bottles and glasses were found in the luxury car.After the accident, the trio fled the scene in another car even after sensing the victims’ serious condition and didn’t even inform the police or ambulance, the SSP said. The deceased, all residents of Mohali, were Ram Prasad of Mataur, who was on a cycle, and Ankush Narula of Zirakpur and Dharampreet of Gholumajra village, who were returning from work in the taxi.Among the injured, cab driver Harish Kumar is stated to be critical at PGIMER, Chandigarh. Pradeep Kumar, who was in the cab, survived the crash with fractures in both legs and arms and is admitted at a private hospital in Sector 71, Mohali.

All three study at a private school in Sector 26, Chandigarh. Arjun lives in Sector 9, Chandigarh, and Prabnoor, who is the son of the owner of Hotel Majestic in Phase 9, Mohali, is a resident of Phase 7.All accused are facing charges under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 304A (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code.“Investigations will be completed in the next two weeks, and the court will be asked to conduct a speedy trial and give an exemplary punishment to the culprits,” the SSP said. “We have lost everything”Jasbir Singh, father of Dharampreet, 23, who died in the accident, said they had lost everything with his son’s death. “He got a job with Unify, a billing services provider, in Phase 8B, Industrial Area, three years ago and was expected to get married by the end of 2021. He was earning a good salary and was helping with our house’s construction in Gholumajra village,” said Jasbir, a daily wager.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/18yearold-driver-whose-mercedes-crushed-three-to-death-in-mohali-arrested-101616347185959.html
22-03-2021||Pune||Pune district’s positivity rate up from 10% in February to 31% on March 21||The spread of the Covid-19 infection continues to grow, as is evident by the district’s rising positivity rate.The positivity rate on March 21, as per the district health office is 31%, higher that the peak positivity rate last year.The positivity rate, which was 10% in the week between February 13 and February 19, 2021, has now gone up to 21%, between March 14 and March 20. The positivity rate was at 5.7% in between January 30 and February 5.Despite the administration increasing its testing, the number of cases also continues to rise. State officials believe that this could be because of a new variant of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Coronavirus, which is transmitting much faster.The fresh Covid cases include tests results of both RT-PCR and the Rapid Antigen tests.During the peak months of August and September 2020, the positivity rate had reached 24%, and 19%, respectively, for Pune. The current rate is almost at par with this peak of the first wave of infections.On November 2, 2020, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to the Maharashtra government, in a letter to divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, had written about a possible second wave.In the letter, Salunkhe references the positivity rate in September being 24.30% and then, in November, going down to 9.94%.In the letter he advises aggressive testing, surveillance on super spreaders and a sero survey in urban and rural areas.The administration has performed only one sero survey so far.Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “We have no concrete proof of mutation and we need stronger evidence. As of now we know that people are not following Covid- appropriate behaviour. Also, now we are going in for demand-driven tests, which is what most people are demanding; RT-PCR tests; which is why the number of false negatives is going down. Only wearing masks and social distancing will help. Variants may compromise the vaccine efficacy or even the possible factor of reinfections, but irrespective of all this, only a mask is most effective.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-s-positivity-rate-up-from-10-in-feb-to-21-in-march-101616335544519.html

22-03-2021||World||Afghan foreign minister on 3-day visit to Delhi for talks on peace process||Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar arrived in New Delhi for a three-day visit on Monday, days ahead of a crucial regional meeting on Afghanistan that is expected to be attended by the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan. Atmar will hold talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and other senior officials during the visit. His discussions are expected to focus on bilateral relations, economic and security cooperation and the Afghan peace process. The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are expected to participate in the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe on March 30. However, it is still not clear whether the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers will hold a bilateral meeting in Dushanbe. Heart of Asia, a regional initiative launched by Kabul and Ankara in November 2011, is one of the rare forums focused on Afghanistan that includes both India and Pakistan. The initiative includes 15 countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Central Asian states such as Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Atmar is visiting India close on the heels of a meeting of the “extended troika” on Afghanistan convened by Russia on March 18, and the trip will provide him an opportunity to exchange notes on recent developments related to the troubled peace process with Jaishankar, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Afghan foreign minister also spoke with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi on March 19 and stressed the need for close cooperation between the two countries for building on the outcomes of peace efforts in Doha and Moscow. Atmar also discussed the upcoming Heart of Asia meeting in Dushanbe, he said in a tweet. A statement issued by the Afghan foreign ministry on Monday said the purpose of Atmar’s visit is to “discuss bilateral relations, strengthen regional and international consensus on the Afghan peace process, and enhance cooperation in security, economic, political and cultural areas”. Atmar will also meet former Indian ambassadors of Afghanistan, students, businessmen, representatives of Afghan Hindus and Afghan refugees living in India, the statement said. The Heart of Asia meeting is also expected to figure in Atmar’s talks with Jaishankar, the people cited above said. The past few weeks have witnessed a flurry of Afghanistan-related developments against the backdrop of a fresh US initiative to find a political settlement in the war-torn country. These developments followed US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s letter to President Ashraf Ghani, outlining the next steps in the peace process and a draft “peace agreement”, which were first accessed by Afghanistan’s Tolo News channel. The US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke to Jaishankar on phone on March 7 and visited Islamabad the following day. Khalilzad also attended the “extended troika” meeting in Moscow on March 18 that was joined by officials from the US, Russia and China – the members of the troika – and officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan, members of the Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation, leading Afghan politicians and representatives of the Taliban. A joint statement issued after the Moscow meeting ruled out the restoration of the Taliban’s “Islamic Emirate” and called on the militant group not to launch a spring offensive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-foreign-minister-on-3-day-visit-to-delhi-for-talks-on-peace-process-101616432751557.html
22-03-2021||World||Germany's Curevac to include virus variants in vaccine trials||German group Curevac said Monday it will broaden its mRNA Covid vaccine trials to include new virus variants as it aims to file for EU approval in the second quarter.The decision was taken because of the "rapid distribution of new variants" in European and Latin American countries where phase three trials have been in progress since late 2020, according to a statement.The aim is to "determine efficacy of the vaccine candidate for select variants", the company said."Our goal is to offer the public and especially the vulnerable older age groups the best possible protection," said Ulrike Gnad-Vogt, interim chief development officer for Curevac.The company is discussing the expansion of trials with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is already evaluating the vaccine, it said.Curevac also reaffirmed its intention "to file for formal marketing authorisation within the second quarter", or from April through June.Curevac said earlier this month it has signed a deal with Novartis for the Swiss pharmaceutical giant to help in its production of its vaccine.The Swiss giant will make up to 50 million doses of the mRNA vaccine by the end of 2021 and up to 200 million doses in 2022.Curevac also has a separate agreement with German chemicals giant Bayer to make the vaccine from 2022.The European Commission has signed a contract for up to 405 million doses of the mRNA vaccine.The EU has approved four vaccines so far: mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson's so-called viral vector vaccines.It started a rolling review of the Curevac jab in February and is also examining Novavax's protein-based vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-curevac-to-include-virus-variants-in-vaccine-trials-101616428501847.html
22-03-2021||World||EU imposes sanctions on 4 Chinese officials over abuses against Uyghurs||The European Union imposed Monday sanctions on four Chinese officials accused of responsibility for abuses against Uyghur Muslims, part of a raft of measures targeting alleged human rights offenders around the world and provoking retaliation from Beijing. The four are senior officials in the northwest region of Xinjiang.The sanctions involve a freeze on the officials' assets and a ban on them travelling in the bloc. European citizens and companies are not permitted to provide them with financial assistance.China at first denied the existence of camps for detaining Uyghurs in Xinjiang but has since described them as centres to provide job training and to reeducate those exposed to radical jihadi thinking. Officials deny all charges of human rights abuses there.Xinjiang had been a hotbed of anti-government violence, but Beijing claims its massive security crackdown brought peace in recent years.China’s Foreign Ministry responded immediately, denouncing the sanctions as “based on nothing but lies and disinformation” and issuing its own retaliatory measures.The ministry announced sanctions against 10 individuals and four institutions that it said had damaged China’s interests and “maliciously spread lies and disinformation.” They and their family members would be barred from entering mainland China, Hong Kong or Macao and cut off from financial dealings with those areas, the ministry said.Among those targeted was Adrian Zenz, a U.S.-based German scholar who has publicized abuses against minority groups in China’s western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China has said companies and individuals have petitioned to sue Zenz, but it wasn’t clear who the plaintiffs were or how they would pursue legal action across borders.Others targeted for sanctions include five members of the European Parliament: Reinhard Butikofer, Michael Gahler, Raphael Glucksmann, Ilhan Kyuchyuk and Miriam Lexmann.The ministry did not say what specific measures would be taken against the organizations. They were listed as the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the European Union, where the 27 national envoys decide foreign and security policy; the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights; the German-based Mercator Institute for China Studies; and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation in Denmark.Last week, China’s ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, had warned that Beijing would retaliate.“We want dialogue, not confrontation. We ask the EU side to think twice. If some insist on confrontation, we will not back down, as we have no options other than fulfilling our responsibilities to the people in our country,” he said.The new EU sanction system is similar to the Magnitsky Act — Obama-era legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those it sees as human rights offenders, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the United States.EU foreign ministers, as part of Monday's move, also imposed sanctions over repression in North Korea, “extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances in Libya, torture and repression against LGBTI people and political opponents in Chechnya in Russia, and torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings in South Sudan and Eritrea," a statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-imposes-sanctions-on-4-chinese-officials-over-abuses-against-uyghurs-101616425869638.html
22-03-2021||World||Russian president Vladimir Putin to get Covid-19 vaccine shot tomorrow||President Vladimir Putin said he will get a coronavirus vaccine shot on Tuesday, several months after widespread vaccination was started in Russia.Kremlin opponents have criticized Putin for not getting vaccinated amid a comparatively slow rollout of the shot in Russia, arguing that his reluctance is fueling the already extensive hesitance about the vaccine. Russia, where only 4.3% of the 146-million population have received at least one dose, lags behind a number of countries in terms of the vaccination rate.Putin told a meeting with government officials on Monday that he will get his shot “tomorrow,” without specifying which coronavirus vaccine out of the three approved for use in Russia he will take. According to the Russian president, 6.3 million people in Russia have already received at least one shot, and more than 4.3 million have had two doses.“Today we can confidently say ... that the Russian vaccines are absolutely reliable and safe,” Putin said. “It is an absolute success of our scientists and specialists.”Despite scepticism about Russia’s hasty introduction of the vaccine, which was rolled out before it had completed late-stage trials, the vaccine appears to be safe and effective. According to a study published in the Lancet, Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with COVID-19, although it’s still unclear if the vaccine can prevent the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-shot-tomorrow-101616421375310.html

He said at least four units of firefighters were struggling to control the blaze due to its rapid spread.Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, said in an email that fire services, rescue and response teams and volunteers were at the scene.“So far the fire has affected shelters, health centres, distribution points and other facilities. Volunteers are supporting those affected,” she said.No casualties were immediately reported, but deaths and injuries were feared. No details on the missing could be confirmed. Two Rohingya refugees told The Associated Press at the scene that the fire had spread very quickly and continued to rage into the night Monday.Several videos posted on social media showed clouds of smoke billowing from the camp.Bangladesh has sheltered more than a million Rohingya Muslims, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 in a major crackdown by Myanmar's military. The U.N. has said the crackdown had a genocidal intent, a charge Myanmar rejects.Bangladesh has hosted the refugees in crowded refugee camps and is eager to begin sending them back to Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Several attempts at repatriation under a joint agreement failed because the Rohingya refused to go, fearing more violence in a country that denies them basic rights including citizenship.In January, another fire destroyed hundreds of shanty-like homes in the camp, leaving thousands without shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-guts-rohingya-refugee-camp-in-bangladesh-hundreds-of-shelters-destroyed-101616420850433.html

22-03-2021||World||Saudi oil giant Aramco reports 30% drop in payments to state||Saudi Arabia’s state-backed oil giant Aramco paid the Saudi government 30% less in taxes in 2020, the company reported Monday, as the region’s largest economy grapples with the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices.Saudi Arabian Oil Co, the kingdom’s largest taxpayer, transferred $110 billion to the government in 2020, down from nearly $159 billion the year before. The kingdom's 2021 budget plans to spend $263 billion, showing the significance of Aramco's payments to state coffers.The state-controlled company’s public figures offer key insight into the financial health of the kingdom, which relies on the energy sector for 80% of its exports and two-thirds of its financial revenues. That's despite Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious efforts to diversify the economy away from oil.The firm stuck to its promise to pay out $75 billion in dividends for the year. Still, the decline came as its royalties and income taxes more than halved. Nearly all of the dividend money goes to the Saudi government, which owns more than 98% of the company.Aramco announced on Sunday that its profits fell some 44% in 2020 to $49 billion, amid turmoil in global energy markets unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. As virus-induced lockdowns slashed oil demand, the price of international benchmark Brent crude plummeted to all-time lows in April of last year.Despite Aramco’s steep losses, the company managed to keep its dividend pledge to shareholders by taking on a ballooning amount of debt. Aramco’s net debt to equity ratio more than doubled — to 55% in 2020 from 26% in 2019.The Saudi-based asset management firm Jadwa Investment reported that the kingdom’s fiscal deficit hit $79 billion in 2020, or 12% of gross domestic product, far surpassing previous estimates. The budget deficit has widened each year since oil prices dropped in 2014, prompting the government to borrow heavily and accelerate its shift away from oil largess. The kingdom has cut back some subsidies, tripled the value-added tax to 15% and accelerated its search for non-oil revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-reports-30-drop-in-payments-to-state-101616414396020.html

Police said the number of arrests would likely increase in coming days as officers study closed circuit television footage.The violence, which also saw several police vehicles damaged, was branded as “unacceptable” by Britain's interior minister, Priti Patel.“Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,” she said.What started as a peaceful demonstration of around 3,000 people on College Green in the heart of the city in western England turned violent after hundreds of protesters descended on the New Bridewell police station.Many demonstrators donned face masks and carried placards criticizing the legislation, such as “Say no to U.K. police state” and “Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy.”The protesters were ostensibly venting their anger at the government’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which is currently going through parliament. Under the terms of the legislation, which covers England and Wales, police will be handed new powers to tackle demonstrations.Sue Mountstevens, police and crime commissioner for the Avon and Somerset region, said seven people have been arrested but that there would be “many more” detained.“It’s disgraceful and outrageous," she said. “Police officers went to work yesterday and some have returned home via hospital battered and bruised.”Protesters attempted to smash the windows of the glass-fronted police station and damaged 12 vehicles, including two that were set on fire.Andy Marsh, chief constable of Avon and Somerset Police, said 12 police vehicles were damaged and “significant damage” was caused to the New Bridewell police station.“Officers were pelted with stones and missiles and fireworks and it was a terrifying situation for them to deal with," he said.“I believe the events of yesterday were hijacked by extremists, people who were determined to commit criminal damage, to generate very negative sentiment about policing and to assault our brave officers," he added.Two of the police officers injured were treated in hospital after suffering broken ribs and an arm. Both have since been discharged.Bristol mayor Marvin Rees, who said he had “major concerns” about the bill, condemned the violence and said the unrest would be used to justify the legislation.One of the reasons why the British government has pushed through new legislation on the police's powers over protests relates to last summer's anti-racism protests, including the toppling of a statue of slave trader, Edward Colston, in Bristol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-english-city-of-bristol-leave-20-police-injured-101616413452347.html

The Kremlin has denied any role in his illness and said it has seen no proof he was poisoned.After recovering in Germany and returning to Russia, Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed last month for around two and a half years over parole violations he called trumped up.His allies had asked Russian law enforcement authorities to open criminal cases into his poisoning and had filed a legal complaint against what they said was the authorities' unacceptable inaction.But a Moscow military court on Monday rejected their appeal, Vyacheslav Gimadi, the head of the legal department at Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Twitter as did the Navalny Team's official Twitter account.The court ruled that state investigators' refusal to look into the matter formally, a decision they said was justified by what they said was a lack of evidence that a crime had taken place, was lawful, Russian news agencies reported.Navalny's team said it planned to appeal the ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-uphold-decision-not-to-investigate-navalny-s-poisoning-lawyer-101616411736470.html

Merkel and regional leaders will discuss the proposals on Monday as infections reach levels that would trigger more stringent measures on Europe’s biggest economy.Just weeks after the chancellor laid out a plan to gradually reopen shops and restaurants, the move would be a blow to pandemic-weary Germans, who opinion polls suggest have become increasingly disgruntled with the government’s handling of the crisis.Amid sputtering vaccination programs across Europe, lockdowns have been reimposed in Italy and France in the past week. In Austria, the government will meet on Monday with health officials and opposition parties as rising infection rates force it to reconsider plans to ease curbs on parts of the economy.Europe’s sluggish pace of immunizations has sparked a spat with the U.K. over possibly blocking vaccine exports. The effort was further complicated last week after Germany and other countries temporarily suspended using AstraZeneca Plc’s shot over blood-clotting concerns.The European Union has administered doses covering 6.4% of the population, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.With Easter holidays starting at the end of March, Merkel’s chancellery is proposing mandatory quarantines and Covid tests for travelers returning to Germany, while allowing family visits within the country. A number of proposals haven’t yet been agreed on, indicating tense discussions will be needed to reach a deal.For hard-hit areas in Germany, other possible curbs include nightly curfews until 5 a.m. and closures of schools and child care if teachers and pupils can’t get tested twice a week.Cases in Germany are rising again after authorities began to relax restrictions in late February and set out a plan to gradually unwind the remaining curbs -- including the partial closing of non-essential stores and the shutdown of hotels, restaurants and gyms, as well as cultural venues.That plan was dependent on the infection trend, but after the recent jump in cases, officials want to stop further easing measures and roll back some of the previous opening steps.Revelations that members of Merkel’s conservative bloc profited from the pandemic threatens to hamper implementation of the virus strategy. Questions have also been raised in the media about Health Minister Jens Spahn’s links to face-mask deals, dealing another to blow public trust.The Robert Koch Institute health agency reported on Monday that the national seven-day rate of infections per 100,000 people rose to 107.3. After dropping to 56.8 on Feb. 19, the figure exceeded the so-called “emergency brake” level of 100 for the second straight day. The provision allows authorities to tighten lockdown measures, and the threshold has been crossed in ten out of 16 states.The resurgent pandemic has prompted some health experts to warn that intensive care units risk being overwhelmed within a few weeks if the exponential growth in cases continues. On Monday, the number of Covid-19 patients in German ICUs rose to 3,117, the highest in more than a month.“We expect a drastic increase in the number of patients in the next few weeks,” said Gernot Marx, president of the German organization for intensive and emergency care.Regional leaders and members of Merkel’s cabinet disagree on what to allow for the upcoming Easter holidays. The premiers of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony want to allow citizens to go on holiday within their own states, while Finance Minister Olaf Scholz warned against a “big wave of travel” that will jeopardize the summer holidays.“Many people are really corona weary, and we have to take that into account in our decisions,” Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony, said in an interview with ZDF television on Monday. Public acceptance of the restrictions is “a very serious problem because we’re dealing with a really powerful wave while people are feeling demoralized.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-seeks-longer-tighter-lockdown-in-german-pandemic-setback-101616409897220.html

EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting this week to discuss a ban on Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK as it tries to secure its own supplies of the vaccine for EU citizens.The European Commission president says the EU can "forbid" vaccines made on the continent from being sent to the UK. Meanwhile, Johnson is expected to put up a resistance to the EU's proposed move, the BBC reported. The latest row appears to revolve around doses of the Oxford University vaccine made in a Dutch factory.The UK is pushing for "strictly controlling" the risk of travellers importing new variants of the deadly virus into the country. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said yesterday that a spike in coronavirus cases in neighbouring European countries could put gains from the vaccination programme at risk.The country is also warning citizens against booking summer holidays abroad at the moment, PTI reported. The EU has encountered production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, which is being related to timings of when contracts were signed for these deliveries.It comes into sharp focus as much-anticipated results from a US trial of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs involving more than 32,000 volunteers revealed that the vaccine is “safe and highly effective”.Several European leaders paused the rollout of the vaccine amid concerns of a possible link with blood clots, which is since being lifted as UK and EU regulators had said there was no evidence the vaccine causes blood clots.On Sunday, the UK recorded another 5,312 coronavirus cases, taking the total tally to 4,296,583. Also, 33 deaths were reported, taking the UK's total to 126,155.Also, more than 27.6 million people in the UK - more than half the adult population - have now received at least one dose of a vaccine.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-call-on-eu-make-a-case-for-not-banning-covid-19-vaccine-export-101616405703292.html

Defendants Tang Kai-yin and Quinn Moon, who were sentenced to three and two years, respectively, remain in Shenzhen.Two minors who were among the 12 pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the border and were returned to Hong Kong in December.During the detention of the 12 in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, mainland authorities denied their families and lawyers access, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers, provoking criticism from rights groups.Pro-democracy activists began fleeing Hong Kong for democratic Taiwan from the early months of the protests in 2019, most of them legally by air, but some by boat, activists in Taipei have told Reuters.Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly.Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in Beijing are whittling away at those freedoms, a charge China rejects.Since Beijing imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, scores of democracy campaigners have been arrested, some elected legislators have been disqualified and others have fled overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-hong-kong-democracy-activists-set-to-return-from-china-after-jail-terms-101616403252670.html

22-03-2021||World||Malaysia sets up compensation fund for Covid-19 vaccinations||Malaysia on Monday announced it had established a $2.4 million compensation fund to provide cash assistance for any Covid-19 vaccine recipients who suffer severe reactions due to inoculations.The Southeast Asian country has inoculated nearly 430,000 frontline workers, with the majority having received the first of two jabs of the vaccine jointly developed by U.S. company Pfizer and German partner BioNTech.Under the new fund, individuals requiring extended hospitalisation due to a vaccine reaction will be eligible for 50,000 ringgit ($12,171), or if this results in permanent disability or death 500,000 ringgit, Health Minister Adham Baba said.Adham said health authorities had recorded 20 instances of adverse reactions to vaccination as of March 18, with symptoms ranging from itching to shortness of breath and palpitations."There have not been any deaths linked to the vaccine," Adham told a news conference, without specifying the type of vaccine he was referring to.Malaysia's vaccination drive began on Feb. 23 using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with authorities only starting to administer the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech on March 18.Malaysia will also scrap a plan to reserve a second shot of the Pfizer vaccine for those who had already received their first dose, in a bid to speed up its vaccination drive.Malaysia has reported just over 330,000 coronavirus cases and 1,233 deaths after keeping infection rates relatively low for much of last year until a spike of infections from October that peaked in early February.Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said the government is confident that Pfizer will be able to provide the 32 million doses secured by Malaysia.Last week, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the government will almost double its COVID-19 immunisation budget to 5 billion ringgit to speed up its target of vaccinating 80% of its 32 million population by December, instead of February 2022.

22-03-2021||World||New Zealand searches for fix as housing prices soar||New Zealand is set to unveil measures on Tuesday to counter a rampant rise in property prices that has pushed younger and lower income buyers out of the market, and poses a major challenge for the government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.The country's success in combating the coronavirus has made it a safe haven for returning Kiwis and investors, who have parked their funds in real estate, pushing house prices up 23% in just 12 months, far ahead of wage growth.Billions of dollars in government stimulus and historically low interest rates have further inflamed the market, while housing affordability has fallen back to its equal lowest in nearly 20 years, making it the least affordable amongst the 36 wealthy Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations.Finance Minister Grant Robertson has said publicly that he is looking at moves to restrict loans to investors and dampen potential returns, while supporting other types of investments, but analysts warn there is no easy fix."The finance minister will need to throw the entire kitchen sink at this problem," said Brad Olsen, senior economist at Wellington-based economic consultancy firm Infometrics."The conversation happening in Kiwi households during summer was not COVID-19, but housing. So he doesn't need a silver bullet ... he needs to fire every damn bullet at it."House prices have doubled over the last decade and successive governments in the country of 5 million have struggled for years to find solutions.Almost 1% of New Zealand’s population is ranked as homeless or "severely housing deprived", the highest rate amongst OECD nations, and almost twice that of neighbouring Australia.While Ardern's government was easily returned to power last year after virtually eliminating COVID-19 domestically and a string of domestic successes, the scrapping in 2019 of its flagship KiwiBuild project to build 100,000 affordable homes was a notable failure.HOUSING DIVIDEArdern said on Monday the government will outline a suite of urgent and longer term measures to tip the balance in favour of first home buyers and improve housing supply."It is, I believe, a plan that will start to make a difference in this complex problem," she said.Mooted changes include restrictions on high debt-to-income and interest-only mortgage lending to investors, along with extending the holding time of investment properties from 5 years to 10 to win tax offsets and lowering tax rates on investments outside of housing.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has already tightened mortgage lending rules, and has been asked to consider housing while setting policies.These demand side measures will have some impact, but don't address the central problem - a clear lack of affordable homes, said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr."I'm worried the focus will be too much on the demand side ... I don't believe speculation is the problem, but it's an easy one to focus on," said Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr."The issue we have here is a chronic housing shortages and anything government can do to boost supply of dwellings will go a long way in solving this crisis," he said.Another headache for the government is upsetting investors and home owners who are sitting on tidy profits from the housing boom."Housing is the most divisive issue at the moment," said Infometrics' Olsen."While there's an understanding that prices need to go down, there are also a lot of Kiwis who don't want their investments to go into the red."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-searches-for-fix-as-housing-prices-soar-101616386399936.html

The results of the trial also showed that no safety concerns were found regarding the development of blood clots after receiving the vaccine. The results come amid rising concerns over numerous blood clot events reported in many European Union countries for the past two weeks. AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish pharmaceuticals company, also issued a statement after the reports of blood clots, saying that a review of 17 million people who were administered its Covid-19 vaccine suggested that it was entirely safe for use.Read more: Explained: Why have some countries suspended use of AstraZeneca vaccine?Here are the key things we know about the trial:1. The trial in the United States was run by experts at Columbia University and University of Rochester in collaboration with AstraZeneca in which 32,449 people participated, accruing 141 symptomatic cases of Covid-19. Approximately 60 per cent of the participants had comorbidities that are associated with an increased risk for progression of severe Covid-19 infection.2. The randomisation ratio of vaccine to placebo in the trial was 2:1 and the vaccine was given to the participants in two doses which were done four weeks apart.Read more: WHO panel gives nod to AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, has 'tremendous potential'3. Around a fifth of the volunteers who participated in the trial were over 65 years and in this group, the vaccine was found to be 80 per cent effective.4.

22-03-2021||World||Taiwan loses two fighter jets in apparent collision||Two Taiwanese fighter jets crashed on Monday in the third such incident in the past half year, at a time when the Beijing-claimed island's armed forced are under increasing pressure to intercept Chinese aircraft on an almost daily basis.While Taiwan's air force is well trained and well equipped, mostly with US-made equipment, it is dwarfed by China's. Beijing views the democratic island as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control.Taiwan's National Rescue Command Centre said two air force F-5E fighters, each with one pilot aboard, crashed into the sea off the island's southeastern coast after they apparently collided in mid-air during a training mission.An air force helicopter, coast guard and other rescue ships have been scrambled to look for the pilots, it added.Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it was working on a statement, and provided no other immediate comment. The official Central News Agency said the air force had now grounded the F-5 fleet that operates from the Chihhang air base, where the aircraft are based.The US-built F-5 fighters first entered service in Taiwan in the late 1970s and have been mostly been retired from front-line activities, though some are still used for training and as a back-up for the main fleet.Another F-5 crashed in October, killing the pilot. The following month a much more modern F-16 crashed off Taiwan's east coast, whose pilot also died.In January of last year, Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed after a helicopter carrying them to visit soldiers crashed in a mountainous area near the capital Taipei.The incidents have raised concern about both training and maintenance, but also the pressure the air force is under to respond to repeated Chinese flights near the island.Taiwan's Defence Ministry has warned Chinese aircraft, including drones, are flying repeatedly in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, seeking to wear out Taiwan's air force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-loses-two-fighter-jets-in-apparent-collision-101616406607229.html
22-03-2021||World||Taiwan kicks off Covid-19 vaccination drive with AstraZeneca shot||Health care workers received the first shots in Taiwan's Covid-19 vaccination drive Monday, beginning a campaign that won't use supplies from China amid uneven distribution of the vaccines globally.Taiwan has on hand 117,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which it is distributing to healthcare workers across 57 hospitals.Taiwanese premier Su Tseng-chang launched the drive by receiving the first shot at National Taiwan University Hospital in the capital Taipei. “After 30 minutes of rest, there's no signs of any discomfort,” he said.The rest period is for monitoring recipients for any adverse reactions.Last week, more than a dozen nations suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after a few dozen people among the millions who've received the vaccine developed blood clots. The European Union’s drug regulatory agency concluded after a review it couldn't rule out a direct link but the benefits of using the vaccine outweigh the possible risks.Taiwan has signed contracts securing 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, 5.05 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, and 4.76 million doses of vaccines through COVAX.Currently, Taiwan has recorded 1,006 confirmed cases of COVID-19, most of those from visitors coming from abroad. It has been one of the most successful places in the world in the battle against the pandemic, owing to strict public health and border control measures.The island is planning to administer its full initial supply to 117,000 individuals to ensure the broadest protection. The first dose provides an efficacy rate of 71% and the second dose — meant to be given eight weeks later — boosts its effectiveness to 81%, authorities have said previously.Taiwan has yet to announce a vaccination campaign for the public.Countries around the world are scrambling for vaccines, which have been distributed unevenly with rich countries buying up a majority of the doses. China has stepped in to offer hundreds of millions of doses of its own vaccines across the developing world, but Taiwan has refrained from buying them.Taiwanese law bans import of Chinese vaccines made for human use. The island's health minister had said in February there were no considerations to amending the law and no experts have made a special recommendation for Chinese vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-kicks-off-covid-19-vaccination-drive-with-astrazeneca-shot-101616390284110.html

22-03-2021||World||Netanyahu says he made Israel a 'vaccination nation'. But will it vote for him?||Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed victory over Covid-19 by making Israel a "vaccination nation". Even that may not be enough when voters wearing mandatory masks cast their ballots in an election on Tuesday.Netanyahu, who turned Israel's world-leading rollout of vaccines into a showcase of his campaign in the country's fourth national poll in two years, gave a measured assessment of his chances after the latest opinion polls pointed to a close race."I'm still missing a (parliamentary) seat or two to achieve a stable government," he said on Army Radio on Sunday, in what could have been a strategic bid to rally supporters of his right-wing Likud party to turn out to vote.Opinion polls showed an uptick for Likud in the campaign's home stretch, giving a Netanyahu-led coalition of conservative and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties around 60 seats, still short of a majority in the 120-member parliament.But the surveys indicated that a potential, though perhaps unlikely alliance of left-wing, centre and rightist factions, possibly led by Netanyahu's strongest rival in the polls - centrist Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party - is also near 60.No one party has ever won a parliamentary majority on its own in an Israeli election. In a close contest, election night results may only be a starting point, with backroom coalition talks determining whether "King Bibi" will still rule.Gone this time were Netanyahu's giant billboards featuring a handshake with ally Donald Trump, defeated in the U.S. presidential election in November.And with Democrat Joe Biden in the White House, there was little prospect of U.S. diplomatic moves that could help Netanyahu's election chances.Israel's longest-serving leader, 71, focused instead on highlighting his role in turning high-tech Israel into what he dubbed a "vaccination nation".About half of the population has been inoculated at a pace that drew international praise for Netanyahu but also calls for Israel to do more to ensure Palestinians in territories it occupies receive vaccines."We are the world champions in handling the coronavirus ... I have brought millions of vaccine doses and will bring millions more," Netanyahu said on the stump, pacing the stage in multiple campaign rallies each day and in a slew of media interviews as election day neared.Political opponents say he mishandled the pandemic from the start, pointing to the need for three national lockdowns and accusing him of turning a blind eye to violators within the ultra-Orthodox community that provides a power base for his key coalition partners.'Obsession'For Netanyahu, public praise from Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, Israel's main vaccine supplier, was campaign gold. The prime minister, Bourla told Israel's Channel 12 TV, phoned him 30 times to secure a supply deal - even at 3 a.m."Just like I was obsessive about the vaccines, I'll be obsessive about our economy," Netanyahu said on Army Radio, promising more cash stipends for all Israelis and ailing businesses.But after three inconclusive elections, voters have had plenty of time to make up their minds about Netanyahu, in a ballot being held almost a quarter of a century to the day after he won his first term as prime minister.Despite corruption charges he denies, weekly street protests over his alleged graft, a trial scheduled to gain speed after the ballot and elections in April and September 2019 and last March, Netanyahu has managed to stay at Israel's helm.This time, much could depend on potential kingmaker Naftali Bennett, who heads the ultranationalist Yamina party and once served as Netanyahu's defence minister.Without Bennett's backing, neither a Netanyahu-led coalition nor an anti-Bibi alliance would have enough seats in parliament for a governing majority, polls showed.And Arab voters might also tip the balance, six years after Netanyahu, drawing allegations of racism, said on election day that they were "heading to the polling stations in droves" to wreck his chances for a right-wing government.Now, he peers down from Arabic-language Likud billboards and has campaigned in several Arab towns. Looking at their country's messy political mix, many Israelis simply wonder whether a fifth election is on the cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-says-he-made-israel-a-vaccination-nation-but-will-it-vote-for-him-101616403599424.html

Myanmar we are going to take sanctions against 11 persons involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators," Borrell said, adding the situation in the country was deteriorating.Reuters reported on March 8 that the EU was preparing the measures. The names of the individuals are expected to be made public once the sanctions are formally decided by ministers.Stronger measures are expected soon as the bloc moves to target the businesses run by the military.EU diplomats have told Reuters that parts of the military's conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), are likely to be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.The conglomerates are spread throughout the economy from mining and manufacturing to food and beverages to hotels, telecoms and banking. They rank among the country's biggest taxpayers and sought partnerships with foreign companies as Myanmar opened up during its democratic liberalization.A U fact-finding mission in 2019 recommended sanctions against the two companies and their subsidiaries, saying they gave the army extra sources of revenue that could finance human rights violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-sanction-11-people-involved-in-myanmar-coup-foreign-policy-chief-says-101616402861933.html

Phase two is expected to begin in July, with results by year-end.The Thai vaccine candidate modifies the avian Newcastle Disease virus with a Covid-19 spike protein and is replicated using egg-based technology, the GPO said.Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the vaccine would give Thailand more options with less constraints."Even though we can produce vaccines in the country, it is from technology transfer and under management of brands," he told the news conference."But today, if we are successful we can set our own direction."Another homegrown vaccine is being developed by Chulalongkorn University and uses Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. It is expected to start human trials soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thaideveloped-covid-19-vaccine-starts-human-trials-101616400787384.html
22-03-2021||World||Journalist freed in Myanmar as anti-coup protests continue||A BBC journalist held in Myanmar has been freed, the broadcaster said on Monday, as demonstrators took to the streets for fresh anti-coup protests against the military.Myanmar's junta has unleashed deadly violence on protesters who have risen against the military's ousting of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month.More than 2,600 people have been arrested and 250 killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group that has warned fatalities could be even higher.Aung Thura, a journalist with the BBC's Burmese service, was detained by men in plain clothes while reporting outside a court in the capital Naypyidaw on Friday.The broadcaster confirmed on Monday in a news story on its website that he had been freed but gave no further details.Scores of people, including teachers, marched on Monday through the pre-dawn streets of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, some carrying placards calling for UN intervention in the crisis.Mandalay has seen some of the worst violence of the crackdown and recorded eight more deaths on Sunday, a medical source told AFP, adding that as many as 50 people were injured.Machine guns rang out late into the night across the city of 1.7 million."People were really scared and felt insecure the whole night," a doctor told AFP by phone.To protest the brutality of the crackdown, a group of doctors in Mandalay staged a "placard only" demonstration by lining up signs in the street, Voice of Myanmar reported.A group of monks staged a similar "monkless" protest.There were also early morning protests in parts of Yangon, the commercial capital and largest city, where drivers honked their horns in support of the anti-coup movement.Residents in Yangon's Hlaing township released hundreds of red helium balloons with posters calling for a UN intervention to stop atrocities, according to local media.One man was also killed during daytime clashes with security forces in the central city of Monywa Sunday and hundreds turned out to protest a day later, local media reported.- EU sanctions -International concern has been growing over the junta's brutal approach as the death toll climbs, with a senior UN expert warning the military is likely committing "crimes against humanity".But so far the generals have shown little sign of heeding calls for restraint as they struggle to quell the unrest.In a fresh bid to step up pressure, the European Union is expected on Monday to hit 11 junta cadres with sanctions -- in the form of travel bans and asset freezes.The United States and Britain have already taken similar steps.Myanmar's regional neighbours have also weighed in, with Indonesia and Malaysia calling for an emergency summit of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations to discuss the crisis.Following the call, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan embarked on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour including meetings in Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia.On the commercial front, French energy giant EDF announced that a $1.5-billion hydropower dam project in Myanmar had been suspended in response to the coup.Australia and Canada have confirmed they are providing consular assistance to two business consultants detained in Myanmar.It is understood that Matthew O'Kane and Christa Avery, a dual Canadian-Australian citizen, are under house arrest after trying to leave the country on a relief flight Friday.The couple run a consultancy business in Yangon.The Canadian and Australian foreign ministries have refused to comment further on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalist-freed-in-myanmar-as-anti-coup-protests-continue-101616403253184.html

Other countries producing it include Brazil, China and South Korea.Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, which has run small clinical studies of Sputnik V in India, sought emergency-use approval for the vaccine last month, but India's drug regulator asked for more data from the Sputnik V developers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-virchow-biotech-to-make-russia-s-sputnik-v-shot-in-india-101616402094651.html
22-03-2021||World||Two Americans accused of aiding Ghosn escape indicted in Japan||Two Americans accused of helping former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn jump bail and escape from Japan were indicted on Monday and face up to three years in prison.The father-son pair arrived in Japan earlier this month from the United States after losing their battle to avoid extradition.Both Michael Taylor and his son Peter face a single charge of helping a criminal escape.The pair, along with a third man still at large, is believed to have masterminded the operation that saw former international jet-setter Ghosn packed into an audio-equipment case and onto a private jet to jump bail in December 2019.Ghosn is now beyond the reach of Japanese justice in Lebanon, which does not have an extradition treaty with Tokyo.But the Taylors were arrested in the US last year after Japan issued a warrant for them.They sought to block Tokyo's extradition request by claiming they would face torture-like conditions while in custody in Japan, but the US Supreme Court struck down their appeal in February.'Brazen and well-orchestrated escape'Ghosn was a global business superstar and head of an auto alliance joining Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors before his career came crashing to an abrupt end in November 2018, when Tokyo investigators stormed his private jet to arrest him.The French-Lebanese-Brazilian national was eventually charged with four counts of financial misconduct over claims he hid compensation and misused Nissan funds.Having spent months in detention, Ghosn was out on bail awaiting trial on the charges -- which he denies -- when he fled the country in what Japanese prosecutors termed "one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history".Having spent months in detention, Ghosn was out on bail awaiting trial on the charges -- which he denies -- when he fled the country in what Japanese prosecutors termed "one of the most brazen and well-orchestrated escape acts in recent history".The details of his escape proved embarrassing to Japanese authorities -- with the former tycoon allegedly having boarded a train to Osaka before evading security checks at Kansai airport by boarding a private jet packed into an oversized box that was not scanned.After his arrival in Lebanon, Ghosn claimed that he had been forced to escape because he feared he would not get a fair hearing.While Ghosn remains at large, the repercussions of both the original case against him and his escape from Japan continue.In Tokyo, his former close aide at Nissan, Greg Kelly, is currently on trial for his alleged role in underreporting Ghosn's income. Nissan itself faces charges in the case and has pleaded guilty.And a Turkish court has sentenced two pilots and another employee of a small private airline to four years and two months in prison for their role in Ghosn's escape.Ghosn transited in Turkey, switching planes on his way to Lebanon, and the three Turks were charged with involvement in conspiracy to smuggle a migrant.Two other pilots and two flight attendants on trial in Turkey were acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-americans-accused-of-aiding-ghosn-escape-indicted-in-japan-101616398958500.html
22-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine found to be 79% effective in US trial||The Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford was 79% effective in preventing the disease in a US trial, paving the way for the shot’s potential approval.The UK drugmaker published the first data from a study of more than 30,000 volunteers on Monday. The results are good news for older adults, who made up about a quarter of the tests, after trials last year failed to provide conclusive data for that age group due to a lack of participants over the age of 65.The vaccine was also shown to be 100% effective at preventing severe disease, death and hospitalization.The findings should go some way to bolstering confidence in the shot globally after confusion over the true efficacy of the vaccine and the best dosing regimen has impacted take-up, particularly in Europe.Trials in the U.K. and Brazil last year produced a range of readings due to different dosing amounts and regimens used, and at least 10 countries in the European Union only approved the shot for under-65s initially. Many have since reversed that decision after more data from real world use showed the shot was highly effective in older people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazenecaoxford-covid-19-vaccine-79-effective-in-us-trial-101616397087453.html
22-03-2021||World||Explained: As Israel heads to elections, Netanyahu's future hangs in balance||Israel will hold its fourth election in two years on Tuesday as the incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing Likud party hopes to bank on the country’s success in the Covid-19 vaccination rollout. But 71-year-old Netanyahu, who is the longest-serving leader in the history of the country, faces corruption allegations that led to massive protests in the country ahead of the elections. He also faces the challenge of securing the majority in the elections so that the country can move forth from the past two years of political paralysis and lack of a stable majority.How are elections in Israel conducted?Voting in elections in Israel is done for parties and not for individual candidates. The 120 seats in Knesset, the country’s parliament, are distributed among parties as per their share of the national vote, thus making it difficult for any single party to win a majority (61 seats). Therefore, forming alliances post-election is the norm.What are the major challenges that Netanyahu faces?Israel is said to have raced out of the pandemic with the vast majority of the country’s population already being inoculated and millions in the country receiving the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine. Since the vaccination began in the country in December last year, new Covid-19 infections are as low as 3 per cent and restrictions that were put in place owing to the pandemic have largely been removed in the country.Even though Netanyahu’s government has made significant strides in managing the coronavirus pandemic, he faces major challenges. Netanyahu faces allegations of corruption as his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach has already begun and will resume after the elections. He also faces the challenge of reviving the country’s economy which, like other nations in the world, has been hit hard by the pandemic.Who are Netanyahu’s main rivals in these elections?Netanyahu’s main challenger from the previous election Benny Gantz is not much of a force to reckon with in these elections. Gantz, who is a former general, joined Netanyahu in a coalition after the previous elections, saying that he was doing so as there was a need for a national unity government. This resulted in the loss of Gantz popularity in the country and polls expect his Blue and White party to not win any seats in these elections.Netanyahu faces a major challenge from Yair Lapid, who is a former finance minister and TV host who leads the centre-left Yesh Atid party. Gideon Saar, who was a cabinet minister in the government and later quit the Likud party to set up his own New Hope party, is also a serious contender in the polls as his party has the same political interests as that of the Likud. Naftali Bennett, a former aide of Netanyahu and a cabinet minister as well as a high-tech millionaire, is also in the race with his ultra-right Yamina party.What do the opinion polls say?The opinion polls have predicted that there will be no clear winner in the elections. In Knesset, most opinion polls predict that Netanyahu’s Likud is expected to emerge as the single biggest party.What happens if Netanyahu’s party does not emerge as the single-largest party?Likud will need to emerge as the single-largest party in order to be the driving force of a coalition government. Although, the formation of a coalition government will be difficult as was in the case in the previous three elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-as-israel-heads-to-elections-netanyahu-s-future-hangs-in-balance-101616393885002.html
22-03-2021||World||Investors with $2 trillion urge EU to make agriculture greener||The European Union’s flagship agricultural policy risks undermining the bloc’s net-zero climate targets because it supports high-polluting food industries, according to a group of investors and policy experts.Reforms to the Common Agriculture Policy don’t go far enough to address climate change and biodiversity, investors managing 2 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion) of assets said Monday. The policy will give farmers of high-emitting commodities like beef bigger subsidies for producing more, the group said. It urged the inclusion of climate targets in the distribution of the payments, which make up one-third of the EU budget.Greening agriculture is one of the biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. The EU is decarbonizing its economy, but agriculture, the third-largest contributor of greenhouse gases, has seen little reduction in the past 15 years.“Some of the main barriers for further improvements in sustainability have to be resolved by policymakers,” Peter van der Werf, senior engagement specialist at Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV, said in a statement. Reform in the agriculture policy is important “to ensure that any subsidies provide the right incentives for farmers to align with the Paris Agreement,” he said.The change will be crucial for climate mitigation, reversing emissions and long-term environmental resilience, said the group which includes Legal & General Investment Management and Brunel Pension Partnership.Its recommendations include shifting incentives from prioritizing yields to those that put a value on sustainable agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/investors-with-2-trillion-urge-eu-to-make-agriculture-greener-101616391805262.html
22-03-2021||World||Australian parliament debates motion on rights abuses in China's Xinjiang||Australia's parliament debated on Monday a motion to condemn "systematic breaches" of human rights by China, saying other legislatures had described as genocide its actions towards Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang.Parliaments in Canada and the Netherlands drew rebukes from Beijing after they passed non-binding motions in February that said the treatment of China's Uighur Muslim minority constituted genocide."The most egregious, systematic abuse of human rights in the world is occurring in Xinjiang," said Kevin Andrews, a lawmaker of Australia's ruling Liberal party, moving a private member's motion that drew support from members of all major parties.The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China denies any human rights abuses in Xinjiang.Andrews cited large-scale internment camps and accusations of forced labour among the reasons for the condemnation from the Dutch and Canadian parliaments, as well as Britain's upper house and U.S. Secretaries of State Mike Pompeo and Antony Blinken.Many have said, or questioned if, the ruling Chinese Communist Party's programme contravened the United Nations' genocide convention of 1948, he added.Andrews' motion urges Australia to enforce laws against modern slavery and identify supply chains that use forced labour. It was not immediately clear when it would be put to a vote.A Labor MP said many of the 3,000 Uighurs in Australia lived in her electorate, and were desperate and anxious."Most Australian Uighurs know someone who has disappeared or not been heard of for many years," Anne Stanley, who represents Werriwa in western Sydney, told parliament."Those here don't know whether they are alive or dead."China initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centers and are designed to combat extremism. Late in 2019, it said all people in the camps had "graduated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-parliament-debates-motion-on-rights-abuses-in-china-s-xinjiang-101616390111348.html
22-03-2021||World||Myanmar: Army uproots ethnic villagers amid anti-coup protests||In the jungles of southeast Myanmar, the army was shooting and otherwise oppressing civilians long before last month’s military coup.This largely unseen repression continues even now. In the country’s remote southeast, an army offensive has driven as many as 8,000 ethnic Karen people to flee their homes in what aid groups say is the worst upheaval there for nearly 10 years.They’re now living in the jungle, with fears growing for their health and security, and no prospect of an early return.This crisis in the borderlands has been overshadowed by the deadly crackdown on the mass movement protesting the military’s takeover of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.But it also is a reminder of the brutal force Myanmar's army has long used against civilians, and in particular the country's ethnic minorities.The Karen National Union, the leading political body for the Karen, for now is shouldering all of the displaced people’s basic needs for food, shelter and security.But in the long run, that will be a challenge for the group, said Padoh Saw Taw Nee, head of the KNU’s foreign affairs department, in an email interview.“Therefore the international community should reach out with humanitarian assistance to these people who are in need as soon as possible,” he said.The Karen are among more than a dozen ethnic groups that have been seeking greater autonomy from the central government since Myanmar, then known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948.At times the ethnic groups’ guerrilla forces have engaged in full-on armed conflict with the government; in recent years, many have reached an uneasy cease-fire. Their talks with Suu Kyi's government failed to reach a comprehensive political resolution before it was deposed by the coup.The army, meanwhile, has aggressively expanded its reach in at least two districts in Karen state since 2017, building new bases and roads to try to dominate an area that doesn’t want it there.In the last few months, troop numbers and activity have scaled up dramatically, according to relief organizations active there.The Karen’s own armed force, the Karen National Liberation Army, has fought back. In retaliation, the army has increased its attacks and shelled surrounding villages.Relief agencies say the 8,000 or so people who abandoned their homes for the privations of the jungle are safe and are adapting as well as they can, building bamboo shelters and holding school classes in the open.But no one knows when they can return or whether their villages will still be standing when they do. Meanwhile, the fields where their crops would grow are untended, threatening food supplies later in the year.A humanitarian group, the Free Burma Rangers, has been bringing in aid since the attacks began and documenting the Karens' plight. The group was formed in the late 1990s during intense attacks that displaced more than 100,000 Karen people.Its founder and director, Dave Eubank, is a former member of the U.S. Special Forces who combines evangelical activities with well-disciplined forays by Karen volunteers to deliver medical aid to villagers.In a recent interview with The Associated Press via satellite phone from the affected area, Eubank spoke of what the displaced Karen desperately need.He said that stopping attacks by Myanmar troops — “security and survival” — is the top priority.Food comes next. “As they get displaced they’ve got to eat,” he said. “They can’t go back and start their crops. They can’t prepare for the next fields, they can’t look after the animals,” he said.Medical care and shelter are also essential, Eubank said.In 2012, the Karen National Union signed a cease-fire with the government, which it hoped would end decades of military aggression. But Myanmar’s army has repeatedly breached it. This is the worst breach yet, aid groups say.Hsa Moo from the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network has just returned from the affected area. A former refugee herself, she says it’s heartbreaking.“This is not a good time for us. This is after the cease-fire; but we thought the cease-fire can help them, but actually not. So they have to flee and they have to hide, so it is very difficult for them to hide in the jungle,” she said.The Karen long ago learned the brutal nature of the military, independent analyst David Mathieson told The Associated Press.“What’s interesting about Karen state is a lot of people there see the fighting and now the coup and the civil disobedience movement as intricately linked,” he said. “It’s like ‘Look, we’ve been telling you for years that the enemy is the military.’"“For all those people who wanted to accommodate the military, when you live in these areas of ongoing armed conflict you know exactly who you are dealing with and you know that you can’t trust them,” he explained.The lesson he takes from the army's actions in the cities and in the hinterlands: "This is the military trying to subjugate the entire country once again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-army-uproots-ethnic-villagers-amid-anti-coup-protests-101616389089686.html

22-03-2021||World||Europe can achieve herd immunity by July: EU commissioner||Europe could have herd immunity against Covid-19 by July, a European Union commissioner has said, as incoming jabs are expected to speed up the continent's sluggish vaccine rollout.The note of optimism comes even as several European countries have started reimposing restrictions as they contend with surging coronavirus infections, and after mixed messaging on the safety of a key jab."Let's take a symbolic date: by July 14, we have the possibility of achieving immunity across the continent," Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market told French broadcaster TF1."We're in the home stretch, because we know that to beat this pandemic there's just one solution: vaccination. The vaccines are arriving," he said.More than a third of France's population is now under renewed lockdown, while frustrations over virus curbs spilled into weekend demonstrations in Germany, Amsterdam, Bulgaria and Switzerland.Europe's battle to prevent a deadly third wave of infections has been complicated by a patchy vaccine drive that included several nations temporarily halting AstraZeneca's shots in response to isolated cases of blood clots.Most have since resumed using the vaccine after the European Medicines Agency found it "safe and effective".But AstraZeneca has delivered only 30 percent of the 90 million doses it promised the EU for the first quarter.Breton said he was confident more vaccines will arrive soon, with 300-350 million doses expected between March and June.He added that 55 factories would now be producing vaccines in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-can-achieve-herd-immunity-by-july-eu-commissioner-101616386541732.html
22-03-2021||World||A transgender Islamic school in Pakistan breaks barriers||A long white shawl on her head, Rani Khan gives daily Koran lessons at Pakistan's first transgender-only madrasa, or Islamic religious school, which she set up herself using her life savings.The madrasa is an important milestone for the LGBTQ community in the overwhelmingly fundamental Muslim country, where transgender people face ostracism, even though there is no official restriction on them attending religious schools or praying at mosques."Most families do not accept transgender people. They throw them out of their homes. Transgender people turn to wrongdoing," Khan, 34, said, as other transgender people, their heads similarly covered, swayed back and forth behind her, reciting Koran verses."At one time, I was also one of them."Holding back tears, Khan recalled how she was disowned by her family at 13 and forced into begging.At 17, she joined a transgender group, dancing at weddings and other functions, but quit it to connect with her religion after a dream in which a deceased transgender friend and fellow dancer pleaded with her to do something for the community.Khan studied the Koran at home, and attended religious schools, before opening the two-room madrasa in October."I'm teaching the Koran to please God, to make my life here and in the hereafter," Khan said, explaining how the madrasa offered a place for transgender people to worship, learn about Islam and repent for past actions.She says the school has not received aid from the government, although some officials promised to help students find jobs.Along with some donations, Khan is teaching her students how to sew and embroider, in hopes of raising funds for the school by selling clothing.Pakistan's parliament recognised the third gender in 2018, giving such individuals fundamental rights such as the ability to vote and choose their gender on official documents.Nonetheless, the transgender remain on the margins in the country, and often have to resort to begging, dancing and prostitution to make a living.The madrasa could help trans people assimilate into mainstream society, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat told Reuters."I'm hopeful that if you replicate this model in other cities, things will improve," he said.A religious school for transgender people has opened in Dhaka, the capital of nearby Bangladesh, and last year a Christian transgender group started its own church in Pakistan's bustling southern port city of Karachi.Pakistan's 2017 census recorded about 10,000 transgender people, though trans rights groups say the number could now be well over 300,000 in the country of 220 million."It gives my heart peace when I read the Koran," said one madrasa student, Simran Khan, who is also eager to learn life skills."It is much better than a life full of insults," the 19-year-old added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-transgender-islamic-school-in-pakistan-breaks-barriers-101616377041561.html
22-03-2021||World||Turkish lira plunges after Erdogan sacks hawkish central bank chief||Turkey's lira plunged 15% to near its all-time low after markets opened following President Tayyip Erdogan's shock weekend decision to oust a hawkish central bank governor and install a like-minded critic of high interest rates.The appointment of Sahap Kavcioglu, a former banker and ruling party lawmaker, in the early hours on Saturday marked the third time since mid-2019 that Erdogan has abruptly fired a central bank chief.Kavcioglu had sought to ease concerns over a sharp selloff in Turkish assets and a pivot from rate hikes to cuts in a 90-minute call on Sunday, in which he told bank CEOs he planned no immediate policy change, a source told Reuters.The currency tumbled to as weak as 8.4850 versus the dollar, from 7.2185 on Friday, back to levels touched in early November when it reached an intraday record of 8.58. It last changed hands at 8.0749."The lira is being smashed by investors fearing that the custodian of its value does not share their hopes for a stable currency underpinned by positive real interest rates," said Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow, adding that the lira may not yet have found a bottom."The real test will be when the volume comes in in Europe," he said.Goldman Sachs and others had expected a sharp dive in the lira and Turkish assets given the new governor's dovish and even unorthodox views, and what was seen as the latest damage to the bank's credibility amid years of policy interference that has dogged the major emerging market economy.The weekend overhaul could soon reverse the hawkish steps taken by predecessor Naci Agbal, analysts said, and nudge Turkey toward a balance of payments crisis given its depleted buffer of FX reserves.One possible scenario would see the lira swing as much as 15% in both directions in Monday's European session as "TRY sets off on a roller-coaster ride driven by capital flight, central bank interventions and bargain hunters," SEB Research wrote in a client note.Erdogan fired Agbal two days after a sharp rate hike that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and a dipping lira.In less than five months on the job, Agbal had raised rates by 875 basis points to 19% and regained some policy credibility as the lira rallied from its nadir. But the currency gave back most of those gains in less than 10 minutes as the week's trade began."It is going to be a dark and long day on Monday," said one Turkish fund manager.Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities, predicted a 10%-15% lira depreciation over the coming days.The overhaul "demonstrates the erratic nature of policy decisions in Turkey, especially with regard to monetary matters (and risks) looser, unorthodox, and eventually mostly pro-growth policies from now on," he said.On the call with Turkish bankers, Kavcioglu said any policy change would depend on lowering inflation, which he said was the primary goal, the source familiar with the call said.Kavcioglu said the current policy approach would continue, the source added. The central bank did not immediately comment.In a statement on Sunday, Kavcioglu said the bank would focus on permanently lowering inflation, which has been stuck in double digits for most of the last four years.A former member of parliament for Erdogan's AK Party (AKP), Kavcioglu has espoused the unorthodox views shared by the president. He wrote high rates "indirectly cause inflation to rise," in a newspaper column last month.WEEKEND OF QUESTIONSAgbal's latest rate hike was 200 basis-points on Thursday which sparked a more than 3% lira rally.His hawkish stance dramatically cut Turkey's CDS risk gauges and started to reverse a years-long trend of funds abandoning local assets.But after Erdogan ousted Agbal, investors told Reuters they had worked through the weekend to predict how quickly and sharply Kavcioglu might cut rates - and how much the currency would retreat.The heads of some local treasury desks had estimated offers up to 8.00 on Monday. At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar on Saturday, one trader said a dollar bought 7.80-7.90 of the local currency.Wall Street bank Goldman told clients it was reviewing investment recommendations and predicted a "discontinuous" drop in the lira, and a "front-loaded" rate-cutting cycle.The overhaul meant capital outflows appeared likely and a rapid adjustment in the current account may be necessary since markets would shy away from funding Turkey's chronic deficits, it said.Concerns over central bank independence have exacerbated Turkey's boom-and-bust economy and record dollarisation, and prompted last year's unorthodox and costly policy of FX interventions, economists say.The lira has lost half its value since a 2018 currency crisis.Kavcioglu said in the statement that policy meetings will remain on a monthly schedule, suggesting any rate cuts may wait until the next planned meeting on April 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-lira-plunges-after-erdogan-sacks-hawkish-central-bank-chief-101616382084772.html
22-03-2021||World||Myanmar protests: Doctors join 'civil disobedience' movement against coup||Health care workers marched through Myanmar's second-biggest city Sunday as part of a broad civil disobedience movement against last month's coup. While their protest was left alone, security forces used violence elsewhere and shot dead at least one person.About 100 doctors, nurses, medical students and pharmacists, wearing long white coats, lined up on a main road in Mandalay to chant slogans and voice their opposition to the Feb. 1 coup that toppled the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Mandalay has been a major center of opposition to the takeover, and later in the day engineers there held what has been dubbed a “no-human strike,” an increasingly popular tactic that involves lining up signboards in streets or other public areas as proxies for human protesters.Video recorded in Mandalay showed a motorcyclist apparently being shot off his motorbike by police on an empty street.As the people who recorded the video shout “He’s been hit! He’s been hit! Go and rescue him!” police quickly appear and swarm around him just after he slumps to the ground. Police led him away on foot while another officer rides off on the motorbike. It isn’t clear how badly he was hurt or what happened to him.The civil disobedience movement has used widespread boycotts, strikes and other actions with the aim to restore civilian government and return Myanmar to its slow march toward democracy that began nearly a decade ago after a half-century of military rule.In recent weeks, street protests have faded as a tactic in the face of rising deaths as police and soldiers have shot live fire into crowds and indiscriminately detained people. The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners had verified 247 deaths nationwide but says the actual total, including cases where verification has been difficult, is probably much higher.At least one protester was shot dead Sunday in Monywa, another central Myanmar city, according to the online news site Myanmar Now and numerous social media posts.Myanmar Now, citing a doctor in Monywa, identified the victim as Min Min Zaw, who was shot in the head as he was helping assemble barricades for a protest. Virtually all the dead since the coup have been shot, many of them in the head.Elsewhere, students, teachers and engineers marched in Dawei, a city in southeastern Myanmar that has become a hotspot for opposition and has seen at least five killings by security forces.On Sunday, protesters broke into small groups and varied the timings of their marches in an effort to avoid confrontations.In a more rural outlying area, protesters from several villages in Launglone Township held their protest on motorbikes.In Yangon’s Thaketa neighborhood, a funeral was held Sunday for 15-year-old high school student Aung Kaung Htet, who was killed a day earlier, Myanmar Now reported.According to posts on social media, Thaketa was one of several areas where police fired their guns Sunday, the others including Tachileik and Taunnggyi in Shan State in eastern Myanmar, and Gangaw, a town in Magway Division in the west-central part of the country.The protesters' cause over the weekend received support from demonstrations in several places abroad, including Tokyo, Taipei in Taiwan and on Times Square in New York City.In addition to deaths since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has confirmed 2,345 people have been arrested or charged since the coup, with 1,994 still detained or sought for arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protests-doctors-join-civil-disobedience-movement-against-coup-101616383956496.html
22-03-2021||World||Miami Beach extends curfew, emergency powers to control spring break crowds||Miami Beach officials voted on Sunday to extend an 8pm curfew and emergency powers for up to three weeks to help control unruly and mostly maskless crowds that have converged on the party destination during spring break.Thousands of people have packed the city's Art Deco Cultural District causing bedlam and lawlessness in recent days when university students typically celebrate spring break, leading some businesses to close voluntarily out of concern for public safety.Mayor Dan Gelber told an emergency meeting of the city commission that all manner of out-of-town and out-of-state visitors, not just college students, were filling the streets since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Feb. 26 called the state an "oasis of freedom" from coronavirus restrictions. "It looked like a rock concert. All you could see was wall to wall people," Interim City Manager Raul Aguila told the commission."This is not a typical spring break crowd. ... These are individuals coming into the city ... to engage in lawlessness and anything goes party attitude," Aguila said.Aguila said he noticed a surge on Friday night and imposed emergency powers on Saturday. That included authorities setting a curfew and closing streets in the area, citing in an emergency declaration "multiple fights, brawls, melees, and other public displays and disturbances of the peace."Officials also restricted eastbound traffic on the three main causeways connecting the city with downtown Miami.The commission on Sunday agreed to grant Aguila the authority to extend the measures for up to three more seven-day periods as needed, starting on Tuesday.Video and photos posted on social media showed thousands of spring breakers, many eager to let off steam after a year of COVID-19 lockdowns, packed together and dancing in the streets as police struggled to enforce the curfew, firing pepperballs at the crowd.Police said they had arrested more than 50 people and confiscated eight firearms since Friday, according to a Twitter post on Sunday afternoon.Hundreds of people reconvened on Sunday night, attempting to recreate the party atmosphere, but police dispersed the crowd, images on social media showed. There were no reports of mass arrests or major confrontations, the Miami Herald reported.The Miami Beach Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.Gelber said the mass crowds gathered at a time when the surrounding county was experiencing 1,000 new infections of Covid-19 each day and with 50 to 100 people being hospitalized each day.Many Miami Beach locals took to social media to blame out-of-towners for the chaos."Don't blame Miami for those crowds on South Beach. Nobody who's from Miami goes to South Beach," one Twitter user named Silas P. Silas wrote, eliciting approval from fellow residents.Concerns over public safety prompted some businesses to close their doors voluntarily during what would normally be among their most profitable days of the year and after months of hardship caused by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miami-beach-extends-curfew-emergency-powers-to-control-spring-break-crowds-101616384082739.html
22-03-2021||World||China denies foreign diplomats access to Canada's Michael Spavor trial||Chinese authorities refused diplomats from more than 20 countries access to the Beijing trial of jailed Canadian Michael Kovrig, in the latest international dispute over the high-profile spying case.Kovrig, an analyst for International Crisis Group, appeared Monday at the Beijing No. 2 People’s Intermediate Court to face allegations of spying on state secrets. The group of diplomats, led by Jim Nickel, the charge d’affaires at the Canadian Embassy, were refused access, in a repeat of what happened Friday at the related spying trial of Canadian Michael Spavor.“Michael Kovrig has been arbitrarily detained for more than two years now, precisely 833 days,” Nickel told reporters. “This is completely unacceptable, as is the lack of transparency in these court proceedings.”China detained the two Canadians in December 2018 after Canada detained Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou in response to a US extradition request. The pair were then charged in June last year.Spavor, who organized trips to North Korea, went on trial on Friday in the northeastern city of Dandong on charges of stealing and illegally providing state secrets to other countries. No verdict was announced after two hours of proceedings.Individuals convicted of serious violations of parts of the law cited by Chinese authorities face 10 years to life in prison. Diplomats attempting to attend the proceedings Monday included representatives from the US, the UK, the European Union and numerous European countries.China has closely tied the cases of the two men to Meng’s, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian telling reporters last year that halting her extradition “could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Canadians.”The US is seeking the extradition of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, to try her on fraud charges. Her extradition case is pending in Canadian courts.Canada has criticized China’s handling of the two men’s cases. Foreign Minister Marc Garneau said his country is “deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings.” On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the situation “completely unacceptable.”The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa disputed those comments, with an unnamed spokesperson saying in a statement posted on the embassy website: “This is just fact-distorting.”“On the one hand, the Canadian side claims that it upholds the rule of law, but on the other hand, it makes irresponsible remarks with regards to China’s handling relevant cases in accordance with law,” the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-foreign-diplomats-access-to-canada-s-michael-spavor-trial-101616380894450.html

22-03-2021||World||'Blunt' Joe Biden says US facing issues with racism, xenophobia and nativism||President Joe Biden took aim on Sunday at the "ugly poisons" of "systemic racism and white supremacy" that he said had long plagued the United States, and vowed to change the laws that enabled continued discrimination.In blunt language, the Democratic president said the country faced problems with racism, xenophobia and nativism.Biden's statement followed similar sentiments from Vice President Kamala Harris, who detailed in Atlanta on Friday the U.S history of discrimination against Asian Americans."Racism is real in America and it has always been," said Harris, the country's first Asian-American, first Black and first female vice president. "Xenophobia is real in America and always has been. Sexism too." she said.Biden' statement, issued on Sunday night, marks the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, created in the 1970s to mark a 1960 massacre in South Africa."Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It should have no safe harbor anywhere in the world. We must join together to make it stop," Biden said in the statement.He said his administration would speak out against racial discrimination around the world, including the "horrific" mistreatment of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and the Uighurs in China."One of the core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans is standing against hate and racism, even as we acknowledge that systemic racism and white supremacy are ugly poisons that have long plagued the United States," he said. "We must change the laws that enable discrimination in our country, and we must change our hearts."Biden's statement came amid mounting pressure on law enforcement authorities to treat last week's deadly shooting in Atlanta of eight people - including six women of Asian descent - as a hate crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blunt-joe-biden-says-us-facing-issues-with-racism-xenophobia-and-nativism-101616374446998.html
22-03-2021||World||Europeans' confidence in AstraZeneca jab falls after clotting fears: Poll||Trust in AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine in many European countries has plunged following controversy around the jab in recent weeks, according to a new survey unveiled Monday by British pollsters YouGov.A majority of people in the biggest European Union member states, including Germany, France, Spain and Italy, now see the inoculation as unsafe, the recent poll found.However, views of the Anglo-Swedish pharma giant's jab remain overwhelming positive in Britain, where two-thirds of respondents said it is safe, compared to just nine percent believing it is not.The findings come at a tumultuous time for the AstraZeneca vaccine and the EU's troubled inoculation campaign, as a third virus wave on the continent prompts renewed social restrictions.Meanwhile, Britain and the bloc are embroiled in an increasingly acrimonious war of words over supplies, with Brussels warning it may halt AstraZeneca vaccine exports.The drop in Europeans' faith in the jab, developed in partnership with Oxford University in the UK, follows weeks of turmoil on the continent over safety fears.Earlier this month several EU countries suspended its use, pending a review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) after dozens of isolated cases of blood clots and brain haemorrhages.The EMA last week declared the AstraZeneca jab "safe and effective", with the WHO and Britain's drugs watchdog issuing similar endorsements.That led European countries to resume administering the vaccine, but not before severely damaging confidence in it. 'Undoubtedly suffered' In its mid-March survey, YouGov found 55 percent of Germans now say the vaccine as unsafe -- a 15 point rise in a month -- compared to 32 percent viewing it as safe.In already more vaccine-hesitant France, 61 percent of respondents said it was unsafe, while Italy and Spain both saw a 27-point monthly jump in the number of people saying they did not trust the jab.No similar increases in safety fears were seen for rival vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna, YouGov said.The pollsters interviewed 2,024 Germans, and around 1,000 adults in each of the other countries between March 12 and 18."After concerns about its protection and potency were raised by leaders across Europe, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has undoubtedly suffered damage to its reputation for safety on the continent," said Matt Smith, lead data journalist at YouGov."With a third wave of infections potentially emerging now across the Channel, officials everywhere will be worried if ongoing rows about AstraZeneca's vaccine ends up damaging the rollout."Even prior to its recent woes in Europe, the jab -- which is among the cheapest available, relatively easy to store and billed as the vaccine of choice for poorer nations -- had suffered several setbacks.They include South Africa asking to send back one million doses after researchers found it had failed to prevent mild and moderate cases of a more contagious virus variant there.Confidence in the vaccine has also been hit by mixed messaging.French President Emmanuel Macron said at the end of January the vaccine was "quasi-ineffective for people over 65", despite the EMA approving its use for all ages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europeans-confidence-in-astrazeneca-jab-falls-after-clotting-fears-poll-101616372892528.html
22-03-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine battle with UK heats up as EU ready to halt shipments||The European Union is ready to start withholding Covid-19 shots from the UK, risking a sharp deterioration in relations with London in a bid to turn around its lackluster vaccination campaign.The EU will start reviewing, and likely rejecting, export authorization of AstraZeneca Plc coronavirus vaccines to the UK until the drugmaker fulfills its delivery obligations to the 27-nation bloc, according to a senior EU official.The EU has contracts with the company that aren’t being respected, and any vaccines and ingredients produced in European factories will be reserved for local deliveries, said the official, who asked not to be named because the decisions are under consideration and haven’t been made public.The conflict between the EU and the UK has been growing since Astra informed Brussels it wouldn’t deliver the number of shots it had promised for the first quarter. Both sides have blamed each other for export curbs and nationalism, posing a risk to the fragile post-Brexit trade relationship agreed on only in December.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke last week and a new round of high-level diplomacy is expected among leaders ahead of a summit in Brussels.The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, said last week that it would restrict exports of vaccines to countries that don’t reciprocate or that already have high vaccination rates. The UK is the largest recipient of doses made in the EU, receiving 10 million of 42 million shots from the bloc so far.EU leaders meeting this week will discuss the plan, and will ultimately have to decide if they should follow through with the proposed restrictive measures. Countries including Italy and France said they were open to exploring the export ban while others, such as Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, urged caution and warned about the impact on European companies, according to a diplomatic note seen by Bloomberg.“All options are on the table -- we are in the crisis of the century,” von der Leyen said last week. “We have to make sure that Europeans are vaccinated as soon as possible.”Johnson and von der Leyen spoke by telephone hours after the vaccine restriction plan was floated, according to two people familiar with the call.Johnson has called EU leaders about the dispute in recent days, including Dutch premier Mark Rutte and Alexander De Croo, his Belgian counterpart, and is prepared for more conversations before this week’s summit, a person familiar with the matter said.Slow RolloutAstra is now expected to deliver 30 million shots to the EU in the first quarter, less than half of what it initially committed to. The Astra vaccine is one of four approved in the EU.The EU is struggling to overcome a slow start to its inoculation campaign and has pledged to immunize 70% of adults by the end of September. The bloc has administered 12 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. The EU expects 360 million deliveries from all providers in the second quarter, almost four times as many as in the first three months of the year.The EU isn’t alone in facing supply issues. The UK is facing a “significant” four-week cut to the supply of Covid-19 vaccines from late March, according to a letter sent to local health-service groups last week. A delayed shipment of the Astra vaccine from India and a batch requiring re-testing are behind the disruption.UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News on Sunday that the EU should allow Astra to keep supplying Britain and warned the bloc would pay a heavy price if it tried to interfere with those shipments.‘Political Pressure’“The commission knows deep down that this would be counterproductive,” he said. “They’re under tremendous political pressure at the European Commission. It would damage the EU’s relations globally.” A spokesperson for Johnson’s office declined to comment and referred back to Wallace’s remarks.It’s not the EU’s responsibility to help Astra deliver on its commitments to the UK, according to the EU official.Still, a spokesman for Pfizer Inc. warned that the free movement of supplies between the UK and the EU is critical to the production of its vaccine. Manufacturing of lipids -- the fatty substance used to deliver the genetic material at the heart of the vaccine Pfizer makes with its German partner BioNTech SE -- takes place at a secret location in the U.K. before shipping to the EU where the shots are completed.The EU official added that there are no outstanding requests for UK exports from Astra’s production facility in the Netherlands, but should such a request be made, it will likely be rejected. A production plant in the Netherlands and one in Belgium produce ingredients for the Astra shot.“The Netherlands in principle allows exports to continue until told otherwise by the European Commission,” a Dutch spokesman said on March 21. “It is of paramount importance that Brussels, London and AstraZeneca reach a deal promptly on the vaccines produced by the company in facilities falling under both contracts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-battle-with-uk-heats-up-as-eu-ready-to-halt-shipments-101616372313503.html
22-03-2021||World||Joe Biden says he plans to visit US-Mexico border ‘at some point’||President Joe Biden says he plans to visit the US-Mexico border “at some point” for a first-hand look at conditions as the entry of migrants seeking refugee status in the US rises sharply.The comment, made to reporters at the White House on Sunday, came after the US Homeland Security secretary said he’s not worried about setting a precedent on open borders by allowing thousands of unaccompanied minors to enter the country.“At some point I will, yes,” Biden said about a border visit. Asked if he wanted to see first-hand what’s happening at overcrowded migrant processing centers, he added, “I know what’s going on in those facilities.”The President’s schedule for the coming week, released by the White House, shows no plans for a border visit through Thursday.The influx of crossings at the US-Mexico border has become a political liability for the two-month-old Biden administration, which reversed many of former President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. Republicans blame Biden’s approach for encouraging a new wave of migrants while the administration says Trump left behind an inhumane and inadequate system that can’t keep up.Alejandro Mayorkas, the US Homeland chief, spoke on four Sunday talk shows as pressure mounts over what many see as deteriorating conditions on the border.“The border is closed,” Mayorkas said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding that immigration authorities are expelling families and single adults, but not children who cross the border alone.“We will not expel into the Mexican desert, for example, three orphan children whom I saw over the last two weeks,” Mayorkas said.A major focus for the Biden administration, he said, is rebuilding “orderly systems” in Mexico and Central America to discourage would-be migrants from traveling to the US border.“It takes time, because the entire system was dismantled” by the prior administration, he said on “Fox News Sunday.” Biden also referred to re-establishing “what existed before.”“We are elevating our messaging, so that the individuals do know that they cannot come to the border,” Mayorkas said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”On Friday, Mayorkas traveled to El Paso, Texas, with two Democratic and two Republican senators to view first-hand the processing and housing for unaccompanied minors.That closed out a week in which the White House heard from members of both parties describing the US southwest border situation as a mess.‘Wide Open’Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican hardliner on immigration, blamed the border surge on the new administration’s move to end Trump policies that sent families, children and other border crossers back to Mexico or flown to their home countries.“The border right now is wide open because the Biden administration dismantled the very effective policies of the Trump administration and the agreements we had with Mexico and other Latin American countries,” Cotton said on “Fox News Sunday.”GOP Representative Michael McCaul of Texas also urged the administration to revisit Trump’s Migration Protection Protocols. Asked about abuses of would-be migrants kept away from the US border under those deals, he said: “It’s a good policy because it deterred.”Republican lawmakers are streaming to the southwest border to highlight the problems, including Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who planned to visit an Arizona border outpost on Sunday. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has already made the trip with a group of GOP colleagues.One of the two Republicans who traveled with Mayorkas on Friday, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, tweeted about “dismantling” the Trump administration’s policies with no thought to the ramifications.Democrat Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, tweeted that he “fought back tears” from what he saw on the trip.“The Biden Administration is trying their best to uphold the rule of law with humanity. They have a ton of work ahead to clean up the mess Trump left them, but their intentions are true,” tweeted Murphy.Mayorkas refused during an appearance Wednesday before the House Committee on Homeland Security to agree that the problems had reached the level of “a crisis,” aggravating some Republicans.The US has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials in recent weeks. That includes 18,945 family members encountered in February alone, an increase of 168% from January, according to the Pew Research Center.Officials are looking for ways to boost capacity to house and care for migrants now in federal custody.Axios reported Saturday that the Biden administration has awarded an $86 million contract for hotel rooms near the border to hold about 1,200 migrant family members. The Washington Post reported that customs officials are considering flying migrants to states near the Canadian border for processing.Asked about the report, Mayorkas said on CNN that “we don’t have those plans in place now. But what we are doing is, we are putting all options on the table, as it is our responsibility to do.”The biggest challenge faced by Biden’s administration is that of unaccompanied children. They’re allowed to enter the country in the custody of Customs and Border Protection, even as most adults and families are sent away. More than 9,600 entered the US in February, triple the number who arrived in February 2020, according to data released earlier this month.On CNN, Mayorkas said three facilities had been established in the last week to help move children out of border patrol stations.McCarthy told reporters on Thursday, “This entire crisis is created simply by Joe Biden’s actions and words.” On Saturday he tweeted that Democrats need to “DO SOMETHING.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-he-plans-to-visit-us-mexico-border-at-some-point-101616366916321.html
22-03-2021||India||Amid Covid surge, norms flouted as Holi celebrations begin in Braj||Even as the state continues to add fresh cases to its Covid-19 tally, Holi celebrations began on a grand scale in Uttar Pradesh’s Braj region on Monday with hundreds of people converging at the Ladliji (Radha Rani) Temple in Mathura’s Barsana town to participate in the tradition of “Laddoo Holi”.Several images showed revellers engaged in Holi celebrations without wearing face masks or maintaining physical distancing.The revelry will continue on Tuesday in Barsana in the form of “Lathmaar Holi” – a practice that will be repeated in the neighbouring Nandgaon village on Wednesday.“Laddoo Holi” (in which priests throw laddoos [sweets] at the devotees) and “Lathmaar Holi” (in which revellers playfully hit each other with sticks) date back to ancient times when Lord Krishna used to actively participate in Holi celebrations, according to old-timers in the Braj region, comprising Mathura, Vrindavan and a few other districts in UP.“How can one play Holi with a mask on? There’s no limitation on celebrations, at least in Braj region,” said a priest at the Barsana temple.When asked to speak on record, the office-bearers of the temple promised to abide by Covid norms and denied any violation.The development comes at a time when neighbouring Uttarakhand is under spotlight for non-adherence to Covid protocols during Kumbh celebrations in Haridwar, with CM Tirath Singh Rawat saying on Saturday that “faith will help overcome Covid fears”. Rawat was detected Covid positive on Monday.Dr Bhoodev Singh, in-charge of the Covid cell in Mathura chief medical officer’s office, maintained the authorities were taking adequate measures. “About 300 antigen tests were conducted at the control room on the mela site, but no one tested positive. We also handed over masks to those coming without it. Devotees are being sensitised on Covid norms,” he said.He, though, ducked a query on the number of people fined for not wearing masks. “The district administration will take care of this issue,” he added.On Monday, Mathura recorded 11 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day case count for the city this year, said Dr Singh.UP reported538new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the number of active cases to 6,08,076.“We have asked hotel and guest house owners in Mathura to seek a Covid negative report from guests arriving from Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh,” he added.Veterans in Braj region have raised concern over non-compliance of Covid protocols during Holi celebrations.“Many have stopped wearing masks or are placing it on their chin. Authorities should act strict on violations. Festivals will keep coming each year but not a person’s life. The district administration should restrict the number of people in gatherings during the festive season,” said Mohan Swaroop Bhatia, an expert of Braj literature.In Mathura and Vrindavan, Holi celebrations begin on the day of Basant Panchami in mid-February and continue for 40 days in different forms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-surge-norms-flouted-as-holi-celebrations-begin-in-braj-101616436787482.html
22-03-2021||India||Amidst Covid-19 surge in TN, Madras HC urges parties to follow norms||The Madras High Court on Monday urged political parties and candidates to follow safety protocols amid a rise in Covid-19 cases in the state with Chennai being a hotspot. The court also observed that it would do good if the Election Commission of India (ECI) issued a message on the same so that there is compliance in mask-wearing and social distancing.This was after the court dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) that sought a prohibition on political parties from campaigning for the assembly elections slated for April 6 in Tamil Nadu to avoid crowds and prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease.It’s officially summer in the southern state and with heightened political activity, the state health authorities are bracing for a second wave after a steep fall in infections. The state’s higher education department on Monday ordered all colleges and universities to conduct classes and exams online starting March 23 after a meeting was held with vice-chancellors of all universities to avoid clusters in educational institutions.The state is back to increased RT-PCR testing, contact tracing and micro containment of streets to handle the surge, said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “Ten days ago, the test positivity was around 1 per cent from 100 samples tested and now it is more than 2 per cent,” said Radhakrishnan. “We are doing random RT-PCR testing. We have directed all district-level election officials to oversee pandemic norms that are maintained in political party meetings,” he said.Two key candidates of actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) tested positive for Covid-19 in Chennai. Late President Abdul Kalam’s former advisor V Ponraj, who is contesting from Chennai’s Anna Nagar, and former IAS officer Santosh Babu contesting from Velachery have tested positive. They will continue to campaign through digital platforms.While state leaders, including chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and DMK president MK Stalin, have predominantly worn masks in public, campaign meetings follow no pandemic rules. Thousands gather together with no physical distancing and mask compliance. A day ago, Stalin while campaigning in Coimbatore embarrassed his partymen who weren’t wearing masks properly. The opposition leader wasn’t wearing a mask himself when he made the comment.

22-03-2021||India||Covid-19: Panel to meet this week over Sputnik V approval||The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) is likely to meet sometime this week to consider the emergency use application of the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, according to officials aware of the matter, who asked not to be named. An approval to Sputnik V will add a third inoculation to India’s arsenal of vaccines, which could be crucial in the fight against the pandemic at a time when the country is grappling with a resurgence in cases. The dose, made by the Gamaleya Research Institute, is 91.6% effective in preventing Covid-19, according to clinical trial findings. “The committee looking into Covid related application could convene any time this week,” said an official in the know of things. During the last meeting on the matter, the experts asked for safety and immunogenicity data from Sputnik V’s phase II/III trials being conducted in India. Sputnik V’s backers, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), has tied up with five India-based pharma companies for production. The latest of these deals was announced on Monday. Virchow Biotech will produce 200 million doses, the RDIF announced. “Vaccine partnerships are the only way to overcome the pandemic. The world continues its fight against coronavirus and we see a growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine as it is one of the most efficient vaccines available. The agreement with Virchow Biotech is an important step to facilitate the full-scale local production of the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners globally,” said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer f the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). Virchow indicated the production is likely to be for “international partners” of RDIF. “The technology transfer is expected to be completed in the Q2 of 2021 followed by full-scale commercial production of Sputnik V. Virchow Biotech capacities will help facilitate global supply of Sputnik V to international partners of RDIF,” the statement read.Tummuru Murali, managing director of Virchow Biotech, said, “We are glad to sign a cooperation agreement with RDIF to produce the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine. Virchow’s proven capabilities in large scale drug substance manufacturing should help meet the global demand for this vaccine. We are also happy to learn of the positive feedback that this vaccine has been receiving from all сountries.” On Friday, RDIF announced its partnership with Stelis Biopharma, the biopharmaceutical division of Strides, a global pharmaceutical company headquartered in India, to produce and supply a minimum of 200 million vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-panel-to-meet-this-week-over-sputnik-v-approval-101616436112131.html

Modi launched the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” campaign via video conferencing and also watched over an agreement between the Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Shekhawat and the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Aadityanath, to implement the Ken Betwa link project, the first project of the national perspective plan for the interlinking of rivers. The Jal Shakti Abhiyan is the Jal Shakti ministry’s flagship water-conservation campaign. The next leg of the programme, dubbed “catch the rain where it falls, when it falls”, will be rolled out across the country’s 734 districts covering over 600,000 villages. Modi listened to gram panchayat leaders from various parts of the country on ongoing efforts to conserve water. The prime minister said that the majority of rainwater during the monsoon months is simply washed away. Conserving rainwater will ease the pressure on groundwater in stressed areas. According to official data, 254 districts in the country are said to face acute water stress. He said the campaign, which will run from March through November, should focus on conserving every drop of water. “I would want to see that every penny of MNREGA till the rainy season comes, should be utilised for this purpose. Money available under MNREGA should not go anywhere else other than for whatever is required for readiness to conserve water,” the prime minister said. Modi said a major step had been taken for the Ken-Betwa link canal, adding that “rapid development is not possible without water security and effective water management”. He said that the vision of “India’s development and India’s self-reliance is dependent on our water sources and our water connectivity”. During the campaign, geotagging of all water bodies throughout the nation will be carried out, which shall form the basis for assessment of the rejuvenation efforts for water bodies across the country, an official said on condition of anonymity. According to data from the state-run policy think tank. NITI Aayog, nearly 600 million Indians face “high to extreme water stress” and the country’s water demand is likely to double by 2030, potentially costing a 6% loss in gross domestic product by 2050.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nregs-funds-must-be-used-to-save-water-pm-101616436051567.html
22-03-2021||India||UP, MP sign deal on linking of two rivers; experts flag concerns||Bhopal: Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for starting work on country’s first major project interlinking two rain-fed rivers, Ken and Betwa, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as environmental activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve which is known for its critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides a thriving big cat population. The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s ambitious programme to interlink rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity. Officials said the delay was because of no agreement between the two states on sharing of water during the lean supply months, November to April. The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 million cubic meter (MCM) water during the Rabi (winter crop) season, settled for 750 MCM while Madhya Pradesh will receive 1,834 MCM water, said an officer of the MP water resources department. According to the project report, 2,800 MCM of water will be diverted from the Ken basin to the water-deficit Betwa basin through a 73.8 meter high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in MP’s Chhattarpur district.The report also said 6,017 hectares forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and the Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir. MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine Madhya Pradesh districts, Sagar, Chhatarpur, Vidisha, Shivpuri, Raisen, Damoh, Panna and Tikamgarh, and four districts of Uttra Pradesh, Mahoba, Jhansi, Lalitpur and Banda will benefit from the project.“About 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated and 6.2 million people, mostly in water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water,” he added. There is, however, opposition to the project from the Panna royal family and environmentalists. “It is very sad that the government and experts overlooked the possible impact of the project on diamond mining in Panna and wildlife in the area. We will lose our world famous diamond site for ever,” said Maharani Jiteshwari Judevi of Panna royal family.Judevi said, “According to a report of 1938 on Diamond mines, the production of diamond took place naturally in Panna and it being excavated since 15th century. The seepage of water due to the dam will reduce the temperature and also reduce the level of nitrogen which is important for the natural production of diamond. I am raising this issue and I want a scientific study should be done to check the impact of dam water on diamond mine.” Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People (SANDRP) said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed an MoA on World Water Day even though the project would proved to be a curse for water conservation.“According to a report of the forest advisory committee, an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand,” he added. He said that the project will also destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several species of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which has run a successful vulture population revival programme.Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), have raised doubts about the project. A petition opposing the approval to the project is pending before the Supreme Court. “We are sure the project won’t get forest clearance,” Thakkar said. Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh feared the project would destroy local ecology. “The CMs of UP and MP will sign a pact today to link the Ken and Betwa rivers. This will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve in MP, a success story in translocation and revival. I had suggested alternatives 10 years ago but alas,” he tweeted earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office said the project will “also pave the way for more interlinking of river projects to ensure that scarcity of water does not become an inhibitor for development in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mp-sign-deal-on-linking-of-two-rivers-experts-flag-concerns-101616436051029.html

State sports minister V Srinivas Goud was also present on the occasion.According to Suryapet district superintendent of police (SP) R Bhaskaran, preliminary investigations revealed that the incident happened as the gallery stand was overcrowded.“We have moved the injured to Suryapet government hospital. Two of them, who sustained serious injuries, were taken to Hyderabad. If any others require better treatment, they would also be sent to Hyderabad. We are investigating the case,” Bhaskaran said, without elaborating further.An eyewitness told the local reporters that three different galleries were constructed with wooden planks and iron bars, each at a height of 20 ft and a width of 240 feet. “The total capacity of each stand is around 1,500. However, there was a heavy rush at the event and the spectators occupied the gallery more than its capacity which led to the sudden collapse of the stand,” the eyewitness said.Over 1,500 participants from 29 states were taking part in the sports event which was being organised in Telangana for the first time. The matches are being conducted on synthetic kabaddi mats on league-cum-knock out format under floodlights on all four days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spectators-stand-collapses-at-kabaddi-tournament-in-telangana-at-least-100-injured-101616433231391.html

22-03-2021||India||Amid opposition, Parliament passes bill aimed at boosting private investment in mining sector||The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2021, aimed at boosting private investment in the mining sector even as opposition parties demanded a select committee scrutiny of the bill.“We want to bring private players into this because we have rich minerals like coal, gold, silver, but we are not being able to bring it out. That’s why we are bringing these changes and trying to redefine exploration,” Union mines minister Pralhad Joshi said in Parliament.Assuring members in Rajya Sabha, Joshi said the “progressive” bill will not curb the powers of states while creating more jobs. “I assure you that not a single iota of power of the states will be snatched or taken away by this bill.” Joshi also responded to the opposition’s call for a select committee probe on the bill.“Wide consultations on the bill were held. The bill was circulated to states and 10,500 comments were received. As many as 10 associations and six NGOs had recorded their comments,” the minister said. “As many as 143 mines have been given to states. Since 2015, these mines are with them. Neither those were allotted nor auctioned. Who suffered the loss? We are importing coal despite having the 4th largest resource of coal,” Joshi stated.Also read: Overseas students including Indians not allowed to return for now - ChinaCongress leaders Digvijay Singh and Jairam Ramesh, among other opposition members, pressed the government to send the bill to a select committee for scrutiny.“Eleven parties in House have requested that the bill to be referred to a select committee... consensus today is that the bill should go to select committee but the government is unlikely to agree and respect this consensus... by passing this bill, today we are going against the general consensus,” Ramesh said.During the discussion on the bill, Digvijay Singh said, “Don’t treat this bill as you had done with the farm laws.”AIADMK’s M Thambidurai said the minister should ensure that states’ rights are not taken away.Joshi said the bill’s objective is to generate employment in the sector and enhance the contribution of the mining sector in the total GDP of the country.“The major reason why we are lacking in the mining sector is that we do not have explored mines. Only 10 per cent of the Obvious Geological Potential (OGP) area has been explored so far and out of that we are mining only 5 per cent of the OGP,” he said.Earlier in the day, Rajya Sabha proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm amid an uproar over corruption allegations in Maharashtra during the Question Hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-opposition-parliament-passes-bill-aimed-at-boosting-private-investment-in-mining-sector-101616429871933.html

Instead, Beijing has suggested that Indian students stay in contact with their universities in China and follow their instructions – in effect saying that they should continue with their online studies.In a statement issued on Monday, the Indian embassy in Beijing said the Chinese government’s bar on allowing foreign students to enter the country was still in place despite multiple requests to the Chinese ministries of foreign affairs and education to allow the students to return to the country to resume in-person classes.The embassy also clarified that the recent visa facilitation notification for foreigners who have been administered a Chinese vaccine did not apply to students, the Indian embassy said in a statement on the situation of Indian students on Monday.According to China’s education ministry, 4,92,185 international students from 196 countries and regions were studying in the country until the end of 2018.According to a country-wise breakup of foreign students in China, South Korea tops this list with more than 50,000 students. It is followed by Thailand and Pakistan with over 28,000 students each studying in China. At 23,000, Indian students are the fourth largest group.Also Read| Next round of India-China talks looks positive on Gogra-Hot Springs“Chinese authorities at various levels continue to maintain their position that, on account of last year’s announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs…to suspend temporarily the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese Visa and residence permits following the outbreak of Covid-19 in many countries in the world, overseas students are temporarily unable to enter China,” the Indian embassy said.Despite bringing the pandemic in the country under control, China continues to impose severe restrictions on incoming foreigners including a nearly-month long quarantine, and now, linking returns to travellers taking a China-made vaccine.The academic lives of nearly 23,000 Indian students who study in China, mostly in medical universities, have been upended because of the travel barriers: There is no sign that these restrictions will be lifted any time soon.Many Indian students had returned home in January, 2020, for Chinese New Year holidays, in the weeks ahead of the pandemic spreading in the central Chinese province of Hubei and before restrictions were placed on foreign travel; many more left in the weeks after the outbreak while some were evacuated from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, in special flights.They have been unable to return to China since despite pleading with Chinese authorities through its embassies, consulates, and social media channels.It could of little solace to the stranded Indian students but Beijing has told New Delhi they are aware of the “…concerns of the students and have asked all relevant Chinese universities to maintain close contact with the students and keep them informed, besides continuing with the online courses.”“It has also been suggested by Chinese authorities that Indian students stay in touch with their universities and pursue their studies in accordance with the suggestions and guidance of the universities,” the statement added.Last week, the Chinese foreign ministry said academic institutions were to keep in close contact with those students abroad, make good arrangements for online courses, and properly address their legitimate concerns and appeals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/overseas-students-including-indians-not-allowed-to-return-for-now-china-101616424472180.html

The government intends to pass the bill on Tuesday, which is the reason why the ruling party has issued the whip.The Lok Sabha last Wednesday passed the Appropriation Bill 2021-22, authorising the government to draw ₹117.16 lakh crore from the Consolidated Fund of India for its working as well as implementation of its programmes and schemes.This completes two-thirds of the exercise for approval of the Budget for 2021-22.The bill was introduced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Once the Finance Bill is passed, the budget exercise is complete.Both appropriation and finance bills are classified as money bills which do not require the explicit consent of the Rajya Sabha.

Even Sita mata went through 'agni pariksha' so why can't they?: BJP leader Ram Kadam pic.twitter.com/KyR1S5UwQ9A political storm has been brewing in Maharashtra, following former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh's allegations that Deshmukh asked arrested cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore a month from various establishments of the city through extortion. The ex-top cop moved the Supreme Court today, seeking directions for immediate "unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair" CBI probe into alleged corrupt malpractices of Deshmukh.In his petition to the court, Singh claimed that Deshmukh held meetings at his residence with police officers, including Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai, and Sanjay Patil, ACP Social Service Branch, Mumbai, bypassing their seniors.The issue formed the focal point today at the Lok Sabha, where the BJP demanded the resignation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government headed by Uddhav Thackeray. Raising the issue during Zero Hour in Lok Sabha amidst protests by the Shiv Sena and the NCP, BJP member Manoj Kotak pointed out that according to Singh's letter to the chief minister, the state's home minister had asked Vaze, now suspended, to collect ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants in the metropolis every month. Rakesh Singh, another BJP leader, said that the issue is so serious that it can't be termed a state subject as it has a national implication.The Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Congress are part of the MVA government in Maharashtra. The coalition partners did their part in defending Deshmukh, with the Sena claiming that the BJP has been hatching a conspiracy to defame the Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP dispensation for the last 14 months so that it can form a government in the state. Congress, too, claimed that central agencies were being used against opposition ruled states for one or the other pretext.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/undergo-narco-tests-bjp-leader-s-agni-pariksha-challenge-to-anil-deshmukh-101616415804843.html
22-03-2021||India||Congress just like elephant, has one teeth to show off, other to chew: JP Nadda in Assam rally||BJP national president J P Nadda on Monday mocked the Congress, comparing it with an elephant having two sets of teeth - "one to show off and another to chew".Addressing an election rally at Tingkhong in Dibrugarh district, Nadda also accused the Congress of practising "politics of opportunism" and said Assam will head into "darkness" if the opposition party is voted to power."The Congress' only aim is politics of opportunism. They are with the Muslim League and fighting against the CPI(M) in Kerala, but joined hands with it in West Bengal and Assam...," Nadda said."Like a tusker, the Congress has two sets of teeth -- one to show off and another to chew. It says something and always does the opposite... It is dividing the society," the senior BJP leader said.In an apparent reference to Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, who is also campaigning in the state, Nadda said the social-media handle of the opposition party shared pictures from Taiwan and Sri Lanka when "one leader" of the party visited tea gardens of Assam."She plucked tea leaves then. But as far as I know, tea leaves are plucked only after April. Then, why was this photo shoot? The Congress is cheating people," he said.The Congress had recently assured tea garden workers that it will hike their daily wages to ₹365 from the existing ₹117 "within six hours of forming the government".Repeatedly attacking the Congress, Nadda said the opposition party "means darkness", while the BJP stands for development."If you need darkness, then go with the Congress. But if you need development, hold the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Nadda said at the rally.The Congress has neglected Assam and the northeast since Independence, and did nothing to develop the region, he alleged."Because of Congress' double standard, the wheels of development had totally stopped. It attacked the civilisation of Assam, sidelining the state's culture. But, BJP brought development and protected Assam's culture and language," Nadda said.The opposition party never gave any importance to the safety of Assamese people, including not solving the Bodo problems for 50 years, he claimed."For a long time, our borders were open and anyone could come freely. It was a challenge to our security... The Congress does not have any intention, policy and agenda. It is only for grabbing power," he said.Attacking the Congress-AIUDF alliance, Nadda said former chief minister Tarun Gogoi never allied with the Badruddin Ajmal-led party, but his son has now embraced the AIUDF."This is nothing but opportunism. How are you going to protect the Assamese culture? By joining hands with Ajmal?" the BJP chief said.Gogoi's son Gaurav is a Lok Sabha MP and chairman of the Manifesto Committee of the Assam Congress.The Congress, which was in power for 15 years in Assam since 2001, has formed a 'Grand Alliance' with AIUDF, BPF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), RJD and the Jimochayan (Deori) Peoples Party (JPP) to fight the upcoming Assembly election against the BJP-led NDA.Nadda also alleged that the Congress did nothing for the development of the tea garden workers, protection of 'Namghars' (a place of worship for Vaishnavite followers) and ending violence in Bodoland areas."During the Congress tenure, 2,155 people died, 2,004 security personnel lost their lives and 1,300 people were kidnapped in Bodo areas. When the BJP came, the Bodo agreement was signed, 4,000 assault rifles were surrendered and 2,300 cadres laid down arms," he claimed.Nadda accused the Congress of "latkana (delaying), atkana (stalling) and bhatkana (misleading)" people on development projects, "which have been cleared after the BJP formed government in Assam".During BJP's tenure, land pattas (deeds) were given to 3.3 lakh people, 135 mobile medical units were set up for tea gardens, ₹1,000 crore allocated for welfare of such areas, Bogibeel bridge over Brahmaputra was completed and ₹8,000 crore gas royalty was provided, he said."During the 13th Finance Commission, ₹50,000 crore was given to Assam. The 14th Finance Commission after BJP came to the Centre provided ₹1,55,000 crore to the state," Nadda said.He said former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a Rajya Sabha Member for 10 years, but "did not do anything" for the development of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-just-like-elephant-has-one-teeth-to-show-off-other-to-chew-jp-nadda-in-assam-rally-101616416540545.html
22-03-2021||India||Covid-19 -ve report mandatory for travellers from Punjab, Chandigarh: Karnataka||Karnataka on Monday made it mandatory for travellers arriving from Punjab and Chandigarh to produce negative Covid-19 test report. This comes at a time when Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said the second wave of Covid-19 has begun and sought people’s cooperation to contain the virus.“We are at the beginning of the second wave of coronavirus. Let us all join hands to control it because the next three months are crucial for us,” Sudhakar told media. He said he would discuss the Covid-19 situation and measures to be taken with Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa.Punjab is among the states which have been red-flagged by the Centre over the spread of Covid-19. The Union health ministry said that Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh account for 80.5 per cent of the total new cases registered in the last 24 hours.Eight states and union territories, including Punjab and Chandigarh, have a weekly positivity rate more than the national average of 3.7 per cent, according to health ministry.Meanwhile, there was no let-up in the surge in Covid-19 cases in Punjab with the state recording 2,669 fresh infections, maximum this year so far, and 44 more fatalities on Sunday, according to state government's medical bulletin.Sudhakar also said that the state government is strictly screening incoming travellers from other Maharashtra and other high caseload states. The minister said that if travellers from these states are found not carrying the negative RT-PCR test report, they will be subjected to test at the border. Increasing penalty for not wearing mask is also being discussed, the ministrr further said.Karnataka is also seeking Union home ministry's support in enforcing strict screening at borders. However, the state government is not looking at semi-lockdown or lockdown at the moment, said Sudhakar.Last week, Karnataka saw its daily Covid-19 tally crossing the 1000-mark since November last year. On Sunday, 1,700 cases were reported in the state. Manipal Institute of technology from Udupi is the second biggest cluster in the state where more than 300 students have tested Covid-19 positive.Yediyurappa has appealed to the people to exercise caution as Covid-19 cases is on the rise at an alarming rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-makes-it-mandatory-for-travellers-arriving-from-punjab-and-chandigarh-to-produce-negative-covid-19-test-report-101616416179058.html
22-03-2021||India||UP, MP seal Ken-Betwa linking project deal; environmentalists flag concerns||Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for starting work on country’s first major interlinking of two monsoon rivers, Ken and Betwa, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as environment activists said the project would spell doom for the Panna tiger reserve which is known for critically endangered white-rumped vultures besides successful restoration of tiger population. The MoA was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s ambitious programme to inter-link rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity. Officials said the delay was because of no agreement between the two states on sharing of water during the lean supply months, November to April. The Uttar Pradesh government, which was initially demanding 930 million cubic meter (MCM) water during the Rabi season, settled for 750 MCM while MP will get 1,834 MCM water, said an officer of MP water resource department. According to the project report, 2,800 MCM of water will be diverted from Ken basin to water deficit Betwar basin through a 73.8 meter high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in MP’s Chhattarpur district.Also Read | Ken Betwa project could hit wildlife: ReportThe report also said 6,017 hectares forest land of Panna Tiger Reserve and Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary would be submerged in the dam reservoir. MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said people of nine Madhya Pradesh districts: Sagar, Chhatarpur, Vidisha, Shivpuri, Raisen, Damoh, Panna and Tikamgarh, and four districts of Uttra Pradesh -- Mahoba, Jhansi, Lalitpur and Banda -- will benefit from the project.“About 1 million hectares of land will get irrigated and 6.2 million people, mostly in water deficit Bundelkhand region, will get drinking water,” he added. There is, however, opposition to the project from the Panna royal family and environmentalists. “It is very sad that the government and experts overlooked the possible impact of the project on diamond mining in Panna and wildlife in the area. We will lose world famous diamond site for ever,” said Maharani Jiteshwari Judevi of Panna royal family.Himanshu Thakkar, convenor of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People (SANDRP) said it was “very unfortunate” that the Central and state governments signed an MoA on World Water Day even though the project would proved to be a curse for water conservation.“According to a report of the forest advisory committee, an estimated 4.6 million trees will be cut down for the project. This will lead to poor rainfall in an already parched Bundelkhand,” he added. He said that the project would destroy Panna Tiger Reserve, home to over 52 tigers and several of endangered vultures, including the white-rumped vulture. Of the nine vulture species found in India, six can be seen in Panna, which is running a vulture population revival programme.Several committees, including the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee (CEC), had raised doubts about the project. A petition opposing the approval to the project is pending before the Supreme Court. “We are sure the project won’t get forest clearance,” Thakkar said. Former environment minister Jairam Ramesh feared the project would destroy local ecology. “The CMs of UP and MP will sign a pact today to link the Ken and Betwa rivers. This will all but destroy the Panna Tiger Reserve in MP, a success story in translocation and revival. I had suggested alternatives 10 years ago but alas,” he tweeted earlier in the day. State water resource minister Tulsiram Silawat said, “People should stop doing politics on this issue. The governments will spend more than ₹35,000 crore for development, not for destruction. It won’t destroy anything but will bring a smile to the faces of the people of Bundelkhand.” Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s Office said the project will “also will pave the way for more interlinking of river projects to ensure that scarcity of water does not become an inhibitor for development in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-mp-seal-ken-betwa-linking-project-deal-environmentalists-flag-concerns-101616415830773.html

22-03-2021||India||Central government's tax collection on petrol, diesel jumps 300% in 6 years||Central government's tax collections on petrol and diesel have jumped over 300 per cent in the last six years as excise duty on the two fuels was hiked, the Lok Sabha was informed on Monday.The central government collected ₹29,279 crore from excise duty on petrol and ₹42,881 crore on diesel in 2014-15 -- the first year of office of the Modi government.The collections on petrol and diesel rose to ₹2.94 lakh crore in the first 10 months of the current fiscal (2020-21), according to information furnished by Minister of State Anurag Singh Thakur in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.Together with excise duty on natural gas, the central government in 2014-15 collected ₹74,158 crore which has gone up to ₹2.95 lakh crore in April 2020 to January 2021 period.He said taxes collected on petrol, diesel and natural gas as a percentage of total revenue have gone up from 5.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 12.2 per cent this fiscal.Excise duty on petrol has been raised from ₹9.48 per litre in 2014 to ₹32.90 a litre now while the same on diesel has gone up from ₹3.56 a litre to ₹31.80.Taxes make up for 60 per cent of the present retail price of petrol of ₹91.17 a litre in Delhi. Excise duty makes up for 36 per cent of the retail price.Over 53 per cent of the retail selling price of ₹81.47 a litre of diesel in Delhi is made up of taxes. As much as 39 per cent of the retail price comprises of central excise."The total central excise duty (including basic excise duty, cesses and surcharge) was increased by ₹3 per litre on petrol and diesel with effect from March 14, 2020. It was further revised upwards by ₹10 per litre on petrol and ₹13 per litre on diesel with effect from May 6, 2020," Thakur said.These increases took away the gain that would have accrued to consumers from a sharp drop in international oil prices.The hike in excise duty is similar to the increase in taxes the government did between November 2014 and January 2016.Over nine instalments, duty on petrol rate was hiked by ₹11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months.The government had cut excise duty by ₹2 in October 2017, and by ₹1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by ₹2 per litre in July 2019."The excise duty rates have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure keeping in view the present fiscal position," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-government-s-tax-collection-on-petrol-diesel-jumps-300-in-6-years-101616412359082.html

Singh, then serving DSP, was arrested by the agency in January, 2020. He was granted bail by a Delhi court on June 19 last year.The supplementary chargesheet against Para, Shaheen Ahmad Lone and Tafazul Hussain Parimoo has been filed under section 120B of the IPC, sections 17, 18, 38, 39 & 40 of the UA (P) Act, and section 25 (1AA) of Arms Act and section 6 of the Explosive Substances Act in NIA Special Court Jammu, according to a press release. Earlier, chargesheet had been filed against eight people in this case.Investigation by the central agency showed that Lone and Parimoo were part of gun running from across the Line of Control (LoC) for terrorists of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), the release added.Waheed Para on the other hand, was a part of a conspiracy which also raised and transferred funds to Hizbul terrorists for procuring terrorist hardware. the NIA said. The PDP leader played an important role in ‘sustaining political-separatist-terrorist nexus’ in the Union territory, the agency further said.Para was arrested by the agency on November 25 last year and was granted bail by the NIA court on January 9 this year. However, two days later, he was again held by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on January 11 and continues to remain in custody.

22-03-2021||India||Explained: Why govt recommended revision in second dose interval for Covishield||The central government on Monday wrote a letter to chief secretaries of states and administrators of union territories, asking them to increase the interval between the two doses of Covishield, one of the two Covid-19 vaccines being given across the country as part of nationwide inoculation drive.The vaccination drive was launched on January 16 after India's drug regulator cleared AstraZeneca-Oxford University's Covishield - manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) - and domestically made Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. In the first phase of the vaccination drive, healthcare and frontline workers who interacted with Covid-19 patients were given the shots of the vaccines. In the second phase, which began on March 1, people above the age of 60 and 45+ with comorbidities were chosen for vaccination.The Centre's today clarified that its advisory is only meant for Covishield and not Covaxin.Why did the Centre take this decision?In its communication sent to the states and union territories, the central government said that its National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration revisited the current interval period being followed across the country in view of the emerging scientific evidence.During this meeting the recommendation, the two expert group revised the time interval to 4-8 weeks after the first dose, instead of earlier practiced interval of 4-6 weeks.The Union health ministry accepted the recommendations of these two groups and advised the states and union territories to ensure the administration of second dose of Covishield to beneficiaries within 4-8 weeks of giving the first dose.Why the time interval has been revised?The Centre said that scientific evidence shows that protection is enhanced if the second dose of Covishield is administered between 6-8 weeks, but not later than stipulated period of eight weeks.Pune-based SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer in terms of numbers, partnered with the Oxford University to manufacture their Covid-19 vaccine in India.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) granted an emergency use approval (EUA) for Covishield in India in January this year. Doses of the vaccines were transported from Pune to multiple hubs in the country.On Sunday, the central government placed orders for 120 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines with SII and Bharat Biotech. Of the 120 million doses, 100 million will be of Covishield. The remaining will be of Covaxin.India aims to give doses to 300 million people - healthcare workers, frontline workers and those at highest risk due to their age or comorbid conditions - by the end of July. But experts now believe as many people as possible should now be allowed to take the doses in order to head off this new wave of cases.More than 4.50 crore vaccine doses have been administered through 7,33,597 sessions, as per the provisional report till 7 am on Monday. As on Day 65 of the vaccination drive (on Sunday), a total of 4,62,157 vaccine doses were given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-why-govt-increased-time-interval-between-2-doses-of-covishield-101616410069834.html

In order that the stress situation is not left unattended, we need to raise the FDI limit."The COVID-19 pandemic, Sitharaman said, has further added to the woes of the insurance companies.The minister further said that the FDI limit was being raised on the recommendations of the regulator IRDAI which had extensive consultations with stakeholders.The FDI inflow in the insurance sector, the minister said, had increased significantly after the government decided to raise the cap from 26% to 49% in 2015.As much as ₹26,000 crore has come as FDI in the insurance sector since 2015, she said, adding the asset under management (AUM) in this sector has grown by 76% during the last five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-to-increase-fdi-in-insurance-sector-gets-parliament-s-nod-101616407943826.html

He often served as a facilitator of talks between adversaries, Iran and the U.S. He was a key to meeting India’s energy security needs in the Persian Gulf.The award carries an amount of Rs. 1 crore, a citation, a plaque and an exquisite traditional handloom item.The decision to confer the award for 2020 on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh, his first foreign trip since the outbreak of Covid-19. PM Modi will attend the national day programme of Bangladesh on March 26 as the guest of honour and participate in the commemoration of what New Delhi has described as “three epochal events” – Mujib Borsho, the birth centenary of Bangladesh’s father of the nation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 50 years of diplomatic ties, and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation.PM Modi’s itinerary in Bangladesh includes visits to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s memorial in Tungipara, about 400 km from Dhaka. Tungipara is the place of birth of Mujibur Rahman. It is also also where the architect of the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence lies buried inside a tomb called the ‘Bangabandhu mausoleum’.PM Modi will also pay respect to Harichand Thakur, the founder of a religious reformation movement Matua Mahasangha at his shrine in Orakandi. On March 27, PM Modi is scheduled to visit the famous Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Satkhira.A large number of people from the Matua community migrated from Bangladesh to parts of Bengal and Assam over the last five decades to escape religious persecution. In Bengal, they are mostly concentrated in Nadia, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Kolkata and Hooghly, districts that together have 16 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats.PM Modi, who heads the jury for the Gandhi Peace Prize, called Bangabandhu a champion of human rights and freedom, and is a hero to Indians as well.An official statement said the prestigious award “recognizes the immense and unparalleled contribution of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in inspiring the liberation of Bangladesh, bringing stability to a nation born out of strife, laying the foundation for the close and fraternal relations between India and Bangladesh, and promoting peace and non-violence in the Indian subcontinent”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheikh-mujibir-rahman-oman-s-sultan-qaboos-named-for-india-s-gandhi-peace-prize-101616409110277.html

After a meeting held at Pawar's residence in Delhi on Sunday, the party said Deshmukh won't resign.The Maharashtra home minister also defended himself, saying he was in home quarantine in February and stepped out for the first time on February 28th."A few journalists were waiting for me at the hospital gate after I got discharged on 15th February. I was feeling low and weak so I sat on the chair there and responded to their questions. Then I went straight to my car and went home. I was in home quarantine from February 15th to 27th. I stepped out of my house for the first time on February 28th," he said.The Shiv Sena, who leads the MVA, alleged that Param Bir Singh is a puppet of BJP government at the Centre. It also demanded probe into allegations against Singh by his subordinate officer."Param Bir Singh himself is a embroiled in corruption. On February 2, 2021, Anup Dange, an officer of Gamdevi Police station, wrote to Additional CS Home department complaining how Singh harassed Dange through Bharat Shah and Jitendra Navlani, who are connected to underworld," claimed Sena leader Vinayak Raut.Dange had taken action against a pub but Param Bir Singh called him at 2am and asked him not to file a case, he further alleged.The controversy around Deshmukh was triggered by a letter written by Singh to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in which he claimed that Deshmukh gave Vaze a monthly extortion target of ₹100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. Since the letter surfaced on Saturday, the MVA has been defending Deshmukh.Singh wrote the letter after his transfer from the post of Mumbai police commissioner to Maharashtra Home Guard. He has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the transfer, calling it "arbitrary".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-pawar-s-remark-on-anil-deshmukh-fadnavis-accuses-him-of-diverting-issue-101616405731752.html

The delegation, led by Pakistan’s Indus water commissioner Mehr Ali Shah, will hold talks with the Indian team led by Indus water commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena in New Delhi during March 23-24. The talks are being held against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral relations, which had taken a hit after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing and a subsequent military standoff. The last meeting of the permanent Indus commission was held in Lahore in August 2018. Last month, the Indian and Pakistani militaries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, raising hopes for further improvements in bilateral ties. The decision to adhere to the truce on the volatile LoC was the apparent outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two countries. Also Read | The Nehruvian imprint on Indus Waters TreatyAn eight-member delegation of Pakistan’s Commission on Indus Waters will leave for New Delhi on Monday for a two-day meeting of the Permanent Commission on Indus Waters to discuss with their Indian counterparts Pakistan’s objections to the design of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric plants/projects and other issues. The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. The last meeting took place in August 2018 in Lahore. Officials said the gap between the two meetings was caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. After the 2018 meeting, a Pakistani delegation was invited by India to inspect the sites of the hydroelectric projects being constructed by India on Pakistani rivers. Recent comments by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Bajwa about improving ties with India have also helped clear the environment, though India has said the onus is on Pakistan for creating an atmosphere conducive to a meaningful dialogue. During the meeting of the permanent Indus commission, the Pakistani side is expected to raise objections to the design of India’s Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydroelectric plants. It is also expected to seek information on new projects planned by India on western rivers, and flood data arrangements for the flood season. The impact of India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic had affected the scheduling of meetings of the permanent Indus commission, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, which was brokered by the World Bank, is one of the most durable agreements between India and Pakistan. It has survived several wars and disruptions in bilateral relations over the decades. The permanent Indus commission is required to meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan, under the terms of the treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-team-arrives-for-meeting-of-permanent-indus-commission-101616405930469.html

22-03-2021||India||Telangana govt employees get 30% pay hike, retirement age increased by 3 years||Over nine lakh employees of the Telangana government will get a hike of 30% in their salaries with effect from April 1. The government has also decided to increase their retirement age from 58 years to 61 years, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced in the state assembly on Monday.The decision was taken based on the recommendations made by the 11th pay revision commission headed by retired IAS officer C R Biswal in May 2018. The earlier pay revision for the employees was done in 2014 soon after the formation of Telangana, when the government had given 43% pay hike for the employees. Acknowledging that there was a delay in the implementation of pay revision due to the coronavirus pandemic that crippled the state’s economy completely, KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known, said his government had now decided to implement the pay revision to the best possible extent, as the financial position of the state was gradually limping back to normal. “We have decided to give 30% fitment (hike in basic salary) to the employees with effect from April 1,” the chief minister announced. The pay revision commission, in its report submitted to the government in January, recommended a salary hike of only 7%. He said the salary hike will be extended to all the government employees, grant-in-aid employees, work-charged employees, daily wages employees, full time contingent employees, part-time contingent employees and pensioners among others. “In all, the salary hike would benefit 9,17,797 employees of all categories,” he said. The pay hike is effective retrospectively from the last financial year. The chief minister said his government would pay arrears of the salary hike for the last 12 months to the employees, despite the fact that the state’s financial position was precarious due to drastic fall in revenues on account of Covid-19 pandemic. The arrears would be paid to the employees along with their other retirement benefits, he said. KCR also announced increase in the retirement gratuity to be paid to all the employees from the present ₹12 lakh to ₹16 lakh. “Similarly, the government has decided to reduce the age of eligibility for the retired employees from 75 to 70 years for the payment of additional quantum of pension of 15%,” he said. The chief minister said as per the promise he had made before the December 2018 assembly elections, the government was enhancing the age of superannuation of the employees from 58 to 61 years. The chief minister also reminded that the government had already completed the process of promotions to the eligible employees after holding a series of discussions with the employees’ and teachers’ unions. “So far, we have completed 80% of the promotion exercise and we shall take up the remaining promotions at the earliest. After all the eligible employees get the promotions, the vacancies arising thereon would be filled in due course,” he said. KCR announced constitution of a steering committee with representatives of employees’ unions and government officials to work out new guidelines for the implementation of Employees’ Health Scheme (EHS) for the state government employees, on the lines of CGHS being implemented for the central government employees. The government would take up inter-district transfer of employees for spouse cases, so that husband and wife working in different districts could now work in the same district. It also decided to repatriate Andhra employees working in Telangana to their native state and orders to this effect would be issued shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-employees-get-30-pay-hike-retirement-age-increased-by-3-years-101616404670411.html

In his writ petition, Singh accused Deshmukh of interfering in various investigations and instructing the police officers to conduct probes in a particular manner as desired by him. “The petitioner has invoked writ jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court to seek unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the corrupt malpractices of Shri Anil Deshmukh, the Hon’ble Home Minister of Government of Maharashtra, before the evidences are destroyed,” stated the plea, filed through advocate Abhinay. Also Read | Pawar again backs Anil Deshmukh, cites Covid-19 diagnosis to question Param BirIt added: “The petitioner submits that said Shri Anil Deshmukh had been holding meetings in February, 2021, at his residence with police officers, including Shri Sachin Vaze of Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai, and Shri Sanjay Patil, ACP Social Service Branch, Mumbai, bypassing their seniors and had instructed them that he had a target to accumulate ₹100 crore every month and had directed to collect money from various establishments and other sources.” Calling his transfer a malicious move, Singh contended that he was shunted out by an order on March 17 immediately after he brought Deshmukh’s corrupt practices in the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders. The petition further said: “The transfer of the petitioner in the aforesaid circumstances is for reasons smeared with malice, when there is no iota of material or evidence – far from proof – found or even imputed against the petitioner, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, without detail of any sort against the petitioner having been noticed by anybody.” Singh said he was constrained to write a letter to the chief minister on March 22 regarding Deshmukh’s conduct after his transfer, followed by adverse media publicity by the minister, in violation of his right to reputation, dignity, equality and liberty. In this letter, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore for him every month—a charge which has been rejected by the state home minister. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi is expected to represent Singh in the Supreme Court. A date of hearing is still to be fixed for Singh’s petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exmumbai-police-chief-param-bir-singh-moves-sc-for-cbi-probe-against-deshmukh-101616404550091.html

He sought direction for immediate "unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair" CBI probe into alleged corrupt malpractices of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.In his petition, Singh said that his transfer was done in an "arbitrary and illegal" manner "without the completion of the minimum fixed tenure of two years"."The said transfer was maliciously effected purportedly under Section 22N(2) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 with the reason that the transfer was necessitated by “administrative exigencies”. It is settled law that the orders have to stand on the reasons contained in the same and no reasons can be supplemented later," the former top cop said in the petition.Singh also said that as commissioner of Mumbai police, he ensured that the investigation in the Ambani security threat case is carried out in a fair and transparent manner, and also did not obstructed the probe by the NIA.The transfer is smeared with malice, and is solely based on conjectures, surmises and pure speculation, the petition further said.Singh, a 1988 batch IPS officer, was last week transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in the midst of a probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV which was found parked outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25.Reacting to his transfer, Deshmukh said that Singh was removed because some "serious lapses" surfaced in the police probe in the Ambani bomb scare case.But Singh hit back with a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray which has since shaken the political field in Maharashtra. Singh claimed in the letter that Deshmukh asked arrested cop Sachin Vaze to extort money to the tune of ₹100 crore per month from various establishments in Mumbai like hotels and bars.While the constituents of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have stood behind Deshmukh, meetings are being held by Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress to discuss how to resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/param-bir-singh-moves-supreme-court-against-his-transfer-to-home-guard-101616403308708.html

22-03-2021||India||Bhima Koregaon case: NIA court refuses bail to Stan Swamy||A special NIA court in Mumbai on Monday rejected the bail plea of Stan Swamy, a tribal rights activist, booked in connection with being part of the conspiracy in connection with the Bhima Koregaon-Elgar Parishad case.Swamy had moved bail plea in November last year, claiming that he has been falsely implicated due to the nature of his writings about caste and land struggles of the people in India.The NIA arrested the 83-year-old activist in October last year on the basis of several letters found in his possession which it claimed established his connection with banned CPI (Maoist) organisation. While objecting to his plea, NIA claimed there are around 140 emails exchanged between Swamy and other accused – Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha and others. It also claimed that Swamy was a “staunch supporter” of organisation which work as fronts of CPI (Maoist). The probe agency recovered several letters from Wilson’s computer which were used to book other accused in the case.The defence also submitted a copy of a report from a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm, Arsenal Consulting, which claimed that just few hours before the arrest of Rona Wilson, another accused in the case, his computer was tampered with.Also Read | Stan Swamy gets straw, sipper in jail, files fresh plea seeking his bagIn his bail plea, Swamy refuted NIA’s allegations and questioned the authenticity of letters that the agency submitted as evidence. “The prosecution has attached word and pdf copies of the letter. They are not even part of emails. That these alleged letters were ever sent or received is questionable,” said Swamy’s bail plea. Swamy had previously applied for bail on medical grounds, citing his Parkinson’s disease, but was denied it. Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating nervous disorder that can cause involuntary spasms and tremors that make it difficult for patients to carry out everyday actions, such as drinking water, without aid.Violence had erupted in the vicinity of a war memorial in Koregaon Bhima, on the outskirts of Pune city, on January 1, 2018, allegedly after provocative speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave. The Pune Police, which initially probed the case, claimed that the conclave was backed by outlawed Maoist groups. The NIA later took over the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhima-koregaon-case-nia-court-refuses-bail-to-stan-swamy-101616399149761.html

22-03-2021||India||BJP-backed panel sweeps corporation polls in Goa’s Panaji||The BJP’s gamble to back the panel set up by newly inducted Atanasio Monserrate at the cost of the party’s old guard paid off spectacularly in the municipal elections in Panaji with the panel winning 25 of the 30 seats.The panel was made up of a mix of old BJP candidates and those who realigned with the party after Monserrate switched sides in September 2019. Monserrate, who has a history of party hopping, joined the BJP in the autumn of 2019 along with nine other Congress legislators, has for long been the ‘opposition’ face in the city council for as long as the BJP-backed panel controlled the Mayor’s post.Although municipal elections in Goa are not held along party lines, the respective local MLA fields a ‘panel’ of candidates that he/she publicly acknowledge of backing them. In the case of Panaji a panel comprising of Bharatiya Janata Party backed candidates led by then chief minister and local MLA for 25 years Manohar Parrikar used to go head to head against a set of candidates set up by Monserrate, who was the MLA from the neighbouring Taleigao constituency, part of which falls under the Panaji municipal area. With Monserrate now in the BJP, the state party leadership has allowed him to decide which candidates are to be officially backed by the party and in the process several long time BJP supporters have been sidelined. The decision prompted a rebellion of sorts by those within the BJP who are uncomfortable at the fact that Monserrate, once their bete noire, is now calling the shots within the BJP.Leading the rebellion was former MLA Siddharth Kunaliencar, a former Parrikar aide along with Parrikar’s elder son Utpal Parrikar besides others who threw their weight behind candidates other than those set up by Monserrate. The Congress and AAP, which had jointly fielded candidates through a panel ‘Ami Ponnjekar’ (We the People of Panaji) did manage to hold on to their traditional stronghold winning core residential areas within the Panaji city including the upscale neighbourhoods of Miramar and Dona Paula. The elections in the capital city were held using EVMs while in the five other councils -- Pernem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Curchorem-Cacora and Cuncolim the elections were held using ballot paper with results expected to be finalised later in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpbacked-panel-sweeps-corporation-polls-in-goa-s-panaji-101616396929664.html
22-03-2021||India||Bihar Congress unit proposes district-level dharna on farmers’ issues||After a statewide padyatra-cum-mass contact programme, the Bihar unit of the Congress is gearing up to muster popular support for the party on the issue of farmers’ protest over the new farm’s laws by organising a district-level dharna and demonstration across the state on March 25. Grappling with the challenge to bring the party back into relevance, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar and former Union minister Bhakta Charan Das visited 36 out of 38 districts of the state to utilise the farmers’ unrest to resurrect the party at grassroots level. Das led the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) drive christened as ‘Kisan Satyagrah Andolan’ which kicked off on January 26 and was aimed at sensitising the people in general and farmers in particular about devastating fallout of the controversial farms laws on rural economy amply suggests that party’s desperation to retrieve its past glory, said chairman of BPCC media department Rajesh Rathore. As part of the third leg of the drive, the state congress leaders held a series of farmers’ conclave (Kisan Mahapanchayat held at Samastipur, Darbhanga and Madhubani—core districts of Mithilanchal— and at Jehanabad). Das is set to conclude the drive by holding kisan mahapanchayat at Nawada and Sheikhpura in the next phase. “Our next mission would be to take the mass awareness campaign to the block levels. Four-five regional level farmers’ conclave will be held next month, before holding a mega rally at Gandhi Maidan, the date of which would be announced later,” Das said. He also claimed that the party’s drive was successful in eliciting huge response from the people. “Tattered state of economy that led to massive joblessness, mounting miseries of the people owing to the BJP-led government’s bid to leave no scope for taxing them and unfriendly approach of the state government for development of industries have led to deep frustration among the common masses. Corruption at every step and deteriorating law and order have compounded the people’s miseries,” said the AICC leader. “The drive also witnessed impressive participation of the party veterans, who had otherwise kept themselves off from the party’s sponsored programme. The programme also stood out, as it managed to pull in a large number of youths in Mithilanchal - once considered a stronghold of Congress,” said Prem Chandra Mishra, also an AICC media panelist. Former MLA Amit Kumar Tunna, former BPCC vice president Praveen Singh Kushwaha and senior AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha, who led the mass awareness drive in different areas, exuded confidence that the party’s campaign would give impetus to Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders’ bid to intensify their protests in Delhi yet again. “BKU leader Rakesh Tikait and others are also expected to visit Bihar and solicit farmers’ support for their agitation,” said Kushwaha. A section of party leaders said that leaders had come out of their comfort zones and demonstrated their strength in their respective areas in an apparent bid to get suitable positions in the organization, which, according to Das, is likely to be revamped next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-congress-unit-proposes-district-level-dharna-on-farmers-issues-101616395549632.html

Congress state president Amit Chavda on Sunday organised a meeting in the electoral constituency which was led by Baria, the Congress MLA of the constituency.During the meeting, Baria said, "BJP candidates who have won the recent panchayat elections should have their houses pelted with stones as they won with bogus votes using EVMs and by giving alcohol to voters."She then challenged Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to contest against her in the upcoming state assembly elections."If I have to be defeated in the coming assembly elections, the Chief Minister will himself have to get into the field," the Congress MLA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-congress-mla-asks-party-workers-to-pelt-stones-at-bjp-candidates-homes-101616394849105.html
22-03-2021||India||Nagaland begins integrated settled farming project||The Nagaland government has begun work on an innovative model of cluster agricultural development, Naga Model Integrated Settled Farming (NISF).The pilot project was launched at Boke-Botsa under Kohima district, where eight departments and a public undertaking – agriculture, sericulture, horticulture, animal husbandry and veterinary science, water resources, fishery and aquatic resources, land resources, soil and water conservation, and the Nagaland beekeeping and honey mission – are converging for the first time to work with the village community.Covid-19-induced lockdowns in 2020, which highlighted the gap in production and access to food, prompted the state government to look at the agricultural and allied sector in a new light. Chief minister Neiphiu Rio also said in his recent budget speech, “The agricultural and allied sectors are going to be the most important aspect of the state government’s strategy towards achieving a self-sustaining economy”.The project is based on the concept of settled farming because farming in most of the Naga villages still sees villagers living on hilltops for security, while their fields are located at the foothills. The settled farming concept looks to change this approach, saving the farmers the commuting time with the activities closer home.Also Read | MHA tells 4 N-E states to prevent influx of people from MyanmarAccording to agriculture production commissioner (APC) Nagaland, Y Kikheto Sema, the NISF pilot project area is slightly over 1,000 acres involving 145 farmers or landowners. Several samples of soil have been sent for health testing for agricultural purposes. Mapping of the area was carried out in November 2020 and farmers’ activities have already commenced in February. Road construction around the project site has also been completed.The government is also establishing a farm-to-market chain for marketing linkage and storage that will help farmers sell their produce in a bigger market. Sema said many of the Central government schemes were devised as per the conditions of the mainland states, while the topography and system of cultivation in Nagaland is different, making the schemes unsuitable for Naga farmers.Jhum, or shifting cultivation, though not economically viable and ecologically sustainable, is a major practice in the state. Sema said this practice was ultimately reducing the state’s forest cover and at the same time, making it difficult for the department(s) to connect with the farmers in consecutive cycles. He expressed hope that the NISF model would address these challenges.In the pilot project, the state government is looking to establish an organic vegetables market, about 200 fisheries, a commercial nursery, seed banks to preserve and promote traditional seeds, compost marketing, farmers training institution, custom hiring and repairing of farming tools and machinery.The aim is to turn the project into a model farming township, and ultimately a business model.Also Read | ‘Reckless’: Naga group on governor RN Ravi’s peace talks concluded statement“If it (the NISF pilot project) is successful, we will implement it in all districts. But its success also depends on all the stakeholders,” Sema stated.“The main aim of the project is to start an ecosystem of farming. If it is successful, it will not only give an entirely new direction to Nagaland, but to other states in the country as well – to lead the way for the next generation,” says Richard Belho, the project consultant. He admitted that the pilot was being started on a research and experiment basis, but was hopeful that it would take off well and attract the educated younger generation back to the field. “We never had a proper market structure. The activities introduced by various agri and allied departments often overlap with the farming community’s, thereby resulting in having to shelf the new activities after a few years of trial. With NISF, we are looking at sustainability- first for the farmer, then the village community, and finally the market,” Belho said. He said the departments will track the activities and document their successes and failures so that the future models can learn from the pilot project, he added.“If implemented properly, this project will enable farmers to multiply their production, become a contributing factor towards sufficiency and even export beyond the village. The projects are different from our normal practice as, for instance, the fishery ponds are being widened, scientific testing of soil is being done to assess suitability of crops etc.,” says Kechangulie Kense, one of the farmer-landowners at Boke-Botsa. He said he has taken up fishery and horticulture.“Farming was not an option earlier, but this settled farming project has changed my opinion and I want to seriously get involved in it,” Kense said.Another farmer and a village elder, Pfheliezhü, said he is upbeat about the project.The first impact and output from the project is expected within the next three to six months. However, the actual output will be the result yielded in the next three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-begins-integrated-settled-farming-project-101616393989489.html

But he cautioned that the PLA was concentrating its deployment in Tibet and Xinjiang region across the LAC through long term military plans.Military officials, however, cautioned that there was a clear effort by the People’s Liberation Army to consolidate its hold in Tibet and Xinjiang regions through long term military plans.The PLA has been moving heavy equipment to Rutog base in the occupied Aksai Chin area of the union territory of Ladakh, a senior military commander said, referring to a continuing effort to upgrade the military infrastructure in this region.Indian national security planners noted that while the PLA has parked its heavy equipment in the depth areas at Rutog in Tibet and Xiadullah across Karakoram pass in Xinjiang, the new military infrastructure build-up allows PLA the capability to reach the LAC in a very short time. All the airbases servicing the east Ladakh region including Gar Gunsa in Ngari prefecture and Hotan airbase have blast pens, which protect fighters from bombing during an enemy attack.The PLA has dug into the mountain faces and parked rocket regiments inside to ensure that they escape any attack at the hands of the Indian Air Force in the worst-case scenario. The Chinese airbases that have built blast pens include Hotan, Gar Gunsa, Lhasa, Yarkand and Kashgar airbases.“It is quite evident that the PLA will monitor the LAC through electronic surveillance in the future with land force and air force kept on standby in the nearby bases. This way the PLA will not have to station its troops in very high altitude posts in subpolar temperatures while the capacity of the Red Army to deploy remains intact,” said a former Army Chief.The PLA’s electronic surveillance of LAC through radars and sensors also became clear when a massive exercise to lay down optical fibres was carried out during the Chinese aggression in Gogra general area (also called patrolling point 17A). Radars and electronic surveillance equipment have also been placed at Tienweindien (TWD) post across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector with troops stationed at Xiadulla military camps.The Chinese Army infra build-up along the 3,488-km LAC after its aggression on the north banks of Pangong Tso last May has been noted with concern by Indian military commanders as it will stretch the troops the year-round. The Indian Army has also prepared a counter plan where reserve forces are stationed near the LAC and are deployed through new roads, helicopters like Chinook or C-130 J aircraft in case of any conflagration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11th-round-india-china-talks-look-positive-on-gogra-hot-springs-disengagement-101616391289405.html

This is testimony to the process of effective decentralization and cooperative federalism,” said the health ministry in a statement issued on Sunday.The health and wellness centres form the primary pillar of Ayushman Bharat as it aims to provide universal and comprehensive primary healthcare through 150,000 centres that will be set up by transforming some of the existing sub health centres and primary health centres by 2022.Also Read | Over 70,000 health, wellness centres set up under Ayushman Bharat: MinistrySince the first health and wellness centre was launched in 2018, about 415 million individuals have accessed care at these centres, of which about 54% are women.As part of the government’s strategy to promote preventive healthcare, these health and wellness centres have also been screening individuals above the age of 30 for non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and breast, cervix, oral cancers, etc.So far, 90 million screenings have been conducted for hypertension, 74 million screenings for diabetes, 47 million for oral cancer, 24 million for breast cancer, and 17 million screenings for cervical cancer in women.About 75% of the total non-communicable diseases screenings were conducted during the pandemic period, from February 1, 2020 onwards.“These population-level screenings can be of immense help in detecting signs of cancer early, leading to better treatment outcome in most cases,” said Dr PK Julka, former head of radiation oncology department, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The government is also incrementally adding other primary healthcare services for mental health, ear nose throat, ophthalmology, oral health, geriatric and palliative health care, and trauma care etc., along with expanding essential medicines and diagnostics list under the scheme at these health and wellness centres.In 2019, the Centre announced that the ministry of Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) will now be getting to run 10% of these centres exclusively through the alternative systems of medicine, and will be called Ayush Health and Wellness Centres (AHWCs).Teleconsultations by medical teams, another component of health and wellness centres, also picked up significantly during the pandemic, with at least 945,000 teleconsultations having been provided through these centres so far.As part of the government’s focus on holistic health, these centres also conduct various activities promoting wellness and healthy lifestyle. So far, these centres have conducted nearly 6.5 million wellness sessions.“Depending on the local context, States are undertaking various wellness activities including Yoga, local sports, Zumba (in NE States), etc. These centres also follow a calendar of 39 health promotion days spread over a year,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-400-mn-accessed-care-in-70k-ayushman-centres-health-ministry-101616390929286.html

22-03-2021||India||Facing heat, doctor at AIIMS-Patna says private practice rampant among peers||A doctor at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), facing charges of private practice, has denied the allegations and blamed the institute for selectively targeting him when many doctors were also doing the same.Doctors at AIIMS are not allowed to practice privately. They get non-practising allowance (NPA), which is generally 20% of their basic salary. Dr Shantam Mohan, assistant professor in the department of gastroenterology, has denied charges of unethical practice and laxity in work, after the AIIMS administration issued him a show-cause notice on March 13. While defending himself, Dr Mohan said: “There are many doctors at AIIMS who do private practice. I don’t.” “There are some doctors who do not even come to the institute regularly. All such suspects should have been issued show-cause notices. I have been selectively targeted because someone’s ego has been hurt as I do not pander to the powers that be. I diligently go for duty every working day at around 10am (the OPD registration is from 8am to 2pm),” said Dr Mohan. “Some doctors who did private practice have left the institute recently. There are others who still work at the institute and are currently into private practice. I have evidence against a few such doctors in terms of their private prescription and admission by patients, who used to consult them earlier,” he added. He did not name any of the doctors. Dr Mohan acknowledged that he used to practice privately before joining the AIIMS-Patna as an assistant professor on August 3, 2018. “The private clinic, where I used to practice, is currently run by my sister-in-law and I am not associated with it anymore,” he said. Dr Mohan had failed to turn up before a committee of senior faculty members, after the director convened a meeting, following a complaint against him by Dr Ramesh Kumar, associate professor and head, department of gastroenterology. “I was communicated about the meeting, convened at a short notice, through e-mail, which I could not check in time. However, I responded to the show-cause notice in around 30 hours of having received it, denying all the charges levelled against me,” said Dr Mohan. Dr Kumar had complained to the director about Dr Mohan’s alleged misconduct, compromising the institute’s work culture because of his late coming and reluctance to shoulder responsibility. Dr Mohan had earlier resigned from AIIMS during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in July, last year, only to take back his resignation after a month. “My friends advised me to complete three years as an assistant professor, which will make me eligible to apply as an associate professor in a government medical college sometime later. I’ll resign again on May 2 or 3 so that by the time I serve my three months’ notice period, I complete my term of three years as an assistant professor,” he said. In January, the gastroenterology department at AIIMS had initiated a three-year doctorate in medicine (DM) programme, with a student each having joined from New Delhi and West Bengal. The department is already handicapped, with only two faculty members, which is half its sanctioned faculty strength. Dr Ramesh Kumar said he was not authorised to speak to the media. “We have issued a show-cause notice to Dr Mohan because he is not very regular in work. He didn’t even come for the meeting, which I convened recently. We will first try and counsel and then see what is to be done about him,” said Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, AIIMS-Patna director. Responding to allegations of private practice being rampant among doctors at AIIMS, Dr Singh said, “This is a sweeping allegation. I don’t deny the fact that there may be 3 or 5 doctors at our institute who indulge in private practice, but I’m determined to weed them out. We will act against them as soon as we get any complaint or an iota of evidence. I will not allow the AIIMS work culture to suffer and our image dented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facing-heat-doctor-at-aiims-patna-says-private-practice-rampant-among-peers-101616382528952.html

He said that some students were allowed to leave after ascertaining that they have no contact history, ruling out other risks and a Covid-19 negative report.Udupi had seen a surge of cases in the second half of last year as well. The district has a significant number of its citizens settled in Persian Gulf countries who returned home during the lockdown.“As per the report, students had come in the second week of March. They had online classes and there was an examination due for which they had come from all over India. Maybe few had come from Maharashtra and Kerala as well. So, we doubt that the source of infection must be from either Maharashtra or Kerala,” Bhat added. On Saturday, MIT had communicated that entry and exit from this containment zone was restricted. The institution also appealed to students to stay inside their rooms during the containment period.“Meanwhile, we appeal to all of you to remain calm and make minimal movement out of your rooms until the District Authorities feel it is safe. We also appeal to students not to venture out in large groups to common areas such as Students Plaza, Gardens etc. Staying within the room is the best option and if possible, taking packed food to dine in the room is advisable to prevent crowding in the dining areas,” the institute said in circular to its students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-turns-manipal-institute-of-technology-turns-into-containment-zone-101616380368919.html

Monday marks the first anniversary of ‘Janta Curfew’ announced by Prime Minister Modi in his address to the nation and it comes at a time when India is in the grip of the second wave of the pandemic.What was ‘Janta Curfew’?With the country witnessing a steady rise in its daily new cases of Covid-19, and countries around the world announcing measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, PM Modi urged people to observe ‘Janta Curfew’, which translates to People’s Curfew, from 7am to 9pm on March 20, 2020. This was seen as a way to prepare the citizens for a lockdown, in case one was needed in future.In his speech, PM Modi said, “Today, I seek some more cooperation from every citizen. It is Janta Curfew, a curfew for the people and imposed by the people themselves.”What did PM Modi say?In his address, the Prime Minister also urged people to come out in the balconies of their houses at 5pm and clang utensils for five minutes as a gesture of solidarity with each other and to express gratitude for the frontline warriors. Urging people to stay off the roads for a day, he said that emergency services would not come under the purview of the curfew.My address to the nation. #IndiaFightsCorona https://t.co/w3nMRwksxJWhat happened on the day of ‘Janta Curfew’?The ‘Janta Curfew’ was largely successful as people voluntarily stayed off roads and away from public places. The clanging of utensils began well before 5pm and continued even after 5:05pm, by when, according to PM Modi’s announcement, it should have come to a stop.What happened next?On March 24, PM Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown. Later, it was extended thrice, with the final phase beginning on May 18, and concluding on May 31. From June 1 onwards, the country started reopening gradually, in what was termed as ‘Unlock.’What’s India’s Covid-19 situation now?Earlier this year, the number of daily cases fell below 10,000 while the number of active cases had also started coming down. However, starting late February/early March, the number of daily infections picked up and, on Sunday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) announced that 43,846 new cases and 197 related fatalities were recorded in the preceding 24 hours. India’s Covid-19 tally currently stands at 11,599,130 including 11,130,288 recovered cases, 309,087 active cases and 159,755 deaths.Also Read | 86.8% of India's Covid-related deaths recorded in these 6 statesIndia is also conducting the world’s largest vaccination drive against the viral disease which commenced on January 16.

22-03-2021||India||Watchdog alerts transport ministry over ‘intrusions’||The Union transport ministry on Sunday received an alert from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (Cert-IN) regarding “targeted intrusion activities” directed towards the country’s transport sector with “possible malicious intentions”, a senior official said.This comes after a slew of cyber security attacks on Indian government’s domains over the past few months. On February 25, HT reported about new phishing emails using compromised government accounts to target groups of officials, attempting to lure them into sharing their passwords on a page that mirrored the government’s official mail server sign-on website.“The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways received an alert from CERT-In regarding targeted intrusion activities directed towards Indian Transport sector with possible malicious intentions. The Ministry has advised departments and organisations under transport sector to strengthen the security posture of their infrastructure,” the transport ministry said in a statement.The ministry requested NIC, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL), Indian Road Congress (IRC), Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE), state PWDs, testing agencies and automobile manufacturers to conduct the security audit of the entire IT system by CERT-In certified agencies. “The audit report and the ATR will be regularly submitted to the government,” the government said.The previous attack prompted the government’s IT departments to send out an alert to large groups of officials, according to emails seen by HT. The incident leverage compromised @gov.in or @nic.in email addresses issued by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which may be more successful in luring the targets into sharing sensitive information.On February 21, HT also reported that the devices of multiple former defence personnel may have been compromised in a phishing attack launched through similar attacks carried out by government domain email addresses.Earlier this month, American cyber intelligence company Recorded Future also said it uncovered a suspected China-linked cyber operation that was focused on India’s electricity grid and other critical infrastructure. While the company did not link a wide power outage in Mumbai to the operation (which it titled RedEcho), it did not rule out a link. According to Recorded Future, RedEcho deployed a malware known as ShadowPad, which has been previously linked to Chinese cyber soldiers.Last year, NHAI reported a cyber attack on its email server and said prompt action resulted in no data loss.

22-03-2021||India||Mothers who gave birth in police vans during the lockdown recount journey||When Kiran Aharwar went into labour on May 16 last year, her husband Ashok was despondent. The nation was under lockdown to arrest the spread of Covid-19, public transport was suspended, private vehicles were allowed at night only with special permission, and despite emergency services functioning in Delhi, medical facilities were stretched thin.Ashok dialled the local hospital but was told an ambulance would take two hours to reach their house in outer Delhi’s Rohini. With his wife’s condition deteriorating, an Asha worker in the neighbourhood called the local police station, hoping for some help.Within 10 minutes, a local police control room (PCR) vehicle had appeared. With the help of two officers, Aharwar was put in the car and it sped off to the local hospital.Aharwar, however, was well into labour. Ten minutes later, she delivered a healthy girl child, Shanvi, in the PCR van, with the help of two officers. None of the policemen were medically trained or had any special equipment to help with the delivery.They ensured the van was parked at an isolated spot to offer privacy and helped with the delivery.“After my baby was born, the policemen helped with the cleaning work before moving us to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital,” said Aharwar.Shanvi is among six babies delivered in PCR vans with the help of Delhi Police personnel during the lockdown months. Each of these children was born in a PCR van after their mother, while in labour pain, failed to find an ambulance and ended up dialling the police as last resort. Each of these cases involved police personnel helping deliver the baby without technical knowhow, using ordinary objects as makeshift medical equipment. In each case, the police personnel involved in helping were men.“These policemen went beyond their gender roles and boundaries and their general duties,” said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Umed Singh, who was in charge of the PCR van in which Kiran delivered her baby, said they were in Aman Vihar, about four kilometres away, when they got a message about the emergency on the wireless set. Singh and the van’s driver, ASI Ramesh, immediately shifted the woman on the stretcher available in the vehicle.“We requested some women in the neighbourhood to accompany us, but they refused citing personal reasons. As it was an emergency situation, we did not waste any time and left for Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital with the woman’s husband and a relative. The woman delivered the baby en route to hospital. We provided all possible assistance ,” said Singh, who is retiring from the force next year.Police data show that last year, 997 women in labour were rushed to hospitals in PCR vans. Only five of these instances were reported before the lockdown was imposed on March 25. Overall, through the year, nine babies were delivered in the vans – each of them involving male police personnel, the police data show.Nearly a year after their births, HT tracked down five of the six children born in PCR vans. The babies are healthy, but their parents struggle to recover from the financial shock and job loss suffered due to the pandemic.But they all say local police were in constant touch with them. Every month, they received a call from the local station. Occasionally, the officer paid them a visit. On International Women’s Day, March 8, these mothers were guests at celebration at the Delhi Police headquarters and the babies were showered with gifts.“The police’s phone calls and visits didn’t change my financial situation and struggles, but I know there is someone we can call if in an emergency,” said Anita Singh, one of the mothers.Six babies were delivered in PCR vans with the help of Delhi Police personnel during the lockdown months. Each of these children was born in a PCR van after their mother, while in labour pain, failed to find an ambulance and ended up dialling the police as the last resort. Each of these cases involved police personnel who helped deliver the baby despite no formal training, using ordinary objects as makeshift medical equipment. A year after the nationwide lockdown, Shiv Sunny and Karn Pratap Singh speak to the parents of five of these children.'My condition then was way too serious’: Kiran Aharwar and Ashok Kumar Aharwarparents to ShanviWhen Ashok Kumar Aharwar called an ambulance to attend to his wife Kiran in labour on May 16 last year, he was told that the vehicle could only come to his Rohini house two hours later. It was 11am but the nationwide lockdown kept public transport off the roads and medical services were stretched thin in dealing with surging Covid-19 patients.Kiran was in pain, so the family called the local Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker. She came within minutes, but the ambulance hadn’t reached. Desperate, the ASHA worker dialled the police station.The PCR van reached the Aharwar residence about 10 minutes later. Police personnel quickly put the family in the car and sped towards the local hospital. But before they reached, Kiran delivered the baby in the car. Police personnel helped her, parked the van by the roadside and covered it to give the mother privacy.When Kiran and her newborn baby, Shanvi, were eventually admitted to the hospital, she realised the scale of the medical emergency that had gripped the city. “There were two patients on every bed in the hospital. The rush was such that doctors decided to discharge me in two hours,” said Kiran.For Kiran, it was the second such experience in three years. Her first daughter, Tannu, too was born in a car on their way to a hospital in Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. But this time, the condition was far more serious, and she was thankful to the policemen. “Until my baby was in my arms, I thought this time I would lose the child,” she said.Unlike many other families, the lockdown had a limited impact on the Aharwars. “I am a daily wage mason hired by a government contractor. When there was no work for a month during the lockdown, my contractor gave me some money to stop me from returning to my village,” said Ashok. He is paid Rs.400 as his daily wage.Ashok chose to stay back in Delhi, and found work easily when the economy reopened.‘Wouldn’t be able to bear if things went awry’: Sangeeta and Sant Kumar parents to HarshitaFor two hours on April 30, Sant Kumar made desperate phone calls to various ambulance services. His wife, Sangeeta, was in labour; his home was located right next to Outer Ring Road, but that did not make a difference. Every single ambulance service said they were too busy. Their neighbours advised them to call the police.Less than 10 minutes later, they were on their way to a hospital that was about four kilometers away. Sangeeta delivered a baby in the police van while two policemen helped her and his mother with the delivery.It was the toughest few minutes in the couple’s lives. “I am 35 and we were trying for a child for a long time. We wouldn’t have been able to bear the loss of our baby,” said Kumar.The responsibility wasn’t easy on them. Kumar lost his job during the lockdown, about a month before their daughter’s birth.“While mother’s milk doesn’t cost money, we had no money to buy me nutritional food. We depended on the meals provided by government,” said Sangeeta.“Not many children are born under such trying circumstances,” said Kumar.‘We borrowed money to ensure our baby did not lack anything’: Asha and Shravan Lalparents to DivyanshIn the early hours of May 19, Asha Lal went into labour. Her husband, Shravan, dialed several ambulance services but received no response. “When someone eventually did take the call, they plainly refused to attend to us,” said the daily wage labourer.Eventually, the family called an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA), Jyoti, who suggested they call the local police station.The ASHA worker’s husband owned an auto-rickshaw, but was afraid to take it out during the lockdown and the night curfew.A police van was outside the neighbourhood in five minutes but it was another 25 before Asha was on her way to the hospital.“All the three gates of the neighbourhood in which our shanty is located were locked at the time [to prevent the movement of people]. Because of this, it took us a lot of time to guide the PCR van to my home,” said Shravan.Their baby boy, Divyansh, was born in the PCR van, with help from the policemen.“If the gates were not locked, the police had responded quick enough for the delivery to happen in hospital,” said Asha.This was a period when Shravan was without work for three months, but the family did not let that hinder their care for their baby.“My husband and I ate meals offered by the government, but we borrowed money to ensure our baby did not lack anything,” said Asha.‘When the police van came, we knew situation wouldn’t hinder the delivery’: Anita Singh and Monu Singhparents to NiharikaAnita Singh went into labour on the night of May 1. Her husband, Monu Singh, was immediately worried. “There was strict enforcement of lockdown in our neighbourhood. Police were chasing people into their homes,” said Monu Singh, a resident of south Delhi’s Aya Nagar.When frantic calls to ambulance services yielded no results, the family decided to seek help from the police. Even neighbours who owned cars refused to venture out.Ten minutes later, Anita was riding out in a PCR van with her mother-in-law, and her husband following them on his motorcycle. Barely a couple of kilometers away, Anita delivered a baby girl, Niharika, in the police van. The usually busy road was deserted due to the lockdown, giving the family the necessary privacy during childbirth.The family was under great financial stress at the time because Monu lost his job as a security guard. They had to depend on his parents for survival.“To survive, we sought help from my father who works as a gardener at a farmhouse in Fatehpur Beri. He got me a job alongside him three months after the lockdown,” said Monu.But they were thankful to the police for their help. “When the PCR arrived, we knew our economic situation wouldn’t be a hindrance in the delivery,” said Monu Singh.‘I realised later that any more delay and I would have lost my baby’: Vandana Kumari, Suraj kumar parents to HimanshiWhen several ambulance services refused to attend to his pregnant wife Vandana in the early hours of May 1, Suraj Kumar panicked. The lockdown meant there was no public transport available. He planned to take her on his motorcycle and rush her to the nearest hospital in Rohini. But before he could roll out his motorcycle, neighbours advised him to call the police station.Minutes later, the police van arrived, and whisked Vandana away to the local hospital. On the way, Vandana gave birth to a baby girl, Himanshi, in the PCR van. It was a premature baby.When the family reached the hospital, tragic news awaited them. They were expecting twins but her other child was stillborn. Still, the family is grateful to the police for their response. “I realised later that any more delay and I would have lost my other baby,” said Vandana.They still regret not hurrying more. “We also erred in guiding the PCR van to our home. We weren’t able to explain our location properly which caused a little delay,” says Vandana’s mother-in-law, Veena Devi.The family says the local police have been kind. “They even called us to the station to ask about a few times,” said Devi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mothers-who-gave-birth-in-police-vans-during-the-lockdown-recount-journey-101616355497690.html
22-03-2021||India||Fresh surge takes active Covid cases past 345,000||A total of 47,005 new infections of Covid-19 were reported across India on Sunday, the highest single-day increase in cases since November 11 last year, pushing the number of active cases in the country close to the 350,000 mark, as the second wave of the outbreak continued to expand its footprint.In just the last five days, more than 200,000 new Covid-19 infections have been reported across the country and as many active cases have been added in the last 30 days, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.As of Sunday night, there are 345,122 active cases in the country. The number of active cases in India crossed the million mark in the middle of September, when the first wave peaked, but it was dropping rapidly since. This receding trend, however, reversed a month ago with the start of the new wave of infections, according to data.Sunday’s 47,005 new cases came despite the fact that new case numbers generally drop on weekends on account of low testing. Of these, a record 30,535 cases came from Maharashtra – the third time in four days that the state set a new all-time record for single-day cases.There were 823 new cases in Delhi, the most number of daily cases in the Capital since December 14, as the positivity rate in the city remained above 1% for the second day in a row.Another 2,644 new cases were reported in Punjab, 1,715 new infections in Karnataka and 1,580 in Gujarat – all single-day record high in at least four months.A total of 204 people lost their lives to the viral disease on Sunday, taking the total number of deaths to 160,024.Tracking active cases is crucial because it reflects the actual spread of a virus in a region, as well as the load the country’s health care system is currently bearing. A higher caseload means that the virus has more hosts in a region, and thus has a higher chance of spreading to more people. Experts warned that this dangerous trend of rising active cases is unlikely to subside unless people across the country drop the laxity in Covid-19-appropriate behaviour that has developed due to low cases over the past few months.New infections have been rising the past month across India, marking the start of what is clearly the second wave of infections.Since the peak of the first Covid-19 wave in mid-September, the seven-day average of new infections across India, which denotes the country’s “Covid curve”, was consistently dropping for eight straight months till February 11, touching a low of 10,988 cases a day. Since then, this number has more than tripled – on average, 37,220 new cases were reported every day in the past week.Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state, has majorly contributed to the rise of the second wave and makes up roughly two-thirds of the country’s daily case burden in the past week. The western state is also home to nearly two-thirds of all active infections in the country as on Sunday — 211,416.Other than Maharashtra, several other regions such as Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have seen clear resurgence of Covid-19 cases over the past month, forcing several of them to reintroduce restrictions on public assembly and gatherings in an attempt to arrest rising cases.More than 44,641,471 doses of vaccines have been administered to 37,299,609 people across the country till Sunday night, as per Centre’s Co Win dashboard.According to experts, the biggest reason for the surge in cases is that people feel the pandemic is over and they are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour.“There are multiple reasons for the surge, but the main reason is that there is change in people’s attitude and they feel coronavirus is over. People should still restrict non-essential travel for some more time,” All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member (Health), said that to remain free of this virus, it is very important that Covid-appropriate behaviour, containment strategy, readiness from the health infrastructure point of view as well as vaccination has to be brought in to fight the pandemic. He advised that in districts where cases are seemingly on the rise, vaccination of eligible individuals should be intensified and prioritised.Others said the rise in active cases was expected, given how fast cases have been rising in the past few weeks, and warned that it is increasing the load on the health care system at a time when it is already burdened with one of the largest vaccination drives in the world.“The active caseload directly depends on incidence of disease in the past 10 or so days. Clearly, the new cases have seen a jump, which is why the number of active cases has also gone up. Active cases going up would mean additional load on health infrastructure, which is not ideal at this stage. The best way to bring the active caseload down is to bring down the number of new cases that can be done by cutting the transmission cycle,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology department, AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-surge-takes-active-covid-cases-past-345000-101616353678396.html
22-03-2021||India||Punjab CM didn’t fulfil poll promises: Arvind Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday held a Maha Kisan Panchayat in Punjab’s Moga and hit out at the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government, saying the Congress administration had not fulfilled any of the poll promises made by it before the 2017 elections.“In the run-up of the 2017 assembly polls, Capt Amarinder Singh had made several promises. But after assuming power for over four years, the chief minister is unable to deliver on announcements including debt waiver for farmers, jobs, providing smart phones and unemployment allowance,” he said.The AAP leader also portrayed his party as an alternative to both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state that goes to polls next year.“Now, it is a time for Punjabis to remember that Punjab voters were cheated in the last elections and you should be ready for badla (revenge) from the Congress in the next polls,” he said.Kejriwal said that the AAP will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with farmers protesting against the contentious new agriculture laws, which last year triggered a widespread agitation by cultivators across the country.He also took on the central government over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, alleging that the BJP-led Union government wants to “snatch power” from the chief minister of Delhi by giving more rights in the functioning of the Capital city to the lieutenant governor.“Upset over AAP government’s refusal to grant permission to arrest protesting farmers in nine open jails, [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi is now conspiring to reduce more decision-making powers of the Delhi state government. But I assure you that the AAP government will not let the Centre harm the farmers who are fighting for their survival,” Kejriwal said.A large chunk of farmers protesting against the agriculture laws on the outskirts of Delhi since November last year are from Punjab.The AAP government has previously expressed support for the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-didn-t-fulfil-poll-promises-arvind-kejriwal-101616352811975.html
22-03-2021||India||TN leaders urge India to vote in favour of UN resolution against Sri Lanka||DMK president MK Stalin and other leaders on Sunday urged Central government leaders to support the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution against Sri Lanka for war crimes against Tamils in the island nation. Stalin, in a statement, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi not to take a pro-Sri Lanka stand while voting on the resolution that comes up on March 22 (at its 46th regular session). Stalin said that Modi’s silence “has caused shockwaves to Tamils around the world and in Tamil Nadu” after Sri Lankan foreign secretary Jayanath Colombage had said that India would vote in support of his country. “Union foreign minister Mr Jaisankar went to Sri Lanka. Mr Modi and Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa held telephone talks but none of the press reports said that the talks discussed the resolution,” said Stalin. He called for Modi to gather support from other member states in favour of the resolution.“While Tamils are anxiously waiting for India’s position, it is painful that the BJP government has allowed the Sri Lankan foreign secretary to decide India’s stand. Nine-crore Tamils living across the world will never forgive them if Tamil’s interests are betrayed,” he added.DMK’s ally, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko, a known sympathiser of the outlawed militant group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), said the BJP-led Centre won’t be forgiven if they favour Sri Lanka. The LTTE fought for an independent homeland for Tamil in Sri Lanka and was found responsible for assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur over the issue. Leader of Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who is in the NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu, wrote to external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Sunday requesting to vote for the resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. He recalled that Modi in a public meeting in Chennai in February had assured that India was committed to ensuring that Tamils lived in Sri Lanka in peace, dignity and equality. “Justice for Tamils killed in the 2009 genocide in Sri Lanka remains elusive for the victims after 12 years,” Ramadoss said in his statement. “Peace in Sri Lanka and maintaining India’s position as the dominant ally are vital for our national interests,” he said, adding that Sri Lanka has changed its position with India and taken its relationship with China to a higher level.Also read: ‘Karunanidhi did not trust Stalin, how will people’, says Tamil Nadu CMIn the last twelve years, there have been seven resolutions on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC where India’s position varies from voting against Sri Lanka and abstaining as influenced by local coalition politics after a three-decade-long war between the army and the LTTE ended in 2009. Tamil Nadu’s politicians have consistently advocated for equal rights for Tamils who are a minority in the Sinhalese- Buddhist island nation and continue to seek devolution of powers through the 13th Amendment.Ahead of the vote in March 2013, the DMK pulled out of the UPA alliance which was in power at the centre for not doing enough to address the alleged human rights violations of Tamils. The DMK and ruling AIADMK, in their election manifesto for the assembly polls on April 6, made promises for Sri Lankan refugees living in the state from granting them dual citizenship to international probe to monthly payouts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-leaders-urge-india-to-vote-in-favour-of-un-resolution-against-sri-lanka-101616352766447.html
22-03-2021||India||World Water Day How city’s growth depleted quality of lakes||At around 6 am on Sunday, three coracles ventured into the over 150-acre lake in BTM Layout, a suburban neighbourhood in the southern side of Bengaluru. In about an hour, the coracles returned one-by-one with nets full of rohu (Labeo rohita), catla (Labeo catla) and the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) among the about 160 kg of fish. Morning joggers queued up to get the catch of the day, while many others just stood around the stall chattering on about the fish dumped on tarpaulins as it was weighed, cleaned and sold to customers. “The water in this lake is not fit for drinking. But the fish is good,” said Antony, the 51-year-old who has the contract to cultivate and sell the catch from the lake. He said the lake’s condition improved ever since authorities diverted the sewage water. This lake was developed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body) and is considered one of the more successful projects of the administration that has spent—and continues to spend—tens of crores into ‘rejuvenating’ water bodies in the city. The civic body has also partnered with corporates to channel CSR funds into lake rejuvenation but with little success to improve the quality of water. With the World Water Day being observed on March 22, the discussion on deteriorating quality of water, air and life in urban centres across India and other parts of the globe gains significance. Once known as the ‘land of lakes’, Bengaluru has seen a steady decline in the water bodies as a victim of its own success. It has led to a higher allocation of funds but with little attention to the quality of water and ecology, experts said. But lakes and tanks, which were part of the human-interventions in Bengaluru to mitigate the lack of river, are now found mostly in the pages of history books, experts said. At least 19 lakes of the remaining 205 (out of earlier estimates of at least 250) under the BBMP were termed as disused lakes due to encroachments, according to a February 2021 report by the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). Some of the encroachments are by big builders, who name their projects “lake view” to attract more interest from potential buyers. Between 2008 and 2020, the BBMP claimed to have developed around 80 out of the 205 lakes with another 20 or so under various stages of completion.“None of the lakes have drinking standards water,” said a senior official of the BBMP, incharge of lakes. He said that until there is sewage water flowing theought storm water drains into these lakes, the quality of water cannot improve. “Until the BWSSB (Bengaluru Water supply and sewerage Boad) continues to allow sewage to enter these drains, it wont help the lake,” he said. The official added that despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order to stop inlet of sewage into these drains, the practice contiues. However, experts said that most of the money went into ‘ornamental’ developments like concrete walking/jogging tracks, gazebos, seating and fencing than implementing measures that improve the quality of water and its ecology. “Money is not spent on lake rejuvenation but cosmetic and beautification. That’s why the lakes, ecology and environment are in a bad state. But you will see a nice park around lakes, gyms, walking tracks and people have been misguided to believe that this is lake rejuvenation,” said V Ramprasad, one of the founders and coordinators of Friends of Lakes, a citizen-driven initiative to revive water bodies in Bengaluru. With the Vrishabhavathi river becoming a victim of over exploitation, sewage and encroachments, Bengaluru quenches its insatiable thirst by dipping into the Cauvery, about 100 km away. Thousands of crores is spent each year to divert water to Bengaluru, where leakages and lack of reuse of water have weighed on any sustainability goals India’s IT capital may have. Experts said that less than 5% city residents have implemented rainwater harvesting in a region known to get bountiful rains. Instead, the need for water in the city is met through borewells and supply through tankers, which snake around almost every inch of the city, delivering thousands of litres several times a day. Lakes are no longer an answer and have instead become casualties of Bengaluru’s economic success. The CSIR-NEERI report indicated that there were only around 21 lakes in the city where water is deemed fit for drinking. This data, however, has been contested by environmentalists, scientists and residents of the city. A report by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 2020 stated that not even one lake had fit-for-drinking water. “One of the places they (authorities) are going wrong is their investment in the waterbody and not the entire watershed. It should take care of sewage and solid waste networks in catchment areas that give the lake a chance at revival. But merely putting up a fence or taking out silt doesn’t mean anything,” Dr Vishwanath Srikantaiah, a water activist and urban planner, said. “For the money that is invested, the bang for the buck is absolutely minimal,” he added. Few big apartment complexes have installed STP (sewage treatment plants), but most of Bengaluru’s used water flows through a complex system of lakes and open channels or ‘tank cascade system’. Experts said the unregulated and unchecked development of Bengaluru in the last two decades — right around the IT boom — has led to the construction of apartments, mushrooming of layouts and other establishments. It has facilitated open channels, receiving more untreated water and industrial effluents, causing a range of impact on these ecosystems. Bellandur lake made global headlines for its toxic content and foam that often catches fire largely due to the sewage, metal and other harmful contents within the lake. Hundreds of crores have been allocated, but there is little to show as ‘rejuvenation’, experts said. Dr. Priyanka Jamwal, fellow at the Centre for Environment and Development at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment or (ATREE), said there was no clarity on what authorities wanted in respect to rejuvenation. “For water quality they just say that they want to attain a trophic level. In a lake, it could be Oligotrophic, Mesotrophic, Eutrophic or hyper-eutrophic, which depends on the productivity of the lake. Hypereutrophic is highly contaminated that has a lot of algae while Oligotrophic lakes are present in pristine environments,” she said. ATREE has been monitoring Jakkur lake, considered one of the cleanest in the city for four years now, but even it has high content of faecal coliforms, nitrate and other contaminants that make it unfit for drinking unless treated. “It can be treated and made drinkable, but the amount of investment required is very high,” she added. About the fish from these lakes that are caught, sold and consumed, Jamwal said faecal coliforms die when the food is cooked at high temperature. However, Jamwal also pointed out that there are other heavy metals and contaminants bio-accumulated in the fish. “The point is that nobody is testing the fish,” she said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-water-day-how-city-s-growth-depleted-quality-of-lakes-101616351985811.html
22-03-2021||India||Centre to soon issue guidelines on ecotourism||New Delhi: The Union environment ministry is set to issue, in around a month's time, guidelines that will open up wildlife rich forest areas across the country to eco-tourism, a move that officials say targets positioning India as a global destination for such travel.The “Guidelines on Ecotourism in Forest and Wildlife Areas, 2021”, aimed at promoting better understanding of nature and wildlife conservation while generating income and opportunities for local communities, are likely to be issued “in a month or so”, according to officials familiar with the matter who did not wish to be identified.Projects under it will include promotion of low-impact nature tourism, promotion of traditional ecological knowledge and heritage values of India’s wilderness, partnerships amongst various stakeholders etc., to realise India’s “potential as a global eco-tourism destination”.On March 8, the government published minutes of the 61st meeting of the standing committee of the national board for wildlife held on February 18 over the matter.“They (the guidelines) will be implemented in an ‘ecologically, culturally and economically sustainable manner’,” according to the minutes of the meeting.NBWL's standing committee has deferred the decision to approve the guidelines as the forest conservation division of the ministry felt the need to examine if they reconcile with the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. A number of tweaks are being made to the Act in order to make way for the eco-tourism plan, the officials quoted above said.HT reported on March 11 that the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) in February eased norms for eco-tourism projects by allowing them to build “non-permanent” structures in protected areas without permission from the central government.The FAC, in its meeting held on February 17, also decided to delete two clauses (12.13 and 1.18) in guidelines on forest conservation published in the ministry’s Handbook on Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 and Forest (Conservation) Rules 2003. These clauses state that eco-tourism is a “non-forestry activity”, and thus require prior approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.“We have already made required changes in the handbook to categorise eco-tourism as a forestry activity. Now, the guidelines will specify exactly what we mean by low-impact tourism and how it should be implemented. They should be out in a month or so. The process of framing these guidelines started 3-4 years back and the NBWL has sought comments from a number of organisations to implement an eco-tourism strategy effectively,” said a senior official from the forest conservation division of the ministry.Another senior official confirmed that wildlife safaris will be included in the draft guidelines covering eco-tourism.The ministry has also started the process of amending the FC Act to make way for these guidelines to be implemented. An internal note has been circulated to various ministries on the amendments likely. Some of them are contentious. For example, the note suggests any work ancillary to conservation such as regeneration operations, setting up of check posts, construction of fencing, pillars, bridges, culverts, dams, trenches, waterholes, wildlife training infrastructure, zoos and safaris will be removed from the category of “non-forest” activities and hence does not require prior permission from the Centre.It also suggests that the Centre based on certain criteria cause certain forest areas to be delineated for the purpose of conservation for a fixed period and in such areas the use of forest land for non-forestry activities will not be permitted for that fixed period.“The amendments to the FC Act is an internal matter for now. We can assure you that we are taking an extremely cautious approach. We will go only to the extent of tweaking fine things. Tree plantations will be promoted in non-forest land as much as possible, eco-tourism in forest land will also be promoted. The eco-tourism guidelines are expected before the FC Act is amended,” the official said quoted in the first instance said.“Firstly, eco-tourism is not a permissible activity under the wildlife protection act or the forest conservation act yet. Even to set up a couple of structures in a wildlife reserve or national park, the permission of the NBWL is mandatory. They (Centre) can do these eco-tourism activities outside the national parks. Why do they need to set up inside? Even with eco-tourism pressures outside parks look at the condition of places like the Corbett Tiger Reserve. If you start opening up and breaking forest land there will be nothing left of our wildlife reserves and forests anymore. Already linear projects are wreaking havoc in protected areas. Tourism even with tents has a huge footprint,” said Ritwick Dutta, environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-soon-issue-guidelines-on-ecotourism-101616351926986.html
22-03-2021||India||Law on interfaith marriage not against any religion: Shivraj Singh Chouhan||On completing one year of his third term, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan speaks to HT’s Chetan Chauhan and Madan Jaira of Hindi Hindustan about the challenges of Covid-19, a resurgence in infections and the revenue shortfall the state is facing. He also expressed confidence about the Bharatiya Janata Party winning elections in West Bengal and Assam. Edited excerpts:In a few days, you would complete a year in office in your third term. You took charge when Covid-19 was spreading fast. How do you rate your first year?When I took charge, there was no minister with me for one month and Covid-19 was spreading fast... We made arrangements for Covid-19 management, creating testing facility in the states, getting masks, PPE kits and making arrangement in hospitals. Another big challenge was that in March, wheat harvest starts in MP. We bought 1.39 crore metric tonne of wheat, which was even more than Punjab. During Covid-19, we provided work to all workers and ensured that those entering MP get food and buses. On the PM’s call, we turned the Covid-19 pandemic into an opportunity — started Aatmanirbhar in MP and started working on infrastructure, education, health, good governance and employment...You have been CM for almost 15 years. Your remarks about your other tenures?In the first tenure, we worked for better roads and brought laws to ensure Public Service Delivery law, first state to do so in India. In the second term, we promised 24-hour power when people were getting five to six hours of power; expanded irrigation network and started river linking projects. In the third one, we got nine awards for being the best agriculture state both by Manmohan Singh ji and Modi ji’s governments. We now have surplus agriculture produce. But, a lot more has to be done on bringing investment.Despite your claims, MP has very low per capital income and it is one of the lowest-ranked states on health parameters.When I took charge, MP was a Bimaru state and had Rs.13,000 per capita income. Now it is Rs.99,000; this year, we will cross Rs.1,00,000. Our GDP will cross Rs.10,000 lakh crore. We were a landlocked state and no industry came. Now, we have changed that...Protesting farmers are demanding a law to protect minimum support price. What is your view?There should be provisions to give farmers right price for their produce. I think we need to think about alternative ways to ensure the right price. We can provide the right price through schemes such as Bhavanter, in which the government pays the difference between the MSP and the market price to farmers. If the market is buying at less than MSP, the government can pay...There have been accusations that minority groups are being targeted through the MP Religion of Freedom Law.There is no question of targeting. It is same for all. If someone tries to lure someone through coercion, threat or any other wrong means, action would be taken. The law is not against any religion. People doing good work for communities can continue.The second wave of Covid-19 has started and cases in MP are also rising. What steps are being taken to control the spread?In mid-February, we had 141 new cases and we thought things were getting normal... But in the past 15 days, cases have increased and pace of spread has intensified. People are not wearing masks and are going to social programmes. We need to tell people about the severity of Covid again.How do you rate the BJP’s chances in West Bengal and Assam?I went to both the states and I am confident that the BJP wave is there in both. In Bengal, there is a wave of change. TMC has become a symbol of terror, murder and corruption... The Congress has damaged itself by allying with Badruddin Ajmal and BJP has brought all-round development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-on-interfaith-marriage-not-against-any-religion-mp-cm-101616351925750.html
22-03-2021||India||Now, U’khand CM says US enslaved India for 200 yrs||After the “ripped jeans” faux pas, Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Sunday courted another controversy by saying “the US enslaved India for 200 years” and questioned people’s complaints about getting less subsidised ration during the pandemic, saying they should have had more children if they wanted better supplies.Rawat made these comments during a function in Ramnagar on Sunday in connection with the International Day of Forests. Rawat said at one time “we were ‘ghulam’ (slaves) of the US for 200 years, it (US) was ruling over the world, it was said the sun would never set for it, but now, in the present time, all that has gone...” He said the US was now struggling to control the pandemic. Rawat said the government gave 5kg rice per head to every household. “Those families who had 10 members got 50 kgs, those who had 20 members got one quintal, those who had two members got 10 kgs. People made stores, found buyers… such good rice came, they hadn’t taken it in their normal life… that too during ‘aapdha’ (disaster) time. But even after this, people were jealous of each other, that one got 10 kgs and another got one quintal… who is at fault in all this? He bore 20 children and you two children… why jealous? When there was time, you bore only two children, why not 20?”Last Tuesday, Rawat said at an event on containing substance abuse that “showing bare knees by wearing ripped jeans just to look like rich kids is the value given now which is just a race towards westernisation when the western world today is following us. Ripped jeans pave the way for societal breakdown”.State Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said, “Don’t know what has happened to the CM. Is it lack of wisdom or lack of education or is he doing it deliberately?....” He accused CM Rawat of insulting people for their poverty citing his statement on giving good quality rice in ration kits during the lockdown. “He said the government gave rice which people could never have afforded, which only insults the poor. Being the CM of the state, he should carefully look after his language...”The BJP, however, accused the Congress of “only seeing the negativity”. Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president, said, “The CM spoke about employment schemes for the youth in Corbett Tiger Reserve but the Congress could see only the negative part because they have become devoid of issues. The CM is doing commendable work for the development of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-u-khand-cm-says-us-enslaved-india-for-200-yrs-101616351527485.html
22-03-2021||India||CAA roll-out, 1 job per family on BJP manifesto for Bengal||Kolkata The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday promised to implement the new citizenship law, ensure employment to one member of every family, set up modern hospitals, spend thousands of crores of rupees for development of infrastructure in Kolkata and other districts, and support farmers, fishermen, tribal people and backward classes if it comes to power after the eight-phase election beginning March 27. The promises were made in the BJP’s election manifesto called its “sankalp patra” which Union home minister Amit Shah released in Kolkata on Sunday evening. “Once we are in power, the first meeting of our cabinet will announce the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act,” said Shah. On February 11, Shah, while on a visit to Bengal, said the Centre will enforce the new citizenship law once vaccination across the country is over and the Covid-19 pandemic ends. He also said no Muslim will lose citizenship because of the law. Shah made the statement at an election rally at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district while addressing the Dalit Matua community which has demanded the law’s immediate implementation. The fact that Shah released the document and spoke in Hindi triggered a sharp reaction from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) which has branded Shah, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other central leaders of the BJP as “outsiders”.“This speaks of the BJP’s bankruptcy. The party has no competent Bengali leader to release a document meant for the state. It is an insult to the people of Bengal,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. The 58-page document is divided in 13 parts with each focusing on women, farmers, health, the youth, governance, economic development, infrastructure, culture, tourism, social welfare schemes, regional development, Kolkata, and the environment. Some portions of the BJP’s manifesto had striking similarities with the TMC’s document released on March 17. The TMC manifesto promised to generate 500,000 employment opportunities every year, provide annual financial aid of ₹10,000 per annum to farmers and monthly assistance of ₹500 to all women of the general category and ₹1,000 to women of the scheduled caste and tribe categories. It also promised credit of ₹10 lakh to students at a low interest rate of 4%. In the BJP’s manifesto, there was special focus on women, with whom the document starts, and Bengali language and culture. The document also talks of a whistle-blower policy for unearthing corruption, three AIIMS-like hospitals in the north Bengal region where the BJP won seven of eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019, and a minimum wage of ₹350 for tea garden workers. The party promised to include the Hindu Mahishya and Tili communities in the Other Backward Class (OBC) category, something the TMC has also done. “Do not think whether it is possible to achieve these with the state’s budget. Experts have studied everything. All this will require 15% of the state’s budget. Don’t worry. I am a bania. I will not make promises without any calculation,” said Shah. “Release of election manifestos was reduced to a formality years ago but the BJP changed that. We call this sonkolpo patro (document of oath). These are not mere announcements for us. This document is based on our dream to create Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal),” said Shah. He spoke at length on the state’s rich heritage and contribution of great Bengalis to art, culture and history. While taking some of the names, Shah mentioned founders of two Dalit Hindu communities -- the Rajbanshis of north Bengal and the Matuas of south Bengal -- whose support is crucial for both the TMC and the BJP. During his trip to Thakurnagar last month, Shah announced an array of sops for the Matuas who are a part of the backward Namasudra community that can influence poll results in around 80 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. The BJP has sworn to overthrow the TMC government by winning more than 200 seats. “A resident of Gujarat with a resident of Madhya Pradesh by his (right) side, releases a manifesto and then makes a full speech in Hindi to create a #ShonarBangla #BengalElections2021,” Derek O’Brien, leader of the TMC in the Rajya Sabha, tweeted on Sunday evening, referring to Shah, who hails from Gujarat and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya who comes from MP. Some of the key promises in the manifesto are 33% reservation for women in government jobs, annual assistance of ₹10,000 to 1.8 million farmers, annual assistance of ₹6,000 and mechanised boats for fishermen, medical insurance under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, zero infiltration across the international border, assistance of ₹10,000 for five years for refugees, a literary award similar to the Nobel Prize and named after Tagore, a film award styled after the Oscars and named after Satyajit Ray, and a monthly pension of ₹3,000 for widows. Political analyst and columnist Suvashis Maitra said, “If the BJP is capable of all this then it should tell people whether such projects have been implemented in Assam and Tripura. A lot of Bengalis live in these two states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/caa-roll-out-1-job-per-family-on-bjp-manifesto-for-bengal-101616351745712.html
22-03-2021||India||PM to launch ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” campaign via video conferencing on the occasion of World Water Day on Monday, an official statement said on Sunday.The Jal Shakti Abhiyan is the Jal Shakti ministry’s flagship water-conservation campaign. The next leg of the programme, dubbed “catch the rain where it falls, when it falls”, will be rolled out across the country’s 734 districts covering over 600,000 villages.It will be implemented between March 22 and November 30, covering the monsoon period in the country.During the campaign, geotagging of all water bodies throughout the nation will be carried out, which shall form the basis for assessment of the rejuvenation efforts for water bodies across the country, an official said on condition of anonymity.According to data from the state-run policy think tank. NITI Aayog, nearly 600 million Indians face “high to extreme water stress” and the country’s water demand is likely to double by 2030, potentially costing a 6% loss in gross domestic product by 2050.The programme will be rolled out across the country’s 734 districts covering over 600,000 villages. Under the scheme, the government focuses on rainwater harvesting and water conservation, including initiatives such as renovation of traditional water bodies and tanks, reuse of water and recharge structures watershed development and afforestation in 256 districts.“In the first phase interventions were made in 10,104,338 water conservation and rainwater harvesting projects 7,536,381 renovation of traditional and other water bodies, 7,485,025 reuse and recharge structures and 9,696,381 watershed development,” minister of state for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria said recently, quoting figures from his ministry.India sustains 18% of the world’s population and 15% of global livestock with just about 4% of global fresh water resources. India’s most water-stressed blocks are in Tamil Nadu (541) followed by Rajasthan (218), Uttar Pradesh (139) and Telangana (137).On average India receives 1,170mm of rainfall, most of it during the summer monsoon months, but only 10-20% of that is currently tapped. Teams of central government officials will visit each district to sensitise and motivate the public to undertake water harvesting and conservation measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-launch-jal-shakti-abhiyan-catch-the-rain-101616351686222.html
22-03-2021||India||Ahead of Mahakumbh, Centre raises Covid flag||The Centre has raised concern about the potential surge of Covid-19 cases during the upcoming Mahakumbh and directed the Uttarakhand government to put in place stringent measures to control the spread of the viral illness at the religious congregation scheduled to begin in Haridwar on April 1.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to state chief secretary Om Prakash “strongly highlighting the concerns raised by the high level central team in its visit to Uttarakhand and about the need of stringent measures to control the spread of Covid19 during Kumbh Mela”, the Union health ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The development comes a day after Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat assured devotees that all “unnecessary” restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic will be removed for the event, and asserted that “faith is stronger than fear”. The CM’s statement also comes a time several states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, have introduced restrictions on gatherings and other curbs to stem the viral outbreak. The director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr SK Singh, led the high level central team that visited Uttarakhand on March 16-17, 2021, to review the medical and public health preparedness measures undertaken by the state for the event. Bhushan, in his letter, pointed out that at least 12 states in the country have reported a spike in the daily number of Covid-19 cases in the past few weeks, and that pilgrims who are likely to visit Haridwar for the congregation could also be from among the affected states. There is a “potential of an upsurge in cases in the local population after the auspicious Shahi Snan days during the Kumbh Mela”, the statement read, referring to the Hindu ritual of taking a holy bath in river Ganga. States such as Maharashta, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh accounted for 77.7% of the new cases on Saturday.The health secretary also said the daily coronavirus testing of 55,000 people in Haridwar was not enough given the large numbers of pilgrims expected, and that cases were already rising. “This positivity rate has the potential to rapidly turn into an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh,” Bhushan said. Despite a raging pandemic, at least 30 million people are expected to attend the curtailed Mahakumbh (one-month-long), believed to be the largest religious congregation held every 12 years. Normally, 120 million pilgrims attend the congregation that is usually a four-month-long event.  Among other measures that the Centre has advised Uttarakhand to put in place during the event are to ensure that Union health ministry’s standard operating procedures issued for the Kumbh are strictly followed, scale up testing in potential high transmission areas, and continue periodic testing of frontline workers before and after the shahi snan days. The advisory further states that in case of a sudden surge or a super-spreader event (when one infected individual goes on to infect several others), the state administration should promptly send samples for genome sequencing. This could help monitor if the outbreak is due to a variant that may be more infective than the predominant type of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Much like the trend in the rest of the country, Uttarakhand has been seeing a resurgence of cases in the past month, in what the experts say could be the beginning of second wave of infections. In the past week, the state reported 80 cases a day on average – a rise of 174% from the 29 cases a day (seven-day average) it was reporting in the week ending February 25. Uttarakhand has so far reported over 98,000 cases, and has administered the coronavirus vaccine to 545,863 people, according to government data. Experts say following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is the mainstay of controlling disease transmission.“It has been well-established that wearing a mask cuts down the transmission risk by about 85%, which is why government has been trying to promote wearing of a mask publicly in an aggressive manner. Other important measures are observing hand-hygiene and maintaining physical distancing,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research, said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mahakumbh-centre-raises-covid-flag-101616351685689.html
22-03-2021||India||After beating plates, MP govt to blow sirens to create awareness about Covid-19||The Madhya Pradesh state government will blow a siren on March 23 after one year of beating thalis to make people aware of the surge in Covid-19 cases, said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The chief minister said the state government is going to introduce Sankalp Abhiyan from March 23 to ensure the use of mask and social distancing. “On this day, a siren will be blown in every district at 11 AM and 7 PM and people will be requested to stop for 2 minutes to take a pledge of using masks and maintaining social distance,” said Chouhan. He said masks and social distancing were the best way to contain the spread of the virus. “Schools from classes 1 to 8 will remain closed in Madhya Pradesh amid a spurt in Covid-19 cases. In such an adverse condition, we can’t take the risk of opening schools,” said Chouhan. Earlier, school education minister Inder Singh Parmar had announced the opening of schools from Classes 1 to 8 from April 1. However, Congress took a jibe at the BJP-led state government for taking a non-serious decision to contain the spread. Former minister and Congress MLA PC Sharma said, “The government is not serious about Covid-19 which resulted in a number of positive cases increasing again. By imposing night curfew and blowing a siren, they thought that the virus will be killed like they did last year by beating thalis.” Instead of such an insane decision, they should come up with some serious steps to contain the spread of the virus, he added. After an increase in Covid-19 cases, the state government imposed a one–day lockdown on Sunday in three districts –Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur. Schools and colleges will remain closed from March 21 to 31 in these three districts. On Saturday, 1322 Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-beating-plates-mp-govt-to-blow-sirens-to-create-awareness-about-covid19-101616351566979.html
22-03-2021||India||Mansukh Hiran murder solved, Sachin Vaze prime accused: Maha ATS||The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) arrested a policeman and a bookie in connection with the alleged murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, an official said on Sunday, adding that suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze was being treated as prime accused in the case that the agency “has solved”.The two accused, identified as policeman Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gaur, were arrested late on Saturday, an ATS official said. However, the agency did not share any details of what the investigation revealed.Hiran’s wife, at the time of filing an FIR, raised suspicion about Vaze’s involvement in her husband’s death. In a press statement on Sunday, ATS said Vaze was being treated as the prime accused.Maharashtra ATS DIG Shivdeep Lande said: “The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) have solved Mansukh Hiran’s death case.”Shinde is a convict in the 2006 Lakhan Bhaiya fake encounter case and he came out of jail on furlough last year, an official said, adding that Shinde was in touch with Vaze since then.“Sachin Vaze is a prime accused in the Hiran murder case. He had played a key role. During the probe, the ATS found that Gaur had provided five SIM cards to API Vaze and Shinde for the crime. Shinde used to help Vaze in his illegal activities,” the official added. He said ATS was investigating if more people were involved in the case.The Centre on Saturday suo motu handed over the probe into Hiran’s death to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing a car laden with explosives found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month.NIA will take over the case from the Maharashtra ATS, which has been investigating the possible murder of Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to the Scorpio that was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks, and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis, outside their Antilia residence on February 25.NIA arrested suspended police officer Vaze on March 13 for purportedly planting the explosives in the Scorpio. ATS has also questioned Vaze over his role in Hiran’s death after it came to light through the statement of Hiran’s wife, Vimla, that the two knew each other.ATS arrested the two accused in the case hours after it was announced that the probe into the case of Hiran’s death was being transferred to the central agency.“The mystery of the highly sensitive Mansukh Hiran murder case has been solved. I heartily salute all my colleagues (in ATS), who had put efforts through day and night and complete the investigation in a lawful manner to achieve the result.

22-03-2021||India||Karnataka farmers should lay siege on Bengaluru just like Delhi: Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday asked the farming community in Karnataka to lay siege to Bengaluru with tractors, just like it was done in Delhi, in protest against the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre.“You have to make a Delhi in Bengaluru… and surround the city from all directions,” Tikait said while addressing a protest rally in Shivamogga, about 320 km from Bengaluru on Sunday.“The protest must be done with tractors only,” he added.The farmers from all across the country, mainly from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament last year.“Unless the three laws are repealed, and there is a law related to the MSP, you need to continue this agitation in Karnataka as well,” Tikait said.He added that agitation will have to continue against several contentious laws that aim at “grabbing lands from farmers” and forcing them to work as daily wagers in factories. Tikait said there were many such bills in the pipeline relating to milk, electricity, seeds and fertilizers, which were also being prepared to be introduced.He claimed that the privitisation of nationalised banks will result in farmers who have availed loans through Kisan Credit Cards, by pledging lands, will be forced to part with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-farmers-should-lay-siege-on-bengaluru-just-like-delhi-rakesh-tikait-101616350549738.html
22-03-2021||India||Ashoka, its ex-professors move to salvage situation||Ashoka University and the two professors who resigned from it last week, political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta and noted economist Arvind Subramanian, on Sunday released a joint statement that sought to resolve a brewing controversy over the departures, with the varsity expressing “deep regret” at the recent events and acknowledging “lapses in institutional processes”.The statement was issued jointly by Ashoka University chancellor Rudrangshu Mukherjee, vice-chancellor Malabika Sarkar, chairman, Board of Trustees, Ashish Dhawan, Mehta, and Subramanian. “We acknowledge that there have been some lapses in institutional processes which we will work to rectify in consultation with all stakeholders. This will reaffirm our commitment to academic autonomy and freedom which have always been at the core of the Ashoka University ideals,” it read.“Pratap and Arvind would like to emphasize that Ashoka University is one of the most important projects in Indian higher education. They are sad to be leaving Ashoka, especially its outstanding students and faculty. They continue to believe strongly that Ashoka University should embody a liberal vision and commitment to academic freedom and autonomy. And they remain lifelong friends and well-wishers of the institution and are committed to its success wherever they are. They remain available for advice and consultation to the University in the future,” the statement said.Mukherjee separately wrote to faculty and students, saying the institution’s founders have never interfered with academic freedom.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday — he resigned on March 15 — and caused a stir among students and faculty of the university, and the academic community across India and overseas. “After a meeting with Founders, it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politic that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the University, I resign,” he said in his resignation letter. On Friday morning, his colleague and former chief economic adviser, Subramanian, resigned saying he was “devastated” by Mehta’s resignation, and it reflected the university’s inability to protect “academic freedom and expression”.Mehta also independently wrote to students at the university on Sunday, addressing them as “superheroes” and urged them not to “press” on the matter. “The underlying circumstances that led to the resignation will not change for the foreseeable future, in my case, at any rate. So, I must close this chapter. I urge you not to press on this matter. I know you will be disappointed. But if I may exercise one last bit of professorial discretion: your mission is larger than the fate of two Professors,” he wrote in the letter.“I hope the Trustees and Faculty will work with you to secure your renewed trust and confidence,” he added.Mukherjee and Dhawan also separately wrote to students, alumni, and parents on Sunday, saying that Ashoka University “will remain committed to academic freedom and intellectual independence”, and that the founders don’t “have even an iota of commercial or business interest” in the university. “I know that this week has been full of anguish but it is in these moments that it becomes critical for us to come together and move forward. I admit that the departures of Professors Mehta and Subramanian make us all feel a tremendous loss but there is nothing for you to fear. As an institution, we are committed to freedom in every aspect. Even as we evolve, this commitment will never fade,” Dhawan said in its letter.In his letter, chancellor Mukherjee said the founders never “interfered with academic freedom” at Ashoka University. The board of trustees also met the students’ body and the alumni council a day ahead of a two-day boycott of classes scheduled to be observed by the students. The strike was not called off by the time this report was filed||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-were-lapses-in-our-process-ashoka-university-on-mehta-subramanian-exits-101616307583123.html

22-03-2021||India||Number of pedallers rise in Bengaluru, but not enough space for cycling||The cycling community in Bengaluru may be growing but the city has perhaps not fared well in providing cycle-centric infrastructure to its residents. Even as the newly-developed cycle lanes in the Central Business District (CBD) appear to be a hit, riders feel the overall number of tracks available remains insufficient to enable them to pedal without running into traffic or pedestrians.Satya Shankran, Bengaluru’s first ‘Bicycle Mayor’ and founding member of Praja-Raag, a city-based citizens’ group, said the pace of the construction of bicycle lanes was pretty slow.Speaking to HT, Shankran said that as per the comprehensive mobility plan of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Pallike (BBMP), the original plan was to develop 174 km of cycle tracks in the city. “We took up the matter with the authorities and got it changed to developing 600 km in the next 10 years. But this is still not enough,” he said.He said the city has 14,000 km of roads, of which only around 2,000 km are 15 m wide or more and ideal for cycling. “Going by this, the current plan provides only 30% of the roads for cycle tracks. Even if we agree on these plans, the pace of development is slow,” he said.Over the years, the cycling community in the city has grown at a steady pace. While there is no official data on this, according to CycleToWork, an app that crowd sources information in Bengaluru, the use of cycle for commuting doubled between 2017 and 2020.While it was expected that the ridership would drop during the pandemic, it, however, increased threefold.Rajesh Jain, a software developer from Marathahalli, said one of the biggest problems with cycling tracks in the city is lack of continuity. “I understand that cycle lanes are present in the city but there needs to be a plan for a seamless track in the city. As of now, they are constructing tracks wherever smart city projects are coming up. But I’ve noticed that they are in patches. There should be a vision to connect the city using cycle lanes.”Meanwhile, the BBMP is planning to include cycle lanes in Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BSCL)’s plans to develop 35 km of roads in CBD. The latest cycle track being built by BSCL is the 5 km-long from Minsk Square to Basaveshwara Circle. DULT commissioner V Manjula said the department is conducting a field study to identify roads where lanes could be created. “DULT has submitted drawings for the roads already. It is up to the BBMP to take up projects.”DULT commissioner V Manjula said the department is conducting a field study to identify roads where these lanes could be created. “DULT has submitted drawings for the roads already. It is up to the BBMP to take up these projects.”Manjula added that the work on a 35 km-long cycle track between Silk Board and Lowry Junction, as part of the Non-Motorised Transit project, is underway.The DULT commissioner also said that the department has received crowdsourced maps and data on user preferences to identify new routes. It is also using the CycleToWork app for data on cycle rides by employees belonging to 156 organisations to develop infrastructure.Urban expert V Ravichandar said it is important to develop hubs every 5 km in the city with all facilities to ensure people do not have to travel long distances. “Once the need for long-distance travel within the city is limited, we shall see more people walking or using cycles and creating cycle lanes would encourage this further,” he said.According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, in 2019, Bengaluru reported 47 accidents involving bicycles. At least 43 cyclists lost their lives while 29 others sustained severe injuries during this period.“We are also keen on getting the cycle lanes because it prevents accidents and encourages people to use bicycles. We are supporting this effort,” Ravikante Gowda, joint commissioner of police, traffic, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-of-pedallers-on-rise-in-city-but-not-enough-space-for-cycling-101616092638051.html
22-03-2021||Today's||India must leverage the Indus Water Treaty for progress||The Indus Commissioners of India and Pakistan will meet in New Delhi on March 23 and discuss, not surprisingly, concerns over the designs of hydropower projects on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir. This is the 116th meeting since the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) was signed in 1960.Coincidentally, it comes in the backdrop of Pakistan army chief QJ Bajwa call for creating a “conducive environment” for the resumption of dialogue, and the possibility of foreign ministers of both countries meeting on the sideline of the Heart of Asia conference in Dushanbe later this month.A notable feature of IWT was the establishment of Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), with one commissioner from each country to implement the treaty as well as settle differences and disputes by agreement, neutral expert, court of arbitration or any other manner as agreed. The commissioners have met at least once a year except in 2020, when the meeting was cancelled due to Covid-19.India has shown remarkable compliance with the treaty. One can equally argue that India has often miscalculated its generosity. India’s leadership and water development planners in the 1970s lost much ground to Pakistan on the interpretation of IWT when it came to various projects on the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum and Chenab). India conceded to Pakistan’s objections, for example on the Salal hydroelectricity project and then later the Tulbul navigation. The adjustment on the height of the Salal resulted in huge siltation of the dam and the Tulbul waterway even till today remains shelved. India felt that the spirit of the treaty was far more important to the overall peace and security in the region. For Pakistan, the format of the treaty gives it a context to question many of the projects. A prosperous and developed Kashmir increasingly assimilated to mainstream India is anathema to Pakistan leadership and it used the treaty to block progress.Interestingly, the framework for arbitration would not have come about had it not been for Zulfikar Bhutto, the Oxford-educated lawyer who had joined Pakistan president Ayub Khan’s cabinet as the minister of water, power, communication and industry. Bhutto played an active role in the final phase of the Indus treaty negotiations but more significantly, his statement in the United Nations (UN), as a member of the Pakistan delegation, drew a crucial link to arbitration. A Soviet draft resolution on the question of defining aggression was put forward in the UN General Assembly in October 1957, and Bhutto said that “economic aggression or indirect aggression is perpetrated if lower riparian are deprived of natural rights in use of rivers which flow through two or more countries.”The fact, however, remains that the provisions of the treaty entitled for India on the western rivers remain woefully unutilised both in terms of storage capacity and hydropower generation. After the effective abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the current government, which realises water as a mean to socioeconomic ends, has fast-tracked a number of multi-purpose river projects in Kashmir.Recently, the Cabinet approved ₹5842 crore investment for the 850 MW Ratle project. The NHPC expects to install 3800 MW of projects with an investment worth ₹2,300 crore for J&K. It is estimated that hydropower on the Chenab will triple in the coming years. India has done well in recent times to communicate, in no uncertain terms, to the international community and even to the World Bank, as the third party to the treaty, that riparian sympathy towards Pakistan is misplaced.The PIC format has become rather predictable, with Pakistan monotonously accusing India of water harm. Perhaps, it’s time to infuse some fresh thinking. India can take the lead by expanding the debate to benefit sharing such as waterways, water wastage, water efficiency or even setting up a study group to assess socio-economic gains and losses from the Indus basin in the coming years. This can help the farming and business community in Pakistan to build pressure on their establishment to adopt a more reasonable approach. Uttam Sinha is with the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-must-leverage-the-indus-water-treaty-for-progress-101616423937635.html
22-03-2021||Editorials||A dark nexus in Mumbai | HT Editorial||It may have started with 20 loose gelatin sticks found in an abandoned SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, but the case has blown up, and now, the fate of state home minister Anil Deshmukh hangs in the balance. Former Mumbai police commissioner, Param Vir Singh, has accused Mr Deshmukh of running an extortion racket by reportedly setting monthly targets of ₹100 crore for certain policemen (including Sachin Vaze, arrested for his role in the SUV case). A suspended Mumbai police inspector has now written to the home department making corruption allegations against Mr Singh. All sides are in the dock, for key questions remain unanswered. Why did Mr Singh only raise his voice against the home minister’s reported corruption after being shunted out of his post? Why was Mr Vaze, who had been suspended from the force for his role in an alleged custodial death, reinstated in 2020 and given an important post? Why is chief minister Uddhav Thackeray not ordering an immediate probe into the serious charges against Mr Deshmukh and seeking his resignation? And why is Sharad Pawar not acting against the home minister, who is his party’s representative in the state’s beleaguered coalition government?But the issue goes beyond the immediate. No major party in the state has focused on police reforms, a possible reflection of the complicity of all actors in systemic corruption. Until the police are kept insulated from political interference, whether in terms of postings or transfers, or in terms of their investigations, the two will forever remain in an unhealthy co-dependent relationship. As political scientist Milan Vaishnav has explained in the context of politics and crime, there is a supply-side issue, where individuals (and this can extend to mean corrupt cops) seek political protection to preserve and expand wealth, and a demand side issue, where parties depend on illegal finance (and this takes the form of extracting resources from state institutions such as the police and citizens). What is needed is a charter of wide-ranging reforms in the criminal justice system that could lead to quick judicial decisions (such as on Vaze’s role in the alleged custodial killing; instead, the matter is still in court, 18 years later); in the political finance regime; and in watchdog institutions, which should strongly enforce the law and expose wrongdoings. Maharashtra must address the nexus of politics, police and crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-dark-nexus-in-mumbai-hteditorial-101616423933413.html
22-03-2021||Editorials||In Indian politics, the gender dimension | HT Editorial||From the trenches of India’s unequal democracy, there is both good news and bad news. The good news is that from being considered invisible, women are finally being seen as an empowered, autonomous political constituency of their own. Both surveys and anecdotal evidence indicate that women are playing a crucial role in determining electoral outcomes — and they do this on the overall performance of the government and the specific measures outlined for women’s welfare.From Narendra Modi’s focus on toilet construction and distribution of gas cylinders to Nitish Kumar’s announcement of prohibition and cycles to school-going girl students to Mamata Banerjee’s cash hand-outs to young and unmarried girl students, astute politicians were quick to recognise the power of the women’s vote. In the upcoming assembly elections, parties have made promises with an eye on the women vote — from direct income allowances and pensions to homemakers to reservations in jobs to benefits for women from marginalised groups. This is positive. Women’s labour, particularly at home, has long gone unrecognised and unpaid and parties, today, are being forced to address it.But here is the bad news. This recognition of the power of the women’s vote has not translated into representation. The Trinamool Congress, to its credit, has fielded 17% women candidates, much lower than what equity would demand, but higher than other parties. To throw up the lack of winnability as an argument is a cop-out, for what is needed is political commitment to ensure that women are not just subjects of largesse but equal players in decision-making at leadership levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-indian-politics-the-gender-dimension-hteditorial-101616423932169.html
