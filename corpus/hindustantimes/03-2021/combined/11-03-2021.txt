11-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 409 ha of mangroves in Alibag a reserved forest||As part of the forest department’s campaign to bring all mangrove forests in Maharashtra under the purview of section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 (IFA), 409 hectares (ha) of mangrove forests in Alibag taluka, Raigad district, were declared a ‘reserved forest’ via gazette notification on March 5. The move is in line with the Bombay high court’s directive to the government, which instructs the latter to hand over all mangrove areas on state land to the forest department for better conservation. Declaring areas as reserved forest grants them legal sanctity, and protects biodiversity by outlawing activities such as foraging, hunting and harvesting of natural resources in the earmarked boundaries. As per official estimates, there are 17,090 ha of mangrove forests in the entire state which are on government land. Of these, 10,632 ha have already been brought under the purview of the IFA in 2019, 2020 and 2021. A total of 2,066 ha of mangroves have been excluded from the purview due to community dependence on the land, officials clarified, while 4,392 hectares are “under process for declaration”. “This whole process starts by first declaring the mangrove site as a reserved forest under Section 4 of the Forest Act, which we had done even earlier, starting 2015. What follows, as per Sections 6 to 19 of the Forest Act, is the process of settlement of any rights that other parties may claim over the land. Following this, some portion of the land may be excluded from the final notification under Section 20,” said Virender Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell). Tiwari added, “In Alibag, we have settled all such claims and now 409 hectares are declared under Section 20, bringing the process to its final conclusion. There can now be no further accrual of rights to the land by any party.” However, a crucial step in this process -- handing over the land to the forest department -- also includes transferring possession of the land to the mangrove cell, which is pending by various government bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra409-ha-of-mangroves-in-alibag-a-reserved-forest-101615487015015.html

11-03-2021||Delhi||Victim’s wife planned South Delhi shooting||The shooting of a BSES contractual driver in his car in south Delhi’s Andrews Ganj on Wednesday was planned by his wife and her lover, who executed the attack, the Delhi Police said on Thursday after scanning footage from scores of CCTV cameras to identify the suspected gunman.The police on Wednesday arrested the suspected shooter, 23-year-old Rohan Kumar and apprehended the victim’s 41-year-old wife, Babita, on Thursday. Bhimraj was shot at outside the Andrews Ganj electricity grid office, under the jurisdiction of Defence Colony police station, around 9am on Wednesday. He remains in a “critical” condition at AIIMS.Also Read: Two firing incidents in south Delhi; BSES contractual driver, policeman injured“Babita had conspired with Kumar to kill her husband after he learnt of her extramarital relationship. She funded nearly half of the ₹65,000 required for carrying out the crime,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south). Raids were also on to arrest a north Delhi resident who allegedly sold the gun to Kumar, the officer added.Thakur said Wednesday’s shooting was the attacker’s second attempt to kill Bhimraj in as many days. “He tried to shoot him in a park in Malviya Nagar, but failed due to the crowd,” the officer said.The police zeroed in on the suspect’s motorcycle registration plate using CCTV footage. This led them to a slum in north Delhi with nearly 10,000 houses, after which they enlisted the help of an insurance firm to track the phone number linked to the owner of the motorcycle.Once the owner was tracked, the police realised the vehicle was sold at least twice, but without legal transfer of ownership.By Wednesday evening, the police were able to nab Kumar, who was the last known owner of the motorcycle.The DCP said when Kumar first admitted to the crime, he came up with a cooked-up story about how he was seeking revenge against Bhimraj over a road rage incident over a month ago. However, Kumar confessed, after the police confronted about his call records, which allegedly showed extensive communication between the two suspects.“Kumar and Babita were in constant touch over the phone. Even after the shooting on Wednesday, he called her to find out if Bhimraj had died or not,” Thakur said.He said Kumar first met Babita at the beauty parlour that she owned in Khirki Extension late last year. “Bhimraj found out about the relationship on January 1. Thereafter, Babita alleged, Bhimraj would get drunk and beat her up,” the DCP said.While Bhimraj was in the intensive care unit (ICU), his brother Shiv Charan denied the allegations. “My brother liked to drink, but he did not hit his wife. When he got to know about her extramarital relationship, there was an argument between them. He wanted her to move her parlour to our neighbourhood in Chirag Delhi,” said Charan.The police said that about a fortnight ago, Kumar met Babita at her home where they planned to have Bhimraj killed.“Babita contributed ₹30,000 for the gun and Kumar borrowed another ₹35,000 from friends,” he said.On Wednesday morning, Kumar allegedly removed stickers from his motorcycle, twisted the number plates and went about conducting a quick reconnaissance of the crime spot before executing the crime. “Later, he dumped his shoes and clothes in a dustbin,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/victims-wife-planned-south-delhi-shooting-101615486287420.html

He wanted a refund of the license fee, paid to the government for sand extraction. According to the police, Wagh had obtained a license from the government in 2018 for sand mining and transportation. For this, he had paid ₹8.72 lakh. Wagh had started the sand excavation but had to stop it because of opposition by the locals. Due to the frequent protests by the villagers, Wagh suffered huge losses. After losing all hopes, Wagh then followed the matter with revenue authorities to get a refund of the license fee paid by him. But his efforts did not yield any results. Hence, he decided to end his life at the minister’s bungalow.“On Tuesday, he poured petrol on himself and tried to set himself ablaze in the hall of special executive officer of Royal Stone, the official residence of revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat,” said a police officer.However, the policemen present around stopped him.“Wagh was detained and taken to the police station.

11-03-2021||Chandigarh||J&K, Ladakh receive rain, snow; another spell likely on March 14||The Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh witnessed widespread rainfall in the plains and snowfall in the higher reaches throughout the day on Thursday. While the Srinagar-Jammu national highway was open on Thursday, authorities will close it for maintenance on Friday. “On March 12, no traffic will be allowed from either direction on the highway between Nashri and Jawahar Tunnel in view of the maintenance and repairing on the road,” the traffic department said. The Mughal Road, which connects south Kashmir with Jammu division and Srinagar-Sonmarg-Gumri Road, continues to remain closed due to snow accumulation and adverse road conditions.The precipitation has been attributed to a western disturbance in region. “As expected there was widespread rainfall in Kashmir and snow in the higher reaches and at scattered places in Ladakh, especially Zojila, Minamarg, Drass areas,” said director meteorological department Sonam Lotus.He said mild rainfall also took place in some parts of Jammu.“Light rainfall took place in Udhampur, Batote, Doda and Ramban areas,” he said, adding that the weather office expects precipitation to continue till Friday. “Light to moderate rainfall and thunderstorms are expected at scattered places in the next 36 hours,” Lotus said.The weather office has predicted erratic weather in Jammu and Kashmir for the next five days and urged farmers to avoid spraying during this period.Lotus said the weather on Saturday will be mostly dry.“Another spell is likely on March 14 and 15. There will be an overall improvement in weather conditions from March 16,” he said.The weather office has asked people to contact traffic authorities prior to undertaking journey on Srinagar-Jammu, Srinagar-Ladakh and other landslide and avalanche prone roads.“There are chances of blockage of road due to incessant rains and snow which may lead to landslides and avalanches on vulnerable spots on these routes,” he said.Rain and snow has hit parts of Kashmir valley intermittently since Sunday, bringing down the temperatures. The maximum temperature in Srinagar on Thursday was 6.4°C while it was 6.8°C at night. In Pahalgam and Gulmarg, the minimum night temperatures plunged to 1.6°C and -1.5°C, respectively.The minimum temperature in Leh was -4.7°C while Kargil shivered at -4.0°C.

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vasai Road to get 2 platforms to boost connect to South India||To boost Maharashtra’s railway connectivity with South India, Western Railway (WR) is planning to construct platforms for outstation trains at Vasai Road railway station. WR is contemplating construction of two platforms for outstation trains at the Vasai Road railway yard. The land required for these has been identified and surveyed by senior WR officials. The decision to construct these platforms is in response to demands of passengers residing in Vasai and Palghar district, who have asked for train connectivity with southern India. It will also decongest the presently-saturated outstation terminuses at Bandra and Mumbai Central. The land where these platforms presently deals with transportation of freight materials and will be made available to WR after the construction of the dedicated freight corridor (DFC), scheduled to be completed in 2022. East to west connectivity at the Vasai Road railway station will also be provided by the WR. “We have surveyed the area and identified the construction work that will be required for the operation of outstation trains towards south India. There has been a long demand for operating trains from WR towards Hyderabad and other prominent cities.” said a senior WR official. The platforms will be connected to the suburban railway stations as WR is also looking to operate local trains between Vasai and Panvel from the outstation platforms. However, the project requires approval from the Indian Railways and may be sent to the railway ministry later this year, following approvals from WR. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) is also working on a project of operating local trains between Vasai and Panvel railway stations and has proposed the construction of 11 new railway stations between the two stations. Apart from the construction of new railway stations, other proposals include making changes in the present railway stations, increasing the height of AC and changing the present signalling equipment. Railway expert and retired member of the Railway board Subodh Jain said operating outstation trains from Vasai could be a challenge. “Operating outstation trains from Vasai Road could be cumbersome and difficult as the train links would be from Vasai- Diva-Panvel. A full-fledged terminal would be much more helpful.” said Jain, who has previously served as chief administrative officer of WR’s construction department and general manager of CR. Passenger associations have welcomed the proposed platforms. “It is very difficult for people residing in Vasai, Mira Road to travel all the way to Dadar or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to board a train to South India. We have been demanding the operation of trains for a long time. This is a welcome move.” said Subash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. WR had first proposed the construction of a terminus at Vasai Road in 2013, when the plan did not materialise. The project was proposed again in 2017. In 2018, WR announced plans of constructing an outstation terminal at Vasai Road railway station. Construction of the terminal requires private and government land. The proposed new terminus would have four platforms, three stabling lines for outstation trains, and a new terminus building. The project was originally scheduled to be completed by 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vasai-road-to-get-2-platforms-to-boost-connect-to-south-india-101615485935749.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Akhtar’s defamation case: Kangana Ranaut moves sessions court||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut has moved the sessions court, challenging, the bailable warrant issued by a metropolitan magistrate against her for failing to personally appear for the hearing of a defamation complaint filed against her by lyricist Javed Akhtar. Confirming the development, Ranaut’s lawyer, advocate Rizwan Siddiquee said, “We have challenged the process issued by the metropolitan magistrate, Andheri court. The matter is now pending for revision before the sessions court.”“It is our claim before the sessions court that mandatory compliance of section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc) was not followed in the matter, as the four witnesses named by Akhtar, in his complaint, have not been examined on oath. Without the said mandatory compliance process was issued under section 204 CrPC,” Siddiquee said.A metropolitan magistrate court had on March 1, issued a bailable warrant against Ranaut for failing to appear for hearing on the defamation complaint filed Akhtar. The court had on February 1 issued summons to Ranaut to appear before the court on March 1. The actor failed to appear in person but her lawyer, Siddiquee, appeared on her behalf.For the non-appearance of the actress, Akhtar’s legal team sought a bailable warrant against the actress.Akhtar in his complaint has alleged that Ranaut had made several defamatory statements about him in an interview given to a news channel in July 2020, alleging that the 76-year-old writer/lyricist runs a suicide gang in Bollywood and he had threatened her to settle her dispute with actor Hrithik Roshan, failing which she will be compelled to commit suicide.Akhtar has claimed that her claims were entirely false and the statements have harmed his reputation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/akhtars-defamation-case-kangana-ranaut-moves-sessions-court-101615485694874.html
11-03-2021||Lucknow||UP needs to strike balance to meet fiscal challenge||: The Uttar Pradesh government, which presented a large budget of ₹5.50 lakh crore for 2021-2022, faces the challenge of striking a balance between meeting the committed expenditures and funding the budgetary allocations in coming months as the state inches close to the 2022 assembly elections.As a large chunk of revenue receipts are spent on payment of salaries, pension and debt servicing, the state government is left with limited funds for welfare schemes and development projects scheduled to be completed before the 2022 polls.“The state government spends more than 70% of revenue receipts on payment of salaries and pension to employees and debt servicing. It is left with hardly any financial space to fund welfare schemes or development projects,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor at department of economics, Lucknow University. The state government’s budget analysis also indicates it is spending 61.3% of revenue receipts on payment of salary, pension and interest. It is spending 17.3% of revenue receipts on debt servicing. The state government’s total receipts are estimated to be ₹5,06,181.84 crore in 2021-2022. Its total expenditure during the same period is estimated to be ₹5,50,270.78 crore. The fiscal deficit in 2021-2022 is estimated to be ₹90,729.80 crore, about 4.17% of the projected GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product).“The state government has presented a high deficit budget for 2021-22. It has, however, not given any indication about measures to meet this deficit. Although no taxes have been proposed in the state budget, the state government may resort to imposing more taxes to meet the budgetary deficit,” said former Rajya Sabha MP and senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari.The state government’s GSDP projections for 2021-22 have also come into question. The state’s budgetary estimates indicated the GSDP to be about ₹17.91 lakh crore in 2020-2021. The revised estimates indicate an increase in the GSDP to ₹19.40 lakh crore in 2020-21 despite the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the economy. “The projected GSDP of ₹21.73 lakh crore in 2021-22 appears unrealistic. In 2020-21, the budget estimates indicated the GSDP to be ₹17.91 lakh crore. It may have come down to ₹16.50 lakh crore in view of the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the economy. The state may need a much higher growth rate to reach close to the GSDP projections,” said Tyagi.Uttar Pradesh’s indebtedness is also increasing year after year. It is estimated to go up nearly three times from ₹209227.32 crore in 2011-2012 to ₹611161.85 crore on March 31, 2022. The state government claims its total indebtedness will remain at 28.1% of GSDP in 2021-22 against 28.8% of GSDP as per budgetary estimates for 2020-21 and 29.2% as per the revised estimates for 2020-21. It, however, needs to pay attention to the issue. “The state government may not fall into a debt trap under the prevailing situation. It will need to pay attention towards the growing indebtedness as this will add to the burden of debt servicing in the coming years,” said Tyagi.The state government had estimated its total receipts to be about ₹5.0 lakh crore in 2020-21. Its receipts appear to come down to about ₹4.0 lakh crore due to the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. This includes a shortfall of ₹54.24 thousand crore in state’s share in the central taxes during the period. Its expenditure in 2020-21 is estimated to come down by ₹75.15 thousand crore under revenue expenditure head and ₹22.95 thousand crore under capital expenditure head. The state government proposes capital expenditure of ₹1,55,140 crore in 2021-22.“The state government though increased size of annual budget in 2021-2022, it is only 7.3% higher than the previous year. It’s expenditure on revenue account remained nearly the same in 2020-21 and projections for 2021-22. A higher projection in capital expenditure head is certainly good for the state,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-needs-to-strike-balance-to-meet-fiscal-challenge-101615485514210.html

11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Tax-free import of Iranian apples has Kashmiri growers worried||Tax-free import of Iranian apples through Afghanistan and the Wagah border could adversely affect the Kashmiri apple business in India, say local growers.Growers say the quantum of Iranian apples entering India was increasing by the day, which could eat into the Kashmiri apple’s market share in the coming years unless the imported fruit is taxed. The Union territory’s horticulture department has already flagged the issue with the Centre. Each year, around 1.5 to 2 lakh metric tons of apples are stored in cold stores across Kashmir in an effort to heap rich dividends during the off season, especially March, April and May when their market price soars. Ajaz Ahmad, a grower from Shopian in south Kashmir, said. “Tax-free apples coming via Afghanistan have had a negative impact on the sale of the Kashmiri variety. The government should shut down this free trade as it will ruin the prospects of Kashmiri growers. We had been expecting to sell our apples in cold storages for ₹130 to ₹150 per kilogram but the duty-free apples from Iran have brought down the prices.”Horticulture is the backbone of the J&K economy as it contributes around 8% towards the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Union Territory besides generating employment avenues for the younger generation. As per official data, seven lakh farming families comprising 35 lakh people are directly or indirectly associated with the sector. At present, Kashmir produces around 23 to 24 lakh metric tons of fruit.Cold storages may become defunct: BusinessmenKashmir Cold Store Association president Maajid A Wafai said, “For the last three months, we have been going from pillar to post to get import of apples via Afghanistan stopped, to no avail. On one hand, the Prime Minister is asking people to become self-reliant and on the other hand trade that has been flourishing in the region for decades is being destroyed.” Wafai said growers are not opposed to importing apples from Iran or other countries. “Our only demand is that duty or cess should be imposed on apples coming from Iran via Afghanistan. If growers do not get a good price for fruit outside the state mandis, they will stop using cold stores. A large number of cold storage facilities have cropped up across the Valley in the last few years and hundreds of people will loose their livelihoods should the storages become defunct.”Kashmir Valley Fruit Growers’ Union president Bashir Ahmad Bashir said, “We have also raised the issue with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Once tax-free apples from Iran reach here, Kashmiri growers will suffer losses. At present, apples are not in season but we want to level the playing field for the next season.”Nothing to worry about: Horticulture director A senior manager, working at a cold store in north Kashmir’s Baramulla, said, “We still have 5,000 to 8,000 metric tons at the store. Now, growers have starting sending their fruit to different mandis. They did not send the produce earlier as the Iranian apples that had come via Afghanistan had de-stabilised the market.”Recently, Kashmiri fruit growers and owners of cold stores and inter-state fruit and vegetable unions of hilly states (Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) had met in Pulwama.Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat said the Kashmiri apple is being sold in the Kashmiri market for ₹120 per kilogram.“At present, there are no Iranian apples in mandis.A very limited number of trucks had come,” he said. Bhat said apples from Kashmir were fetching a good price in different mandis.There is nothing to worry about this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/taxfree-import-of-iranian-apples-has-kashmiri-growers-worried-101615485095645.html
11-03-2021||Lucknow||Covid vaccination in full swing, crosses 22-lakh mark in UP||: Covid vaccines have been administered to 22,49,925 beneficiaries in Uttar Pradesh till now at an average of 41,665 per day since the inoculation started on January 16, according to the state health department data.While 17,11,376 beneficiaries have received their first dose, 5,38,549 got their second and final dose too. Among the second dose recipients are 5,12,107 health workers, who account for 68.1% of the 7,45,218 health workers who got the first dose.Initially, Uttar Pradesh was vaccinating beneficiaries two days a week, but since the last week, six-day vaccination is being done.The total beneficiaries include health workers, frontline workers, people above 60 years of age and those between 45 and 60 years with co-morbidity. About 9.5 lakh health workers were listed for the vaccination and officials said the target was almost achieved. In some cases, certain health workers did not fall in the category of those to be vaccinated due to health conditions.“In certain, health conditions vaccination is not recommended. But not many health workers would be left out from vaccination in the state. We have almost achieved our target,” said a senior health official.Efforts are also going on to increase the vaccination percentage among the elderly. In a recent order, the National Health mission has asked all the chief medical officers in the state to engage accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in the districts to motivate the elderly and those between 45 and 60 years of age with co-morbidity to get themselves vaccinated.Experts said the elderly were showing enthusiasm in getting the vaccine jab and they just needed a smooth process and easy access.“The elderly started making queries via phone call even before the vaccination in their category began. They are turning up in good numbers every day. Despite a holiday, 140 of them got the vaccine jab today (at one centre),” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, head of the Aastha Geriatric Centre, one of the private health centres facilitating vaccination in Lucknow.Over 1,000 elderly took the anti-Covid shot on Thursday against a total count of 1378 beneficiaries, who reported to the vaccination centres in Lucknow on the day.“The way the elderly are responding to vaccination, we hope to complete target for March without delay,” said Dr MK Singh, the officer incharge of vaccination in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-vaccination-in-full-swing-crosses-22-lakh-mark-in-up-101615484974139.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||BJP alleges ‘scam’ in DTC bus procurement process, AAP refutes claim||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday in the state assembly alleged irregularities in the Delhi government’s procurement of new buses, a claim that transport minister Kailash Gahlot refuted, saying that the government saved ₹225 crore in the same process. “In March 2020, the government floated a tender for procurement of 1,000 low floor buses at a cost of ₹875 crore, which included a warranty for three years. But, four months later, it floated a separate tender for ₹3,500 crore only for annual maintenance of these buses. The cost of annual maintenance comes out to be more than the actual cost of the buses,” Rohini BJP MLA Vijender Gupta said in the assembly.Gupta’s accusation drew a sharp reaction from minister Gahlot who challenged the BJP to stop the government from procuring more buses if it could. “The decision for two tenders for procurement of buses and comprehensive annual maintenance was taken by the Cabinet in July 2019. In fact, let me tell you that we rather saved ₹225 crore on annual maintenance by bringing down the per kilometre rate from ₹48.50 to ₹45.50 only by negotiating with the manufacturers,” he said. Gahlot explained that warranty and annual maintenance cost are not the same thing and cannot be used interchangeably.“The warranty period of the buses did not include 71 things that were covered in the provision for annual maintenance. So, we saved a lot of money. Gupta has a habit of filing complaints every time the Delhi government tries to procure new buses. But the truth is that this government under chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s leadership will continue to buy buses and I challenge the BJP to come and stop us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-alleges-scam-in-dtc-bus-procurement-process-aap-refutes-claim-101615484914178.html

The court also noted that trial courts have been specifically directed not to pass any adverse orders during the pandemic. “On March 16, 2020, when the matter was fixed before the family court, the pandemic has already set in and the functioning of courts was also severely restricted. In fact, the courts subordinate to this court were specifically instructed not to pass any adverse orders against those who could not appear either physically or in proceedings through video conferencing due to the pandemic,” the bench said.Since the woman or her counsel did not appear before the family court on March 16, 2020, she was declared ex parte and the family court fixed the matter for hearing through video conferencing.As the woman did not appear in those proceedings, the court passed an ex parte judgment and granting divorce.The high court, while setting this aside, said though the woman’s counsel did not appear before the family court on March 16, 2020, but “we are of the view that in the light of the then prevailing circumstances, the family court should have waited for the woman to appear and contest the proceedings, rather than hurriedly proceeding ex parte against her”.The bench sent the case back to the family court and asked the court to hear it from the stage when the woman, through her counsel, was declared ex parte.The couple got married in February 2013 and was living separately since March 2013. They have a son and the husband had filed the divorce petition alleging cruelty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcsets-aside-divorce-as-woman-could-not-appear-in-case-due-to-pandemic-101615484855363.html

Ghosh was nominated as the CPI (M) candidate from the Jamuria constituency in Bardhaman district on Wednesday for the upcoming West Bengal Assembly elections. Jamuria goes to polls on April 26. Elections to 294-member West Bengal assembly will be held in eight phases starting from March 27 with the final round of voting taking place on April 29. The counting of votes will take place on May 2.Ghosh, 26, is pursuing MPhil from the School of International Studies at the university. She was elected as the JNUSU president as the candidate of CPI(M) affiliated Students’ Federation of India (SFI) in September 2019, and her term as the students’ body head was extended last year after the students’ union elections could not be held owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Thursday, Ghosh took to Twitter saying, “Will be contesting from Jamuria legislative assembly seat as a candidate of the CPI (M), supported by the Sanyukta Morcha. Requesting all of your support.” Ayesha Kidwai, professor at the Centre for Linguistics, said that no other incumbent JNUSU president has ever contested in an Assembly or Lok Sabha election before. “Aishe Ghosh so far is the first incumbent JNUSU president to contest in an election,” she said.Sachidanand Sinha, a professor at JNU’s Centre for Study of Regional Development, also said. “So many JNUSU members have contested in elections before. But they have all done so only after completing their education from the university. Aishe contesting in an election will create a positive impact on students’ politics in general,” he said.Among others to have contested polls after getting out of JNU are former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, Sitharam Yechury, and Shakeel Ahmed Khan. Aishe’s colleague and JNUSU vice president Saket Moon said, “The participation of an incumbent student union leader in a mainstream election will make it clear that the struggles we lead in the campus are not just limited to the campus. A student participating in politics will create a larger impact because it will encourage more students to become leaders in the future.”Ghosh was among the 35-odd people, including students and teachers, who were attacked during a spell of violence that took place at the JNU campus in January 2020. She had sustained a severe head injury, and her left arm was fractured in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aishe-ghosh-becomes-first-incumbent-jnusu-president-to-contest-assembly-polls-101615484854836.html

11-03-2021||Delhi||One worker killed, 8 injured as scaffolding collapses during railway bridge repair work||A 20-year-old daily wage earner was killed and eight others injured after a 20-foot-high scaffolding that they were perched on, to carry out repairs on an elevated railway tracks in east Delhi’s Yamuna Khadar, collapsed late Wednesday. Police said the eight injured workers are currently stable. The construction work was being undertaken by the Northern Railway. Police have booked the contractor for death due to negligence and efforts are on to trace him.Police identified the dead man as Mohammad Shahzad, a 20-year-old from Alwar in Rajasthan. Police said the incident was reported around 10pm when the scaffolding that the labourers had erected to reach the railway bridge collapsed while nine workers were perched on it.“There was some debris lying beneath the scaffolding and the nine men fell on that, injuring themselves. Soon as the police got information, a team reached the spot. Since the spot is 3-5 kilometers inside the wooded area on the banks of the Yamuna, it was tough for the team to take the injured to the hospital. The nine men were rushed to three different hospitals – Jag Pravesh, Guru Teg Bahadur and Lal Bahadur Shastri hospitals. While Shahzad was pronounced dead at the hospital, the others have been admitted and are undergoing treatment,” said a police officer who wished not to be named.Shahzad’s body has been sent for a postmortem examination and his family members have been informed, police said. Shahzad’s family lives in Alwar and he is survived by his father Khurshid, mother Zarina, a brother and two sisters.The eight injured were identified as Sonu Nishad, 20, Raghubir Lal, 22, Sohib, 20, Kali Bhawan, 22, Sudhir, 38, Golu, 20, Anis Khan, 20 and Imran, 21. Most of them are from different areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.Police said the initial probe has suggested that one of the pipes supporting the scaffolding had bent, causing the entire structure to collapse.Police have found that the repair work at the railway bridge was going on for the past month. Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said, “We have booked the contractor Ramzan Khan, who was carrying out the repair work for the Northern Railway. Prima facie, it was found that the labourers did not have protective gears. A case has been registered against Khan under IPC (Indian Penal Code) sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 337 (for causing hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) and 304A (for causing death due to negligence),” the DCP said.“Khan is currently not in Delhi. Multiple teams have been formed to trace the contractor and arrest him,” Yadav said.Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer of the Northern Railway, did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-worker-killed-8-injured-as-scaffolding-collapses-during-railway-bridge-repair-work-101615484796934.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi may receive moderate rain, hail in certain parts today||Delhi will most likely receive light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunderstorm and hail in certain parts, from Friday morning under the influence of a western disturbance that is passing over the north-west region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said starting early Friday, parts of Delhi and NCR will receive rain and thunderstorm along with strong winds. “The forecast was that Delhi was to get light rain, starting Thursday evening, but the possibility now seems that we are likely to receive rain from Friday morning. The temperature will also fall by at least three-four degrees,” Srivastava said. Parts of the national capital had on Wednesday evening received light showers, accompanied by thunderstorm in certain parts. The last time a western disturbance impacted the city in this manner was on February 5 and Met officials said such a prolonged period without a western disturbance was one of the reasons the higher than normal temperatures in the months of February and March. Further explaining the weather variations, an IMD scientist said that when a western disturbance passes over a region, the cloudy sky keeps the sunlight from directly hitting the ground and thereby increase the daytime temperatures. On Thursday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 35.2 degrees Celsius, six degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature was 17.3 degrees Celsius, three degrees above what is considered normal for the season. IMD forecast said as an impact of Friday’s rain, the temperature over the weekend is expected to fall. However, from Monday, the mercury will start climbing again, the IMD said. “Gusty winds are also expected to bring relief from pollution. The wind speeds are likely to touch around 40-50kmph on Friday,” the IMD forecast said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that on Thursday, the overall air quality index of the city was 242, in the “poor” zone. On Wednesday, the AQI had improved to the “moderate” category, with an AQI of 175.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-may-receive-moderate-rain-hail-in-certain-parts-today-101615484795534.html

But the government is yet to announce the schedule for a separate admission process it conducts for 25% seats reserved under EWS/DG categories as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act in these classes in private school.Parents expressed their concern at the potential academic losses caused by the delay.Amarjeet Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar who is looking to enrol his son in nursery class at a private school under the EWS category this year, said, “The new academic session will begin next month. General category students will be able to join immediately since their admission process will complete on March 31 as per the government schedule. But what about EWS students? The admission process is already delayed this year. Who will make up for my son’s academic losses?”The centralised process for admissions to entry-level classes in around 1,700 private schools, which usually commences in November or December, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Khusboo, a resident of Gonda who is seeking admission of her two sons in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category said, “My elder son could not get admission last year as his name did not appear in the list. His entire year went to waste. I am really worried about his admission now.”Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working with EWS children in Delhi, said, “We have received several queries from parents every day. The government should immediately release the notification for EWS/DG admissions and start the registration process. Otherwise, these students will suffer academically. These students have already faced losses since they could not study properly in 2020 due to the closure of schools [due to the pandemic].”A senior government official, who asked not to be named, said, “The schedule for EWS/DG category will begin once the admission process for the general category is complete or at least one list of selected candidates is released. The government will fast-track the process to minimise the students’ academic loss.”The first admission list for students under the general category students is scheduled to be released on March 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nursery-admissions-parents-waiting-for-ews-guidelines-101615484734795.html

11-03-2021||Bangalore||'City of future!' Infosys' Nandan Nilekani on what makes Bengaluru click||In an interview with Hindustan Times Editor-in-chief Sukumar Ranganathan, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani said on Thursday that an innovative streak has been in Bengaluru's bloodstream for hundreds of years and the start-up boom is the latest manifestation of this streak. Nilekani said that the work from home system is here to stay as the city sees a new phase of change. Here are some excerpts from the interview.Q: Is Bengaluru your most favourite city in the world?A: I’ve lived everywhere in India and aboard but I’m always happy to come back to Bengaluru, which was recently voted the most livable city in the country. Yes, it is my favourite city.Q: So, do you agree with the ranking in the ease of living? Because a lot of people, in Bengaluru, don’t agree with it.A: Every city has its strengths and weaknesses. It is never perfect, but when I look at the totality of what is possible, I still look at it as the best city to live in.Q: One person, who felt very passionately about this, said that it is not because Bengaluru is very good, but all other cities are very bad.A: It could be so because it is relative. When you look at the weather, the people in the city, the facilities and others -- like having one of the best airports in India -- all of it makes Bengaluru very livable. Things can be much better everywhere, but we have to live with what we have.Q: You have watched Bengaluru grow over a period of time and it was a fascinating evolution to watch. So, where do you think Bengaluru is in its evolutionary journey?A: One of the big things in recent years has been the development of the metro. We are seeing the metro network – even though it is not as comprehensive and sophisticated as Delhi – is getting rolled out. For example, Electronic City, where many of the tech companies, including Infosys, is getting connected to the metro network. As the metro spreads out, mass transit becomes easier and it would take some pressure off from the roads. Traffic here has been a matter of concern. So, you can see the upswing and see a lot of road work going on.Also read: Bengaluru has public-spiritedness - Nandan Nilekani on HT DialoguesQ: What makes Bengaluru click? Since it has topped the ease of living index, people insist it is the best city to live in and is the innovation hub. What makes Bengaluru work?A: It always had a history of innovation and contribution by forward-looking visionaries. We have two great parks in Bengaluru – Lal Bagh and Cubbon Park. The Lal Bagh was developed in 1760 by Hyder Ali, who felt the need to create the need Mughal garden in the south. Cubbon Park was set up by the British in 1870. Both went to create green lungs in the middle of the city. It was forwarding looking to think of these things in 1760 and 1870.It has always been the hub of innovation. If you look at the early part of the 20th century, Bengaluru was the first city to get electric light on a street. In 1904, there was an electric pole set up in KR Market because Maharaja (Krishnaraja Wadiyar) had set up a power plant in Shivasamudram to provide electricity to the Kolar Gold Field to mine gold. That line ran through Bengaluru and they decided to take bypass from that to provide electricity to Bengaluru. So, Bengaluru became the first city in India, in 1905, to get electricity.In 1909, Jamsetji Tata and the Maharaja got together to set up the Indian Institute of Science, a forward-looking science university for it and it still the best science university in the country.The Maharaja brought in German botanist Hermann Krumbiegel in 1908, who not only developed Lal Bagh but also came up with the idea of serial blooming, which meant that different trees would bloom in the city at different times.If you look at it, all these people were way ahead of their time, thinking about parks, electricity and universities. So, the innovative streak has been in the city’s bloodstream for hundreds of years and what you are seeing is the latest manifestation of that -- the reinventions in terms of start-ups.Just like Silicon Valley (in the USA), once you have a culture where you attract good talent, people like to live there, there are good schools and college and you create that critical mass of people, then magic happens.Q: In this evolutionary journey, it is important to look at the Texas instrument setting up base in Bengaluru.Bengaluru was the place where Walchand Hirachand set up the first aircraft manufacturing plant in 1940, in the pre-independence era, which became Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL). Post-independence, many top research labs were set up in India. Several public electronic manufacturing companies -- like ITI (Indian Telecom Industries), BEL (Bharat Electronics Limited)-- were set up in Bengaluru. The strong public sector presence led to private sector manufacturing.Remote software development was again invented in Bengaluru which led to the growth of the IT industry, which today is close to 190 billion dollars in size. That again created huge technology, which then attracted more capital units and that in turn brought in the VCs (venture capitalists) who brought young talent from these companies.Q: Following the pandemic, work from home is the new trend and some say it is going to be around indefinitely. Do you think it will lessen the pressure on Bengaluru to some extent?A: Work from home is here to stay. I think it's to the credit of the Indian IT industry that they managed to take millions of people and may get them to work from home in a matter of four to six weeks. For example, at Infosys, 2,40,000 employees across 40 countries move to work from home in three weeks, because they have the technology infrastructure to do so.So, I think work from home has a fundamental impact. Obviously, we do want to go back to work in offices because of the value of meeting people, the serendipity, the ideas, the innovation requires people working together. But one thought is that to have a system of two-thirds going to the office on any given day while the remaining one-third works from home.But fundamentally, this is good news because this will reduce the pressure on the commute and traffic. This ultimate hybrid model of working from home using collaboration tools, where some people are physically together, and some are remote is the way of the future.Q: This will probably make Bengaluru even more livable? Because one thing that everyone in Bengaluru likes to talk about is the traffic.A: Yes, the traffic will get much more evened out because people are at home on a given day. Secondly, as I said, there's pretty fast progress happening on the metro network. When the metro reaches a certain network effect, the usage will take off. I think we will achieve such a network in Bengaluru Metro in a couple of years and then you will see that fewer people will drive to work.Q: Let's come to the negative side, what do you think are the main issues in Bengaluru, what do you think are the real pain points in Bengaluru?A: The infrastructure will always be behind, and roadwork will continue all the time. Also, I think we need to address the inequality issues because, Bengaluru has a large number of migrants, not necessarily IT professionals. So, they still want the quality of life which is not that great, they live in slums, and that should be addressed. So, I think inequality need to be addressed in a big way.Q: Bengaluru has been a place that has attracted people from outside regions. A lot of people move in and then make it their home. How does the culture evolve through all this? What is the culture of Bengaluru?A: If you think of the fact that the first large public garden was set up in 1760, it will be clear that Bengaluru is a city that has been around for a few 100 years. It is also a capital city, so it's firmly ensconced.It's also a very cosmopolitan city. When the British built cantonment, many people came in from the different states. Many more migrated when the public sector boom happened in Bengaluru. During this time, Bengaluru has reinvented itself for the future.Q: If you could change some things about Bengaluru to make it a better city for business or to make it a better city to live in, what are the three or four things that you would change?A: It would be to fix public transportation. The key to Mumbai's greatness has been its fast trains and Delhi has an extraordinary metro system that connects the National Capital Region.That's why I keep harping on this. I think the combination of the metro, the bus system and suburban rail would make a big difference.Q: Let's talk about education. One of the things that I think Delhi has got right is its school system right now. There has been a lot of work that's happened there. And I think the effects are becoming visible. How well do you think the Karnataka school system is run? Do you think that that is one of the probable failings of the city?A: No, I don't think so. I think they are doing a good job. It is just that Delhi experiments have got a lot of visibility, but there's a lot of good work happening in the public schools in Karnataka. But Covid-19 has made a big impact. Because people who can't afford devices can't get online working at home. It has been a big setback. And I have mentioned, when it comes to higher education, may it be the IIMs, IIT or IISc Bengaluru is a big education hub.Q: There has been an increase in the number of institutes of higher learning that have come up in the last few years in Bengaluru. Do you think that at this point, Bengaluru can stake claim to being the intellectual capital of this country?A: In some areas. In technology, Artificial Intelligence, general sciences, urban studies, I think Bengaluru is the leader. But in terms of thinktanks, Delhi has a more developed system, partly because it is the capital city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/city-of-future-infosys-nandan-nilekani-on-what-makes-bengaluru-click-101615483346229.html

11-03-2021||Gurugram||Budget for green works likely to be slashed: MCG officials||Funds for environmental works is likely to see a major dip in the upcoming 2021-2020 budget of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), officials familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The MCG is scheduled to draft its 2021-22 budget on March 18.Officials said that around ₹102 crore was reserved for environment works in the 2020-21 fiscal, of which only ₹21 crore was spent. “Even though the MCG set a fund allocation of around ₹102 crore, only around ₹21 crore were spent for environmental works in the 2020-21 fiscal, mostly related to Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) measures. Hence, there is an 85% dip in the allocation of funds for this fiscal,” a senior MCG, requesting anonymity, said.The official explained that the budget serves as a guide around which the MCG initiates its operations for a financial year and added that only 15-20% of funds can be increased from the original allocation.“We can allocate some extra funds for any specific category. However, it should not be in excess of 15-20% as then the MCG has to explain the spending and seek approval from the state government. The biggest drawback of low funding is that it signifies that the MCG does not have any large-scale new projects or environmental restorations in mind,” the official cited above said.Over the last two days, the MCG has also held separate meetings with its officials and councillors over the draft budget. MCG officials said that all suggestions and complaints will also be taken into account when the budget is being finalised.“Only a draft budget has been prepared at the moment. Each category under the revenue collection as well as expenditure will be scrutinised, reviewed, and then finalised in the official budget meeting. We have held two meetings on the matter, with councillors and officials recently. Their inputs and suggestions will also be factored while preparing the MCG’s 2021-22 budget,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Officials said that the MCG is likely to increase its funds’ allocation by nearly two times for water bodies, while it will reserve funds for rainwater harvesting for the first time.“This fiscal, we are aiming to spend a lot of funds towards the rejuvenation of ponds and local water bodies to both mitigate localised waterlogging and recharging the groundwater table. Further, for the first time in 13 years of existence, MCG is also reserving funds for rainwater harvesting,” the official cited above said.Officials said the increase in allocation of funds for water bodies and rainwater harvesting by the MCG may be due to a recent order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directing the civic body to highlight the steps it will take to ensure increased groundwater recharge in 2021.Vaishali Rana Chandra, a city-based environmentalist said that Haryana has one of the lowest green covers across the country as consistently highlighted by the annual reports of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) over the past decade.“Increasing green cover is of the highest importance, especially since Gurugram is one of the cities with the highest pollution globally. Delhi has seven biodiversity parks and Gurugram has just a solitary one. MCG needs to take cognisance of this situation and allocate more funds towards increasing the city’s green cover, build more biodiversity parks, plant more saplings, rather than reducing its expenditure,” said Chandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/budget-for-green-works-likely-to-be-slashed-mcg-officials-101615482157161.html
11-03-2021||Gurugram||Gangster Kaushal files petition demanding protection from fake encounter||Gangster Kaushal on Thursday filed a petition in a local court, seeking protection from his rivals as well as officers of Gurugram Police, alleging the possibility of a fake encounter. In his application to the court, he stated that Gurugram Police should not be allowed to transport him from Hisar Jail — where he has been lodged since December 2019 — to the Gurugram court and back. Further, the court should appoint a police team from another district to accompany him. The special task force of the Haryana Police had arrested Kaushal from the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport on August 26, 2019, when he had allegedly arrived from Dubai. Kaushal has more than 200 cases of murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, extortion, and life threats registered against him in Haryana. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said criminal activities have been reduced in the city after the arrest of Kaushal. Rao said the police followed the due process of law while arresting him and presented him before the court, rejecting Kaushal’s contention that the Gurugram Police was planning an encounter to kill him. “More than 20 close aides of Kaushal are lodged inside Bhondsi Jail and are in touch with him. He is still running an extortion racket from the jail. We are monitoring their communication and movement of his gang members to ensure they do not target any anyone. Safety of Kaushal is also our concern,” he said. Kaushal also cited that the rivals of gangster Sandeep Gadoli and the Gurugram Police had planned his encounter in Mumbai.In the two-page petition filed in the local court, Kaushal also stated that his associates lodged in Bhondsi Jail has informed his family members that rival gang members are hatching plan to kill him with the help of the police.Rahul Chauhan, Kaushal’s counsel said he has been lodged in jail since August 2019 and has no role to play in any of extortion cases. “Kaushal’s life is under threat. Binder Gujjar, who is his biggest rival, has been lodged in Bhondsi Jail for the fake encounter of Gadoli. We need special security so that he is not killed in police custody,” he said. Kaushal was lodged in Bhondsi Jail after his arrest but was moved to Hisar Jail in November 2019. He had filed a petition in the district and sessions court in December 2019 to transfer him back to Bhondsi Jail but the court had dismissed the jail transfer application, citing that “societal peace” took priority over “individual convenience” in his case. The court had directed jail authorities and superintendent of police in Hisar to make appropriate arrangements for the safe transportation of Kaushal from Hisar Jail to Gurugram courts and way back. Kaushal was lodged in Bhondsi Jail after his arrest but was moved to Hisar Jail in December 2019.The police said he used to run his operations from Dubai and was involved in the murder of Congress leader Vikas Chaudhary, who was shot dead by the gang members of Kaushal on his direction in June 2019, following his refusal to pay protection money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gangster-kaushal-files-petition-demanding-protection-from-fake-encounter-101615482155980.html
11-03-2021||Gurugram||District administration proposes changes to restoration plan of John Hall||The district administration has proposed additional changes to the restoration plan of John Hall — a colonial structure at Civil Lines — that is scheduled to undergo renovation and conservation as part of a three-year-long memorandum of understanding(MoU) with a private company in the city. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who visited the site earlier this week, said that various ideas, including setting up a rainwater harvesting system, along with an underground tank and the installation of a vintage jet aircraft, were under consideration. “Our vision is to restore John Hall in such a manner that it reflects the history of the time period when it was established. In recent years, it has been renovated but certain elements do not match the appropriate time period. Right at the entrance, there is a shed whose architecture does not match with the time period of the original structure. With appropriate steps, our goal is to ensure that the structure retains the essence of that time,” said Garg. A proposal to install a dummy aircraft/jet at the premises is among the ideas that are being considered by the administration. “We are exploring the possibility of showcasing an old vintage aircraft on the premises. There are some constraints with space, but I have asked the team of architects to suggest alternative places on the premises where this can be implemented appropriately,” said Garg. Gaurav Singh, additional CEO and regional head of Haryana Corporate Social Responsibility Advisory Board (HCSRAB), Gurugram, said that changes suggested by the deputy commissioner would be taken up for detailed discussion on Friday. “Recently, the deputy commissioner and all stakeholders visited the site for review during which some new changes and suggestions came up. The open-air theatre that we were initially planning to work on has been removed from the plan taking into account parking hassles. We will instead have a recharge pit for water harvesting. We are exploring the possibility of installing a dummy fighter jet at the site since the site also serves as a war memorial,” said Singh. He said that the new changes were expected to get approval by Friday, following which conservation work will start. “Updated designs in line with the proposed changes will be put up before a committee tomorrow for improvement and approvals,” said Singh. John Hall was built in 1925 in the memory of John Goble Brayne, the second son of FL Brayne, who was the deputy commissioner of Gurgaon in 1920. Over the years, it has come to occupy an important place in the administrative functioning of the city. Currently, the place is used by the administration for meetings and is open only for official work. The hall was renamed Swatantra Senani Zila Parishad Hall a few years ago and is presently under the ownership of the Zila Parishad.In November 2019, the district administration had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a city-based firm as a funding partner for a three-year-long restoration project of the structure. Work on the site was to start from April 2020 but couldn’t take off due to pandemic-related delays. “We are hoping to start work from April after necessary changes are approved,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/district-administration-proposes-changes-to-restoration-plan-of-john-hall-101615482155339.html

11-03-2021||Gurugram||DLF Phase-3 residents pledge to prevent illegal constructions||Property owners and residents of U Block in DLF Phase 3 on Thursday held a meeting, where it was decided to voluntarily prevent illegal constructions in the area and also curb commercial activities being carried out without any permission. A 10-member committee was formed by residents to interact with property owners and ask them to remove violations from their plots. Additionally, for plots on which construction is currently ongoing, the committee shall ensure that construction is carried out within norms and is restricted to four storeys. This decision was taken during a meeting held between residents and officials of the department of town and country planning(DTCP) at a community centre in DLF Phase 3 on Thursday. DTCP officials said that this was the first meeting held between the two sides in the past several years, The meeting was called in the background of large-scale sealing and demolition drives in this area held over the past months. The U Block in DLF Phase 3 comprises primarily of EWS (economically weaker sections) plots where buildings with multiple storeys have been constructed in complete violation of norms. Last week, the department had sealed 150 establishments in the block, which were being run in violation of rules. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) said that the residents and property owners of the area assured them that illegal constructions and violations will be stopped and they have formed a committee to prevent these activities. “The residents want the department to consider the problems being faced by them as their shops have been sealed. However, the violations in the area are quite serious and, unless corrective action is taken, it would be difficult to accord any help,” he said. Bhath, however, said that if residents deliver on the promise of stopping illegal constructions and remove existing illegal constructions, then the department can examine the genuine issues raised by residents, However, a decision in this regard can only be taken by the state government. “The residents have agreed to prepare a database of all EWS plots and list the violations. They must also obtain permission for carrying out non-nuisance activities as per rules of DTCP. We can’t allow violations. Sealing will be carried out in future if the committee is not able to deliver on what it has promised. Only genuine demands would be sent to headquarters for decision at the highest level” he said. The residents, meanwhile, said that they have formed a core committee of 10 members, and it will have 50 additional members comprising local residents and property owners, who shall interact to find a solution to this problem. “We admit that this is a serious problem and have agreed to prepare a list of plots. We also strongly plead with owners to remove violations. We will ensure that structures under construction don’t violate norms,” said Sahab Ram ‘Leelu Sarpanch’ — a prominent resident of the area who will head the committee.Ishwar Yadav, who is also a member of the committee, said that they have asked the department to take a considerate view of the problems being faced by owners as many people have lost their livelihood due to the sealing of shops. “We have promised that violations would be brought to a minimum and no one would be allowed to carry out encroachments in the area,” said Yadav, adding that over 300 residents were present in the meeting. DTCP officials said that they have asked the committee to interact with locals and explain them that violations of any kind will not be condoned. “We will conduct random inspections and wait for a report from the committee after 15 days,” said Bhath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dlf-phase-3-residents-pledge-to-prevent-illegal-constructions-101615482154064.html

An order copy of the case was released on Thursday and accessed by HT.The court further asked the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) to submit a future action plan that must provide for placing information about day-to-day progress on the website and to ensure processing of current waste at a different site. The court also asked the secretary of urban development/local bodies and the commissioner of MCG to be present in person or through video conference with a report of meaningful action during the next hearing, scheduled for April 7.The green court expressed disappointment over the “inaction of the authorities in scientific management of the waste” that has resulted in leachate being discharged, causing contamination of the groundwater, polluting surface water and also polluting the air.The court said that it has been monitoring the remedial action taken by MGG in the past five years and has repeatedly found failures. The bench said it was disappointed to find that there was “practically no progress, resulting in continuing damage to the environment and public health.”Calling the treatment of legacy waste “insignificant”, the court also said that only 2% of the 3.3 million tonnes of legacy waste has been remediated at the Bandhwari landfill site in over the last year, indicating “that seriousness of the concerned authorities is lacking.”The Bandhwari landfill receives around 2,000 tonnes of waste every day from both Gurugram and Faridabad. Municipal solid waste from both these cities is being dumped at the said site since 2015. Almost eight trommel machines have been deployed by authorities at the site to clear legacy waste, and each machine can process 300 tonnes per day.As per a report by the Central Pollution Control Board submitted to the NGT in September 2020, the height of the dumpsite increased to 36 metres from 27 metres (recorded by CPCB in February 2020) and the total waste dumped stood at 3.1 million tonnes approximately.Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson of Ecogreen Energy, MCG’s concessionaire for waste management at the Bandhwari landfill said, “We have learnt about the recent NGT order and are working to increase the speed of treatment of legacy waste. Along with the regular treatment of waste, we are also following zero waste Mondays for the past two months to reduce dumping of fresh solid waste at the landfill site.”Vinay Pratap Singh, the MCG commissioner said, “The MCG has treated 1.8 lakh (0.18 million) metric tonnes of legacy waste so far even with constraints of Covid-19 restrictions and space at the landfill site. We have assured NGT that our waste treatment capacity would increase by 1,200 metric tonnes per day in March taking the full capacity to 4,000 metric tonnes per day. We are conscious of potential environmental concerns and would submit action taken report in NGT on next date of hearing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/green-court-gives-last-chance-for-clearing-legacy-waste-at-landfill-101615482095317.html

He had come out of a private company’s office, where he had gone to attend a job interview. The police registered a case against the unidentified driver who allegedly fled the spot after the accident on Wednesday night. The deceased was identified as Atul Kumar, a native of Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, who lived in Aliyar in Manesar in a rented accommodation, along with his wife and two children. He had been unemployed for the last three months and was looking for a job in an automobile company, said the police, adding that he was returning to his rented accommodation after the interview. Around 8.15pm, he had reached the T-point of Sector 8 in IMT Manesar. He was crossing the road when a speeding bus hit him before crushing him to death. “He fell on the road, some 50 metres ahead. The bus ran over him, leaving him dead on the spot. The driver did not even stop to check if the victim required any medical help. He fled from the spot,” said Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Manesar). The police said that his cousin, who was walking behind him, took him to a private hospital in Manesar, where the doctors declared him dead on arrival. Yadav said that Kumar was depressed regarding his employment situation. He had told his cousin that he might return to his village as he was not getting any jobs and that all of his savings had dried up during the pandemic. “He was planning to return to his parents in Allahabad this week and had requested me to not tell his wife about his financial condition as she was unwell. We were walking slowly and crossing the road when the accident took place. The driver was speeding and lost control over the bus. He may have forgotten to apply the brakes,” said Shravan Kumar, the cousin. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) was registered against the unidentified driver on Wednesday night. The police said they were trying to identify the suspect with the help of CCTV footage installed in the area. Kumar is survived by a wife and two sons, aged five and three, who left the city for Allahabad after the postmortem examination on Thursday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/21yearold-mowed-down-by-speeding-bus-in-manesar-101615482094066.html
11-03-2021||City||Odisha CM plans to counter BJP's Jagannath temple donation drive||In a bid to counter BJP's plan of initiating a fund collection drive for the 12th-century Jagannath temple in Puri on the lines of a similar drive for the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal government in Odisha plans to set up donation boxes at major railway stations and airports across the country where devotees can donate money.The temple, currently amid a ₹3,200 crore expansion drive as part Sri Jagannath Heritage Corridor project, has recently become central to the politics of the ruling BJD and opposition BJP. Patnaik has been leading the campaign of beautification drive of several temples across the state including the Shiva temple of Lord Lingaraj in Bhubaneswar and temple of Goddess Samaleswari temple in Sambalpur district.Also read: Smart classes in high school located in Odisha's remote areaThe Patnaik government has so far allocated about ₹1,237 crore for the development of the corridor around Jagannath temple in Puri under which the area within 75 metres around the temple will be transformed into a heritage corridor to attract devotees from across the world. Presenting a resolution in the state assembly last month for completing the corridor work of the temple, Patnaik said Lord Jagannath was the greatest identity of the Odia community."Our history, culture, tradition and belief system are all centred on the Almighty. He is the symbol of Odia esteem and pride. Visiting the Jagannath Temple once in a lifetime and getting a glimpse of the Lord is the only prayer of millions of devotees," Patnaik had said.Sri Jagannath Temple Administrative (SJTA) officials said plans are on to encourage devotees to donate to the temple through donation boxes. "Donation boxes would be installed at airports, railway stations, educational institutions and companies to supplement the ₹12 crore annual income from the temple hundis. We will try to generate more revenue from the stone quarries owned by the temple administration in Tapang area of Khurda district. Besides, commercial stores would be constructed on the lands of the temple at different places. The rents would swell the temple revenue,” said SJTA chief administrator Dr Krishan Kumar.The state government's plans to put up donation boxes at airports and railway stations come a week after Union petroleum minister and senior BJP leader Dharmendra Pradhan wrote to Puri king Gajapati Dibya Singha Deb, urging him to launch and lead a mass fund collection drive for the development of ₹3,200 crore Jagannath temple heritage corridor."The drive should be transformed into a revolution in which all Hindus across the globe would get a chance to serve Lord Jagannath both physically and through donations for the development of the 12th-century shrine," wrote Pradhan, drawing parallels with similar efforts for the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. He also assured of the Centre’s help in waiving off income tax on the funds received from devotees from across the country and world.To give a fillip to their plans, Pradhan and other BJP leaders of Odisha have already donated to the temple in recent weeks.Pradhan's offer came in the wake of falling revenue collection due to the Covid-19 pandemic as well as falling bank interest rates on its fixed deposits. Last year, the temple administration had withdrawn nearly ₹545 crore from crisis-hit YES Bank and deposited it in two nationalized banks amid massive public outrage.Unwilling to be drawn into the political battle, Gajapati Dibyasingh Dev did not commit himself but said the drive needs the support of the state government, the Central as well as devotees around the world.Nervous about BJP's game-plan of hijacking its temple card, political analysts said the Naveen Patnaik government may have planned the donation box formula. "It's now an open secret that the two major political parties are using the temple card to shore up their prospects before next year's panchayat polls. The BJD would not like to share the credits of the development of the corridor around Puri temple with the BJP and thus would try every trick in the game," said former Odisha minister Panchanan Kanungo.For more than two years, the Naveen Patnaik government is cleverly playing the religious card by committing funds for the development of temples including Jagannath, Lingaraj as well as a host of other temples in the state to counter BJP's edge. The state government has taken a special interest in the development of temples such as the Jagannath temple of Puri, Lingaraj temple of Bhubaneswar, Baldevjew temple of Kendrapara and Samaleswari temple of Sambalpur pumping money into their peripheral development.Apart from Puri, the government recently announced a special Act for the Lingaraj temple and unveiled the Ekamra Kshetra project for the development of the area around the Lingaraj temple. Though not known to be a regular visitor to temples, Patnaik, over the last two months, visited Jagannath temple, Lingaraj temple, Manikeswari temple and Samalaeswari temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-cm-plans-to-counter-bjp-s-jagannath-temple-donation-drive-101615479775950.html

11-03-2021||Delhi||Women empowerment key focus area of 2021-22 budget: Delhi govt||From establishing special 'mohalla' clinics and dedicated support centres for women to strengthening their role in the economy, women empowerment is a key focus area of Delhi's 2021-22 budget, the AAP government said on Thursday."The role of women is key to the progress of Delhi and hence, providing accessible healthcare, education and social provisions is a priority," the Delhi government said in a statement.Presenting the budget on Tuesday, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, set aside ₹4,750 crore for the Department of Social Welfare, Women and Child Development and the welfare of SC/ST/OBC.He also announced that the Delhi government will launch a new scheme to empower women and give them a larger role in the economy through the establishment of 500 anganwadi hubs in various parts of the city.The statement said major measures proposed by the government this year include establishing 100 'Mahila Mohalla Clinics', allowing every woman in the city access to "special services of gynaecologists and related diagnostic tests"."Considering women are not able to talk freely about their health issues and healthcare is not easily accessible for those belonging to middle-class and low-income families, the Delhi government plans to undertake the responsibility of having a 'Mahila Mohalla Clinic' around every woman in Delhi," it said.To begin with, 100 such clinics will be opened across the city and the number will be increased to ensure that there is "at least one clinic in each ward".Sisodia, while presenting the budget, had termed the 'Mahila Mohalla Clinic' initiative a "revolutionary step".

The varsity syndicate has terminated the services of Dilraj Singh, assistant professor in distance education, on the basis of Supreme Court judgment, which has not granted validity to a MTech degree earned through distance education. Dilraj is son of former registrar of the university and was appointed in 2010. The vice-chancellor has signed the minutes of the syndicate proceedings, which were released on Wednesday. In addition, the university has formed a three-member committee to examine the case of teachers recruited on forged caste certificate. A committee of the university has already recommended action against such teachers by terming them ineligible. Student union leader Harvinder Singh Sandhu had pointed to the issue of Dilraj and other illegally-appointed teachers. “The government has given us enough funds. Now, we are duty-bound to run the university. The guilty will face action and those supporting such elements are working against the university. The message from the government is clear that guilty should be punished,” said a university functionary, on the condition of anonymity. Dilraj had completed his MTech in information technology through distance education from the Institute of Advanced Studies in Education (IASE), Rajasthan, in 2005 with 81%. He was recruited as assistant professor in the university in 2010, while his father was the registrar.In 2017, while deciding a petition on technical degrees awarded through the distance education mode, the Supreme Court had directed that degrees of the students, who had pursued engineering in academic sessions between 2001-2005 from four deemed universities, including the IASE, stood suspended.Dilraj moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking the quashing of the public notice issued by All-India Council of Technical Education on December 2, 2017, regarding suspension of degrees on the basis of the SC order. In December 2018, the high court dismissed Dilraj’s petition stating that, “There is no merit in the petition and the issue raised by the petitioner has already been discussed by the SC, which granted no relief in similar petitions.”Student leader Sandhu expressed thanks to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for acting against the guilty. “The government has given the grant to revive the university, and not to pay salaries to ineligible recruits. I hope honest faculty and non-teaching staff also welcome the decision,” he added. The present registrar of the university, Devinder Singh, could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabi-university-syndicate-terminates-services-of-ex-registrar-s-son-as-asst-prof-101615478435645.html

During the assembly session in November last year, this issue was hotly debated under the calling attention notice of the opposition and the BJP-JJP coalition government was on the defensive. Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of revenue department, had informed the House that a state-wide inquiry was being conducted into the violation of Section 7-A of Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas (HDRUA) Act-1975 from April 3, 2017 to December 31, 2019. The opposition had alleged that the irregularities took place after Chautala became revenue minister in October 2019 in the wake of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) joining the Manohar Lal Khattar-led coalition government. With 40 MLAs, the BJP was unable to cross the half- way mark in the 90-member assembly and formed the government for the second consecutive term with the help of 10 JJP MLAs. “In order to ascertain the real picture and to counter opposition’s narrative, the inquiry was ordered from April 2017,” said a JJP functionary. In a written reply to the question of Congress MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra, deputy CM said: “1,127 FIRs (First Information Reports) were registered in the state in relation to unauthorised colonies/plotting under HDRUA Act, 1975 from 2014 to December 2020.” As per the reply submitted in response to the un-starred question, 49,197 sale deeds were registered in Haryana “in violation of Section-7” of the HDRUA Act from 2017 to October 2020. The Section-7 of HDRUA Act pertains to a no-objection certificate the town and country planning department grants before registration of land in notified urban areas. Gurugram tops the list with 14,228 unauthorised sale deeds, followed by Sonepat (4,954), Palwal (4,040), Mahendergarh (3,950), Rewari (3,118), Jind (2,929) and Rohtak (2,642). Among other districts where this illegality took place are Ambala (1,089), Bhiwani (614), Faridabad (1,480), Fatehabad (520), Hisar (383), Jhajjar (1,708), Kaithal (1,353), Karnal and Kurukshetra (1,325 each), Nuh (1,755), Panchkula (22), Panipat (112), Sirsa (1,603), and Yamunanagar (47). The largest 205 FIRs pertaining to unauthorised colonies/plotting under the Act in question were lodged in Faridabad, followed Rohtak (129), Sonepat (112) and Kurukshetra (106). It may be recalled the deputy CM on Wednesday had also informed the House that 6,223 sale deeds were registered in violation of the rules last year from February 1 to December 31. Chautala had said that the registered sale deeds violating section-7 of the Haryana Urban Development Regulation Act-1975 cannot be cancelled.

The decision irked hundreds of students in the city, who gathered and protested at Navi peth. The Relief and Rehabilitation Department announced the decision in a circular issued on Thursday. Earlier, the examination was to take place in April last year, but was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. A large number of students gathered at Navi peth and shouted slogans against the MPSC and he state government. The police had to resort to a mild lathi charge to disperse the crowd, who were at the spot since 1pm. As student numbers increased by the evening, extra police bandobast was called in from across Pune, to prevent any untoward incident. CM tells MPSC officials to announce new exam date on FridayThe state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced through FB ‘live’ that he has instructed MPSC officials to announce the new dates of the exams on Friday. “I am aware of the protests happening in the state , but due to the increasing number of Covid positive patients and to make proper arrangements for the examinations, this date has been postponed. The revised dates of the preliminary examinations will be announced by Friday and it will be conducted within a week. Also the age-limit criteria which students are concerned about will also be resolved. I have instructed officials accordingly,” said Thackeray. The cancellation of the exams prompted BJP leaders to target the government, while the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders also voiced their dismay at the examinations being cancelled. Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, asked the government to reverse its decision and hold the exams as scheduled. “The exams have been pushed forward already and it would result in a loss of opportunity for many students who invest their best years in preparation,” Fadnavis tweeted. Congress state president Nana Patole said he had already spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and a fresh decision is likely soon. Patole said the CM had assured him that the decision will be positive for the students. Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan questioned the rationale behind the move. “If the government can permit weddings, hold its budget session and conduct exams for the health department, then it is wrong to cancel the MPSC examinations,” said Chavan. In Pune, BJP Member of he Legislative Council, Gopichand Padalkar, along with other leaders, held a rasta roko, resulting in a massive traffic jam, amidst heavy police bandobast. “After the state assembly session ended, suddenly the decision was taken to postpone the MPSC preliminary exams. This is an injustice, with lakhs of students who already suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We have started this protest and till this decision is not taken back, we will not move from here,” Padalkar said. “This is a very unfortunate decision that the government has asked MPSC to take. Hundreds of thousands of students have been preparing for this exam. The government cannot play with the lives of students,” said BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar. This is the fifth time the MPSC has deferred the exam. Earlier, the Uddhav Thackeray government deferred the written examination of two days before it was scheduled, on October 11, under pressure from Maratha outfits, who demanded the exam be cancelled in view of a stay order from the Supreme Court on reservations. Meanwhile, there are two groups of protestor at Navi peth. On one side of the road is the protest being led by BJP leaders, and on the other side of the road, students are protesting. “We don’t want political parties to benefit from this protest. This is our anger and frustration towards the government. We just want exams to happen on the scheduled date and not be postponed anymore,” said Santosh Naik, a protesting student. Pune has one lakh students, from various parts of Maharashtra, preparing for the competitive exams. The frequent deferment of the exam schedule has threatened many, who fear becoming ineligible due to age restrictions. As the exam was scheduled for March 14, students from across the state with Pune as their examination centre, started coming in to the city.Shilpa Kamthe a student from Latur, said, “My parents were not ready to send me to Pune for the exams, but I convinced them. On Monday, I came here and was preparing for the exams and suddenly we got to know that the exams are postponed. This is not right. The state government should understand the issues and difficulties students face, especially from rural areas.” Another student, Rajesh Gondhale from Satara, said, “For the last one year we are waiting to appear for this exam. Initially, due to lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic it got postponed. I am at the age limit to appear for the exam. If it gets postponed again, I doubt I will be eligible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/students-protest-cancellation-of-mpsc-prelims-cops-resort-to-mild-lathicharge-at-navi-peth-101615477713913.html

However, Covid-19 curbs, like maintaining social distance and wearing masks, were hardly seen in the mega congregation.Since Wednesday night, pilgrims were seen arriving in Haridwar, especially towards the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri. As the thirteen Akhadas had the first right to take a holy dip, Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat was prohibited for normal people after 8 am till 7 pm.First Akhada to take the holy dip was Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada whose central attraction was Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdeshanand Maharaj's chariot and hundreds of Naga ascetics.Seers and ascetics from Juna, Aahwan, Agni and Kinnar Akhada started from the revered Shrine of Maya Devi temple and reached Brahamkund at 11:30 am. Kinnar Akahada, which is not recognised as a separate entity but part of Juna Akhada, took part in the Shahi Snan at Haridwar for the first time.Also read: On new CM's command, choppers shower flowers on seers in HaridwarThe second lot, comprising Shri Niranjani Akhada and Anand Akhada, started their Shahi Snaan procession from Tulsi square and reached Har-Ki-Pauri at 1:30 pm. By the time these twin Akhadas reached Har-Ki-Pauri, the previous batch of Akhada seers had vacated the Ganga ghats.Shri Maha Nirvani and Shri Atal Akhada seers started their procession from Kankhal-based Kumbh camp at 1:30 pm and reached Har-Ki-Pauri after 4 pm.To welcome the Akhada seers, the newly appointed chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat made a surprise visit to Har-Ki-Pauri and showered flower petals on the seers. CM Rawat met seers of Shri Niranjani Akhada while they were taking sacred Ganga dip and sought blessings for a grand Kumbh. Rawat urged seers and pilgrims to cooperate with the mela administration in ensuring a grand yet safer Mahakumbh. He also met Ganga Sabha office bearers and teerth purohits at the Ganga Sabha office and assured them of another visit to oversee Mahakumbh fair preparations.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdeshanand of Juna Akhada said that with the turnout on the first Shahi Snaan of Mahashivratri, religious faith has again overpowered the fear (of coronavirus).“Mahakumbh is being held in a grand way and with the easing of further restrictions the next month, when notification of Mahakumbh will be issued, Kumbh will be in its full aura,” said Juna Akhada's Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdeshanand.“It’s a historic moment. For the first time in Mahakumbh in Haridwar, transgender seers have been allowed to take bath during the most significant Shahi Snaan. Today, on the pious festive of Mahashivratri from the holy banks of Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri, a message of equality, religious harmony and spirituality has been sent out,” said Kinnar Akhada's Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi.Heavy security set up was put in place for the Shahi Snaan with 29 companies of Central Paramilitary Forces, including Indo Tibetan Border Police, Central Reserve Police Force, Central Industrial Security Force, and one company of National Security Guards deployed.“For the festive bath, we have bifurcated the mela zone into a super zone and a normal zone with a war room set up at the mela control room near Har-Ki-Pauri. Seven teams of bomb disposal squads, nine teams of sniffer dogs, National Disaster Relief Force, two teams of State Disaster Relief Force and two teams of Anti-Terrorist Squad, including an all-women commando unit have been pitched in for the security,” said Kumbh Mela Force Inspector General Sanjay Gunjiyal.At Shyampur, Kalinadi, Mandawar, Narsain and Laksar interstate border pilgrims and tourists who didn't have a negative Covid-19 report were being sent back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/mahakumbhs-1st-shahi-snan-witnesses-mega-rush-over-3-mn-pilgrims-take-holy-dip-101615476361367.html

Speaking about the rise in cases, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, Maharashtra president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), said that due to exposure to Covid last year, there is partial herd immunity among those living in the slum areas.“Around 60 per cent of the population in slums were found to have antibodies. After the hike in cases, there were more precautions taken by residents there. For housing societies, there has been a complete lockdown last time. After that, many attended public functions like marriages.

This is to avoid spread of the disease.“The second wave of covid-19 has started in the state. We expect nearly 3,000 fresh cases a day by March-end.

Elderly and people above 45 with co-morbidities are showing good response as 70,644 of them have been vaccinated in Punjab in just a few days.”Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said, “Since unvaccinated healthworkers and frontline warriors are at high risk, we will now conduct their covid test, every Monday, to check infection rate among them in the second wave.”GOVT SCHOOL STUDENTS,TEACHERS BEING INFECTEDState health department says nearly 1,100 students and 700 teachers of government schools across the state have contracted the disease in Punjab over the past two months. “We have increased testing in government schools.

Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of the health department at the PMC, said that right now, there are three hospitals being run by the PMC, which have the drive going on till 10 pm.“We do not need a vaccination centre that is active day and night, as most people won’t be coming in at all times,” said Dr Bharti.He added that an early morning session, 6am to 9am, may be considered.“However, there are no such plans as of now. As the beneficiaries increase, there may be private hospitals which may start this,” said Dr Bharti.Dr Bharti said that all PMC-run hospitals are now involved in the vaccination drive.“There will be more centres for vaccination, but not government hospitals. These new centres will involve private hospitals,” said Dr Bharti.Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra, said that there are many beneficiaries who cannot go to the centre during the day, due to work.“For them, 24x7 centres will be helpful. Private hospitals are ready to start 24x7 vaccination. This will help us achieve the goal of getting as many people vaccinated as we can. Also, the government should publicise the private centres more, so that everyone is aware,” said Dr Bhondwe.He claimed that at present, private vaccination centres do not show on the CoWin application.“The app is not updated. Beneficiaries are not aware of all the hospitals where the vaccine is available. The government and local bodies should publicise the private centres so that the number of beneficiaries may increase,” said Dr Bhondwe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/24x7-vaccine-centre-not-feasible-for-pune-pmc-health-chief-101615473633719.html

For five hours, students were on the street blocking traffic and refusing to relent, even after numerous requests from the police. Soon, the protests spread like wildfire across major cities in Maharashtra, including Aurangabad, Nagpur, Amravati and Kolhapur. For students, the cancellation of the exam – this the fifth time – was a spark waiting to ignite. Students fear that another deferment of the exam may disqualify them as they risk crossing the required age limit. These students, most coming from rural and semi-urban parts of Maharashtra, have been preparing for the exam for the last three years.The number of passing seats available at the exam are as few as 250. According to estimates, 0.25 million students were to appear for the exam across state. In Pune, 0.15 million students have been preparing for this competitive exam, conducted by the MPSC. The MPSC, according to sources, acted based on the instructions from the government, though Congress leaders like Nana Patole said the commission is autonomous and free to take a call. Those appearing for exam said if an assembly session can pass-off smoothly gram panchayat polls, along with political rallies, be held, the exam can be held. “We are all responsible adults and can take care of ourselves. Last week, the exam for the health department took place. The Railway examination has been conducted. Then what is the problem in conducting the preliminary exam this Sunday? Candidates have been waiting for this exam and for many, it is the last chance. I am not convinced of the reason of Covid. Last time, in October, MPSC postponed the exam citing Covid, but the real reason was the reservations,” said Mahesh Ghaebude, a civil service aspirant in Pune. “In Pune district, there is an arrangement for 40,000 candidates to give the MPSC prelim exam. Approximately 0.262 million students from all over the state had applied for this exam, which conducted for 200 posts,” said Mahesh Bade, founder of the MPSC Students’ Rights Association Most students, according to Bade, spend a minimum of Rs10,000 per month to live in Pune, knowing well that the future is uncertain. Astik Darade, a Maratha candidate appearing for exam through the open quota, said, “Exams shouldn’t be postponed any further. I am a Maratha student, but I feel that the exam should happen on its scheduled date. The decision on the reservation can be taken before the results, but the exam should be conducted.” Chasing a future in civil serviceNumbers are in approximations to the nearest actual *- Total number of candidates appearing for the state civil service prelim exams: 0.262 million- Number of posts: 200 - Total seating capacity at examination centres in Pune district: 40,000- Number of students in Pune for the exams: 0.1million||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/frequent-cancellations-of-mpsc-exams-fear-of-age-disqualifications-put-angry-students-on-the-streets-101615472613539.html

Those arrested belonged to Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha and said Taj Mahal was a Shiva temple --Tejo Mahalaya-- and hence prayers can be offered there. The CISF personnel handed over the trio to Tajganj police who booked them under section 153(A) of Indian Penal Code for promoting enmity between groups on ground of religion.Various right wing bodies have been stressing that Taj Mahal was built on a Shiva temple and efforts were made time and again to offer prayers on campus of the historical monument. A civil suit is also pending in Agra courts wherein petitioners have demanded to declare Taj Mahal as Tejo Mahalaya. On occasion of Maha Shivratri on Thursday, the three activists -- Meena Diwakar, provincial president of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha along with district incharge Jitendra Kushwaha and district vice president Vishal Kumar entered the Taj premises and offered water to Sun god and were going to offer prayers before the main mausoleum when the CISF men nabbed them.While Kushwaha and Kumar were presented before remand magistrate at Civil court in Agra the third activist Meena Diwakar was admitted to Emergency Ward of SN Medical College and Hospital after her health deteriorated. The trio has been sent to 14-day judicial custody after their bail plea was rejected by the court.Diwakar had been in the limelight in the past too for offering prayers on Taj campus and in 2019 took a ‘kanwad’ to be offered at Taj but was stopped. “If there can be permission for celebrating ‘Urs’ of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan than why cannot devotees of Lord Shiva are allowed to offer prayers at Tejo Mahalaya,” questioned Sanjay Jaat, national spokesperson of the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-right-wing-activists-held-for-attempting-to-offer-prayers-at-taj-101615468053375.html

11-03-2021||Lucknow||Coexistence of tigers and humans in UP’s Amariya draws experts’ attention||In 2012, a tigress from the Pilibhit Wildlife Sanctuary, which has since been declared a tiger reserve, strayed out into sugarcane fields nearby. She has not gone back since and made the farm her permanent home. The tigress also gave birth to two cubs there in Amariya. More big cats have since joined them and now at least eight tigers and their nine cubs live in these fields. Forest officials call these big cats farm or Amariya tigers and their coexistence with humans has drawn the attention of experts and wildlife enthusiasts.PK Sharma, Uttar Pradesh’s chief wildlife warden, said barring a few minor incidents, no fatal human-animal conflict had been reported from Amariya. “A special team from the forest department keeps monitoring the situation and sensitises people about how to prevent any possible conflict.”Sharma said he has written to the Wildlife Institute of India seeking its views on the Amariya tigers and a plan for a thorough study of the situation. “Hopefully they will start their study soon.”Also Read | Tiger dies of electrocution in Kheri forest of Uttar PradeshMudit Gupta, World Wildlife Fund India (WWFI)’s senior landscape coordinator, said the farmland with tall sugarcane plantation provides a favourable atmosphere to tigers along with a good prey base of herbivorous animals, water and minimum human movement. “Like humans, tigers too avoid human contact and attack only when they find themselves in danger.” Gupta said the presence of animals did not affect daily human lives.Naresh, the WWFI’s representative in Pilibhit, said the people were scared initially but gradually accepted the tiger presence after initial demands for their relocation. He added the tigers have also helped protect the crops. He added blue bulls, wild boars, deer and other animals would earlier damage the crops. “But the presence of tigers in the farmland has forced these animals to stay away.”Naresh said movements of the Amariya tigers are tracked in an area of 20 to 30sqkm. Naresh said the first tigress, which came out of the reserve, went as far as Kanpur and Unnao, around 300km away.Prashant Shukla, who owns a farm in Amariya, said there is always a danger of human-tiger conflict. He feared ageing could hamper the hunting capacity of tigers and turn them into maneaters. Shukla said experts should take care of this and prevent conflict. He added there have been instances of tigers and farmworkers coming face to face. Shukla said on Friday, a tiger changed his path after seeing a human. He added even children frequently venture into the farms but no untoward incident has ever taken place.Sanjeev Kumar, a forest officer, said they have deputed a team in the area to track the daily movement of the tigers. He added the team trains the people to identify pugmarks and briefs them about dos and don’ts while working in their fields. Kumar said the farm labourers have been asked to move in groups and harvest crops from one side instead of multiple directions and also keep shouting so that tigers move away.Shukla said it is impossible to always move in groups. “How can labourers move in a group for irrigating a field? Also, someone has to deliver food to labourers working in the fields.” He said the danger to humans could not be ruled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/coexistence-of-tigers-and-humans-in-up-s-amariya-draws-experts-attention-101615466855003.html

The 10-km long road starts at Research and Development Establishment (R and DE), Dighi and connects 512 Army Base workshop in Khadki. The stretch has been used for testing military battle tanks for decades as the fighting machines crisscross the area for fitness tests like maintenance, repair and overhaul.The unauthorised hawkers selling their wares on footpath and road causing traffic chaos could cause accidents as tanks regularly ply on the stretch and authorities, including military establishments, should take immediate remedial steps, according to residents.Sanjay Gadve, a resident of Madhuban Housing Society, said, “This road gets its name because it is dedicated for tank testing and hawkers are illegally occupying the road for the past ten years. Action must be taken to evict hawkers and if need be police cases must be lodged as they are interfering with free movement of tanks.” According to Gadve, military tanks used to freely crisscross the road ten years ago but rapid urbanisation and growth of Vishrantwadi, Dighi, Munjoba Vasti and the surrounding areas led to congestion and hawker encroachment has added to the problem. “Tank drivers on their way to R and DE have to halt till hawkers clear off the road and their movement poses risk to pedestrians and commuters,” he said. Anita Pillai of Dighi said, “The tanks have to move carefully on the road as it is occupied by illegal hawkers. The stretch has become mishap-prone. Pune Municipal Corporation, military and elected members of the area must resolve the issue.”PMC anti-encroachment chief Madhav Jagtap could not be reached for comments despite many attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hawker-menace-pose-risk-to-commuters-of-vishrantwadi-road-used-for-military-tank-testing-101615465413534.html

More than 1,000 people continue to remain under home isolation while the containment zones are at 592.Delhi reports 409 new #COVID19 cases, 286 recoveries and 3 deaths. Total cases 6,42,439Total recoveries 6,29,485Death toll 10,934Active cases 2020 pic.twitter.com/Xxpt1hDhhuCases have been on the rise in Delhi since the latter part of February—200 fresh Covid-19 cases were recorded on February 24. The initial days of February witnessed a respite as the daily cases of the coronavirus disease went above the 100-mark but stayed below the 200-mark. There were no deaths reported on four days of last month on 9, 13, 17, 25 and just 94 cases were seen on February 16, which had been the lowest in more than nine months.Amid the recent surge in cases in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat etc, Delhi also has seen the overall Covid-19 situation worsening. In March alone, the daily cases have breached the 300-mark thrice—March 9 (320 cases), March 6 (321 cases) and March 5 (312 cases). According to news agency PTI, health experts and doctors have attributed the sudden spike in cases in Delhi to residents not following Covid-appropriate behaviour and assuming that all is well now.The Union ministry of health and family welfare pointed out on Thursday that Delhi is witnessing an upward trend in the number of daily cases. However, health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Monday that the outbreak was in its ‘endemic phase’ in Delhi but added that it would not end completely and people have to learn to live with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-daily-covid-19-count-crosses-400-mark-tally-at-642439-101615462546567.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra allows Covid-19 vaccination centres to run 24x7. But there’s a catch||The Maharashtra government on Thursday allowed coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination centres across the state to operate round the clock with a view to speeding up the inoculation drive, according to news agency PTI. However, this will be applicable to only those centres which have sufficient staff, senior officials said.Maharashtra’s health department secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas told PTI the approval by the state government is an ‘in-principle nod’ for keeping the vaccination centres open throughout. “It is up to the medical facilities, depending upon the availability of staff, to decide on the number of hours to carry out the vaccination,” Vyas added. (Brought this up)Maharashtra started its vaccination drive on January 16 and has administered more than two million vaccine doses till now, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare’s update. The beneficiaries at present comprise healthcare and frontline workers, people above the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45-59 with specific co-morbidities.Meanwhile, a health official of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) alleged that some people were coming up with fake certificates to show that they were eligible to take the vaccine shot. “We found some people in their late 40s who came up with fake medical certificates of co-morbidities to get the vaccine. When we asked them to describe their illness, we found they were lying. It is unfortunate,” the BMC official told PTI. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 caseload is nearing 2.26 million with 52,610 deaths, 2,099,207 recoveries and 99,008 active infections. The state’s daily cases have been on the rise since the second week of February. On Wednesday, 13,659 fresh Covid-19 cases were registered- which have been the highest in more than five months. The last time these many cases were seen in the state was on October 8, 2020, when there were 13,395 infections.Districts such as Nagpur, Jalgaon, Amravati, Thane, Nashik etc have been placed under lockdown by their respective administrations to curb the recent surge in the cases. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday that strict lockdown measures will be imposed in some areas of the state and the government would hold a special meeting with officials before releasing these measures. Thackeray added that the government had been requesting residents to adhere to all Covid-related norms such as wearing masks, ensuring physical distancing and moving out only when required.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-covid-19-vaccination-centres-to-run-24x7-but-there-s-a-catch-101615461905206.html

11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal bars civilians from driving olive-green vehicles||The Himachal Pradesh government has prohibited civilians from plying olive-green coloured vehicles in the state. The transport department has issued notices to nearly 15,000 such owners, asking them to change the colour of their vehicles as soon as possible. The use of olive-green paint on civilian vehicles is prohibited under the Motor Vehicles Act as it is meant to identify vehicles of the armed forces. “We have found olive green vehicles on roads when this colour is prohibited for civilians,” transport director Anupam Kashyap said. “It has come to our notice that owners get their vehicles repainted after purchase as there is no entry related to this colour at the time of the vehicle’s registration. Moreover, there are cases when the paint of vehicles bought from the defence forces is not changed” said Kashyap. The department says no vehicles, including tractors or those engaged in the construction sector, shall be painted olive green. The transport department, which has directed the regional transport officer to compile data of vehicles with olive-green colour, has sought help from the police to trace olive-green colour vehicles. Sub divisional magistrates have been directed to ensure that the owners of such vehicles inform the registration authorities. “They will have to inform the registration authority of the transport department and get this colour removed and another painted. The department has directed the RTO to persuade vehicle owners to change the olive-green paint else the department will cancel the vehicle’s registration. The department has given owners three months to change the colour. So far, it has traced nearly 15,000 such vehicles in its records of which 2,100 vehicles ply in Shimla town. There is growing fad among youngsters to paint their vehicles, particularly sports utility vehicles, olive green.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bars-civilians-from-driving-olive-green-vehicles-101615458873797.html

11-03-2021||Other||Taste of life: Chivda, chakali, farsan... Moving snack shelf from kitchen to shop window... and, empowering women||In June 1889, Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, social reformer and educationist, wrote a letter to his uncle, Sadashivrao Bhagwat. Bhagwat’s daughter Venu was 12 and recently widowed. Agarkar urged his uncle to let Venu come to Pune and start attending a school. “If she does not study, she will have to spend the rest of her life roaming from door to door, with a rolling pin in her hand”, he wrote. Venu Namjoshi did come to Pune, completed her education and created a name for herself as a brilliant educationist. Countless other women were not as fortunate. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many widows and single mothers had no option, but to cook in other women’s kitchens to survive. They had no education and there were no other jobs. Cooking, and other household jobs that accompanied it, became the main source of income for many women.After the First World War ended, women started entering professions like nursing and teaching. And the organisation that was instrumental in imparting training for these vocations to needy and willing women in Pune was The Poona Seva Sadan Samiti, started by Ramabai Ranade.Initially meant only for widows and divorcees, Sevasadan soon opened its doors to all women who were willing to get educated. Even though the focus of the society was to train them to be nurses and teachers, Sevasadan, after 1915, started a small unit to train women to make pickles, papads and other savoury snacks, on a large scale. The aim was to make them self-sufficient. It was expected that they would earn their livelihood by selling the products. This rarely happened, though. To be employed as a cook was somewhat acceptable, but, an upper class woman selling pickles and papads in the market was stigmatised. When Sevasadan was established, a few widows were in the business of making and supplying chivada and sev to a couple of restaurants in Pune, known for their spicy misal. These women were almost ostracised for their venture. Sevasadan played an important role in slaying these orthodox notions of purity and sanctity of food and women. It began by sending gift hampers containing snacks, lamps and fragrant oils during Diwali to the who’s-who of Pune. Ads were placed in prominent newspapers urging people to buy the food products. Slowly and steadily sales picked up.A small note published in “Kesari” on the occasion of the 20th Foundation Day of the Sevasadan Society mentions one Godavaribai Hinge, who started with selling chivada and shankarpale, and soon graduated to selling sweets. Although the products were stocked only at Sevasadan, she was able to educate her children, - three boys and a girl. Shantabai Nashikkar and Sundarabai Bhopatkar, in March 1940, started a cooperative of women called the Mahila Udyogmandir. Its aim was to train women to cook food products and sell them in the markets of Pune. Pickles, spices and spice mixes, and papads, were the products the women manufactured and were available all year round. Chivada, chakali, karanji and shankarpale were sold during Diwali.These were available at Dattatray Narayan Hejib’s store, Godbole, Joshi & Co, Nutan Badshahi Boarding House, Jogalekar Brothers and KV Limaye Mandavwale.In 1941, Mahila Udyogmandir had 80 members and made a profit of Rs620, of which Rs400 was put back to expand the business. A small unit to make jams and jellies was established in Sadashiv peth and donations were sought to start a canning unit. Mahila Udyogmandir provided bread and butter to at least 300 women within a span of six years. In March 1948, Shakuntala Bapat from Jalgaon wrote an article in “Aahar”, asking why was it not possible to sell banana flour made in Jalgaon in the markets of Pune. “There are several needy women in the town and they can manufacture banana flour locally, and send it to Pune. They can shoulder the entire responsibility of the business, without any help from the men. I am sure there is some demand for regional specialities like banana and ragi flour, pickles and sandage in big cities like Mumbai and Pune”, she wrote. A small report in “Sakal” in September 1950 tells us that a small cooperative from Jalgaon was selling banana flour in Pune. Whether Shakuntala Bapat had any role to play in this, I don’t know. It is heartening to know that the models established by Sevasadan and the Mahila Udyogmandir were replicated all over Maharashtra.More importantly, they taught people to buy chivada and chakali from shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-chivda-chakali-farsan-moving-snack-shelf-from-kitchen-to-shop-window-and-empowering-women-101615458333011.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||This book haven by Delhi Police has a smart classroom too!||This police station in Delhi’s RK Puram has officials in khaki and some are armed with books! Stocked with thousands of books, magazines and newspapers, the Delhi Police Public Library is a haven for students from the economically weaker sections, who come here to study. And the credit to conceive a space, which keeps the children off the streets, goes to station house officer (SHO) Rajesh Sharma.“In the absence of education and a safe space, kids get involved in crimes and drugs. As police, it is our primary job to ensure that youngsters don’t go down the wrong path. Hence this library has been set up so that parents who couldn’t afford to send their kids to school, or students who were excluded from the service sector due to lack of help in exam preparation, could receive the assistance they need,” says Sharma, adding that within a month of starting the place, they have 70 children come in, to study, every day at the station. The library is not only equipped with a smart classroom and internet connectivity, but also provides free coaching for competitive exams. The initiative has received accolades within the police force as well as on social media when some pictures of its interiors recently went viral. Anil Balin, a resident of RK Puram who saw the pictures, excitedly says, “I will ensure my kids visit the station, and also donate books for this initiative. The library is spacious, full to the brim with books of all genres, and is a great effort by the law enforcement agency. Padhega India tabhi badhega na India!”Reiterating the need to develop such initiatives for the youth, Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP South West, says, “Libraries allow for social development of the kids who come here, and education allows them to join the workforce.

The BSP will be contesting these rural polls, to be followed soon by the 2022 UP polls.The review meetings and the decision to hold membership drive assumes significance as it has come amid a series of defections of important party leaders to the Samajwadi Party.Mayawati reportedly collected details of the party's organisational preparedness from across all the 75 districts, though a communiqué issued by the BSP office after the meeting had no mention of the SP even though she targeted both the Congress and the BJP, describing them as two sides of the same coin.Those who have quit the BSP and joined the SP included former BSP state president Dayaram Pal and ex-Ballia district chief Mithailal Bharati, former minister Kamlakant Gautam, who quit the BSP after its poor show in the 2017 assembly polls and merged his Rashtriya Bahujan Utthan Party with the SP, BSP's Meerut Mayor Sunita Verma, her husband and former BSP MLA from Hastinapur and former BSP minister Yogesh Verma.However, party leaders said Mayawati didn’t appear too perturbed with the defections. “She knows that most defectors have realised that outside BSP they don’t have the same appeal. There could be some exceptions but usually, the BSP's committed vote bank and their belief in behenji is solid,” a party leader said.Also Read: Akhilesh Yadav targets UP CM, says due not given to SP regime for worksIn 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BSP had failed to open its account and for 2019 LS polls she had stitched an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, winning 10 seats.

A communiqué issued from the BSP office later said that Kanshiram’s anniversary will be celebrated while following covid protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unperturbed-with-defections-mayawati-holds-review-meet-for-up-panchayat-polls-101615452234395.html

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Is Vaze being targeted as he is probing cases against Arnab: Sena to Opposition||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Thursday questioned whether Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was targeting police officer Sachin Vaze for reopening an abetment to suicide case against Arnab Goswami and probing the Republic TV editor-in-chief’s alleged role in a Television Rating Point (TRP) scam.In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said Vaze “opened the file” of the suicide case after it was “suppressed” under the previous chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s rule.The editorial slammed the BJP over the ruckus it created in the state legislature demanding Vaze’s arrested for his alleged role in the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to the car found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence with explosive gelatin sticks and a threatening letter.“Arnab Goswami duped everybody in the TRP scam, which was being investigated by Vaze. Did the opposition create hue and cry because Arnab will have to answer questions related to the suicide and TRP scam? It is wrong to create ruckus on Mansukh Hiran case because Vaze shut BJP’s beloved Arnab’s mouth,” it added.Also Read | Vaze under scanner in Mansukh Hiran death case: What led to the moveGoswami was last year arrested and later released on bail over the alleged abetment to an interior designer and his mother’s death by suicide.Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday announced Vaze’s transfer while rejecting the BJP demand for his suspension.The editorial said the government has transferred Vaze, but the decision should not be viewed as the BJP’s victory. It added instead of taking up people’s issues, the opposition raised a hue and cry over Hiran’s death and Vaze. “There are several issues related to people... It would have been good had the opposition taken up such issues in the assembly to corner the government. Instead, they created the ruckus over a suspicious death without allowing a proper investigation to be carried out. This is a perverse version of democracy.”Fadnavis responded to the editorial saying they have taken up issues related to inflated electricity bills, farmers, and Covid-19 response but the government does not see these as issues. “They only saw issues that pricked them.”Vaze, who met police commissioner Parambir Singh and other top police officers on Wednesday, said he will clarify his side of the story and release a statement on Thursday. He added he has also met the team investigating Hiran’s death.Fadnavis has led the attack on the government over Hiran, who was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5 with handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth. Hiran’s widow, Vimla, has blamed Vaze.Fadnavis on Tuesday cited Vimla’s statements to target Vaze. Fadnavis said the car found outside Ambani’s residence was in Vaze’s possession from November 20, 2020. “The car was given to him for use as Hiran knew Vaze, who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiran after four months,” Fadnavis said on Tuesday.

Speaking to Hindustan Times Editor-in-chief Sukumar Ranganathan, Nilekani said that people do want to come to office, but a clear picture is yet to emerge.Also Read: 'Bengaluru is my favourite city', says Nilekani"It is to the credit of the Indian IT industry that they managed to get millions of people work from home in three to four weeks. For example, at Infosys, 2,40,000 employees in 40 countries moved to WFH in three weeks because they had the technology infrastructure to do so," said Nilekani."WFH has a fundamental impact, but we don't now what steady state we will reach. Obviously we do want to go back to work in offices - the value of meeting people, the serendipity, the ideas and innovation require people to come together. There's no clear idea but one thought is that it settle at two-thirds in the office on any given day and one-third from home," he added.Calling it a good news, the entrepreneur further said that WFH will reduce pressure on the commuters and traffic, and people will still be able to work.Soon after lockdowns were announced around the world - in India, a 68-day lockdown began on March 25, 2020 - employees moved to a WFH routine that caused ripples across industries.As 2020 progressed, several companies adopted a hybrid plan: a fraction of employees came to office while the rest worked from home. An alternative model saw employees working out of the office for at least a few days a week.In United States of America, the system saw more participation from the older people - those above the age of 65 - to the labour force. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report in January, roughly 1 in 5 adults aged 65 and older remain on the job. In the mid 1980s, the ratio was closer to 1 in 10.A survey conducted last year by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) and consulting firm Primus Partners revealed that 74% workers are inclined to work from home or want their companies to adopt other policy measures such as flexible working hours and staggered office schedule.The survey was conducted in eight cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/work-from-home-here-to-stay-says-nandan-nilekani-on-ht-dialogues-101615443882158.html

During the trial, prosecution produced eight witnesses.The special Pocso court of ADJ-6 Ashutosh Kumar Jha observed, “The accused, who represents the noble profession of a teacher, and being a married man, did not think of the future of his wife and children while blindly committing the crime to satisfy his lust and immoral wants.

There are presently about 1,500 inmates at the ashram.251 ashram inmates, among the 1,317 tested, were found Covid-positive over the last one week. “We had set up a special auxiliary RT-PCR testing centre in Anandwan earlier this month given the presence of a highly vulnerable population there.

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Bomb threat to death: Decoding the case||Maharashtra leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis claimed in the assembly on Tuesday that Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old businessman, was likely murdered and demanded the arrest of a police officer.Fadnavis based his claims on the statement that Hiran’s wife, 43-year-old Vimla, gave to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) two days after her husband’s body washed up on the Reti Bunder creek in Thane district. Vimla told investigators that she was certain her husband had been murdered, and that she suspected Vaze had a hand in it.Till he went missing on March 4, Hiran was questioned repeatedly after an SUV that he had reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Antilla, the house of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. The car had 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani.Who owned the SUV parked outside Ambani’s house? Who is Vaze? Why does Vimla think that her husband was murdered and did not drown?A Scorpio outside AntiliaOn February 25, Gamdevi police sub-inspector Amit Kadam received a call around 3 pm. Bharat Patil, a security officer at Antilla informed Kadam of a Mahindra Scorpio SUV parked on Carmichael Road. Kadam called the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) team, which found a blue sack with a Mumbai Indians logo, which contained 20 loose gelatin sticks along with the threatening letter.The real SUV ownerShortly after Hiran’s body washed up in a creek in Thane on March 5, his family stopped talking to the media. Till then, Hiran, Vimla; brother, Vinod (50), and older son, Meet (21), had addressed the scrutiny that accompanied the discovery that the Scorpio had been traced to them.On March 7, Vimla gave a statement to the ATS, saying that she was certain her husband was murdered. Based on her statement, the ATS filed a case of murder against unknown persons. Vimla told the investigators that the vehicle belonged to a certain Dr Peter Newton. It was, however, in possession of the Hirans for the past three years. Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop in Thane, on February 5, 2021. On February 17, Hiran was driving in the vehicle but left it on the side of the road as its steering was not smooth, and continued his journey in a taxi. The following day, he took a mechanic to bring the vehicle to his shop. However, he found the car was stolen and lodged a complaint with Vikhroli police.What initial probe saidOn February 26, Vaze took the lead in the investigation. The police checked the footage of CCTV cameras installed outside a departmental store, just across the road from where the Scorpio was parked. They found that the Scorpio and an Innova reached Carmichael Road on the intervening night of February 24 and 25. During investigations, the police came across a report about a missing Scorpio. The police asked Hiran to visit the CIU office. “On February 25, an ATS official named Salvi called my husband and asked him to meet him. My husband and son met Salvi, who showed them a picture of an SUV found near Ambani’s house. My husband identified the vehicle. He also showed the FIR copy to him,” Vimla’s statement to the ATS, read. The same night, ATS officer Shivaji Chavan visited their residence and took Hiran to the Vikroli ATS unit. There, he was shown some CCTV footage. He was brought back to his house at 6.30 am on February 26, the statement added.What Vimla told ATSOn March 2, Hiran wrote a letter to authorities complaining that he was being harassed by police and a particular media person.The following day, Hiran told her that Vaze had advised him to get arrested and he would be granted bail in a few days, the statement read. On March 4, Hiran returned from his shop at 8.30 pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade. Vimla said that when she tried calling her husband at 11 pm, his mobile phone was switched off. The following morning, Meet and Vinod lodged a missing person’s report. Hiran’s body was found by fishermen on March 5 around 10.30 am. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran had died by suicide. But Vimla said that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned. “Our doctors said his lungs were not filled with water and were soft…,” Vinod said. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder,” the last few lines of Vimla’s statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bomb-threat-to-death-decoding-the-case-101615413263326.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Portrait of a geography graduate||Muhammed Nasir is a graduate. “I did my BA in geography,” he says.In his late 20s, the gentleman is a security guard. Stationed at a south Delhi monument, he is this afternoon strolling about the old stone walls. The monument is empty. Talking in Hindi, he regrets: “if I knew English, I might be working in an office with my own desk.”That’s how he had imagined the setting of his working life, while pursuing graduation in his home state of Jharkhand. “But it’s not easy for a Hindi-speaking graduate to get a job,” he remarks. Another option would have been to stay in the village and look after the little family-run agricultural land. Can it be that his status as the family’s first graduate made him reluctant to soil his hands as a farmer? Mr Nasir shakes his head, insisting he wouldn’t have minded tilling the land. “But there are things beyond our control.”He means the climate crisis, he explains. “There is almost no water left in our village.” The village talaab (pond) dried out some years ago, he says. “Farmers then dug borewells to draw water from deep under the ground... but that water is mostly over too.”Now it is almost impossible to pursue farming throughout the year. In any case, Mr Nasir’s village, he says, is in a hilly area in Jharkhand’s Palamau district, with a rocky landscape, making it difficult for extensive agriculture in the first place.“I had to leave the home.” He arrived in the Capital in 2011.To this day he feels the after-effects of his achievement as a graduate. “My high education helps me understand the world and to face challenges.” He hopes his two kids, Majme Ara and Roshan Ara, who live with wife, Shaheena Begum, in the village, will end up being highly educated and also well-versed in English.Now, after checking out the hour of the day, Mr Nasir remarks that his father, Islamuddin, must be working in the village fields at this moment. “He is busy with the wheat crop.”Mr Nasir’s shift will end by 6, when he will cycle back to his room near Kailash Colony Metro station. He will return at 10am tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-portrait-of-a-geography-graduate-101615410380385.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||Bus driver, cop hurt after two shootings near Andrews Ganj||Gunshots rang out in south Delhi on Wednesday morning as a 45-year-old contractual BSES driver and a policeman were injured in two incidents of firing within an hour in Andrews Ganj and Sadiq Nagar – both under the jurisdiction of the Defence Colony police station – triggering gun violence fears in the national capital.Even as the Delhi Police maintain that the use of firearms by criminals reduced in 2020 as compared to 2019 – there were 672 cases in which firearms were used last year in comparison to 736 cases in 2019 – experts said the two incidents of firing in south Delhi show how Delhi’s criminals have easy access to illegal weapons.The injured BSES driver was battling for his life at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The police constable, injured in the second incident, was shot in his left thigh. The Delhi Police said the constable was shot at by two bikers who were out to commit a snatching but bumped into two policemen and fired a bullet in their attempt to flee. The two were later caught by the police.In the first incident, around 9am, contractual BSES driver Bhimraj (identified by his first name in police records) was waiting for some officials of the power distribution company in his car outside the gate of the Andrews Ganj electricity grid office. An unidentified man approached him on a bike and fired a bullet from a distance of about 10 feet, according to investigations. The bullet hit Bhimraj’s neck and was lodged inside. By the time security guards and other BSES employees rushed outside after hearing the gunshot, the biker fled, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police control room was informed about the firing incident at 9.11am and the injured man was shifted to AIIMS, where his condition was serious. The police have registered a case and the suspect was arrested on Wednesday evening.“Prime facie, enmity appeared to be the motive behind the crime. We examined the footage of CCTVs installed on the route and it confirmed that before executing the crime, the suspect had conducted a reconnaissance of the area where the crime took place,” said DCP Thakur.Bhimraj’s brother Shiv Charan said the attack on his brother could be connected to an incident that happened outside their house in Chirag Dilli 10 days ago. “Two-three young men from our neighbourhood were assaulting a scooter rider over some issue. My brother was returning home in his car when the scooter rider, who was trying to flee from those men, hit and damaged my brother’s car. My brother in response pushed his scooter and threw the rider’s helmet on the ground. I will not be surprised if my brother was attacked to take revenge of that small issue,” said Charan, adding that his brother’s condition was critical.The police said that video footage showed the suspect had been following Bhimraj from outside his home.“In a shocking incident, a driver was shot by unknown assailant near Andrews Ganj in South Delhi. He was taken to AIIMS, where his condition is reported to be critical. We are praying for his speedy recovery and are in touch with his family and the contractor to ensure the best possible medical treatment. We are also co-operating with the police in the investigation,” a BSES spokesperson said.About an hour before Bhimraj was shot at, another firing took place on a service lane of the now-scrapped BRT Corridor. A constable was shot in his left thigh as he tried to nab two bike-borne assailants, the police said.The police said at around 8am, constable Naveen of the Defence Colony station, was riding his private motorcycle when in the Sadiq Nagar neighbourhood he spotted two men riding a bike that did not have its front registration number plate, while the rear plate was also bent. Naveen started chasing the bike and also telephonically informed his colleague, constable Manish, to join him.“As Naveen tried to nab the pillion rider, the suspect took out a countrymade firearm and shot him in his left thigh. When the duo tried to escape, constable Manish entered the service road, hit their motorcycle with his police bike. The two fell off their bike. Despite being hit in his thigh, Naveen rushed and overpowered the suspects along with Manish,” said DCP Thakur, adding the injured constable was shifted to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where his condition was stable.DCP Thakur said that the suspects, later identified as Dharmender, 29, and Navdeep, 20, from Badarpur, were arrested for attempt to murder and obstructing public servants from performing their duties. Dharmender was previously involved in two cases of theft and Arms Act, while Navdeep has one police case against him.During their annual press conference last month, Delhi Police said that crime in the city reduced last year. The police also cited data of the number of distress calls made to the police control room, which showed a reduction in calls related to snatching, robbery and other heinous crimes, compared to 2019. In terms of crimes registered, snatching cases rose from 6,266 in 2019 to 7,965 in 2020.Experts said that incidents such as the two firings on Wednesday show how criminals have easy access to illegal arms. In 2020, police recovered 2,735 illegal firearms and at least 5,138 bullets. The police said the illegal guns were manufactured in parts of western Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.Vikram Singh, former chief of the Uttar Pradesh police, said: “The two firing incidents are indicative of how people can move with impunity and that too with illegitimate firearms. Firing at will is also indicative of a horrible surveillance system and a check that is most necessary in respect of bad characters, illegal firearms and also the nakabandi that should be in progress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bus-driver-cop-hurt-after-two-shootings-near-andrews-ganj-101615409128478.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||‘Earn goodwill within’: Delhi HC slams jab exports||The Delhi high court on Wednesday questioned the Centre’s move of exporting vaccines to “not-so-friendly countries” and said goodwill has to be earned “within” rather than from “outside”.The court was hearing a plea initiated by itself to examine the issue of vaccinating judges, court staff and lawyers. On the last date, the court had sought to know the rationale behind the classification of citizens for the vaccination drive.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDefending its decision to export vaccines to foreign countries, the Centre on Tuesday had told the high court that it has allowed only limited export of Covid-19 vaccines while giving the highest priority to domestic needs.“Today’s newspapers show you’re also exporting to not-so-friendly countries. You have to earn goodwill within then earn it outside,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said.On Wednesday, the high court said the Centre was wrong to compare the courts with other crowded places like bus stops, railway stations and markets as the judiciary is one of the three major wings in the constitutional scheme.The government had earlier said it might not be desirable to create a separate class consisting of lawyers and others below 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/earn-goodwill-within-hc-slams-jab-exports-101615408781884.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||‘Our vision of deshbhakti is driven by providing excellent education’: Sisodia||A day after he presented his seventh state budget, Delhi’s deputy CM and finance minister Manish Sisodia spoke about the challenges to the city-state’s economy and the AAP government’s vision for Delhi’s growth in an e-mail interview. Edited excerpts:Delhi’s economy is still recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic led to loss of livelihood, contraction of GSDP, and the decline of per capita income, then why was the budget’s theme patriotism?This budget has been presented under unprecedented circumstances. It comes at a time when the nation is going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Independence. It covers and focusses on the development of all aspects of our society, from women to the elderly, students, youth -- all religions, and all castes.Despite the tough circumstances over the past one year due to Covid-19, all our government subsidies have continued, be it free electricity and water, free education, free medicines and health care, and free travel for women in buses. The trend of dedicating one-fourth of our budget to education and 14% to health care from the last six years has continued this year as well. For us, the vision of Deshbahakti is driven with the objective that excellent education is provided to all students and all citizens have access to high-quality health care. The goal is to ensure that all citizens nurture love, honour and affection for the country, for the people of the country and for the unity of the country.The BJP and the Congress have said the Delhi budget dreams of what could happen in the Capital 25 years from now — and not what will be done by the Delhi government in the coming one year. Should the budget have had more on issues such as pollution, infrastructure, social welfare, and so on?Every year, the Delhi government carefully curates the budget, keeping in mind the plans it has for the subsequent year with strict timelines, as well as its vision for the city and the country in the longer term. This year as well, the budget has been designed to address issues, provide resources, and invest in the development of Delhi and the whole country.As we are approaching a century of our country’s Independence, we would all like to put an end to environmental pollution. Work is being done with a 360-degree approach in this direction under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Similarly, I have proposed separate allocations for installation of CCTV cameras, free Wi-Fi through hot spots, and the development of roads and bridges as well.So, in this budget, the focus has also been on pollution, infrastructure and social welfare along with aspirations and dreams that we see for our country.Three years ago, you tabled a Green Budget. However, air pollution still remains a major problem in Delhi.Combating air pollution has been one of the major priorities of this government since the beginning, and we have introduced many initiatives over the past six years. These include extending Delhi’s green cover to the extent possible, using anti-smog guns at construction sites, encouraging the use of bio decomposers made by agricultural scientists of Pusa to prevent pollutants, banning single-use plastic, prohibiting the practice of burning garbage and leaves in the open, and shutting of thermal power plants.Along with this, an electric vehicle policy is being implemented with the utmost care and seriousness because we have to stop fuel burning to curb pollution. This is why we are giving it intense attention.How exactly does Delhi plan to increase its per capita income to bring it at par with Singapore by 2047?The goal of reaching the per capita level of Singapore implies that we have to increase the income of our citizens by about 16 times, which is a difficult target, but not impossible. Education, health care, and social security are our topmost priorities, and we have introduced several initiatives in these sectors.The per capita income (at constant prices) of Delhi in 1993-94 was ₹ 18,166, which increased to ₹2.54 lakh in 2020-21. Our goal is to create an educated population which we have seen from global examples leads to significantly increased productivity and economic growth. We are confident that these measures will lead us to our per-capita income targets.You have allocated ₹45 crores for installing 500 Indian flags across the city. Almost a similar amount ( ₹50 crores) has been given for free Covid-19 vaccination which has taken at least 10,900 lives in Delhi so far. There is an argument that the money allocated for flags and patriotism could be better used to make Covid vaccination free in private hospitals as well.Health is still our major focus, and it has always been. We have allocated 14% of our budget to the health sector which totals to about ₹9,394 crores. Free Covid vaccination is available to every one at all government hospitals across the city, in addition to this, the government has capped the price of vaccine at ₹250 for those who are able to afford it.What steps have you planned for boosting Delhi’s tax revenues.In the past year, sources of income for the government diminished while the expenditure incurred increased manifold. To recover from such a decline, we are aiming to use data analytics and business intelligence to prevent any possible leakages in taxes. We have commissioned a study on improved GST implementation for this purpose. We have also started keeping an eye on the commercial vehicles going in and out of Delhi through RFID (radio frequency identification), and have initiated a dialogue through SMS with businesspersons over tax issues. Comprehensive changes are being made to the excise policy of Delhi to improve the collection of taxes. This will include preventing the sale of non duty-paid liquor (smuggled from other states) and various new changes to bring liquor shopping in Delhi up to international standards. Further, to deal with the economic slowdown due to the lockdown and facilitate the real estate market, the government has also decreased circle rates by 20% for six months. We believe these factors will help us increase our tax collection.You said you plan to host the Olympics in 2048. Where exactly do you see Delhi now in terms of infrastructure needed for that?We have laid down a vision for hosting the Olympics in Delhi and have initiated the steps to achieve it. As a first step, the Delhi government has decided to establish a sports university to train athletes and create a pool of talented and competent sports professionals who can represent the country and win medals at the international level. We aim to spend the next 15 years to build adequate infrastructure and create an atmosphere where sports flourishes.The Delhi government has proposed a virtual Delhi model of schools in its budget. Please elaborate on the project.The design for the virtual Delhi model school is still underway. The specifics are being deliberated on. It will have students enrolled and will conduct examinations, but it won’t have a physical existence. The virtual model will benefit students in Delhi as well as all those children who live in any part of the country but want to benefit from the Delhi education model. We want to provide learning opportunities to all those students under the principle of “anywhere living, anytime learning, anytime testing”.The government is going to launch its own education board this year starting with 20-25 schools. How different it will be from the CBSE board in terms of curriculum and teaching-learning process?The Delhi Board of School Education will conduct assessments throughout the year to develop holistic learning outcomes, instead of an annual assessment that focuses on rote learning. Around 20-25 schools will become a part of the Delhi Education Board in the 2021-22 academic session, after which the other schools will be looped in eventually in 4-5 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/our-vision-of-deshbhakti-is-driven-by-providing-excellent-education-sisodia-101615407878120.html
11-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal thanks PM Modi, Shah, Opposition MLAs||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday appreciated the role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, the Central government and MLAs in the opposition, along with health workers and frontline workers, in helping the state control the Covid-19 crisis when cases in the Capital peaked.Kejriwal on Wednesday said in the Delhi Assembly: “The pandemic was truly a difficult time for all. For managing the crisis in Delhi, residents of the city, various organisations, Prime Minister, Home Minister, and Union government collaborated on a high scale. All our BJP MLAs too proved to be extremely helpful. The epidemic could not have been controlled by a government or individual.”He further said, “However, the most important work was done by the doctors, health workers and other frontline workers..”Kejriwal’s comments in the Assembly – a day after the Delhi government tabled the 2021-22 budget – put an end to a debate among Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators in the House over Covid-19 management.Starting the discussion on the motion of thanks, government minister Gopal Rai said Covid-19 arrived in the country through passengers from abroad and appreciated the chief minister and health minister for making efforts to control the virus.But, the Leader of the Opposition in the House Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “At a time when Covid-19 cases in Delhi were rising, the Central government stepped in and under the leadership of Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah provided relief to the people of Delhi by setting up thousands of beds for patients, airlifting doctors and paramedics… The condition of Delhi government hospitals was such that deputy CM and health minister had to go to private hospital for Covid treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-thanks-pm-modi-shah-opposition-mlas-101615407491467.html

11-03-2021||Delhi||In assembly, Satyendar Jain ‘dares’ Centre to bring fuel prices under GST ambit||Delhi minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government to bring petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, in light of the hike in fuel prices across India.Speaking on the third day of the ongoing budget session in the Delhi assembly, Jain said the BJP government should act “sensitively” on farmers’ issue and roll back the three contentious farm laws, protesting against which a large number of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states have gathered at Delhi’s borders.Also Read: Case to get petrol, diesel under the ambit of GST“Petrol and diesel prices in Delhi are still much lower than several other cities today. Currently, in Delhi, petrol is priced at ₹91.17 and diesel at ₹81.47. Let’s take the example of a city like Bhopal. Petrol there is priced at ₹99 and diesel at ₹89. Bhopal is in a BJP-ruled state… Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has publicly said petrol and diesel should be brought under GST. But it is the BJP, which does not want to do so because then they will not get to overcharge for fuel in the states they rule. Today, I challenge the BJP government (in Centre) to bring petrol and diesel under GST,” said Jain, who holds health, home and industries portfolios.Jain’s comments came during a discussion on the spike in auto fuel prices, kitchen staples, edible oil and other essential commodities in the capital in the past few weeks.Currently, in Delhi, consumers pay VAT at the rate of 30% on petrol and 16.75% on diesel.BJP MLA and leader of the opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “The Delhi government opened liquor shops during the lockdown and imposed an additional 70% cess but they spent the additional revenue on publicity. So, they had to increase VAT on petrol and diesel. They have reduced VAT from 30% to 17% on diesel but not on petrol. Why? States such as UP and Haryana have reduced VAT by 5%.”Bidhuri said, “Amid such difficulties because of hike in fuel price, the AAP government has yet not implemented several central government schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mitra Awaas Yojana, etc, which could have acted as a safety net for people.”Responding to this, AAP MLA from Kalkaji Atishi said it was because of the safety nets created by the AAP government, in the form of subsidised water bills, power bills, quality health care, quality education and free bus rides for women, that the Residents have been able to manage despite the price rise.The discussion witnessed high drama with Speaker Ram Niwas Goel ordering marshals to evict BJP MLAs Vijender Gupta, OP Sharma, Mohan Singh Bisht and Jitender Mahajan for insisting on a discussion on alleged irregularities in buses recently inducted into the fleet of the DTC – which, Goel said, was unrelated to the list of business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-assembly-satyendar-jain-dares-centre-to-bring-fuel-prices-under-gst-ambit-101615406434278.html

11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt made provision of ₹14,000 crore capital investment to push development works: Manpreet Badal||Concluding the debate on the 2021-22 budget, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Wednesday said the state government has made a provision of a whopping ₹14,000 crore for capital investment against ₹10,280 crore in the current financial year to push development works in the state. He delivered his speech amid protests by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs who were on the well of the House raising slogans against the government. Despite appeals by speaker Rana KP Singh, the opposition MLAs continued to raise slogans questioning the government over its performance in the last four year. SAD’s Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that the budget has fudged figures. To this, the finance minister said, “The proposed committed liabilities of the state government came down to 68% in the current year from 91% in 2017 when the Capt Amarinder Singh took over as chief minister. The budget can’t be surplus as it doesn’t make sense for a growing economy.”It is the success of the budget that the state government will raise ₹37,000 crore against a borrowing limit of ₹42,000 crore, he claimed.Referring to the objections from the leaders of opposition, Manpreet said their real issue was not that there were shortcomings in the budget but the fact that the government has given its best and has reached out to all section of society. “The criticism of the budget is welcome in the spirit of democracy,” he said when starting his speech. AAP’s Sarvjit Kaur Manuke said free travel for women was started so as to invite people to travel in government-run buses as no one travels in them. “In the coming years, women recruited in government jobs will be empowered so much so that they will have the freedom to raise their families as they like. By the end of the year, 33,000 young women are expected to get jobs in government sector as per the reservation policy,” said the minister.The success of the government’s move to increase monthly old age pension to ₹2,500 and shagun scheme to ₹51,000 can be judged from the happiness of the beneficiaries. AAP legislator Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the government was unable to feel the pain of the beneficiaries of these schemes as it delayed their implementation by four years even as they were announced by the Congress in its 2017 poll manifesto. Earlier, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said against the Congress’ promise to waive the entire ₹90,000 crore debt of farmers in its manifesto the beneficiaries got only ₹4,624 crore and a promise of ₹1,712 crore in the budgetary provisions for the upcoming year. “Sixteen lakh jobs announced by the state government under the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar Yojana’ was a farce. Where is the white paper on the power purchase agreements? What about the CM’s promise to end all transport, sand, liquor mafias that continue to operate with impunity?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-made-provision-of-14-000-crore-capital-investment-to-push-development-works-manpreet-badal-101615405950358.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||BJP-JJP govt defeats Cong’s no-confidence motion in Haryana assembly||The ruling Bharaitya Janata Party (BJP)- Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) combine in Haryana on Wednesday won the trust vote in the state assembly with 55 out of 87 MLAs present in the House voting against the no-confidence motion moved against the Manohar Lal Khattar government. The Congress had brought the no-confidence motion. The BJP with 40 MLAs (including Speaker who didn’t vote) in the assembly got the backing of 10 JJP MLAs, five Independents and lone Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) MLA, Gopal Kanda. The present strength of the House is 88 with two seats, Ellenabad and Kalka, having fallen vacant recently. Barring two Independent MLAs – Sombir Sangwan (Dadri) and Balraj Kundu (Meham), who had earlier withdrawn their support to the government, none of the MLAs who professed support to farmer’s cause and publicly voiced opposition to the three central farm laws, supported the motion. JJP MLAs --- Jogi Ram Sihag, Devendra Babli and Ram Kumar Gautam --- who are known for being outspoken on the farmers issue also stomached the party whip to vote against the motion. Babli though wanted to speak during the discussion on the motion but could not as JJP legislature group leader Dushyant Chautala excluded him from the list of speakers. Kundu while speaking for the motion said that he was not with the no confidence motion of the Congress but standing in support of farmers. Slamming the government Sombir Sangwan said that assembly should pass a resolution asking the Centre to repeal the three farm laws and bring a fourth law to ameliorate the sufferings of the peasants Lone HLP MLA who was absent for the last three sittings of this session was also present to lend his support to the government. Soon after chief minister, ML Khattar finished his address on the motion, assembly speaker, Gian Chand Gupta put the motion to vote, and a division of votes took place. The Speaker ruled that 32 votes were in favour of the motion while 55 were against it. Earlier, leader of opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda who opened the discussion on the motion said that the ruling alliance have the numbers to prove majority. “However, the real test is whether the BJP and JJP leaders can visit their constituencies. They have lost the people’s confidence,” the Congress leader said. After the trust vote, Hooda said though the government has survived the floor test, it has fallen in the eyes of the people. “The JJP MLAs and Independents, who are allies of the BJP-led government, had a great chance to vote for the farmers and prove their commitment to the masses. But they squandered it. But we voted against this anti-farmer government which lathi-charged, fired tear gas shells and used water cannons in peak winter and implicated them in false cases,” Hooda said. Speaking against the motion, Khattar said the three farm laws enacted by the Parliament will not be repealed. “There can be amendments in these laws but repealing them is out of question,’’ Khattar said. Farmers have been protesting at the Delhi border since November 26 last year against the newly enacted central farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjpjjp-govt-defeats-cong-s-no-confidence-motion-in-haryana-assembly-101615405770482.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Defamation case: HC seeks Majithia’s response on plea from AAP leader Sanjay Singh||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday put SAD leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia on notice on a plea from AAP leader Sanjay Singh in 2016 defamation case.The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia has sought a response from the SAD leader by March 24, said Sanjay Singh’s lawyer Ferry Sofat. The complaint was filed in January 2016 and subsequently he was summoned by a Ludhiana court. The alleged defamatory statements on linking Majithia with those accused in drugs seizure cases were made on September 5, 2015, at a Moga rally.It was in 2017 that a trial court in Ludhiana had dismissed application from Sanjay Singh in which he had demanded that record keeper and witness concerned of the Enforcement Directorate, Jalandhar, along with record of statements of drugs racket alleged kingpin, Jagdish Bhola, industrialist, Jagjit Chahal and SAD leader, Maninder Aualakh, all accused in the case who had got recorded their statements before ED in the infamous Bhola drugs racket case, be summoned. He had argued that said record is relevant for the purpose of cross examination of witnesses.However, the court dismissed the plea observing that Singh failed to establish how the record of statements would render any assistance for proper adjudication of the matter, says his plea in the HC.It further adds that on February 25, when his counsel tried to question witnesses of Majithia on statements made by these accused before ED in the defamation case proceedings, it was not allowed since the statements were not on record of the trial court. The petitioner requested court to summon the record again, but it was not allowed, the plea says demanding that February 25 order of Ludhiana court be quashed and Singh be allowed to summon record of statements made by these accused persons before the ED.Singh had further stated that pending this plea, the proceedings before the trial court be stayed and direction be issued to Ludhiana court to summon the judicial file of Bhola drugs racket case as the same is necessary for further cross examination of witnesses . Majithia himself has admitted that he was summoned by ED in that case only. Hence, the statements are very much necessary for the adjudication of the defamation case, the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/defamation-case-hc-seeks-majithia-s-response-on-plea-from-aap-leader-sanjay-singh-101615405112534.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 effect: Health issues became tough to manage||Sars-CoV-2 affected people in more ways than one. A Covid-19 positive result wasn’t the only thing that upturned lives in 2020. Meet four Mumbai residents who struggled to cope with their health conditions during the pandemic.‘Lockdown hit dialysis visits’The news of the nationwide lockdown bringing local transport to a halt hit the Mailare family in a different manner.Two days after the lockdown was announced on March 24, 2020, 39-year-old Neena Mailare was scheduled for a dialysis session. However, the lockdown meant that no local transport was plying. For Mailare, the short distance from her residence in Trombay to the dialysis centre in Sindhi Camp, Chembur, suddenly seemed too far.“The distance is less than 5 kilometres but with no local bus or autorickshaw in place, I was worried about reaching the dialysis centre in time for my session,” said Mailare, who has been on dialysis for six years and requires two sessions a week. While a handful of buses were plying in Mumbai in the first few weeks of lockdown, Mailare could not find the bus that would take her directly to the centre.When she borrowed her sister’s car to drive to the centre, she was often stopped by the police. “Twice, our car was stopped and towed to a nearby police station,” she said.It took a few months for buses to start plying normally but the next problem was the increasing crowd in buses. “Our immunity is very low and traveling in crowded buses can turn fatal for dialysis patients, but I had no other option,” she added.‘Challenge for special needs kids’When schools moved online due to the nationwide lockdown in March, 17-year-old Yana Dube was not comfortable with the offline to online transition. Yana, who is on the mild autism spectrum found it difficult to adapt to a life without social interactions.Her mother Anuradha said that the initial month since the lockdown was full of anxieties and disappointments for her daughter. “She was used to going out, meeting her peers, swimming, playing a sport. But with Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, we were all cooped inside our homes and she found it difficult,” Anuradha said.Yana would often get disturbed if someone entered the room while her online class was on. To add to her stress, she had her Class 10 board exams scheduled in October 2020 from the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). The exam was later postponed to January.“After the initial few days of the lockdown, she became very restless and I decided to take her for a walk with all the safety precautions. For her, going out was the most important thing,” said Anuradha.Yana wrote her NIOS final exam at a centre in Colaba, far from her house in Andheri as the board had not given her any other option. She studied before the exams and wrote her papers well. “For children with special needs, the pandemic was already a tough period and the poor planning on part of the board made matters worse. A few days before her exams were stressful. I had to help her with her studies and also my son who is in Class 4 and is a regular student. It was a herculean task.”A year after the lockdown, challenges are still aplenty. For instance, Yana is still not able to swim as the pools in her locality are yet to reopen. Her mother Anuradha has run out of tasks for her to do. “She helps me a bit with household chores and does some indoor activities but that is not enough. Earlier, she would be in school from 9 am to 3pm and now just a few hours of online learning don’t help. It is a challenge to make sense of what is taught online,” she added.‘I felt guilty that I was too poor’Around the time when the national lockdown was declared in March 2020, an 11-year-old Palghar-resident Tejaswini More was undergoing chemotherapy at Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, a type of blood cancer. Her mother Saraswati More, 35, wondered how they would continue the treatment at the hospital 120 km away with no public transportation.Tejaswini started showing symptoms of blood cancer in October 2019. She lost over 6kg in a month. One day, when she fainted in her school, her father, who worked as a daily wage earner, immediately rushed her to the Palghar district hospital. She was referred to Tata Memorial, where she began to undergo chemotherapy.But before she could complete the course in April 2020, the lockdown was declared.“As the trains were shut down, we were clueless about how to travel to Mumbai. Doctors told us that we couldn’t stop the chemotherapy. We didn’t have money to afford an ambulance. I felt so helpless and guilty for being poor,” said Saraswati.Eventually, a politician in their village in Wada arranged for a bus that would ferry all the cancer patients from the taluka along with their family members to the hospital daily, free of cost.Then came the second shock. The doctors informed Saraswati that her daughter needed a bone marrow transplant.On learning that they could not afford the surgery which cost an estimated ₹21 lakh, the family started an online campaign on the crowdsourcing website Ketto to raise the money.“Due to the lockdown, my husband who works at a construction site lost his job. At that time, all the roadside eateries [outside the hospital] were also closed. Only a few expensive hotels were open which we couldn’t afford. So, we would spend days eating only biscuits and water,” she said.In November, Sion Hospital referred Tejaswini to the Thalassemia Centre in Borivali where she underwent the surgery.Tejaswini and her 18-year-old brother, Vishanu have been staying with Saraswati in a rented room in a chawl in Borivali East for the past three months. Her father and 14-year-old brother are in Palghar. They have taken up farming to earn money during the pandemic.‘I was gripped with anxiety’Fear—of losing a loved one to Covid-19, of losing work, of not being careful enough, of not being able to keep up with expenses, and more importantly of a depressive episode around the corner—has been the highlight of the past year for 32-year-old Shayonee Dasgupta. Living with clinical depression and obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the past three years, the freelance writer based in Bandra said that the pandemic was a minefield of triggers.As the number of cases rose and buildings were sealed, Dasgupta was gripped by anxiety that she and her family were unsafe. “I was very anxious during this time and would compulsively read about cases. As the cases rose, I started slipping into depression,” said Dasgupta. Immediately after the lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease, Dasgupta lost some of her high-paying projects and had a tough time paying for her psychotherapy sessions.Dasgupta said that she found the “pandemic aesthetic” overwhelming. “Everybody was taking up new hobbies. People were baking, cooking, painting, and doing all sorts of things and here I was struggling to get out of bed.”Psychiatrists in the city said they saw a rise in number of persons living with mental illnesses seeking help during the pandemic. “One trend we saw was people with psychiatric health concerns, who had been stable before the pandemic, started showing symptoms again. We also saw a lot of people, who did not necessarily have previous psychiatric illnesses, show symptoms of anxiety and depression,” said Kersi Chavda, a city-based psychiatrist and a former president of the Bombay Psychiatric Society.“We, unfortunately, also saw a rise in cases of spousal, elder and child abuse during the pandemic,” Chavda added.On bad mental health days, Dasgupta said she felt “completely paralysed”. “I lived in constant fear that I wasn’t good enough, especially after I started losing work. Every time I opened a work email, I was worried that they were ending it with me,” she said.Virtual consultations by psychiatrists and psychologists helped many people living with mental health concerns, including Dasgupta. “One thing that helped was there was a lot of conversation around mental health during the pandemic. The government also helped by allowing tele and virtual consultations and prescriptions. Many state and city-level psychiatric societies also started helpline services that counselled people and, in some cases, also provided consultation,” Chavda added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-effect-health-issues-became-tough-to-manage-101615404932558.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||House passes resolution to condemn ED raid on Khaira||The Punjab Assembly on Wednesday passed a resolution condemning the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid on rebel AAP member Sukhpal Singh Khaira during its ongoing budget session. The resolution was moved by parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra and was unanimously passed. The resolution says, “the House expresses its concern on the current role of the central agencies such as CBI, ED, NIA etc, which have been set up to ensure transparency in public life but unfortunately, there have been apparent instances whereas these agencies have been used to harass innocent people including the farmers, politically elected representatives and even some government offices”. It further said that ‘during the ongoing session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, a member of this House, (Khaira), has been compelled to remain absent from participating in the proceedings of the House and disabled him from discharging his constitutional obligations as an elected representative of his constituency due to the unwarranted and unconstitutional interference by the ED, which has been noticed and condemned by the august House, unanimously”. “Therefore, the house strongly condemned such unwarranted and unconstitutional use of the central agencies and urges the Government of India to refrain from infringing upon the rights of the elected representatives of the people by subverting the due process of law and uphold the tenets of the democratic set up in the country,” the resolution read. The resolution was supported by cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi and former minister Navjot Sidhu. Earlier, the issue was raised by rebel AAP MLA Kanwar Sandhu during zero hour. He suggested that the state assembly should pass a resolution to condemn the ED action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/house-passes-resolution-to-condemn-ed-raid-on-khaira-101615404870227.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Question hour: ₹71,551 crore investment received in four years: Arora||The Punjab government has received 1,779 investment proposals worth ₹71,551 crore in the last four years, said industries and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora during question hour on Wednesday. Replying to a question, the minister said the proposals envisaged employment of 2.8 lakh. Akali MLA NK Sharma had asked the minister about MoUs signed by the state government, investment proposed and employment generated. “After March 2017, state has signed about 300 MoUs worth ₹52,289 crore approximately. Out of this, projects wroth around ₹25,000 crore are under production or construction. The state stopped entering into MoUs since around last two years,” the minister said in his written reply. Dept to send team to check sewerage system Local government minister Brahm Mohindra said he will send an independent team to Begowal to check the state of the sewarage system in the nagar panchayat. The minister gave the assurance in response to Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s question regarding repair of non-functional sewage system in the area. Mohindra informed the House that 100% work of sewerage system was completed in Begowal town in 2017. “It is being operated and maintained properly. As of now, there is no requirement or proposal to repair it,” he said. However, Khaira told the minister that the sewerage system was in a terrible condition and private contractors had sublet the work. “The situation was very different from the report given by officials to the minister and the available infrastructure is inadequate,” the MLA said, requesting him to get it verified independently. The minister responded by stating he will send a team to get the facts checked. ‘Varsity stone to be laid soon’ Higher education and languages minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa said the foundation stone of Guru Tegh Bahadur State University of Law at Kairon village of Tarn Taran will be laid soon. Responding to Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill’s question, the minister said that classes would commence from academic session 2021-22. Gill said the foundation stone should be laid before the 400th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Majithia also asked the minister to specify the date on which the foundation stone would be laid, terming the funds allocated for the project as inadequate. The minister said the government would allocate the required funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/question-hour-rs-71-551-crore-investment-received-in-four-years-arora-101615404630177.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Zero hour: SAD, AAP members stage walkouts from Punjab assembly||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs on Wednesday staged a walkout from the Punjab Vidhan Sabha over the alleged misbehaviour of the Congress workers with anganwadi workers protesting in Bathinda against the budget presented by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. The Akali MLAs led by Bikram Singh Majithia walked out of the state assembly during the ‘zero hour’ demanding the withdrawal of cases registered against the protesting anganwadi workers. Majithia raised the issue, accusing Congress workers of vulgar behaviour with the women workers protesting outside the finance minister’s office, and then led the party legislators into the well of the House. Speaker Rana KP Singh told the Akali members to go back to their seats. “You have raised the issue. The government is not required to give a reply during the zero hour,” he said. The SAD MLAs kept raising slogans against the government. As they were leaving, Manpreet entered the House and offered to give his reply, but the Akali members did not stop. The finance minister denied the allegations, stating that no Congress workers had misbehaved. The speaker told him that there was no needed to clarify. AAP protest against new tax A few minutes later, legislators of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also walked out of the House to protest against the Punjab Infrastructure Development and Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, being brought by the Congress government to impose a new tax on people of the state. AAP MLA Aman Kumar Arora accused the state government of cheating the people by burdening them with a new tax on petrol, diesel and immovable property. “The state government, in its budget, stated that no new tax is being imposed but is quietly bringing the bill to put an additional burden of at least ₹216 crore. Is this a joke?” he said, accusing it of looting people to fill its coffers. The speaker told the member to take it up when the bill is brought for discussion. Arora and other AAP members went into the well of the House before staging the walkout, raising slogans against the state government and its proposed tax. “We will continue our protest until the Congress government withdraws this black bill,” Arora later told reporters. Earlier, leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema also raised the issue of the power department’s instructions to its staff to switch to a private mobile service provider against whom the farmers of the state have been holding protests for the past several months. “The chief minister is the minister for this department and these instructions amount to betrayal with farmers,” he said, demanding a probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zero-hour-sad-aap-members-stage-walkouts-from-punjab-assembly-101615404392709.html

After the planning department finalises the drawings of the project, we will estimate the cost for the project, and again seek the approval of the MC House on it.”Earlier, the MC’s plan to construct a banquet hall had come a cropper because of financial and land issues. There were proposals to construct banquet halls in Manimajra and near the Hallomajra roundabout, which couldn’t take off either despite approval.On the need for a banquet hall, an MC official said, “The city doesn’t have a proper banquet hall for residents to hold functions, particularly marriage ceremonies. People have to go outside the city to areas like Zirakpur to hold such functions. The banquet hall will also help the MC generate additional revenue.”In addition to approving the construction of the banquet hall, the MC House in its meeting held on Tuesday also gave the go ahead to the reconstruction of three community centres at sectors 16, 22, 29 and Thakur Dwara, Manimajra. A new community centre will come up at Sector 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-s-first-banquet-hall-to-come-up-in-industrial-area-101615403850493.html

There were times when I felt that I would never see my children again,” said Prabhavati Jaiswar, 53, as she busies herself at the stove making coffee in her 10 x 10 ft home in Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, one of localities in densely-populated Dharavi. Her youngest, nine-year-old Ganesh sits on the doorstep with his friends, their legs dangling close to the narrow open drain outside.There are six people in that room, some on chairs, others crouched on the floor, and everyone is talking about the third phase of the vaccination drive that will begin in a few days. No one has a mask on. Jaiswar hands over a cup of too-sweet coffee to each, including her school-going daughter, Shilpa (16). Jaiswar’s older daughter, 18-year-old Sheetal is on a mezzanine floor above us. She surfaces after Jaiswar calls out – earphones plugged in, eyes planted on the phone screen – to receive her cup. Her college class is going on, but no one below is bothering to lower their volume. Jaiswar’s oldest, 22-year-old Durgesh, is out at work.On March 25, 2020, Jaiswar was visiting her husband’s family in Uttar Pradesh as her mother-in-law had recently died. Her husband could not attend his mother’s cremation as he lives and works in Kuwait. Prabhavati was stuck in the village as all transport was stopped during the lockdown, enforced to curb the spread of the virus. She spent the next three months away from her children. “The whole chawl was amazed at how my youngest was brave enough to stay without his mother for such a long time,” Jaiswar said.In mid May, the lane outside the Jaiswars’ house was sealed after a person was found to be Covid positive. This meant that even stepping out to use the community toilet complex – located on the main road, close to the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex -- was disallowed during the day. Volunteers who came to deliver packets of food – organized by the Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation, the area’s legislator Varsha Gaikwad, the local corporators like Vasant Nakashe and Harshala More, and citizen groups like Dharavi Boys made up of Durgesh and his friends who pooled their earnings to help neighbours – couldn’t enter the lane either.“I was so afraid – we all were so fearful in the initial days. I thought, any of us could die at any point and we wouldn’t even be together,” Jaiswar said. “The real virus of the pandemic was fear.”A year after Mumbai recorded its first Covid-19 patient, Dharavi -- a slum spread over 2.4 sq km in the heart of Mumbai with at least 850,000 residents and a population density of 354,167 people per sq km, or 17 times that of Mumbai -- has seen a spike in daily cases reported in the past month.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi, recently announced that the BMC was going to resume screening people for symptoms as Dharavi recorded 12 cases on March 10. So far, Dharavi has recorded 5195 cases and 316 deaths. There are 99 active covid-19 cases in Dharavi as of March 10.Experts, government officials and residents agree on one thing: while the pandemic tore through Mumbai, which was one of the worst-hit cities in the country, in Dharavi, a looming health crisis was largely averted.Dharavi is home to migrants, who work in the construction industry, or as domestic helps in neighbouring tony localities, as well as different communities practicing trades like pottery or leather manufacturing. Nearly 283,000 people use the 450 community toilets in the slum and each hutment, the same size as Jaiswar’s home, houses on an average 8-10 people. Most localities have narrow lanes with two or three-storied houses where often, top floors double as factories for the several cottage industries that Dharavi is known for, such as plastic recycling and garment manufacturing. Where then was the space to quarantine at home, or practice social distancing? After the first case was detected on April 1, 2020, it took 17 days to record the first 100 cases, six days to record the next 100, and only five days to record another 100.Yet, on July 11, World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Dharavi as an example of an intense Covid-19 outbreak that was brought under control. A sero-surveillance survey released that month revealed that 57% of slum-dwellers, taken from a random sample of 7000 residents, had antibodies for the coronavirus; compared to that, only 16% of the population that did not live in slums, had antibodies. On April 1, Dharavi’s first case was detected, posthumously. The 56-year-old man was a resident of Dr Baliga Nagar, a set of nine multi-storied buildings. His family refused to speak: “It has been traumatic for us. We are trying to move on and don’t want to relive what happened,” one of his daughters who refused to give her name, said.The man had no travel history, but he developed symptoms on March 23 following which he visited his local doctor who gave cough medication. Six days later, the man began to face difficulty breathing and he was admitted to Sion hospital, where he was tested for Covid. His positive result came on April 1 shortly after he passed away.The gated colony where he lived was sealed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on April 1. Within a week, four other hotspots were sealed in Dharavi; Baliga Nagar remained a containment zone till April 21. For the first two weeks, cases were concentrated in five areas: Kalyanwadi, Mukund Nagar, Social Nagar, Muslim Nagar, and Madina Nagar. Within a month the number of hotspots increased to 10. By the end of April, Dharavi had over 180 containment zones.“We lived through so many misconceptions about the infection, and rumors. Everyone believed life was over now that they have contracted the virus. We did not step out of our homes even after April 21, because we didn’t want to be a containment zone again,” said Saida Khan, a 48, a resident of Dr Baliga Nagar, who tuition classes came to stop due to the pandemic. Her husband, who runs a contract business in the construction industry, also lost business and the family had to dip into their savings of ₹23,000 to sustain through the lockdown.Though the lockdown is long over, Khan is not keen to resume tuitions despite requests from parents. “I am afraid to allow so many people into my home, or take on responsibility of so many children during a pandemic,” she said.“We had a three-pronged strategy to stop virus transmission in the community: High number of tests, contact tracing, and shifting as many people as possible to institutional quarantine facilities. Without this in place, the situation would have become difficult to manage,” said Dighavkar.Dharavi traced up to 24 contacts for every Covid-positive person, in contrast with the city’s average of 10 to 15 contacts. The BMC acquired three private hospitals in Dharavi, and set up 22 Covid Care Centres with 4,447 beds in April and May.Four large quarantine centres for high risk contacts were set up, the first came up at the Rajiv Gandhi Sports complex with 300 beds. Others came up in the Mahim Nature Park (1200 beds), Dharavi municipal school (700 beds) and Manohar Joshi Vidyalaya (also 700 beds). High risk contacts were also moved to the quarantine centres in Dadar and Mahim. After initially starting a door-to-door screening system, the BMC set up fever camps and roped in private doctors. Fever camps were temporarily set up at various locations across Dharavi. Residents living nearby would walk-in to get a Covid-19 test done, or get checked by a doctor.On June 23, Dharavi recorded only five cases, the lowest since April 5. BMC data from that month shows that by then, 548,270 people had been screened. “Dharavi is a success story. It managed to minimise the infection rate and outbreak very effectively and very quickly. What changed is not just in terms of transmissibility of the virus. Genetic factors, actual genotype of the virus, socio-economic factors could have contributed to high case fatality rate (CFR), though it is difficult to say for sure. Uncontrolled co-mordidity contributes to high CFR, but how much uncontrolled co-morbidity is or was there in Dharavi’s population is difficult to derive without data. Having hypertension in itself is not a problem, it is a problem only if your metabolism is in a state of inflammation, in which case co-morbidity can cause a problem in recovery,” Dr Om Shrivastav, a consultant for infectious diseases, said.According to Dighavkar, strict measures put in place by the municipal body helped curb the spread of the disease.Within the first fortnight of the lockdown, the BMC stopped sale of fruits and vegetables in Dharavi. BMC staff and volunteers helped deliver groceries door-to-door, and community volunteers stepped in to ensure that no household lacked essential goods.The BMC sealed the borders of slum and set up 24 check-posts at all entry/exit points to monitor movement control. Strict containment measures were deployed in virus hotspots. All forms of transportation services and movement of vehicles were stopped; all small industries, shops, and markets across the slum area were shut down. Within weeks, the bustling locality had turned into a ghost town.“We did a drone survey of Dharavi in the middle of the lockdown in May and saw that not a single person was out on the street. Citizens cooperated with the authorities very well,” Dighavkar said.But that’s not how some residents remember it. Satish Dubey, a resident of Rajiv Gandhi nagar and one of the people sitting in Jaiswar’s one-room home volunteered with the BMC to distribute food and ration kits to residents of his locality.“The police would hit people with their lathis if they found anyone on the street, even if the person had to go out to buy some medicine or use the community toilet. We even complained to the police station to get the local cops to stop their high handedness,” Dubey, 22, said. “All that did was add to our fear.”At least 100,000 migrants living in Dharavi left for their hometowns on foot in April before the Centre started special trains for them.“We were already out of jobs and out of money. In the initial months, we thought that if we get the virus, we would die,” Dubey said.In a recent Ease of Living Survey released by the Centre, Greater Mumbai ranked high on resilience, or the ability to deal with natural disasters. This was in full display in Dharavi, as volunteer groups kicked into action.Labour contractor Avirath Shinde, 36, recalls how he and the labourers who remained in Dharavi after the lockdown went door to door distributing essential food items, hand sanitizers, or helping the sick and elderly commute to the nearest fever camp. Avirath tested positive for Covid on May 8, along with three other members of his family.“When I was discharged from the hospital, all my neighbours helped with sanitizing my house, providing my family and children with cooked food, and doing grocery runs for us. Dharavi also managed to deal with the pandemic largely because of its community spirit,” Shinde said.In another part of Dharavi, Nawneet Ranjan who runs Dharavi Diary, an innovation project run with company’s CSR funds to train the area’s school-going students in technology and digital tools, began to work on a database. With the help of motley band of students, he began to record the needs of the residents in that area. Then, he began to raise funds over social media platforms and also helped distribute food and ration kits. “Between July and September, we raised around ₹25 lakh, and supplied ration kits to over 10,000 families,” Ranjan said.By July, Dharavi’s small and medium scale businesses were permitted to resume operations. Dharavi has 5000 GST registered businesses, and over 15,000 single room factories, with a turnover of one billion US dollars annually, according to BMC data. But recovery has been slow.Mohammad Shamshad Sher, 41, who owns an embroidery business in Dharavi and operates from a small 20X20 ft room on the second floor of a tin-roofed hutment, used to own three shops and employed over 60 people. Now, however, he can only operate one of them.Mohammad pays ₹15,000 rent for his workshop, and though the landlord had waived off the rent for the lockdown months, that is not the case any longer.“I have employed only 10 labourers right now, because there is no work. If we do not get orders, then I cannot pay everyone. Most of the labourers I work with went home after the lockdown. Not everyone has returned. Even if they return, where is the work?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/a-slum-fights-a-virus-101615403372778.html
11-03-2021||Other||A year of Covid: How Lucknow dealt with the challenge||There are 19 patients currently admitted to the Covid ICU at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) against a capacity of 251 beds, a sharp contrast to the times when occupancy was 100% for several months at a stretch and getting admission was a herculean task.KGMU was the first health facility in the state to admit Covid patients on March 11 last year. Since then, the journey from a “no beds” scenario to a “few cases” hasn’t been easy and doctors say they don’t want to remember some aspects of it.Lucknow has reported 82,042 cases till now and Uttar Pradesh has logged 6,04,648 cases. (The first case in UP was reported from Agra on March 2 last year.)“It was perhaps the toughest phase in the medical field that I would not like to remember though Covid management taught us a lot and many things were added to the healthcare system,” said Dr D Himanshu, medical superintendent at KGMU, who managed the treatment of Covid patients since the beginning of the pandemic in the state.Of the four ICU wards, only two of them have patients while the other two are reserved for Covid patients, but no patients are currently admitted there.“There was a time when beds were full despite the rising number of serious patients. But the rush has gone down. Now, with vaccination going on, the confidence level is high,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Lucknow.The state capital has done over 19 lakh Covid tests in one year including about 8.75 lakh RT-PCR tests, the data from the health department says.The Covid tests began in March 2020 soon after the first case was reported on March 11. Along with RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), rapid antigen, TrueNat and CBNAT tests were introduced in the labs to confirm Covid infection among suspected patients. The total count of these tests in Lucknow reached 1,907,312 on Wednesday. In the state, 32,375,774 tests have been done.“This is the last phase, which can lead us to victory against Covid infection but we need to maintain utmost precaution,” said Dr Ved Prakash, head of the department of pulmonary critical care medicine at KGMU.Tough for the first few patientsThe Lucknow’s first case was that of a woman doctor, who had come from Canada to meet the family. She was admitted to KGMU. “It took her 20 days to recover but being the first patient, it was a difficult case,” said Dr Virendra Atam, head of the department of medicine at KGMU.Dr Tauseef Khan, the first KGMU doctor to test positive, said there was initial apprehension after he was found infected with Covid, but he gradually recovered.“I tested positive while performing my duty in the ward. Hence, I had no grudges. I was confident I would win and I donated plasma after recovery,” said Dr Tauseef Khan, who got married recently.Celebrity singer Kanika Kapoor also tested positive for the Covid infection in Lucknow and was admitted to SGPGI in March last year.“It was a bad phase for us. Those were the initial days of the spread of the coronavirus. Since my daughter (Kanika) is a celebrity, it attracted huge attention. Thankfully, things are now back on track and she is doing her work as usual,” said Rakesh Kapoor, father of ‘Baby Doll’ singer Kanika Kapoor, who tested positive for Covid-19 soon after returning from overseas on March 9, 2020.Umashankar of Lakhimpur Kheri district, who tested positive and got admitted to KGMU last year, said his life has changed now.“I had returned from a trip to Turkey on March 8, and I felt sick. On March 18, I tested positive for the coronavirus and my neighbours started avoiding me and my family in the village in which I live,” said Umashankar.But his life changed, the day he donated plasma to save the lives of other Covid patients.“When I donated plasma and people read about it in the newspapers, their attitude changed drastically. They started respecting me,” said Umashankar.Telemedicine a key toolSmartphone became a major tool for Dr Kauser Usman, head of the department of geriatric medicine at KGMU who attended over 500 covid patients, prescribed them medication and saved them from panic.“During the months of July, August, September and October, when maximum cases were reported, I got at least 15 calls from patients every day, discussing the symptoms, advising medication and tests, reading their reports and telling them the warning (signs) and non-serious symptoms,” said Dr Usman.“I knew our resources at hospitals may fall short anytime as the cases multiplied geometrically. Hence, attending to patients at the very beginning could help reduce the burden on hospitals and I am satisfied we could do it,” said Dr Usman.“Plasma therapy, too, was among the new things. We started it first in the state in April and gradually came up with a plasma bank by August 15, 2020. Till today, we have received 450 units of plasma donated for Covid patients and issued some 600 units,” said Dr Tulika Chandra, head of the department of transfusion medicine at KGMU.“Our first plasma donor was Dr Nazia, the first Covid patient in Lucknow and the second donor was Dr Tauseef, the first KGMU staffer to test positive,” said Dr Tulika.COVID TESTS IN LUCKNOW19,07,312 Total Covid samples tested in Lucknow till March 10, 2021:Over 8,75,876 RT-PCR tests (maximum of 1,37,846 in September 2020)Over 7,85,206 Antigen testsOver 63,371 TrueNat testsPositive cases in Lucknow (month-wise)March 2020: 9April 2020: 197May 2020: 166June 2020: 734July 2020: 6,928August 2020: 19,319September 2020: 25,577October 2020: 10,364November 2020: 8,142December 2020: 6,996January 2021: 2,941February 2021: 513March 2021: 78UP’S GRIM COVID MILESTONESOne lakh: August 4, 2020 (1,00,310 cases)Two lakh: August 26, 2020 (2,03,028 cases)Three lakh: September 12, 2020 (3,05,831 cases)Four lakh: October 1, 2020 (4,03,101 cases)Five lakh: November 10, 2020 (5,01,311 cases)Six lakh: January 30, 2021 (6,00,079 cases)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-year-of-covid-how-lucknow-dealt-with-the-challenge-101615403309659.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||55 test Covid +ve in Haryana’s Panchkula, highest in 2 months||Panchkula district reported 55 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the highest in the past two months. The numbers have been on the rise since the beginning of this month, with 319 cases reported in the first 10 days, which is more than the cases that surfaced throughout February (313). Meanwhile, the number of active cases has jumped from 124 at the beginning of the month to 310, and recovery rate has dropped from 97.4% to 95.8%. The total number of cases has reached 11,155. While 10,696 people have been cured, 149 have succumbed to the virus.“We are fully prepared to deal with the situation. We have again increased testing and reassessed our preparations in terms of bed availability,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula.Dr Kaur said both Ayush and ESI departments have been asked to provide additional staff for Covid-19 duty, and a Covid-care centre has been made functional at BRS Medical college again. It was discontinued last month.“We are trying to vaccinate a large number of people, and would try to reduce mortality as much as possible,” she said.Follow Covid appropriate behaviour: DCOn Wednesday, deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja chaired a meeting, where it was decided that police should intensify the drive to challan people found without masks in public places. Apart from this, there will be restrictions on gathering of people in public places and increased sampling in hot spots.Ahuja has also directed that in view of the pandemic, Mahashivratri festival on Thursday will be celebrated with due diligence at all religious places, especially at Saketri where the congregation is in large numbers.“It is necessary and expedient to ensure strict compliance of the guidelines/standard operation procedures issued by the government with regard to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he said.The civic body was directed to sanitise the temple premises at regular intervals. Incident commanders assisted by police personnel have been tasked with keeping vigil in their respective jurisdictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/55-test-covid-ve-in-haryana-s-panchkula-highest-in-2-months-101615403250285.html
11-03-2021||Chandigarh||Restrictions on gatherings are back in Chandigarh||Imposing fresh restrictions in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases, the Chandigarh administration on Wednesday decided to keep primary schools in the city closed. A cap was also imposed on the number of attendees at social, cultural, religious and family gatherings.In a review meeting with senior officials, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the school authorities to talk to parents so that their children take proper precautions against Covid-19, both inside and outside schools. The health and education department will also finalise modalities to conduct sampling in schools, it was decided.For indoor gatherings, a maximum number of 100 people or 50% of the capacity of the venue, whichever is lower, will be allowed. For outdoor gatherings, the cap has been kept at 200 people, which is the same as that imposed by the Punjab government.At 819, the number of Covid-19 cases reported in the first 10 days of March has already surpassed the total reported in February (813). With 87 fresh cases on Wednesday, the number of active cases shot up from 430 in the beginning of the month to 816. The recovery rate dropped from 96.4% to 94.8% in the same period.Meanwhile, the death of a 55-year-old man from Sector 48 took the toll to 357. The total number of cases has climbed to 22,589, with 21,416 patients cured so far.‘Increase testing, checking for violations’Expressing deep concern over the rising number of cases, Badnore asked the officials to ensure strict implementation of Covid appropriate behaviour. He directed the deputy commissioner and police to intensify checking and impose fine on people violating the guidelines.A special drive will be started by police to ensure that social distancing is properly maintained at restaurants and inside shops at various markets and also at crowded places.The administrator also said there should be an increase in testing and contact tracing all over the city. He said crowded places, such as bus stands, railway station, apni mandis, markets and Sukhna Lake, should be focused. He also called for special arrangements to screen and test residents of various welfare homes and hostels.Badnore asked the health department to again use the hospital in Sector 48 for Covid-19 patients and to keep Covid care centres earlier opened at Dhanwantry Hospital, Sector 46, and Sood Dharamshala, Sector 22, ready for any exigencies.More vaccination sites made operationalThe officials concerned were also directed to provide proper facilities at vaccination centres, so that senior citizens do not have to wait for their turn for a long time. They should not be asked to stand in queues and instead should be provided with proper seating arrangement before and after vaccination, it was decided.Meanwhile, more vaccination centres have been operationalised in the city, with the total number of sites reaching 40. The new sites have been opened at health centres in Sectors 26, 35, 38, Panjab University and Palsora. On Wednesday, 2,867 people were inoculated, including 1,930 senior citizens and comorbid group.Parida blames Mohali for infection surgeUT adviser Manoj Parida has attributed the rise in cases to the spike seen in the neighbouring Mohali district.“Besides social gatherings, there were municipal elections in Mohali last month, leading to a huge mobility in the area. The maximum increase is being witnessed in Mohali, and we see it as a major cause for the spike in Chandigarh as well,” he said.Sharing details about testing to be carried out across 144 government schools in the city, Parida said mobile testing teams will be deputed for the purpose.“The process will be voluntary for teachers as well as children who are visiting the schools. The education and health departments will fix the modalities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/restrictions-on-gatherings-are-back-in-chandigarh-101615403071749.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran death: Know Sachin Vaze, the police officer who was transferred||A day after leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis sought the arrest of Mumbai crime branch officer Sachin Vaze, home minister Anil Deshmukh announced his transfer in the legislative council on Wednesday. “We have decided to move Sachin Vaze. He will be moved from Crime Branch. An impartial inquiry will be done and whoever is guilty will face action,” Deshmukh told the House on the last day of the Assembly session, as Bharatiya Janata Party demanded his suspension. The 49-year-old cop finds himself at the centre of political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is in opposition in the state, and the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition, with both sides trading barbs. On Wednesday, Vaze reached the Mumbai police headquarters in Crawford Market around noon and had a two-hour long meeting with Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh. Through the course of the day, he also met other senior officers in the crime branch.Later in the evening, Vaze told media persons gathered at the headquarters that he had had conversations with senior police officials about the allegations made against him . “I will clarify my side of the story and release a statement on Thursday,” he said. Vaze met the ATS team investigating the murder of Mansukh Hiran, who recorded his statement over the span of eight hours on Monday.Fadnavis told reporters outside the Assembly that the MVA government was worried that Vaze might disclose links to some people in the government in the Hiran death case. “After we raised the issue in the lower house, state home minister admitted during our meeting in the presence of deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal to suspend Vaze. However, later, the chief minister intervened and the decision was changed,” Fadnavis said. In turn, Sena legislator Bhaskar Jadhav said that Vaze was being targeted because he was involved in the arrest of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, who is implicated in the 2018 suicide of a designer, and alleged that Fadnavis had protected the journalist, as he was chief minister at the time. “Vaze is being targeted because he was in the team which arrested Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami [in November 2020] for his alleged involvement in the Naik case,” Jadhav said. Who is Sachin Vaze, and why has his name come up in connection with the death of Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer linked to the SUV found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter? A day after a Scorpio was found parked on Carmichael Road, Deshmukh released a video statement stating that the Mumbai crime branch would investigate the case. Assistant police inspector Sachin Hindurao Vaze (49), who headed the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai police crime branch, took the lead in the investigation. The Scorpio was traced to 48-year-old Hiran, a Thane resident, who had reported the car stolen on February 18. Hiran was called in for questioning after the link was discovered, thanks to the stolen vehicle complaint filed by him at Vikhroli police station. On March 4, Hiran died under mysterious circumstances: his body washed up on a creek in Thane district, his mouth stuffed with handkerchiefs and covered with a scarf, and all his personal belongings, including his ring, chain and wrist watch, missing from the body. Three days later, Hiran’s wife, Vimla (43), gave a statement to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad investigating team that she was certain Hiran had been murdered, and she suspected Vaze had a hand in it. “Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of the statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Her statement revealed that Hiran knew Vaze well, and that he had lent him the Scorpio in question in November. Vaze returned the car on February 5. Vaze did not respond to repeated calls and messages. The story will be updated when and if he responds. From police to politics Vaze joined the Maharashtra police force in 1990 as a sub inspector. His first posting was in Gadchiroli, a Naxal affected area and he was moved to Thane city police in 1992. It was here that he gained a reputation of being a good criminal investigator. He was later inducted in the Special Squad of Thane crime branch, where he gained a reputation as an encounter specialist. In 2000, Vaze was transferred to the Powai unit of the Mumbai crime branch. It was during his stint here when, together with three other policemen, he faced a charge of murdering Khawaja Yunus, an accused in the December 2, 2002, Ghatkopar blast case when a bomb placed under the seat of a BEST bus parked outside Ghatkopar railway station went off, killing two persons and injuring several others. Yunus, a 27-year-old software engineer, was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch, and later reportedly died in police custody. The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) charged Vaze and three other police personnel -- Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai -- with murder and destruction of evidence on March 3, 2004. Following this, Vaze was placed under suspension. Vaze eventually resigned from service on November 30, 2007. The following year, he joined the Shiv Sena. The assistant police inspector was eventually reinstated in the police force on June 6, 2020. So were the three other policemen who were booked for their alleged involvement in Yunus’s custodial death. A dispute over the framing of charges in this case is pending before the Bombay high court. High-profile arrests At his current position in the CIU, Vaze handled a few high-profile cases, including the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case in which 15 persons including Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) were arrested. The case pertained to Republic TV, owned by ARG Outlier Media, which had allegedly benefited from purported manipulations of TRPs. The CIU filed a voluminous charge-sheet against Vikas Khanchandani, CEO of Republic TV, Dasgupta and Romil Ramgarhia, former CCO of BARC, earlier this year in January. Vaze was also part of the police team that arrested news anchor Arnab Goswami in November 2020, in connection with designer Anvay Naik’s suicide. The police said that Naik and his mother Kumud Naik were found dead in May 2018. According to a suicide note, Naik alleged that he and his mother were forced to end their lives because he was not paid his dues amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami and two others identified as Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda -- owners of two different firms, they added. On December 28, 2020, Vaze arrested famous sports car designer Dilip Chhabria after police found that he and his firm, Dilip Chhabria (DC) Designs Pvt Ltd, in connection with allegations of cheating and forgery to avail loans on sports cars made by his firm. Vaze was also handling the case registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan after his exchange of legal notices with actor Kangna Ranaut in 2016. The case was originally registered with the Cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex and was recently transferred to the CIU for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mansukh-hiran-death-know-sachin-vaze-the-police-officer-who-was-transferred-101615402710458.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt wants petrol, diesel be brought under GST||In his reply to the debate on budget in state Assembly, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said on Wednesday the state wants petrol and diesel to be brought under the Goods and Services Taxes regime, so that the prices are reduced. Pawar said that until the decision is taken, the Centre should take steps to reduce its own taxes on fuel to give respite to citizens. Pawar said the state government would, like a few other states, support the move, if the Centre brings petrol and diesel under GST. Under current financial conditions, the Maharashtra government is not in a position to reduce the VAT levied on fuel, he said. At the same time, Pawar announced an increase in the area development fund used by the legislators in their constituencies. It has now been increased to ₹4 crore from the existing ₹3 crore a year. He also announced restoration of the 30% cut initiated on the salary of the legislators from April 2020 in the wake of outbreak of Covid-19. The restoration will come into effect from March 2021. Legislators (288 in Assembly and 78 in council) draw a salary of about ₹2 lakh a month, including allowances. Pawar also assured the legislators to take a decision about the salary of the drivers of the legislators soon. Tweaking his decision announced in the state budget, Pawar announced on Wednesday to increase the excise duty on branded and non-branded country liquor to 220% from 213%. In budget, it was increased only on branded country liquor. The finance minister also announced Marathi Bhasha Bhavan on a vacant plot at Jawahar Bal Bhavan at Chowpatty.

11-03-2021||Mumbai||13,659 cases in Maharashtra, CM Thackeray says decision on lockdown soon||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said the state government will have to take a call on a lockdown in the next few days if people continue to ignore precautions needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19, The state on Wednesday reported 13,659 Covid-19 cases, its first one-day spike in excess of 13,000 in 2021 and highest in 154 days (on October 7, 2020, the state saw 14,578 cases).The state has till date recorded 2,252,057 infections. The state also recorded 54 deaths on Wednesday, taking the toll to 52,619. Mumbai, which has been recording over 1,000 cases for a week now, also recorded 1,539 cases and five deaths, taking the tally to 337,124 and toll to 11,515 deaths.Speaking to mediapersons, Thackeray said the lockdown can still be avoided if people adopted Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and followed protocol. “Nobody likes a lockdown, even we do not like it. We do not want to impose restrictions on people. But people will have to follow the norms required to avoid it. We still can avoid a second lockdown. We will have to take some specific decision in the next few days. Covid-19 cases are on the rise. I still appeal to people to follow the protocol and guidelines laid down by the government. The vaccination drive is being implemented and will be ramped up in the coming days,” he said. On Wednesday, the Mumbai circle reported the highest number of cases (2,933), followed by Pune circle, which reported 2882 cases. Pune city itself recorded 1,384 cases in a day. The state has asked districts to tighten the grip by imposing limited lockdown, night curfews and increased contact tracing. A senior official from the public health department said, “The district administration is in favour of limited lockdown by imposing curbs on areas with a high positivity rate instead of a total lockdown in the state.” Jitendra Papalkar, Akola district collector said, “We have also been asked to push for institutional quarantine in cases where home isolation would not prove to be effective.”There are 99,008 active cases in the state, according to a statement released by the public health department. The highest number of active cases in Maharashtra was 301,752 on September 17, 2020, after which the tally went down to around 50,000 in December 2020. On Wednesday, 9,913 people also recovered from the infection, taking the total to 2,099,207 till date. However, the state’s case fatality rate (CFR) continues to hover around 2.34%.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state on Covid control, said the Central government must initiate vaccination for those in the age bracket of 24-40 too. “This is the age bracket involved in active life and most cases are also reported in this age group. Vaccination has to increase multi-fold in the state now.” On Tuesday, 148,777 citizens were vaccinated in the state, of which 94, 984 were senior citizens above the age of 60 and 15,819 were above the age of 45 with comorbidities.

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis moves breach of privilege motion against Maharashtra home minister||A day after state home minister Anil Deshmukh made serious allegations in the Anvay Naik suicide case, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis moved a breach of privilege notice against him, accusing Deshmukh of making a false allegation. He also said the allegations were made to mount pressure on him from performing his duties as the leader of opposition. Deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal said he would examine the notice and take appropriate decision. Naik was an interior designer based in Alibag in Raigad. He allegedly killed himself in 2018. Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was arrested in alleged connection with the case. When opposition legislators created a din over a demand to arrest a police officer Sachin Vaze, who is under scanner in the death of Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer linked to the car found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter, Deshmukh on Tuesday said Fadnavis as then chief minister had “covered up” Naik suicide case. “He made the statement despite a decision by the Supreme Court which said that prima facie evaluation of the FIR did not establish the ingredients of the offence of abetment to suicide,” Fadnavis said in the lower House. “The allegations against me are misleading.” Fadnavis announced moving another breach of privilege motion against PWD minister Ashok Chavan in Maratha reservation case. On Wednesday, Chavan made a statement in the lower House over Maratha reservation. He said that the Attorney General KK Venugopal during a hearing before the Supreme Court said that post 102nd Constitutional amendment in 2018 only the President or the central government can provide reservation to the backward classes and not states. By taking such a stand, the Centre has created doubt over validity of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act unanimously passed by this House to provide reservation benefits to the Maratha community. “However, the apex court accepted the state government’s request for seeking opinion of all the states whether the 50% ceiling limit on reservation needs to be reconsidered,” Chavan said. Fadnavis said that Chavan made a false statement in the House. “He (Ashok Chavan) tried to quote the Attorney General out of context,” he told reporters s. “I have mentioned what the Attorney General has said before the Supreme Court. We were expecting a clear stand of the (BJP led) central government over Maratha reservation but they (BJP) are taking different stands at different places. They (BJP) are taking a stand here in Maharashtra and another in Delhi,” Chavan told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-moves-breach-of-privilege-motion-against-maharashtra-home-minister-101615402290810.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reserves Kanjurmarg land for Metro car depot in DP 2034||Even as the Bombay High Court (HC) is yet to decide whether the saltpan land in Kanjurmarg, where the Metro depot has been proposed, belongs to the Centre or state, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday issued a notification to modify the reservation of the 43.76-hectare plot in the Development Plan (DP) 2034. According to the notification, the use of the land parcel, which was reserved for public purposes such as affordable housing, garden, and municipal school, has now been modified to ‘Metro car depot, casting yard and other metro uses’ with certain conditions. While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in October 2020 had announced that the depot for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) will be shifted from the controversial Aarey plot to Kanjurmarg, the Central government claimed ownership of the plot. In December 2020, the Bombay high court stayed the transfer of the land parcel to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). Recently, the MMRDA also moved the court seeking to vacate or modify the stay, stating it is a “public project of urgency”. In a text reply to HT, Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, urban development department, said the notification is not in contradiction to the on-going case as the “title is separate from reservation.” He also said the state had conducted a hearing for the change in reservation, post which the final notification was issued on Wednesday. The notification read: “...the Govt. is satisfied that in the public interest it is expedient to change reservations, land use in respect of the portion of the said land and Development Plan road pattern for proper connectivity in the nearby vicinity.” The notification also states the change in reservation is subject to certain conditions which are obtaining permissions for the land that falls under coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) and undertaking mitigation measures during the construction and operations stage. It further states that it will be binding on the authority to comply with the orders of the HC and the apex court in respect of the land. The state government is looking at building an integrated car depot at Kanjurmarg for line 3, 4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali) and line 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli). It has earlier stated that building an integrated depot will help save cost as well as land. Thackeray had also said that the land in Aarey would prove to be insufficient for Metro-3 in the coming years, making Kajurmarg the only viable option.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reserves-kanjurmarg-land-for-metro-car-depot-in-dp-2034-101615402289619.html

The IIT-Bombay Heritage Foundation, a non-profit organisation in the US, which annually raises funds through the Go IIT-B initiative, raised the funds between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021, almost 73% higher than its contribution last year (USD 2.08 million). At the existing conversion rate of ₹72.76 a dollar, this translates to around ₹26.19 crore. Last year, at an average conversion rate of ₹74.13 a dollar, the donation could be roughly translated to ₹15.42 crore. The announcement was made during the 62nd Foundation Day Ceremony of the institute. The donations come as a relief to the institute that has been recording a deficit of around ₹100 crore annually for the past four years. Faced with a severe cash crunch, the institute this year launched a new fund-raising initiative called the ‘Cherish IIT-Bombay’ for donors all over India and the world. As an ‘Institute of Eminence’, IIT-Bombay is set to receive ₹1,000 crore from the central government, but only a small part of it (around ₹43 crore) has been released so far. Following the tradition of the Foundation Day, the institute thanked all its donors for pitching in for the welfare of the institute. Among other donors were alumni of Hostel 5, who made a donation of ₹5 crore for the renovation of the hostel, said Suhas Joshi, dean, alumni and corporate relations, IIT-Bombay. Subhashis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B, said a research park was in the offing that will foster industry-academia collaborations. “The senate of IIT-Bombay has recently passed the proposal for an inter-departmental dual degree programme where engineering students can complete five years of training and be awarded an MBA degree,” he said, adding that a translational research academy that will help students realise their potential business ideas into an actual business model, was also in the pipeline. Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS, who was the chief guest, said, “Our company and IIT-B has been connected for a few decades through its alumni network. I hope that we will hold on to the partnership and look into the future, where the alumni will form the touch point of our relationship. At the institute level, we are aligned for research and development, academic purposes. We look forward to working together in a larger technological ecosystem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitb-receives-record-usd-3-6-million-in-donations-from-us-alumni-body-101615402230159.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC warns commissioners of being called to court for not complying with orders||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday pulled up the state and the eight municipal corporations that have failed to comply with the directions of the court to file affidavits regarding the illegal constructions in their jurisdiction and the action taken against them since the suo moto public interest litigation (PIL) was initiated by the HC last year. The court warned that it would be constrained to call all the municipal commissioners to court if their officials failed to comply with the HC directions and also chided the state for not setting up a special cell as per court directions, to oversee the issue of illegal constructions. Only two corporations have filed affidavits till now despite the court asking them to do so in October last year and January this year. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo-moto PIL was initiated after a dilapidated building collapsed in Bhiwandi on September 23, 2020, was informed by senior counsel Sharan Jagtiani, amicus curiae that only the state government and the BMC and Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation had complied with its January 13 order. The court had directed the eight corporations which included BMC and municipal corporations for Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur, to furnish details of compliance of section 152A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, and section 267A of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949 which pertained to of providing ward wise data of notices issued against unauthorised structures, steps taken against them, cases in which penalties were recovered and cases related to illegal structures under litigation.After hearing this an exasperated bench said, “Are you not able to gather data? What does this infer? Municipal commissioners from all corporations need to be made accountable if they are not following provisions of law and asking their officers to take action. Why this lawlessness?” The court then directed the advocates for the respective corporations to assist the commissioners and warned, “If you do not, we will call the commissioners next to court and make them answer. We do not want lip service. In January, we had passed an order and there was no compliance. It shows commissioners have not followed it.” The bench noted that during the lockdown period large scale illegal constructions had taken place and the state had failed to keep a check on it as it did not constitute a supervisory cell as directed by the court earlier. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state however submitted that the state was taking the help of geo-mapping experts to identify illegal and unauthorized constructions as well as curb them. The bench then chided the authorities for allowing illegal constructions to come up and then regularizing them without having scant regard for the process of law and said, “Violation is so rampant that even within two months, you (civic bodies) could not collect data.” The court then directed the government and civic bodies to file detailed affidavits by March 31 and posted a hearing of the PIL on April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-warns-commissioners-of-being-called-to-court-for-not-complying-with-orders-101615402110280.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai to get three new air quality monitors, first one to come up in Kalamboli||The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has received a no objection certificate (NOC) from the Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) to set up a continuous ambient air quality monitoring station (CAAQMS) in Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai. MPCB has also proposed to install two more CAAQMS in Kharghar and MIDC Taloja, for which clearances are in the process.MPCB revealed the details in response to a Right to Information (RTI) query by environment group Waatavaran Foundation on March 8, a copy of which was accessed by HT. This development comes on the heels of several complaints from residents and interest groups in Khargar-Panvel who have been demanding a clean air action plan specifically to deal with air pollution in the region.Bhagwan Keshbat, founder of Waatavaran Foundation, said, “Air pollution in Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt is significantly higher than in neighbouring Mumbai because of nearby industrial activity, especially the movement of heavy vehicles and burning of coal in factories. Residents can taste and smell the pollution in the air. It is difficult to keep your windows open in evenings.”Since there were no official air quality monitors in the area to check these allegations, Waatavaran in December last year released findings from a month-long, independently conducted observational study. Residents living at the edges of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the results suggested, were exposed to an air quality index (AQI) above safe limits for nearly two-thirds of the day, with peak pollution during early morning hours.The study, which used low-cost particulate matter sensors to obtain data, found high levels of atmospheric PM2.5, especially between 6am and 8am, and average air quality above safe standards for 17 hours every day. Air quality only improved during afternoon hours.Data from five locations — Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Taloja; Sector 13, Panvel; Navade, Taloja; Sector 7 and 36, Kharghar — showed average PM2.5 levels over 31 days to be 101.12 microgramme per cubic metre (μg/m3), which is almost twice the national safe standard of 60μg/m3, and four times the World Health Organization (WHO) standard (25μg/m3).The installation of three new CAAQMS will strengthen Navi Mumbai’s official air quality monitor networking, taking the total count to seven monitors. At present, MPCB’s has installed such devices at Mahake Naka, Airoli (near Sahakar Bazar), and one each in Nerul Sectors 46 and 19A. The new monitors will also expand the network’s geographical reach eastward across Panvel creek where state-monitoring infrastructure has been lacking so far. “This is an important move and we welcome this as Waatavaran strongly believes that monitoring of air quality in different parts of this belt including Kalamboli, Kharghar, Taloja MIDC and others is the very first step towards mitigating measures for air pollution,” the environment group said in a statement on Wednesday.It is unclear, however, when these monitors will be launched. HT reached out to the MPCB’s regional officer in Kharghar, Sachin Adkar, for a comment but did not receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-to-get-three-new-air-quality-monitors-first-one-to-come-up-in-kalamboli-101615401930694.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university earned ₹20 lakh in photocopy, ₹6.55 crore in re-evaluation in 2 years: RTI||A response to a Right to Information (RTI) query has revealed the University of Mumbai (MU) earned ₹20.09 lakh in fees for photocopying answer booklets and ₹6.55 crore in re-evaluation fees between the 2018-19 academic year until the first half of 2020. As per the year-wise data shared by the university, a large chunk of this money was collected in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years.“Applications for re-evaluation keep increasing at the university and the problem lies in the manner in which assessment of papers are conducted. MU needs to work on its assessment process to control re-evaluation requests,” said Vihar Durve, a city-based RTI activist. As per information shared by the university, it received ₹10.02 lakh, ₹9.92 lakh and ₹13,960 in 2018-19, 2019-20 and the first half of 2020 respectively for photocopy applications. Similarly, it received ₹3.73 crore, ₹2.74 crore and ₹7.76 lakh in re-evaluation fees in the three academic years. “At the time of receiving the RTI query, examinations at the university were still underway so we cannot share details about the current semester,” stated the response from MU.Officials from the university’s examination department said the high number of re-evaluation applications are not related to assessment errors. “Students often try their luck with re-evaluation just to find out if they can get one or two additional marks, so in many cases, students don’t apply for re-evaluation due to errors,” said an official on condition of anonymity.With the winter 2020 examinations having been conducted online, varsity officials clarified that students will not get the option of re-evaluation in the examination session because papers were conducted in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) format. “Also the first half of 2020 saw very few re-evaluation applications mainly because lockdown was implemented in March 2020 and then students’ applications were rejected once the university reopened in early June,” said a student.Last month, another RTI data from the board of examinations and evaluation shows that 87,567 students applied for re-evaluation in the first and second half of 2018. Of these, 39,652 students passed the exams after re-evaluation. This means that almost three in five students passed the exams after re-evaluation. “University’s claim that students apply for luck is wrong because many students end up passing exams after re-evaluation,” added Durve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-earned-20-lakh-in-photocopy-6-55-crore-in-re-evaluation-in-2-years-rti-101615401750556.html

11-03-2021||Mumbai||PIL seeks Bombay HC intervention for manufacturing MDR TB drugs||The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to decide on the representations made by two multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) survivors who have filed public interest litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the government to allow non-commercial production of two drugs Bedaquiline and Delamanid which are essential for the treatment of MDR-TB. The PIL was filed as the drugs, patents of which are solely with the government, are not available regularly resulting in a break in the treatment regime for the near-fatal ailment. The petitioners have said that if the Centre authorises other manufacturers by giving them the patents, the shortage problem would be resolved. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by Meera Yadav, an MDR and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) survivor and Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, an NGO run by another survivor was informed by senior advocate Anand Grover that after the World Health Organisation (WHO) had approved Bedaquiline and Delamanid as essential drugs for treating MDR and XDR TB, the patent for the medicines had been given to individual nations. After India got the patent, the same was given to two different pharmaceutical companies to undertake the manufacturing of the drugs. As the cost of the drugs was high and generic drugs were not allowed to be imported, the companies were asked to give the drugs as donations to the government which in turn would be used to treat patients. However, due to the high number of patients in India which has forced India to declare an emergency the government has to procure the medicines at a high price as well. According to the petition, a six-month course of Bedaquiline costs around ₹26,600 and Delamanid costs up to ₹91,414 per course implying that the government would have to shell out huge amounts for the treatment of a single patient being treated under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) now known as the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP). The petition states that as generic drugs are available for as cheap as ₹600-1,275 per month for both the Bedaquiline and Delamanid drugs, the Centre should be directed to issue compulsory licenses to other manufacturers by giving them the patents as it would reduce the burden of the cost of treatment per patient on the government. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the central government informed the bench that the petitioners had already made representations to the concerned authorities and the same would be taken up expeditiously hence the PIL should be disposed of. The court, however, observed that as the issue was of utmost importance as made out by the petitioners, it would keep the PIL pending and allow the Centre to decide on the representations which could then be placed before the bench for further consideration. Thus saying the court allowed the centre to respond after seven weeks and posted the hearing to April 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-seeks-bombay-hc-intervention-for-manufacturing-mdr-tb-drugs-101615401510156.html

Mahendra Yadav, a technician with a reputed linen fabric unit in Tarapur, allegedly killed his wife Madhuri, 45, in their Saravili flat during a fight. According to the couple’s 11-year-old daughter, Yadav had returned from work around 9pm, following which they were having dinner when the fight started, said senior inspector Pradip Kasbe of Boisar MIDC police station. As the fight escalated, the daughter and his 9-year-old brother went to neighbour, who came and pacified the couple. Around 2.30am, the couple again started fighting, following which their son went to get their neighbour. When Yadav opened the door to their neighbour after repeated knocks, the neighbour found Madhuri in a pool of blood. Yadav had slit her throat using a knife, which the police has seized, said Kasbe.Yadav then fled from the spot and went to the railway tracks near their building and jumped in front of a Mumbai-bound express train. The loco pilot informed the Boisar traffic control, who informed Palghar GRP. Palghar GRP has handed over the body to their relatives. “We have registered case of murder against the deceased. The two children are with the victim’s brother,” said a police officer.

11-03-2021||Mumbai||Need clarity on summer exams: Student groups to state, Mumbai university||The Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) has approached the state education department and state universities including the University of Mumbai (MU) seeking clarity on the mode of examinations for the summer 2021 session. “No one has shared any information regarding summer 2021 examination, whether the same will be held in the online or offline mode. Students need to prepare accordingly, therefore we request the varsity to release a clear statement,” said a spokesperson for MSWA. Many students have taken to various social media platforms to share their concern.In the first week of February, state education minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that colleges can reopen with not more than 50% attendance on campus at any given point of time. MU affirmed this move with circular asking colleges to approach local civic authority or the collector’s office before restarting physical classes in a phased manner. The circular also shared Covid-19 safety guidelines prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure the safety of staff and students.On February 12, however, after a meeting between officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and MU, civic officials said the reopening of colleges be postponed by a week until February 22. The idea was to examine if restarting local trains for the general public would have any effect on total Covid-19 cases in the city. At present, with Covid-19 cases on a rise, the decision to reopen colleges has been put off until further notice.“Since there has also been discussion on reopening of colleges, there’s confusion whether exams, if held in May this year, could be conducted offline as well. Whatever the scenario, there needs to be some clarification,” said another student.While a formal decision on the mode of examination for the summer 2021 session is still pending, an official from MU’s examination department said as of now, examinations will be held in the online mode only. “Unless we hear from the government on whether exams can be held in offline mode, we cannot make any announcement on the same,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-clarity-on-summer-exams-student-groups-to-state-mumbai-university-101615401391092.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||INS Karanj commissioned in Indian Navy||The third Scorpene-class submarine INS Karanj of Project-75 was commissioned into the Indian Navy on Wednesday, after two years of rigorous sea trials. The submarine was launched in January 2018 for sea trials and it will increase the strength and capability of the Indian Navy, said chief of naval staff (CNS) admiral Karambir Singh.Singh and retired admiral VS Shekhawat were present at the event. Shekhawat, who was part of the commissioning crew of the old Karanj and also its commanding officer during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, was the chief guest.Shekhawat, the 14th CNS who served as navy chief from September 30, 1993 to September 30, 1996, said, “We live in India and launch numerous satellites, build nuclear submarines, manufacture vaccines for the world. The new Karanj is another example of Make In India”. He said that between the first and second world wars submarines were hardly evolved. However, after the second world war, when electronic revolution started off, development and engineering began to take place and the nature of the submarine substantially changed. “There is a huge difference between the old Karanj and the new one. But one thing will never change, that is the sea and the dangers of the sea,” he added.Shekhawat quoted a British navy officer who insisted that “the hazard of the sea must always be given priority over the violence of the enemy, the enemy you might have to get away from, but from sea you can never escape if there is a danger situation.”“This Project-75 submarine is motivation to indigenisation, and Aatmanirbhar Bharat is a fundamental tenet of Indian Navy’s growth story and future operational capabilities,” Singh said.He added, “The Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, which was recently developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the trials have just been completed, will be ready in 2023. After that, when the first submarine will go for refit, AIP will be installed in her. AIP plug will increase the capability of submarines to spend more time underwater.” INS Karanj is India’s third of the six Scorpene-class submarines which have superior stealth and several major combat capabilities to defeat an enemy. INS Karanj, a diesel-electric attack submarine and built under Project-75 at Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited in Mumbai. The first submarine, INS Kalvari was launched in October 2015 and was commissioned in December 2017, five years behind the schedule. The second one, INS Khanderi, was launched in January 2017 for sea trials and commissioned in September 2019 and INS Karanj will be commissioned soon. After the tree submarines were handed over to the Indian navy, and multiple torpedoes and missile firing were undertaken during trials to confirm the fighting capability, said a Navy officer. The fourth submarine INS Vela was launched in May 2019 and is undergoing sea trials while the fifth one, INS Vagir, was launched in November 2020 and is also undergoing trials. The sixth submarine, INS Vagsheer, is in various stages of outfitting.Scorpene-class submarines can undertake multifarious types of missions such as anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying, area surveillance etc. The submarine is designed to operate in all theatres with means provided to ensure interoperability with other components of a Naval Task Force. It is a strong platform, marking a generational shift in submarine operations.The state-of- the-art technology utilised for construction of Scorpene-class submarines has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydro-dynamically optimised shape and the ability to launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision guided weapons. The attack can be launched with both torpedoes and tube launched anti-ship missiles at the same time, underwater or on surface. The stealth of this strong platform is enhanced by the special attention given to various signatures. These stealth features give it invulnerability, unmatched by most submarines.

The formation of the SIT comes a day after Jarkiholi claimed that he was aware of the political conspiracy being hatched against him for around four months.“In a letter, Ramesh Jarkiholi has said that there was a politically motivated attempt to defame him. He has requested to conduct a thorough investigation into the case. Based on this, after having discussions with the chief minister and senior police officers, we have decided to form an SIT (Special Investigation Team) to probe who conspired in this case and where the CD was prepared,” home minister Bommai said.He added that Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant has been asked to appoint Additional Commissioner of Police (West) Soumendu Mukherjee to head the SIT.Social activist Dinesh Kalahalli had alleged that Jarkiholi had sexually exploited an unnamed woman on the false promise of getting her a job in the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL). Kalahalli, however, on last Sunday withdrew his complaint. Following this, on Tuesday, Jarkiholi had called the video “fake”. “I knew about this conspiracy four months ago (and) was warned about it. I got a call 26 hours in advance from the high command, from my well-wishers that your CD will be released by 5-6 pm the next day. They asked me to take precautionary legal action, but I still did not do it. This is a major political conspiracy,” Jarkiholi had said on Tuesday.He further claimed that the entire conspiracy was hatched in two apartments around Yeshwantpur area of Bengaluru. He said there were two main conspirators and at least seven more behind them who hatched the plan. He refused to divulge any more details.His brother and Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Balachandra Jarkiholi on Sunday had alleged that conspirators spent over ₹15 crore to upload the video in Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-govt-forms-sit-for-probe-into-jarkiholi-harassment-case-101615401331755.html

Yediyurappa, who had promised to give his response on the topic, had gone absconding.“Yesterday the CM told us outside that I (CM) will give us an answer today. Today the CM has absconded,” Yatnal, a staunch critic of Yediyurappa, said in the Karnataka legislative assembly during the ongoing budget session.“Let the CM tell us what he feels about our community,” he said.Yatnal added that even the Congress’s leader of the opposition, Siddaramaiah, wanted to talk on the issue since he admired the community. “What about our CM’s love (for the community). He used the name of our community (Lingayats) and came to the chair (chief minister),” he said.His statements triggered a sharp reaction from M.P. Renukacharya, the chief minister’s political secretary and BJP legislator from Honnali in Davangere district.“The chief minister has not gone absconding. Whether it is Panchamasali, Veerashaiva, any of the subcastes or other scheduled castes or tribes… The CM has great respect for all of them. You shouldn’t talk like this,” he told Yatnal.The infighting between the BJP gave the Congress a chance to sit and watch the bickering within the ruling party from the comfort of the opposition benches.Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s home, law and parliamentary affairs minister on Wednesday said the Supreme Court’s decision to examine if the 50% reservation cap should be reviewed was a “beacon”.He said that after due consultations, Karnataka would also present its views before the apex court.“In the case relating to reservation for the Maratha community, the Supreme Court’s constitution bench has sought views from all the states, it is kind of a beacon for us in resolving these issues,” Bommai said.The statements come at a time when at least four dominant and politically influential communities have sought higher allocations of reservation and change of category among other requests.The Panchamasalis, Vokkaligas, Valmikis and Kurubas have intensified their reservation-related demands, further adding to Yediyurappa’s troubles.“To give them justice, everything has to be done under the provisions of the constitution and legal framework. As demands by various communities have come together, resolving it will lead to exceeding 50 per cent,” Bommai said.Yediyurappa has formed a three-member committee to look into the reservation-related demands of various communities.Unconvinced by Bommai’s response, Yatnal threatened to stage a protest inside the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/infighting-in-bjp-intensifies-amid-row-over-panchamasali-reservation-101615401331153.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Like captain of Titanic, judiciary should be last to get Covid-19 vaccine: Bombay HC chief justice||While chiding petitioning lawyers for being selfish and seeking Covid-19 vaccination for the judiciary on priority, ahead of others, through public interest litigation (PIL), the chief justice (CJ) of Bombay high court (HC) Dipankar Datta observed that as the number of vaccines available per day was limited, municipal employees who go from door to door providing essential services every day were more deserving of getting vaccinated on a priority. The CJ further held that just like the captain of the sinking ship Titanic who did not leave till all passengers were evacuated, the judiciary should be the last to get vaccinated. When informed that the Supreme Court (SC) was seized of a petition filed by the vaccine manufacturer seeking transfer of all such PILs filed in various high courts across the country to the SC, the CJ said the hearing would continue in the PIL on March 17 if there was anything amiss in the policy. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Vaishnavi Gholave and another through advocates Vinod Sangvikar and Yashodeep Deshmukh, was informed that it sought to declare members of the legal fraternity as frontline workers and get them the Covid-19 vaccination on a priority basis. The petition further stated that after lawyers were added to the list of essential service providers in October and were allowed to travel on local trains vaccinating members of the legal fraternity would avoid the risk of Covid-19 in courts where a large number of people assemble. After hearing the submissions in the PIL the CJ observed, “You are asking judges to be vaccinated first because they are Covid-19 warriors? Why not the municipal employees who come every day to your house to pick up garbage. There are people providing food during the lockdown. Aren’t they frontline workers?” The bench further said, “Why should we think of the lawyers, judges only? Why not the staff of private organisations? What happens when someone does not survive. Survival is more important. This is very selfish of you.” Advocate Deshmukh responded saying that lawyers providing legal aid to needy litigants had worked throughout the lockdown and represented them as well as per state duty, hence they should get vaccinated to which the bench replied, “No doubt there is a risk but we have to exercise caution and take precautions by following Covid protocols. Have faith in the executive as they have done such a wonderful job in containing and combatting the infection.” While comparing the judiciary and the captain of the Titanic ship CJ said, “Have you seen Titanic? Do you recollect the captain of the ship? Do you remember what he did? He has to wait till others are evacuated. He was the last one. First, everyone gets it and the judiciary gets it last. I am the captain here.” Additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh for the Union of India then informed the bench that similar pleas were before several high courts and Delhi High Court had also initiated a suo motu petition with regards to the vaccination drive. Singh also added that Bharat Biotech, the vaccine manufacturer had filed an application before the SC for transferring all pleas there. The CJ then asked the centre that whenever it decided to vaccinate the legal fraternity it should consider lawyers working with the legal services authority on priority. “Since you have told us that there is an application for transfer pending, we won’t give our opinion at this stage. We will give our opinion only if there is something amiss in the policy,” said the CJ and posted the hearing of the PIL to Wednesday, March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/like-captain-of-titanic-judiciary-should-be-last-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-bombay-hc-chief-justice-101615401330071.html

The per capita income for the state for 2020-21 was estimated at ₹226,796 as against ₹223,175 a year ago, when the state had registered a growth of 8.49%, data shows. Officials at the finance and other government departments in Karnataka attribute the contraction to the Covid-19 pandemic impact and de-growth in key sectors like industry and services, which recorded a negative growth of -5.1% and -3.1%, respectively, even though agriculture recorded an increase of 6.4%. “All industries and sectors were hit due to the lockdown for at least two months in 2020. Though the IT industry is likely to have done well, it comes under the broader category of services like transport, trade and other businesses,” said a senior government official, who did not wish to be named. The per capita drop is linked to the shrinking of the GSDP (gross state domestic product) by as much as 2.6% — the first decline in over a decade in the state, which is considered one of the most industrious in the country with thriving IT, startup, aerospace and defence, biotechnology and various other sectors. But Bengaluru’s growth in these sectors has seen the divide between the capital city and the remaining districts of the calamity-prone state widen, data shows. According to the 2020-21 economic survey, which shares the latest district-wise data on per capita income, Bengaluru has seen a jump of over 10% from ₹448,485 in 2017-18 to ₹496,208 in 2018-19. Bengaluru’s per capita income was five times more than Yadgiri, ranked the lowest in the state, with just ₹97,353. More striking is the regional imbalance in Karnataka where the ‘prosperous southern’ districts continue to grow at higher rates than their more backward northern regions. According to division-wise per capita income, Bengaluru stands at ₹301,748 as against Kalaburagi division, which is home to six of the most backward districts in the country, at ₹114,133. The per capita income of Mysuru division stands at ₹205,829, Belagavi at ₹128,761 and ₹156,729 in Bengaluru rural (not including Bengaluru city), according to data provided in the economic survey released along with the state budget. Successive governments have done little to rectify the regional imbalances, which only seems to be growing with time as the technology and industrial ecosystem in Bengaluru attracts all the investments and jobs while the government continues to feed this by building better infrastructure, leaving little else for the rest of the state. Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa has set aside ₹3,000 crore for the development of backward talukas and ₹1,500 crore for Kalayana Karnataka (formerly known as Hyderabad Karnataka). The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the state said they have made enough allocations to help accelerate development in the region. “It is not enough but we have taken a step in the right direction. There are projects like ₹5,600-crore irrigation works, railways, roads and others,” Umesh Katti, Karnataka’s food and civil supplies minister, said. Katti is also a legislator from Hukkeri in Belagavi district. However, analysts do not buy into this theory, stating that most governments, irrespective of party, have continued to ignore the northern parts. “The budget remains centered around Bengaluru, Mysuru and other southern districts. The leadership in North Karnataka is weak and society is also docile,” said one political analyst, requesting not to be named. He added that most of the politicians in the north either own sugar mills or run educational institutions and hospitals, making them think of their own interests before that of the people in the region, which is home to the second most arid parts in the country after Rajashtan. Priyank Kharge, the Congress legislator from Chittapur in Kalaburagi district and former minister for social welfare, said the trend in the last three years has been that the government gives funds for Kalyana Karnataka Regional Development Board (KKRDB) but rarely make other provisions to bridge the growing regional imbalance. By amendment to the Constitution, Article 371(j) was created in 2013 and the KKRDB was set up on 6 November, the same year, which provides reservation for the people of the region in education, employment and other areas. Kharge said the KKRDB should supplement the state government’s efforts to invest and develop the region, adding that the situation was working the other way around. “If this is the attitude, then we cannot bridge the gap,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-sees-lowest-per-capita-income-growth-in-over-10-yrs-101615401269516.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Are private hospitals in Mumbai ready to give shots 24x7?||Following a meeting between officials from the Central government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday, private vaccination centres have been authorised to carry out immunisation round the clock. At present, vaccinations are administered till 5pm. Representatives of private hospitals said that 24x7 centres are not mandatory and the decision to offer inoculation after 5pm will be based on public response. Last week, the state’s Covid-19 task force along with the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a trust of private hospitals, had submitted a proposal to BMC to start 24x7 vaccination centres. It will take two to three days for all private hospitals to decide on extending their existing timings, as they study the public response. Dr V Ravishankar, chief operating officer (COO) of Lilavati Hospital in Bandra, welcomed the decision and said the hospital would extend the time for vaccination till 8pm. “We have seven vaccination units ready for the mass immunisation process. Four units are already running. If needed, we can open up the remaining three units. But it depends on public response. We do not want to waste our resources and manpower by keeping it open 24x7,” said Dr Ravishankar. Hiranandani Hospital also plans to carry out vaccination for 12 hours from today onwards. The hospital has also sought assistance from Rotary Club in Powai. “Our hospital, being a mid-size hospital, is exploring how to conduct this exercise at night. We are going to divide the hospital task force into two batches, comprising a mix of doctors, nurses, front office staff, technicians, IT staff and security — one for the morning shift and the other for the afternoon. Management staff will do crowd management and hospitality,” said Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer (CEO) of the hospital. While some have pointed out that the number of probable beneficiaries is likely to fall after 8pm, Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines, said most major private hospitals have over 2,000 healthcare workers who work in three shifts, including at night. “All hospitals have nurses on night duty who are qualified to vaccinate the public. So there won’t be much problem in arranging vaccinators. We can easily station two to three nurses at vaccination units,” he said. However, some medical practitioners questioned whether running vaccination programmes for all 24 hours in a day would be feasible. “In comparison to January 16 [the first day of the nationwide mass vaccination programme], the turnout has increased by over 100%. So there is a need to extend the timing of inoculation. This will be beneficial for working professionals who are struggling to get their parents to vaccination centres. But making it 24x7 won’t be helpful,” said an officer from a private hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-are-private-hospitals-in-mumbai-ready-to-give-shots-24x7-101615401210468.html

Urging residents to strictly follow all Covid-19 related guidelines, he said the district administration was keeping a close eye on the situation simmering due to the second wave of Covid-19 in Ludhiana, and will impose night curfew if the present situation persists during the next few days. “Organisers and invitees of public events must think twice, as large gatherings can take a heavy toll on all of us, especially when 10 Covid-19 patients are on ventilator support and 166 more are hospitalised. The necessity of an event can be pondered upon before it is organised and invitees should also step out of their homes wisely to keep the virus under check,” he said, while sharing that the daily Covid-19 cases had swollen from 35 a week ago to 125 now, which was quite worrisome. “We should not nurse this misconception that the second wave has arrived or not. I am telling you that the second wave has arrived and we have to take adequate measures and precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” Sharma said. He reiterated the need to wear mask in public, frequently wash/sanitise hands and maintain social distance.‘We’re lucky to have the vaccine’The deputy commissioner called upon senior citizens and people aged between 45 and 59 and having comorbidities to get vaccinated at their nearest healthcare institution, as it was the only key to keeping the virus at bay. “There are many countries in the world that are longing for the vaccine, but we are lucky that our scientists have developed it well in time and it is our duty to come forward for vaccination,” he said, while urging people to visit any healthcare centre with their Aadhaar card to get the jab after on-the-spot registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/surge-in-covid-cases-open-to-reinforcing-night-curfew-says-ludhiana-dc-101615401090075.html
11-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records 1,539 fresh Covid-19 cases highest since October 21||On Wednesday, there were 1,539 new cases of Covid-19, the highest daily tally for the city since October 21, 2020, when 1,609 Covid-positive cases were reported in Mumbai. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the city has gone up to 3,37,124. Mumbai also reported five deaths on Wednesday, taking the Covid death toll to 11,515, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.4%. Mumbai presently has 9,973 active cases and a recovery rate of 93%. In the past two weeks, the number of active cases in Mumbai has increased by over 50%. On February 23, Mumbai had 6,119 active cases. The overall growth rate for Covid-19 in the city is 0.32% and the doubling rate is 215 days. In light of the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to allow private vaccination centres to operate round the clock. With this move, BMC hopes to achieve its target of vaccinating 100,000 people daily. In a statement issued on Wednesday, BMC said, “When we can achieve the target of vaccinating 100,000 people daily, the 3,000,000 senior citizens who qualify as beneficiaries in this phase of the vaccination drive can be vaccinated within one month.” As part of the third phase of the nationwide immunisation programme, vaccines are being administered to senior citizens and citizens above the age of 45 years who have comorbidities. The third phase started on March 1. So far, 1,65,034 senior citizens and 19,040 citizens above the age of 45 years have been vaccinated. At present, there are 71 vaccination centres in Mumbai, which operate between eight hours and 12 hours daily, except on Sundays. BMC has also sent a proposal to the government to approve 29 more hospitals to become vaccination centres. Those who are eligible for vaccines can register on the Centrally managed Co-WIN app, which is monitoring the vaccination drive, or directly visit their nearest hospital to register for inoculation. The Co-WIN app has repeatedly suffered from technical issues. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Wednesday instructed the administration to form a team from the public health department to take calls on BMC’s helpline number (1916) and help those who may be facing technical difficulties while registering for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-1-539-fresh-covid-19-cases-highest-since-october-21-101615401031337.html

On Friday, the region may see thunderstorms accompanied with hail in parts of NCR, western Uttar Pradesh including Noida,” said an official at the IMD.“Hail and thunderstorms are likely towards Thursday evening and Friday due to a western disturbance and cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan. The region will also see strong winds which may bring down pollution levels as well. The temperature may marginally drop but this will be only for a few days as the rainfall is not expected to be continuous,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.A western disturbance is moisture-laden wind that originates from the Mediterranean which is responsible for snowing in the northern states.Meanwhile, the air quality of the city improved to ‘moderate’ in Noida. Wednesday saw the cleanest air quality of this month so far due to thunderous activities a day earlier, which improved ventilation. The air quality of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad also improved from ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ category.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 152 against 293 a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida was 239 against 339 a day earlier. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 221 against 334 on Tuesday.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.“Wind speed on Wednesday improved to around 15 kmph on Wednesday,” said Palawat.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may deteriorate slightly for one day but due to better wind speed later, pollution levels will come down soon.“Rain/thundershowers observed in and around Delhi have washed out suspended particular matter and led to improved air quality. Surface winds are calm. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate to the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for Thursday. An increase in wind speed and ventilation is expected on Friday and AQI is likely to improve to the ‘moderate’ category. Isolated thunderstorms and local dust lifting are likely at isolated places on Thursday and Friday,” said a SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rain-likely-in-next-two-days-in-noida-air-quality-to-improve-101615400372429.html

The wastage rate for Covaxin till March 8 is over 21%, which is well above the 10% limit allowed by the Union ministry of health. However, the district has fared better in terms of wastage of Covishield doses at about 4.54%, the data shows.Officials of the Ghaziabad health department attributed the wastage primarily to fewer people coming up to get the jab.According to the state figures, Ghaziabad till March 8 had a consumption of 7,580 Covaxin doses with wastage of 21.02%, while 2,179 doses of Covishield, out of 47,950 doses, got wasted in the district.“Covaxin was used primarily during the vaccination of front-line workers where we assumed that they would turn out in large numbers. However, when we sent the vials of Covaxin at the centres, many reported that only few of front-line workers arrived to take up jabs. Since a vial of Covaxin contains 20 doses, the rest turned waste. So, it was due to lower turnout of front-line workers that our wastage of Covaxin was on higher side,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.The overall wastage in the state for Covishield is about 9.35% (of 2215680 doses used) while that for Covaxin it is about 12.53% (of 257000 doses used), as per the official figures.“The vaccination with Covishield is much better in terms of wastage as it has 10 doses in a vail. We have more stock of Covishield with us. So, majority of government as well as private hospitals were given Covishield vaccine,” Gupta added.According to Ghaziabad’s stock figures for both the vaccines, the district vaccine store till April 9 despatched 108910 doses, including 20000 doses for the private sector, of Covishield to 29 vaccine storage points, while 16560 doses of Covaxin were despatched. From the vaccine storage points, the vials are further despatched to vaccination centres as per requirements, the officials said.“Our wastage for the two vaccines is about 4-5%. On days when we have stock of Covaxin, we open a vial once we have 17-18 beneficiaries at our centre. So, this way, wastage is reduced considerably. We are vaccinating an average of 300-350 beneficiaries per day,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital which operates six days a week.The private hospitals are taking up paid vaccination to beneficiaries. “We are ensuring proper handling of vaccine doses and also ensuring that we open up a vial once we have presence of at least 10 beneficiaries. As a result, we have almost 0% wastage so far and we are administering vaccine to an average of about 200 beneficiaries per day,” said a spokesperson of Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi.According to the records of the district health department till March 9, 19,356 health-care workers (out of 25,003 identified beneficiaries under the category) have taken their first dose while 14,903 have got second dose as well.Likewise, 10,676 of identified 18,897 front-line workers have taken up their first dose and 749 of these took their second dose till March 9.Under the third category of senior citizens and those having co-morbid conditions, 15,968 senior citizens have taken first dose while another 1,373 beneficiaries having co-morbid conditions have also taken their first dose till March 9. The vaccination coverage for the senior citizens as well as those having co-morbid conditions is about 18.55% with a target of 93,480 to be achieved in March.“To increase vaccination coverage, we are trying to allow the district women hospital to open up for vaccination for six days in a week,” Gupta added.Overall, 25 government health-care centres and 33 private hospitals are engaged in the vaccination drive in Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/wastage-of-covaxin-doses-at-21-in-ghaziabad-101615400249370.html

By surveying the entire city and generating bills for the entire Gurugram, the MCG can generate a minimum of ₹100 crore through water meter bills. Hence, we have decided to give special emphasis to this,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG who chaired the meeting.Although the MCG’s revenue records list 297,000 registered properties, only 88,000 water meters are registered on the records. Officials said that the MCG will be issuing water bills for all authorised and unauthorised colonies, private builder areas and sectors falling within its limits, starting this year.The MCG sanctioned 33,000 water bills to residents last August for the first time and last month, hired a private contractor till 2024 to issue on-the-spot bills to residents based on the readings.In Wednesday’s meeting, councillors and officials also decided to increase the civic body’s income through advertisements, trade licences, meat licences, street vending, mobile towers and land leases. Officials said that the specific ways to generate revenue through these modes would be chalked out in next week’s meeting.The MCG is scheduled to table its 2021-22 budget on March 18.With regard to advertising, MCG officials apprised the councillors of a special campaign launched recently to take action against unauthorised advertisers. In a two-month drive, 800 FIRs were registered by the police and 1,200 challans issued, said officials.Officials said they are optimistic of significant revenue generation through property taxes, with around 500,000 units figuring on the MCG’s records.In the meeting, Vijay Singla, chief account officer, MCG, presented a draft of the proposed budget for the 2021-22 financial year and sought suggestions. He said as per the draft, around ₹4,700 crore of income and expenditure of around ₹2,200 crore has been estimated.Officials and councillors also decided that issues such as municipal bonds and road cut charges will be discussed in the upcoming House meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-seeks-to-increase-revenue-from-water-bills-101615398692673.html

11-03-2021||Pune||Pune’s blind-deaf judokas dream of international glory||Pune: Why do you practice judo? To win a medal in Paralympics is the sole answer from all the nine blind and deaf judokas who are training in Pune. For the local judokas, winning medals at the upcoming 9th National Blind Judo Championship to be held at Lucknow from March 19-20 is a step towards getting selected for the international tournaments. Since 1988, Paralympic judo has been a part of summer Paralympic games, but Indians are yet to make a mark at the international stage. “Learning new techniques and focus on game can win us medals at the international stage,” said Renuka Salve, who had won bronze at the Commonwealth Judo Championship at Walsall, Birmingham in 2019. “The national contest is also a selection tournament for three upcoming international tournaments to be conducted by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA). A medal in these tournaments will give them a chance to qualify,” said coach Rachana Dopeshwar, who trains the players at Sahyadri National School, Warje. International Para Judo Antalya Cup, Turkey (April 5-10); IBSA Junior Grand Prix, Baku, Azerbaijan; and Judo Grand Prix, Walsall, England (June 16-19) are the three tournaments of which events at Baku and Walsall are paralympic qualifying events. All the players taking part in the nationals don’t have a strong financial background. “Being partially deaf makes things hard, but support of the sports provides us a job opportunity. Though I took the sport for financial security, but winning gold is now my top priority,” said Ashutosh Korde. “I started learning judo for self-defence. With the support of Rachana madam, we came to know that the game has a bright future also,” said Pallavi Kamble, who also loves to do anchoring. Kamble, who missed a medal during the last nationals, aims to bite the metal this time. Tanshika Maske, who is completely blind, also participates in national blind chess tournaments. “I love both the sports as the two needs a lot of patience. I aim for international success in both the sports,” said Maske. It’s all about sign Omkar Mokashi, who is also a wrestler, started practicing judo since the last two years. “We focus on sign language. Once we learn what move we need to play, then competing becomes easy. We can focus more as we hear less so it is also one big advantage to us,” said Mokashi. Dopeshwar, who coaches them for free, said, “Winning medal is top priority and becoming a good judo player can also give them a chance to earn a job in sports quota which is also important for their career.” Selected players Akshita Dalavi (40kg) Tanshika Maske (48kg) Sonali Wajge (48kg) Pallavi Kamble (52kg) Renuka Salve (70kg) Laxmi Jadhav (78kg) Omkar Mokashi (63kg) Shubham Nimbalkar (73kg) Ashutosh Korde (81kg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-blind-deaf-judokas-dream-of-international-glory-101615389148700.html

"We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun."Muslim-majority Pakistan had banned the app in October, but restored it within 10 days after the company vowed to block all accounts involved in spreading "obscenity and immorality."The telecom regulator said the social media company had agreed to moderate accounts in accordance with local laws.TikTok has been one of the most-downloaded apps in the South Asian nation behind WhatsApp and Facebook.TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has become hugely popular in a short period of time, by encouraging young users to post brief videos.But the app has been mired in controversy in a number of countries, with authorities raising privacy concerns and security fears due to its links with China.TikTok has denied that its ties to China pose a security concern in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-blocks-tiktok-over-indecency-complaint-101615483486915.html
11-03-2021||World||Trouble for NY Governor Andrew Cuomo as Democrats demand resignation||A group of 59 Democratic state legislators demanded New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation Thursday in the wake of an allegation that he groped an aide at the Executive Mansion last year.The letter released by the group comes as Cuomo's grip on power in the state appeared increasingly tenuous. The top Democrat in the state Assembly, Speaker Carl Heastie, said he will meet with members in conference today on “potential paths forward” in light of mounting allegations.In New York, the Assembly is the legislative house that could move to impeach Cuomo, who has faced multiple allegations that he made the workplace an uncomfortable place for young women with sexually suggestive remarks and behavior, including unwanted touching and a kiss.The Times Union of Albany reported Wednesday that an unidentified aide had claimed Cuomo reached under her shirt and fondled her after summoning her to his official residence.Nineteen senators and 40 Assembly members said in a letter Thursday that it was time for Cuomo to go.“In light of the Governor’s admission of inappropriate behavior and the findings of altered data on nursing home COVID-19 deaths he has lost the confidence of the public and the state legislature, rendering him ineffective in this time of most urgent need,” the letter said. “It is time for Governor Cuomo to resign.”Cuomo has repeatedly said he won’t resign and urged the public to await the outcome of an investigation of his conduct by state Attorney General Letitia James. Cuomo’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.Cuomo has denied inappropriately touching anyone but has said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and didn’t intend to do so.In the newest allegation against Cuomo, the Times Union of Albany reported that the governor had summoned the aide to his Albany mansion, saying he needed help with his cellphone. After she arrived, Cuomo closed the door, reached under her shirt and fondled her, the newspaper reported.The newspaper’s reporting was based on an unidentified source with knowledge of the woman’s accusation, who said she first told the story to someone on Cuomo's staff in recent days. The newspaper hadn't spoken to the woman and didn't identify her.“I have never done anything like this,” Cuomo said through a spokesperson Wednesday evening.“The details of this report are gut-wrenching,” Cuomo said, adding that he would not speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation, given an ongoing investigation overseen by the state attorney general.Several other women who worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in former President Bill Clinton’s Cabinet, and one who met him briefly at a wedding, have also complained of inappropriate conduct.The state Assembly has 150 members. It could convene an impeachment trial against Cuomo with a simple majority vote. Until the new allegations surfaced, most of its members appeared to be leaning against trying to convene an impeachment or demanding Cuomo's resignation until the attorney general's investigation was complete.The state Senate, which would join with members of the state's top appeals court to hold an impeachment trial, has 63 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trouble-for-ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-as-democrats-demand-resignation-101615482930461.html

China, and the rise of China, the dramatic increase of defence spending and increasingly assertive, even aggressive behaviour, both in the South China Sea and East China Sea...[It is a] cause of great concern to us," he added.Yamagami said Tokyo supported Scott Morrison-led government's decision to call out China's unofficial campaign of economic coercion after it slapped restrictions on wine, barley, beef, coal and other products.He also drew parallels with China's decision in 2010 to cut off rare earth supplies to Japan because of a dispute over the Senkakus and Beijing's restrictions on Australian exports, reported Financial Review.The ambassador's remarks came as business and political leaders warned they did not expect a thaw in Australia-China tensions in the near term.On Sunday, Beijing had warned Japan that it would be better if the two countries were friends instead of enemies.US President Joe Biden will be meeting virtually with his counterparts in the Quad -- Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia.The leaders will discuss ongoing efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and explore opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region, the statement read from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).China has criticised the framework as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization seeking to undermine its legitimate rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-quad-meeting-japan-expresses-support-to-australia-in-dealing-with-china-s-increasing-aggression-101615480909812.html

That would require them to deliver another 60 million doses over the next three weeks."Those have already been manufactured" and are currently being tested for quality, he said."Unless a batch (of vaccine) fails, we will be able to provide them. Our track record is that our batches don't fail," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-to-exceed-2021-covid-vaccine-production-target-by-as-much-as-20-ceo-101615482317513.html

But over the past week, Brazil has averaged more than 1,600 deaths per day, ahead of some 1,400 in the United States, where the outbreak has ebbed.As President Jair Bolsonaro rails against lockdowns and urges Brazilians out of their homes, governors and mayors have struggled to enforce restrictions, often pleading in vain with a population inured to the rising tide of the epidemic.Brazil's two most populous cities, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, on Thursday moved to tighten measures as their hospitals struggled with a second wave of the virus, spurred by a more contagious variant that emerged in the Amazon region.While Europe and the United States ramp up vaccinations and bring down their caseloads, Brazil's federal government is off to a slow start, with only 2% of the 210 million Brazilians fully inoculated so far.In the nation's capital Brasilia, which is under a nighttime curfew, public hospital ICU wards are 97% full and private ones are at 99%, forcing the city to again set up field hospitals as it had during a peak in cases last year.On Thursday, Sao Paulo Governor João Doria announced a "new stage" of restrictions to enforce social distancing, arguing it is now the only weapon against the spread of the virus.They include a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m., the suspension of religious services and sports events, including soccer matches, and people not being allowed to use beaches and parks."This is a tough, unpopular decision. No governor wants to stop the economic activities in their state," Doria said in a video.The state of Sao Paulo, home to some 44 million people, is currently allowing only essential stores such as supermarkets and pharmacies to receive shoppers.The Sao Paulo health secretary said hospitals in more than half of the state's municipalities are full.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-hospitals-pushed-to-limit-as-covid-19-death-toll-soars-101615481916225.html
11-03-2021||World||EU 'freedom zone' for LGBT as European Parliament adopts resolution||The European Parliament has overwhelming adopted a resolution declaring the entire 27-member European Union a “freedom zone” for LGBT people, an effort to push back on rising homophobia in Poland and elsewhere.The parliament announced Thursday that there were 492 ballots in favor of the resolution and 141 against in a vote that came after a debate in a session of parliament in Brussels on Wednesday.The resolution came largely in reaction to developments over the past two years in Poland, where many local communities have adopted largely symbolic resolutions declaring themselves free of what conservative authorities have been calling “LGBT ideology.”These towns say they are seeking to protect traditional families based on unions of men and women, but LGBT rights activists say the designations are discriminatory and make gays and lesbians feel unwelcome. The areas have come to be colloquially known as “LGBT-free zones.”The resolution is the work of a cross-party group in the European Parliament, the LGBTI Intergroup.The Polish government has denounced the resolution. It argues that Poland, as a sovereign nation and a society more conservative than many Western European countries, has the right to defend its traditional family values based on a long attachment to Roman Catholicism. It accuses the EU lawmakers of overstepping their jurisdiction.The government also has argued that the rates of hate crimes are lower in Poland than in many countries in Western Europe.However, LGBT rights activists say this is impossible to measure. Kuba Gawon, who has been documenting local anti-LGBT resolutions with the group Atlas of Hate, said that there is no mention in the Polish penal code specifically about homophobic crimes, so police do not keep statistics of such crimes.“We don’t know the full number of such cases,” he said.The European Parliament's resolution said the fundamental rights of LGBT people have also been “severely hindered” recently in Hungary, due to a de facto ban on legal gender recognition for transgender and intersex people. It also notes that only two member states — Malta and Germany — have banned “conversion therapy,” a controversial and potentially harmful attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-freedom-zone-for-lgbt-as-european-parliament-adopts-resolution-101615482072779.html

11-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Why grandparents can’t see their grandchildren ‘sooner’? UK PM answers||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday revealed the reason behind the restrictions on grandparents seeing their grandchildren even after a “successful rollout” of vaccine programme to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Public Health England (PHE) had earlier advised people who are aged 70 or over, or clinically vulnerable, and are not symptomatic, to avoid contact with other family members as much as possible.“If you cannot arrange for vulnerable people to move out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible,” the guidance said.School, colleges, childcare, and children’s supervised activities resumed from March 8 as a part of Johnson’s four-step roadmap to lift the lockdown but outdoor gatherings of six people or two households were extended to March 29. In a video posted on the Twitter account of the prime minister’s office, Johnson said that though the vast majority of people over 70s and 80s have been vaccinated, the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective.“It's very effective, it's not 100% effective, and so what we don't want to see is a great surge of the disease caused by premature mingling of households,” said Johnson. “That's why we are saying that you have got to just be a bit cautious and we are hanging on until 29th March when you can meet your grandparents or grandparents can meet the rest of their family,” he added.With the successful rollout of the vaccine programme, why can’t grandparents see their grandchildren sooner?  @BorisJohnson answers ⬇️Ask your question at: https://t.co/cxEV8mMpwS pic.twitter.com/EAt3fv5px4While the ‘stay at home’ rule will end on March 29, many restrictions will remain in place, including travelling abroad. According to the government’s roadmap out of lockdown, holidays abroad will not be allowed, given the risk of imported variants. The UK health agency on Thursday announced that a new variant, B.1.324.1, identified in the UK in two people, who had recently been in Antigua, has been designated as a variant under investigation (VUI).“The variant contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with Variants of Concern (VOC), however it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a VOC,” PHE said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-why-grandparents-can-t-see-their-grandchildren-sooner-uk-pm-answers-101615481034179.html

His nomination was deadlocked at the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month in a tie vote. Senate rules allow leaders to bring stalled nominees directly to the floor for a confirmation vote, where Becerra would likely need every Democratic vote to be confirmed to the job.If he gets the job, Becerra would oversee an expansion of the Affordable Care Act that was included in Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 package, along with other other efforts to control the coronavirus.Manchin previously derailed the nomination of Biden's pick as budget director, Neera Tanden, and exerted his influence on a recently passed coronavirus relief package, driving a compromise on the size of expanded unemployment benefits central to the package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-senator-manchin-to-vote-for-becerra-to-be-health-secretary-statement-101615480937220.html
11-03-2021||World||Vaccine Initiative, cooperation on key supply chains on 1st Quad Summit agenda||The first Quad leaders’ summit on Friday will create a framework to allow the four-nation grouping to take the lead in post-Covid-19 recovery efforts, especially access to vaccines, and the creation of resilient supply chains for materials such as rare earth metals.The maiden summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, convened by US President Joe Biden less than two months after he assumed office, reflects the urgency attached by the US to coalesce the loose group to bolster cooperation on key challenges across the region and to counter a belligerent China.Among the key initiatives expected to be on the agenda when Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga gather virtually at 7 pm on Friday is a “Vaccine Initiative” and a procurement and supply chain for rare earth metals.India perceives the summit as key to building on crucial partnerships to address challenges in the Indo-Pacific and securing the maritime domain, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The summit is also an opportunity for evolution as the Quad didn’t traditionally have defined areas of cooperation and only discussed principles and shared strategic approaches.The Vaccine Initiative is being seen as the “most significant deliverable” from the summit as greater access to doses, especially for small and developing nations across the Indo-Pacific, will foster a quick global economic recovery, the people said.“Vaccines will be developed in the US, manufactured in India, financed by Japan and the US, and supported by Australia. The Vaccine Initiative will allow new manufacturing capacity to be added in India for exports to the Indo-Pacific. It will not impinge on India’s existing manufacturing capacities,” said one of the people cited above.The Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced, while successful vaccines developed in the US include those from Pfizer and BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.This pooling of capacities by Quad members will help boost global vaccine delivery, meet the demand-supply gap, especially within the Indo-Pacific, and add momentum to efforts to contain the pandemic.India’s role in the Vaccine Initiative will reinforce its credentials as a trusted and reliable manufacturer and supplier of medicines and expand the “Vaccine Maitri” initiative that has supplied 58.3 million doses to 69 countries so far. “It will strengthen India’s standing as the pharmacy of the world and a critical node in global health supply chains,” the person cited above said.Hindustan Times had reported on Thursday on options being considered by the Quad members to ramp up vaccine production and delivery, which will also help in the vaccine race with China.The people said the Quad’s model for collective humanitarian action through supply of Covid-19 vaccines can also serve as a template for peace, cooperation and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, which the grouping defines as its main objective.The four countries are also expected to build a rare earth metals procurement chain to counter China’s dominance in supplying these critical elements to makers of everything from smartphones to high-performance motors and batteries for electric vehicles, Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported.China produced almost 60% of the world's rare earths in 2020 and the Quad members intend to counter China’s grip on supplies by funding new production technologies and development projects, and leading the way in drafting international rules, the report said.More than 90% of India’s imports of rare earths, worth $3.4 million in 2016, come from China. Over the past few years, India and Australia have been exploring the possibility of cooperating on rare earths such as lithium (used in batteries), neodymium (crucial for electric vehicles) and dysprosium (used in lasers and data storage applications), of which Australia has the world’s sixth largest reserves.The rare earths initiative will dovetail with the Quad’s stated aim of creating more robust and resilient supply chains that are not vulnerable to China’s influence. China has not shied away from using its near-monopoly on rare earths as a diplomatic bargaining chip, halting supplies to Japan over the dispute related to the Senkaku Islands in 2010. Such steps have led to massive spikes in the prices of these metals.The Quad members plan to develop refining technologies and to provide syndicated loans to rare earth mining and refining businesses. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is working to establish rules to stop China's export controls on rare earths. Though India is not a member of IEA, it entered into a strategic partnership with the US, Australia and the agency in January, at the behest of Japan, to strengthen collaboration in a range of vital areas, Nikkei reported.The genesis of the Quad was a “core group” formed by the four countries in 2004 for a joint response to the Indian Ocean tsunami. After the US and Australia sidelined the grouping because of sensitivities linked to their relations with China, the grouping faded away from the centre stage around 2007.As the Indo-Pacific became a key strategic region, the Quad was revived, largely because of Japan’s efforts, in 2017 as a dialogue at the level of senior officials. India was represented by a joint secretary from the foreign ministry. In September 2019, the grouping was elevated to the level of foreign ministers as India became more comfortable with it and there was greater convergence among members on concerns related to China.The third Quad ministerial meeting on February 18 took place within a month of the Biden administration assuming office and four months after the second meeting, while the Quad Summit will be President Biden’s second plurilateral engagement after a meeting of G7 leaders.There is considerable speculation on whether Friday’s summit will produce a joint statement – something that has never happened so far in a Quad interaction.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the summit would largely focus on five objectives. “China will be the unstated part of the agenda, and the other key elements will be the Covid-19 crisis, maritime security, techno-economic cooperation and climate change,” he said.“The Quad per se must increase its constituents and it must take action so that others believe it is a powerful but benign grouping in the Indo-Pacific. Though the current initiative is US-led, we must gauge the comfort level of the other three members, especially India – whether there is elbow room for it to make contributions and have a sense of ownership,” Bhatia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-initiative-cooperation-on-key-supply-chains-on-1st-quad-summit-agenda-101615478639995.html

11-03-2021||World||Digital-only artwork fetches nearly $70 million at Christie's||A digital artwork sold for nearly $70 million at Christie's on Thursday, in the first ever sale by a major auction house of a piece of art that does not exist in physical form."Everydays - The First 5000 Days" is a digital work by American artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple. It is a collage of 5,000 individual images, which were made one-per-day over more than thirteen years.The sale of the work for $69,346,250 put Beeple in the top three most valuable living artists, Christie's said in a Tweet.The work is in the form of a new type of digital asset - a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) - meaning it is authenticated by blockchain, which certifies its originality and ownership.The market for NFTs has soared in recent months as enthusiasts and investors use spare savings to buy up items that exist online. Last month, a 10-second video clip featuring an image of a fallen Donald Trump, also by Beeple, sold for $6.6 million on an NFT marketplace called Nifty Gateway."Without the NFTs, there just legitimately was no way to collect digital art," said Beeple, who specialises in irreverent digital art that explores themes such as technology, wealth and American politics.Asked what he thought of the multi-million dollar bids on his work, the 39-year-old graphic designer, who has created concert visuals for the likes of Justin Bieber, One Direction and Katy Perry, said he was lost for words."I don't know... maybe you can put an emoji into the story" he said. "It's so crazy."For NFTs, the artist's royalties are locked in to the contract: Beeple receives 10% each time the NFT changes hands after the initial sale."I do really think that this is going to be seen as the next chapter of art history" Beeple said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/digitalonly-artwork-fetches-nearly-70-million-at-christies-101615478275726.html

The variants are mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which has already killed more than 2.7 million people in the pandemic.B.1.1.7 has spread to about 100 countries, according to WHO data, and some of those, including France, Denmark and the United States, have reported swift rises in the proportion of their Covid-19 cases being caused it.Peacock said evidence from the UK suggests B.1.1.7. is likely to become dominant elsewhere too."Because of its transmissibility, once it's introduced, it does have that advantage over other circulating variants - so it is the case that B.1.1.7 appears to be travelling around the world and really expanding where it lands."Public Health England (PHE) also said on Thursday that a new coronavirus variant had been identified in the UK in two people who had recently been in Antigua. PHE said it shared some traits of other variants but was not classed as concerning for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-taking-over-uk-likely-to-dominate-other-countries-too-expert-101615476307284.html
11-03-2021||World||England investigating new coronavirus variant linked to Antigua travel||Public Health England (PHE) on Thursday said a new coronavirus variant had been identified in the UK in two people who had recently been in Antigua, adding that it shared some traits of others but would not be categorised as concerning for now.The health authority said the variant, know as VUI-202103/01 (lineage B.1.324.1) was designated a variant under investigation on March 4 after two cases were found in the South East of England in individuals who had recently travelled to Antigua."The variant contains the spike mutations E484K and N501Y, both usually associated with Variants of Concern (VOC), however it does not feature specific deletions that would lead to a designation as a VOC," PHE said in a statement.The variants are mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which has already killed more than 2.7 million people in the pandemic.While scientists say that mutations in viruses are inevitable, Covid-19 variants of concern such as those first identified in south east England, South Africa and Brazil, have worrisome changes that give the virus advantages, such as increased transmissibility or reducing the effectiveness of vaccines.The E484K mutation of the spike protein has been seen in South African and Brazilian variants, and has occurred spontaneously in the UK variant, and is associated with lower vaccine efficacy. The N501Y mutation is linked to great transmissibility.PHE also said that four more cases of the P.1 variant, which was first found in northern Brazil and has the E484K and N501Y mutations, had been identified in England.That brings the total number identified in Britain to ten, PHE said, adding that they all had links to direct travel from Brazil or to a previously confirmed case that had travelled to Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-investigating-new-coronavirus-variant-linked-to-antigua-travel-101615475867071.html
11-03-2021||World||Judge allows third-degree murder charge for ex-cop in George Floyd's death||A Minnesota judge granted a request by prosecutors on Thursday to reinstate a charge of third-degree murder against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is on trial already facing second-degree murder and manslaughter charges.Judge Peter Cahill's decision comes after the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that he must reconsider a third-degree murder charge against 44-year-old Chauvin, whose trial got underway with jury selection this week in Minneapolis."I have to follow the rule that the court of appeals has put in place," Cahill said in explaining his decision.Chauvin already faces a more serious charge of second-degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, as well as a charge of second-degree manslaughter.The reinstatement of a third-degree murder charge was a victory for state prosecutors, who had sought the additional lesser murder charge in part to afford them an extra path to a conviction should the jury find the evidence does not support the most serious charge. The third-degree murder charge carries a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.Chauvin's charges stem from his actions during the arrest of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes on a sidewalk outside a grocery store as the Black man pleaded for his life and then stopped moving. Police were arresting him on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at the store.Floyd's death outraged people around the world and helped fuel one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States, with daily demonstrations against racism and police brutality.Lawyers for Chauvin had successfully argued the third-degree murder charge should be dropped on the basis that the statute requires the “death-causing act” not be directed at a single individual. It is often used in instances where someone uses deadly force against a crowd of people, for example.But the Minnesota Court of Appeals recently ruled in a separate case that third-degree murder could be applied even if the “death-causing act” is directed at a specific person, and ruled on Friday that this precedent binds the district court.Jury selection for Chauvin's trial was set to resume Thursday morning, with five jurors already seated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-allows-third-degree-murder-charge-for-ex-cop-in-george-floyd-s-death-101615475875022.html
11-03-2021||World||‘Bought it for fun’: Trump Buddha statue popular on Chinese e-commerce platform||A Chinese e-commerce platform has listed a unique statue of former US president Donald Trump sitting in a zen-like position that is more readily associated with Buddha, the philosopher and religious teacher who founded Buddhism. The seller has labelled the statues as "Trump, who knows Buddhism better than anyone," in an apparent dig at the twice-impeached former president who frequently targeted China over coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The small version of the Trump Buddha statue, which measures 1.6 metres in height, is priced at 999 Chinese yuan (around ₹ 11,180) on Taobao, the e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba. A larger version of the statue, 4.6 metres tall, is available for 3,999 yuan (around ₹ 44, 770). According to a report by The Guardian, Trump is a popular source of merchandise on Taobao where customers can purchase Trump facemasks, models, little statues, hats, and socks.China's state-owned Global Times first reported on the statue and spoke to the furniture-maker, based in Xiamen, Fujian province, who is promoting the statue with the slogan “Make your company great again!”. The seller told the Global Times that they made 100 statues and dozens of them are already sold, noting that "most people just bought it for fun.""I bought it for fun and put it on my desk at home as a decoration. Trump can also be regarded as a representative of an era, and extreme egoism. Now the era has passed but I want the statue to remind me: Don't be too Trump," an unnamed buyer was quoted by Global Times as saying.A craft website Etsy is selling novelty gifts of 3-D printed “Trump laughing Buddha” where the seller says it is “not intended to stir up anything political”. “In fact, this Laughing Buddha mashup is simply a reminder that, no matter where we fall in the political spectrum, we could all use a little more laughter and joy in our lives!” the description reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bought-it-for-fun-trump-buddha-statue-popular-on-chinese-e-commerce-platform-101615473426721.html
11-03-2021||World||Britons told to keep getting vaccinated after some countries suspend AstraZeneca shots||The UK's medicine regulator said on Thursday that Britons should keep on getting their Covid-19 vaccines, including the shot developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, after Denmark and some other countries restricted their use of it.Denmark is suspending for two weeks the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated, including one death in Denmark, Danish authorities said.Norway joined Denmark in halting its roll-out of the shot after reports of blood clots, while Italy banned a batch of the vaccine after notifications of some serious adverse effects.Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was not confirmed that the reported blood clot in Denmark was caused by the vaccine, adding that the Danish suspension was precautionary."Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon," said Phil Bryan, MHRA Vaccines Safety Lead, adding that more than 11 million doses of the vaccine had been administered across the UK and that reports of blood clots were not greater than would have occurred naturally."We are keeping this issue under close review but available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause. People should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so."Austria earlier in the week halted a batch of the shot, but the European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday there was no evidence so far linking AstraZeneca's vaccine to illnesses in two people who received it in Austria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britons-told-to-keep-getting-vaccinated-after-some-countries-suspend-astrazeneca-shots-101615472511797.html
11-03-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 712,000 as layoffs pace eases||The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to 712,000, the lowest total since early November, evidence that fewer employers are cutting jobs amid a decline in confirmed coronavirus cases and signs of an improving economy.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment aid dropped by 42,000 from 754,000 the week before. Though the job market has been slowly strengthening, many businesses remain under pressure, and 9.6 million jobs remain lost to the pandemic that flattened the economy 12 months ago.In February, U.S. employers added a robust 379,000 jobs, the most since October, reflecting an economy in which consumers are spending more and states and cities are easing business restrictions. Thursday's figure, though the lowest weekly figure in four months, showed that weekly applications for jobless benefits still remain high by historical standards: Before the viral outbreak, they had never topped 700,000, even during the Great Recession.All told, 4.1 million Americans are receiving traditional state unemployment benefits. Counting supplemental federal unemployment programs that were established to soften the economic damage from the virus, an estimated 20.1 million people are collecting some form of jobless aid.The continuing job cuts reflect the extent to which the pandemic disrupted normal economic activity and kept consumers hunkered down at home rather than out traveling, shopping, dining out and attending entertainment venues. Cities and states restricted the hours and capacity of restaurants, bars and other businesses. Even where restrictions didn't exist, many Americans for months chose to stay home to avoid the risk of infection.Now, though, as vaccinations are increasingly administered around the country, business limitations are gradually eased and consumers grow more comfortable engaging face to face with others, optimism about the economy is rising. Last month, consumers bounced back from months of retrenchment to step up their spending by 2.4% — the sharpest increase in seven months and a sign that the economy may be poised to sustain a recovery.In the meantime, the number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases has dropped to an average of around 50,000 a day from nearly 250,000 in early January.A brightening outlook for the economy was reinforced Wednesday, when Congress gave final approval to a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill that will provide $1,400 payments to most adults and extend $300 weekly unemployment benefits into early September. The legislation will also provide money for viral vaccines and treatments, school re-openings, state and local governments and ailing industries ranging from airlines to concert halls.Many economists suggest that the combination of substantial federal aid, a rising pace of vaccinations, continually low borrowing rates and the increased willingness of consumers to spend will unleash a robust economic recovery later this year. Still, defeating the coronavirus remains vital to achieving a full recovery of the economy and the job market.“These are welcome policies, but they are still temporary relief," said AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “To fully heal the labor market, the public health situation must be under control. Coronavirus started this mess and continues to cause massive economic damage on a daily basis.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-712-000-as-layoffs-pace-eases-101615471537863.html
11-03-2021||World||Americans seek compensation for failed Covid-19 treatments from US fund||In March of last year, Steve Cicala took his wife, Susan, to the emergency room at Clara Maass Medical Center in New Jersey to treat a worsening cough and fever, unaware she had Covid-19.As her breathing and blood pressure deteriorated, she was given azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine and put on a ventilator. Eleven days after being admitted to the same hospital where she had worked for years as a nurse, Susan went into cardiac arrest and died at age 60.Steve Cicala is now the first person known to be pursuing a Covid-19 claim with a decade-old US government fund that has up to $30 billion that can be used to compensate for serious injuries or deaths caused by treatments or vaccines in the fight against the pandemic.Covid-19 presents the first serious test of the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program so far has denied compensation in 90% of the cases filed prior to the pandemic, mostly for H1N1 flu vaccines.Cicala's claim has not been previously reported.He could receive around $367,000 from the virtually untapped fund if he can show the treatment caused his wife's death. He is not alleging negligence against the hospital, which is largely protected from liability by an emergency health law."There's nothing that's going to bring her back," said Cicala, "but obviously with our two children and now two grandchildren, if there's something that we could do to help them out, that would be nice."Cicala, 58, said he believed the hospital provided the best care possible. Clara Maass declined to comment.A deadly combinationThe government does not publish specifics of claims to the fund, the amount of payouts or why claims are denied. HHS declined to comment.A Freedom of Information Act disclosure brought by a law professor and viewed by Reuters shows 48 claims were filed this year and were pending as of Feb. 16, for serious injuries and deaths from vaccines, ventilators and drugs - figures that have not previously been reported.All of these claims were related to Covid-19.To encourage life-saving efforts during a declared public health emergency, healthcare providers and drug companies can be shielded from nearly all lawsuits, and claims for serious injuries or deaths are instead filed with the CICP.That legal protection extends to Covid-19 vaccines by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE , and Johnson & Johnson, as well as approved medicines, which briefly included the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine touted by former President Donald Trump.US regulators revoked the emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine after studies suggested it was not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients.Electrocardiogram records show Susan Cicala's heart rhythms were disrupted by hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, according to her husband's lawyer, Jonathan Levitt of Frier Levitt."Those two in combination are known to be deadly now," said Levitt. "And she was also placed on a ventilator, which as you know, also has some substantial dangers."Cicala's is one of about a dozen claims Levitt has filed with the fund. He said he has more than 200 clients planning to seek compensation for deaths allegedly caused by failed Covid-19 treatments."Our cases are mostly about hydroxychloroquine," said Levitt, who gets paid a portion of successful claims, though he declined to say how much.US lawsuits over some drugs have run into billions of dollars and protection against liability was seen as key to developing vaccines at breakneck speed during a pandemic.However, critics said the compensation fund pays out relatively small amounts for serious injuries and lacks transparency.In its 10-year history, the fund has paid $6 million for 29 claims for vaccine injuries, according to disclosures obtained by Peter Meyers, a Georgetown Law professor and vaccine injury specialist, and viewed by Reuters. Most of those were for the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome caused by the H1N1 flu vaccine.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates about 123 million people received the H1N1 vaccine.Of the 48 coronavirus-related claims received by the fund, 21 involved Covid-19 vaccines, including three deaths, according to the FOIA information obtained by Meyers.The CDC said it has received reports of deaths among people who received Covid-19 vaccines, but has no evidence linking the shots to the fatalities.Based on Meyers' FOIA information, it appears fewer than 25 claims were filed in 2020, and it was not clear whether these were Covid-19 related.Through the end of January, more than 25 million people in the United States received at least one coronavirus vaccine dose. Meyers said the number of vaccine claims suggests the shots are extremely safe.Still, he said the program's lack of transparency could undermine support for protecting drug companies from lawsuits and for drugs and vaccines authorized for emergency use."It’s important to have openness to gain the trust of the American public and to counter the vaccine hesitancy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-seek-compensation-for-failed-covid-19-treatments-from-us-fund-101615471065740.html
11-03-2021||World||Vietnam overlooks Chinese Covid-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca shots||Vietnam, which recently began its inoculation drive, has overlooked China-made vaccines, opting for the vaccine developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca instead.According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), the programme will be initially conducted in 18 hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and in areas with higher infection numbers, according to Vietnam health minister Nguyen Thanh Long.China's Sinopharm has said the vaccine made by its Wuhan subsidiary has a 72.5 per cent efficacy, while the Beijing-based Sinovac's vaccine was found to be 50.6 per cent effective, one of the lowest efficacy rates as compared to any existing coronavirus vaccine."Besides what's available in the public health care system, the next option for me would be the vaccine from Russia, then the US, then the one from China if there is no other choice," said Hanoi resident Hoang Cam Hang.Hang's stance reflects Vietnam's move to steer clear of Chinese vaccines, despite Beijing's pledge to make vaccines a global public good and offer priority access to developing countries, reported SCMP.Vietnam, which has reported one of the lowest total Covid-19 infections, is the only country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc that has yet to publicly vouch for the use of China-made vaccines.China's vaccine diplomacy had failed with Vietnam mainly because of anti-China sentiments among the public, said Nguyen Phuong Linh, associate director with global consultancy firm Control Risks."From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the virus has been widely reported in Vietnam as originally coming from China. Since then, the anti-China sentiments, which were already strong, have shown no sign of weakening," said Linh.Furthermore, Huong Le Thu, a senior analyst, said China did not come to Vietnam with offers of personal protective equipment (PPE) as it had to other Southeast Asian neighbours, which depicted a level of politicisation in Beijing's Covid-19 diplomacy.According to SCMP, Vietnam and China have always had an uneasy diplomatic relationship, with hostile sentiments being fuelled by an ongoing territorial dispute in the South China Sea between China, Vietnam and three other ASEAN countries, along with Beijing's activities on the Mekong River that have affected ASEAN countries.Bilateral tensions between both sides has resurfaced as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited nine ASEAN states over few months except Vietnam.Meanwhile, Vietnam aims to inoculate 80 per cent of its population or about 72 million people to achieve herd immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-overlooks-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-for-astrazeneca-shots-101615469354355.html

By then, it was too late, and the virus had reached every continent except Antarctica.The agency made some costly missteps along the way: It advised people against wearing masks for months and asserted that Covid-19 wasn't widely spread in the air. It also declined to publicly call out countries — particularly China — for mistakes that senior WHO officials grumbled about privately.Globally, there's been 118 million coronavirus cases and 2.6 million confirmed deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The United States leads the world with 29 million cases and more than 529,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-still-struggling-to-manage-pandemic-response-101615470521950.html

11-03-2021||World||US concerned as Chinese human rights lawyer goes missing||The United States has expressed concerns about the whereabouts of Chinese lawyer Wang Yu, who went missing ahead of the International Women's Day awards ceremony to honour her human rights work.She was among the recipients of the State Department's "international women of courage" awards for her past work on "politically sensitive" cases advocating for individuals ranging from activists and abused children to scholars and members of religious and ethnic minority groups.According to South China Morning Express, Wang has expressed her intention to participate in Monday's virtual ceremony, before losing touch with State Department officials, according to US State Secretary Antony Blinken."We have not been in regular communication over the past two days," he said during the event."We're concerned because we know that she wanted to attend today's ceremony. We'll be following up and, if necessary, speaking out on her case," he added.A State Department representative did not answer whether the administration believed Wang had been detained by authorities but said the US government was worried about her "safety and security", and disappointed that "she wasn't given the freedom" to attend Monday's event.Wang, who was rounded up by authorities in China's nationwide "709" crackdown against human rights lawyers in 2015, had recently travelled from Beijing to Guangzhou in southern China with her husband Bao Longjun, according to Chen Jiangang, a US-based friend of Wang's and a fellow "709" human rights lawyer.Chen told the South China Morning Post neither Wang nor her husband had answered their telephones since Sunday when Bao said he had been contacted by public security officers and told not to leave Guangzhou.In a separate statement, the State Department said Wang had been "harassed, threatened, searched, and physically assaulted by police since she began to take on rights abuse cases in 2011" and had been prohibited by authorities from leaving China.In July 2015, Wang was the first lawyer to be caught up in a nationwide crackdown that ultimately saw some 300 rights lawyers and activists rounded up by authorities.Wang and Bao were later charged with inciting subversion of state power, before she was released in 2016 following a televised and - according to her - coerced confession.Her case caught the attention of the United Nations, international bar associations, and a number of foreign governments, including the US and European Union.In 2019, Wang was detained by authorities as she arrived at the US embassy in Beijing to attend a seminar about domestic violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-concerned-as-chinese-human-rights-lawyer-goes-missing-101615468293306.html
11-03-2021||World||Saudi Arabia shuts down 184 Chinese websites for marketing fake products: Report||Saudi Arabia has shut down 184 Chinese websites for targeting the Saudi market with poor and adulterated goods and fake offers, Gulf News reported.The websites also failed to offer consumers the option of return and exchange and after-sales services and instead deluded buyers with the quality of the offered products, Al Jazirah newspaper reported.The ministry blocked all these sites that do not include the store's data, address and contact numbers along with customer service.It urged the general public to deal with trusted stores, and not to respond to ads promoted through social media for the unknown.Authorities realised that the people are getting attracted to the advertisements in Arabic, which have links attached to them. When they blocked one such site, five other websites opened and sales through it.Saudi officials said 184 sites had been launched with the aim of attracting more people at the same time as they were also blocked.Consumer products such as electronics, perfumes, bags, shoes, clothes and cosmetics were sold through these online websites.Following the discovery of the scam, the ministry conducted further research on the sites and action was then taken against them.The ministry said the closure was due to a lack of information about the online store, address, phone number and user care facility. The ministry urged people to buy only from reputable online stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-shuts-down-184-chinese-websites-for-marketing-fake-products-report-101615468495635.html
11-03-2021||World||Australia to equip schools with educational material on sexual consent||Australian children will soon be given fundamental educational lessons on consent, sexual abuse, and the basics of respectful relationships.To this end, education minister Alan Tudge, in an interview with Sky News, said that the federal government would in the coming weeks distribute 'Respect Matters', a suite of educational material, in schools across the country.The move was triggered by a petition launched by 22-year-old Chanel Contos, a former Sydney school student who calls for a more comprehensive sex education curriculum across Australia.To Contos, the rising number of sexual abuse cases in the country is intrinsically linked to a dearth of elementary education regarding enthusiastic consent, sexual coercion, and slut-shaming, as reflective of the "rape culture" in the society. The 22-year-old activist has especially been vocal about the cases of sexual assault and rape in Australian schools and has shared thousands of such accounts over the past couple of weeks. Her petition advocating for improved sex education in schools has encouraged several women to actively resist sexual abuse in the workplace and triggered a national debate on substantial measures regarding the same.The petition, titled 'Teach Us Consent' has already managed to garner more than 30,000 signatures and sparked close to 3,000 testimonies from women who experienced sexual misconduct in schools.Education minister Tudge, while announcing the government's plans to distribute educational material in schools, also admired the courage of all the activists fighting for the aforementioned cause."I've got to say I've been quite shocked at the extent of the number of people who are coming forward," Tudge was quoted as saying.According to the data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), about one in six girls and one in ten boys face abuse, sexual or otherwise, before the age of 15.Around 374 juvenile sexual assault cases were reported in New South Wales in 2020, while less than 10% of the rapes reported to the police resulted in a conviction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-equip-schools-with-educational-material-on-sexual-consent-101615464444378.html
11-03-2021||World||NPC will mend Hong Kong’s voting system, Keqiang to focus on creating jobs||China’s biggest political gathering of the year came to a close Thursday, with the National People’s Congress approving to overhaul Hong Kong’s electoral system and Premier Li Keqiang vowing to focus on creating jobs.This year’s NPC gathering condensed into half its usual two-week length due to coronavirus restrictions showcased President Xi Jinping’s confidence after China emerged from the pandemic as the only major economy to expand in 2020. Over the past week, the government has laid out ambitious plans to overtake the US in research-and-development investment and shift its capital-intensive growth model toward services and consumer spending.China will prioritize stable economic growth and the creation of new jobs as its main goals for 2021, with the nation needing sustainable expansion, not large fluctuations, Premier Li said during his annual press briefing.“We would certainly be happy to see robust growth, but we are also keenly aware of the large uncertainty around the economic rebound in China as well as global economic growth and development,” Li told reporters in Beijing Thursday at the conclusion of the NPC. The growth goal of more than 6% “is not a low target,” he said.A surge in Chinese stocks on the last day of the NPC failed to prevent them from posting their worst performance during the event since 2009. The CSI 300 Index fell 2.9% over the week-long legislative meeting despite the gauge surging 2.5% Thursday, its biggest daily gain in two months.An equity rout triggered by growing concern over liquidity tightening and possible asset bubbles cast a cloud on this year’s gathering, which was condensed into half its usual two-week length due to coronavirus restrictions. Despite gaining in the last two sessions, the benchmark stock gauge is still down 12% from a 13-year high reached on Feb. 10. With the NPC concluding, some investors are looking for buying opportunities.Also read: China to grow at more than 6% in 2021; defence outlay $200bn for the first timeHong Kong Overhaul Approved Chinese lawmakers approved an extensive overhaul of how Hong Kong chooses its leaders, a momentous step in Beijing’s efforts to curb opposition in the Asian financial hub’s political system.The National People’s Congress overwhelmingly passed a proposal Thursday expected to change the size and composition of the body that picks the city’s chief executive, and have it nominate local legislators. The rubber-stamp parliament was also slated to call for establishing a mechanism to ensure candidates for elected office are “patriots,” remaking the only open elections under Beijing’s rule.Takeaways for Commodities China’s first attempt to chart a course to carbon neutrality by 2060 appeared underwhelming but the NPC still provided fodder for commodities investors. One is Beijing’s unwillingness to stretch out stimulus now that the recovery from the pandemic is almost assured, which is likely to dent optimism in the idea of a new super cycle. It bodes ill for ferrous markets, particularly given plans to reduce steel output to meet carbon goals, although metals with greener credentials like copper won’t be immune from restraints on spending.China is taking a two-step approach to climate change that would limit emissions reductions before 2035, but leave most of the heavy lifting for later, when the impact on growth will have less of effect on a wealthier society and new energy sources such as hydrogen will be deployable.Today’s Only Story In case there was any doubt of its importance, the front pages of China’s major financial newspapers were plastered with stories about the annual political event. Also unsurprising was the positive tone of the coverage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/npc-will-mend-hong-kong-s-voting-system-keqiang-to-focus-on-creating-jobs-101615464200765.html

11-03-2021||World||China’s parliament approves major dam project near Arunachal Pradesh||China’s parliament on Thursday gave the go-ahead to the construction of a major dam and hydropower plant on the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet near the border with the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.The project was approved by the National People’s Congress (NPC) at its closing session on Thursday as part of the country’s 14th five-year plan.The Yarlung Zangbo flows through Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.The project was first announced in November last year. At the time, China had said it was within its legitimate rights to build a dam on the lower reaches of the river, also called Yarlung Tsangpo. Beijing had assured that the hydropower project will take into account the interests of the downstream countries - India and Bangladesh.This week, at least two top Chinese officials spoke about the importance of the project during the just-concluded annual session of the NPC.He Lifeng, director of China’s top planning body, the national development and reform commission (NDRC), said “the development of hydropower on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river” is a world-class landmark project alongside the Sichuan-Tibet railway and the coastal railway project along the Yangtze river.Last Saturday, Che Dalha, deputy Communist Party chief of TAR had said authorities should “strive to begin construction this year”.“Comprehensive planning and environmental impact assessments for the project should be approved as soon as possible,” he said on Saturday, according to a press release quoted by Reuters and published on Monday on an official regional government website.The new dam’s ability to generate hydropower could be three times that of central China’s Three Gorges Dam, which has the largest installed hydropower capacity in the world.“China will build a hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo river, one of the major waters in Asia that also passes through India and Bangladesh,” the state-run tabloid Global Times had said in a report on the project in November.“There is no parallel in history (of the project)… it will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry,” Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China (POWERCHINA), had said.The paperwork on the dam began with POWERCHINA on October 16 signing a strategic cooperation agreement covering the 14th five-year plan with the TAR government.When asked in December about the project and its impact on lower riparian countries, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying had brushed aside apprehensions.“Hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right. When it comes to the use and development of cross-border rivers, China always acts responsibly,” she had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-parliament-approves-major-dam-project-near-arunachal-pradesh-101615465774223.html

"But we're on different paths."The interview was watched by 12.4 million viewers in Britain and 17.1 million in the United States.It has proved divisive among the British public: some believe it showed how outdated and intolerant the institution was, while others decried it as a self-serving assault that neither Elizabeth nor her family deserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-not-racist-prince-william-says-after-meghan-and-harry-interview-101615463334106.html
11-03-2021||World||'Chinese business, Out!' Myanmar anger threatens investment plans||"China's gas pipeline will be burned," chanted a group of protesters in Myanmar this week on the route of a Chinese pipeline.Hailed by China as a symbol of "mutually beneficial cooperation", the pipeline has become a target for public anger over perceptions Beijing is backing the junta that seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.The rise in anti-China sentiment has raised questions in Myanmar business circles and in China, not only over the surge of Chinese investment in recent years but for billions of dollars earmarked for a strategic neighbour on Beijing's "Belt and Road" infrastructure plan."Chinese business, Out! Out!," the dozen or so protesters shouted in Mandalay city, a staging point on pipelines across Myanmar from the Indian Ocean to China. Social media carried many more threats.The gas pipeline, which carries gas from Myanmar's offshore fields, opened in 2013, as Myanmar's military was starting democratic reforms. The $1.5 billion 770-km (480 mile) oil pipe alongside, bringing crude mainly from the Middle East, started in 2017 under the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is now detained and facing an array of charges.A PetroChina official who declined to be identified said there had been no problems with the operation of the oil pipeline - the only source of crude for the state energy giant’s refinery in Kunming, Yunnan province.Protests over the pipeline flared after a Myanmar government document leaked from a Feb. 24 meeting showed Chinese officials had asked Myanmar's junta to provide better security - and intelligence on ethnic minority armed groups on the pipeline route.Reuters was unable to reach officials in Myanmar for comment on the document."Safeguarding the security of bilateral cooperation projects is the common responsibility of both China and Myanmar," China's foreign ministry said in response to questions on the document, reiterating its call for "all sides in Myanmar to exercise calm and restraint" and to resolve their differences."This would also benefit the secure operations of bilateral cooperation projects," it said.China did not immediately respond to a question on anti-China sentiment.Hostile opinionBillions of dollars had been earmarked for such projects, including an economic corridor ending at a $1.3 billion deepwater port, industrial zones, a new city next to the commercial hub of Yangon and a railway to the border."Hostile public opinion will inflict long-term threats and damage to China’s plan," said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.She pointed in particular to the damage done to Beijing's reputation over the Myitsone Dam project, which was shelved in 2011 amid a local outcry - prompting a concerted effort by China to cultivate the public as well as political leaders."Public opinion has been treated as a priority for China’s policy in Myanmar," she said.Efforts in recent years included everything from donating school backpacks to sponsoring inspection trips to China for officials - though a 2018 survey in Myanmar still found an "explicit bias" against Chinese investments.China had also tried to keep close to Suu Kyi, while maintaining ties to the army that overthrew her.Balancing the relationship has become even more precarious.While Western countries have condemned the coup, China has not even described it as one - in line with the generals' wishes. Its call for restraint from both sides draws scorn from opponents of the coup who point to the killing of more than 60 protesters. One policeman has died, the army says."China shame on you. Stop supporting the theft of a nation," read one protest placard outside the Chinese embassy before Myanmar security forces cordoned it off.SuspicionsNo matter how outlandish, allegations of Chinese involvement have swirled on social media.Some said they had seen soldiers with Chinese features or heard some speaking Mandarin. Suspicions were raised by an increase in night-time flights to China - flights the state airline said carried seafood for the Lunar New Year holiday.Unsubstantiated claims surfaced that the planes were bringing in soldiers or technicians to install an internet firewall - an idea dismissed by the junta and described as "nonsense" by the Chinese ambassador.Concerns that anti-Beijing sentiment could turn on Chinese businesses has prompted some to reconsider their positions - especially as anti-coup protests and strikes strangle the economy."They can only vent on the Chinese people on the ground," said one Chinese businessman who gave his name as Ran and is now seeking a way out - while saying he had not faced any personal attacks.Myanmar also has a substantial minority with Chinese origins, whose older members remember anti-Chinese riots in 1967 in which an estimated 30 people were killed. Some younger members, however, have taken a conspicuous stand with the protesters."Our elders worry about the Sinophobic posts - things on Facebook like 'the Chinese will be the first people to be beaten' but it's only a small number of people making them," said Aung Aung, 23, a founder of the Young Burmese-Chinese Association."The people know where we stand. We want to get democracy back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-business-out-myanmar-anger-threatens-investment-plans-101615459892289.html
11-03-2021||World||EU to take legal action against the UK government for failing to keep promise||The European Commission is preparing to take legal action against the British government in coming days over its failure to keep promises it made in the Brexit deal to keep the island of Ireland free of border checkpoints.Here’s what what the EU is planning to do:Start an ‘infringement’ caseUnder the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK remains subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice, so the commission can start an infringement procedure against Britain as if it were still a member of the bloc.The process can take as long as three years, but can be sped up. After months of formal back and forth, the EU court can ultimately issue a ruling that would be binding on Britain. The ECJ could impose financial penalties on the UK if it ignores the decision.It’s this route that the commission took in October 2020 when Britain’s proposed Internal Market bill looked like giving the government unilateral powers to suspend parts of the Protocol. This action was ended in December after the sides reached a compromise.Also read: EU wants employers to report pay levels to fix gender gapInvoke the dispute-resolution mechanismThe second course of action makes use of the dispute resolution mechanism in the Brexit deal. The EU would accuse the UK of not acting in “good faith” as the two sides committed to do in their agreements.This again is a drawn-out process that eventually sees a five-member arbitration panel set up. The panel can take as long as a year to issue a binding ruling. Again, any questions of interpretation of EU law would be sent to the ECJ.If the UK didn’t comply with the arbitration panel’s decision, a financial penalty could be imposed. And if that wasn’t paid, the EU could suspend parts of the Brexit divorce deal -- as well as the trade deal signed in December. That could mean trade tariffs would be imposed.In the meantime, the EU might face a dilemma in how it conducts checks on goods that could be moved into the single market via Northern Ireland.Why has it come to this?Under the Brexit deal, Northern Ireland stayed in the EU’s customs union and some of the single market. This prevented the need for border checks on the island of Ireland, which was a condition for a wider Brexit deal -- but introduced them on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.It’s always been an uneasy compromise, disliked by the UK government and unionists in Northern Ireland.Last month, the government said it would unilaterally waive customs paperwork on food entering Northern Ireland until October, beyond the April 1 deadline it had agreed. The EU said it was a violation of the treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-take-legal-action-against-the-uk-government-for-failing-to-keep-promise-101615454558646.html

The SuperCam was developed jointly by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico, and a consortium of French research laboratories. The audio files, which were first delivered to the operation centre of the French space agency, the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES), in Toulouse, include sounds of wind and rhythmic tapping sound of laser strikes on Mars.“The sounds acquired are remarkable quality,” Naomi Murdoch, a research scientist at the ISAE-SUPAERO aerospace engineering school in Toulouse, was quoted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as saying. “It’s incredible to think that we’re going to do science with the first sounds ever recorded on the surface of Mars!” she added.The first audio file, obtained about 18 hours after landing, captured the faint sounds of Martian wind since the rover’s mast remained stowed on its deck. According to Nasa, the muffled sound is “little like the sound one hears listening to a seashell or having a hand cupped over the ear.” The second file also has the sound of wind from Mars, recorded on Perseverance’s fourth Martian day, and is “more audible, especially around the 20-second mark.”Things are sounding really good here. Listen to the first sounds of wind captured by my SuperCam microphone. This mic is located at the top of my mast. For this recording, my mast was still down so the sound is a bit muffled. https://t.co/0KpN30oIroRead | NASA's Perseverance 'SuperCam' begins hunt for past life on MarsThe US space agency said that the third file includes the rhythmic zapping sounds of a laser impacting a rock target 30 times at a distance of about 10 feet. Some zaps sound are slightly louder than others and the variations in the intensity will provide information on the physical structure of the targets, such as their relative hardness or the presence of weathering coatings.“This information will be essential when determining which samples to cache and ultimately return to Earth through our groundbreaking Mars Sample Return Campaign, which will be one of the most ambitious feats ever undertaken by humanity,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at Nasa headquarters, said in a statement.🔊 You’re listening to the first audio recordings of laser strikes on Mars. These rhythmic tapping sounds heard by the microphone on my SuperCam instrument have different intensities that can help my team figure out the structure of the rocks around me. https://t.co/nfWyOyfhNyOne of the listeners on SoundCloud, an online music sharing platform, compared the audio recording of the laser with a ticking time bomb while another said it was "like a symphony." Last week, the Perseverance rover performed its first drive on Mars that lasted about 33 minutes, covering 21.3 metres across the Martian surface.

11-03-2021||World||Denmark suspends use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine over blood clot fears||Danish health authorities said Thursday they were temporarily suspending the use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine after some patients developed blood clots since receiving the jab.The move comes "following reports of serious cases of blood clots among people vaccinated with AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine", the Danish Health Authority said in a statement.But it cautiously added that "it has not been determined, at the time being, that there is a link between the vaccine and the blood clots".Austria announced on Monday that it had suspended the use of a batch of AstraZeneca vaccines after a 49-year-old nurse died of "severe blood coagulation problems" days after receiving an anti-Covid shot.Four other European countries -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxemburg -- have also suspended the use of vaccines from this batch, which was sent to 17 European countries and consisting of one million jabs.Denmark has however suspended the use of all of its AstraZeneca supply.On Wednesday, Europe's medicines watchdog EMA said a preliminary probe showed that the batch of AstraZeneca vaccines used in Austria was likely not to blame for the nurse's death.As of March 9, 22 cases of blood clots had been reported among more than three million people vaccinated in the European Economic Area, the EMA said."It is important to point out that we have not terminated the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, we are just pausing its use," Danish Health Authority director Soren Brostrom said in the statement.Denmark said one person had died after receiving the vaccine. The EMA has launched an investigation into that death."There is broad documentation proving that the vaccine is both safe and efficient. But both we and the Danish Medicines Agency must act on information about possible serious side effects, both in Denmark and in other European countries," Brostrom said.The suspension, which will be reviewed after two weeks, is expected to slow down Denmark's vaccination campaign.Copenhagen now expects to have its entire adult population vaccinated by mid-August instead of early July, the health authority said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-suspends-use-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-over-blood-clot-fears-101615460885771.html

Nowhere is the discrepancy in vaccinations more glaring than in a comparison with Britain.The last available figures show that 35 % of the UK adult population has had a vaccine shot while the figure in the EU stands at 9.6 %.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-figures-show-major-covid-19-vaccine-exports-despite-shortage-back-home-101615456368186.html

Schools and most shops had followed in mid-December.But epidemiologists, pointing to more contagious virus variants as well as surging infection rates in Germany's neighbouring countries like the Czech Republic or Poland, have repeatedly warned against easing the partial lockdown too early.At the same time, Wieler said there are encouraging signs that a vaccination campaign was already starting to show effect."We see effects already in those who are over 80. The incidence (rate of infection) is on the decline, tremendously," he said.Germany focussed on vaccinating the oldest within its population when it began its innoculation campaign late December, but criticism has grown over the pace of the rollout as the country lags Britain or the United States.Wieler however voiced confidence that there was light at the end of the tunnel.If "everything doesn't run completely out of control... we will have control in Germany this autumn. I am absolutely convinced," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-sees-surge-in-covid-19-cases-amid-third-wave-warning-101615455406883.html
11-03-2021||World||US aims at helping India develop its own defence industrial base: Pentagon||The Biden administration is looking at deepening its military and technical cooperation with India by not only providing it with arms and equipment, but also helping New Delhi develop its own defence industrial base to allow it to work with the US and others around the region, a senior Pentagon official has told lawmakers.In 2016, the US recognised India as a 'Major Defense Partner' under which Washington will continue to work toward facilitating technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.India is a real partner, a rising partner of the United States, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey said while responding to a question from Congressman Doug Lamborn during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday on the Indo-Pacific region by the House Armed Services Committee."We are looking to ... deepen our military-technical cooperation with India that is based on providing them arms and equipment so we can build interoperable forces and capabilities and work with India developing its own defence industrial base so that India is able to produce equipment to service their needs and to be able to work with us and others around the region," Helvey said."We have a unique designation with India; it's called a Major Defense Partner," he said, ahead of US Defence Secretary Lloyd J Austin's first visit to India from March 19 to 21 that is expected to focus on ways to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and strengthen overall defence and security ties.Austin said he would be travelling to India to meet his counterpart Rajnath Singh and other senior national security leaders to discuss deepening the US-India Major Defense Partnership and advancing cooperation between the two countries.During the Congressional hearing, Helvey said one of the things that the US was prioritising is looking at ways to operationalise the defense partnership with India to be able to look at ways where both countries can work together in the defence space in pursuit of common interests based on their converging strategic interest."I think we all agree that it needs to be a better partner and a counterweight to China, so what is the Biden administration plan to build a stronger partnership with India both economically and militarily?" Congressman Lamborn asked."One of the things we would like to be able to do is built on some of the foundational agreements that we have been able to conclude with India in recent years. Say for example, with information security or logistics arrangements to where we can share more information with India so we can build a common strategic understanding of the types of threats that we face together," Helvey said."Look at how we can use our forces and Indian forces in the Indian Ocean region and beyond to be able to work together, whether it's in maritime domain awareness or maritime security or humanitarian assistance and disaster response," Helvey said.Admiral Phil Davidson, Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, responding to the same question said that over the course of his tenure at INDOPACOM there has been some opportunity to cooperate in the maritime and to assist a little bit in information sharing, some cold-weather gear, and things like that with India's challenges along the Line of Actual Control with China."I think it's gone a long way to deepening our relationship and really presents a key strategic opportunity I think, for the United States," he said.In his prepared testimony, Helvey said that in South Asia, America's Major Defense Partnership with India continues to deepen as the two nations build interoperability through increasingly complex exercises and growing defense trade, and through expanded information sharing and secure communications to address issues of shared concern."With the completion of all foundational agreements, the partnership is now poised to accelerate. We also are pursuing emerging partnerships with Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Maldives to work cooperatively to ensure the region remains free and open," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aims-at-helping-india-develop-its-own-defence-industrial-base-pentagon-101615455102961.html
11-03-2021||World||Hong Kong electoral system: Here are key points on China's move to overhaul it||China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC) moved on Thursday to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in the city's institutions.The changes also include a vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners.Here are the main points.Only "patriots" can rule Hong KongChina's Communist Party saw 2019's pro-democracy protests as a direct threat to national security and set out measures to bring Hong Kong onto an authoritarian path.In 2020, Beijing introduced a national security law, saying it will restore law and order but seen by critics as a tool to quash dissent. Most high-profile democratic politicians and activists are either in exile or jail for offences under the new law or related to the protests.The protests also convinced Beijing that a political system designed to allow a minority democratic opposition in the Legislative Council was a "loophole" or "deficiency" if those politicians were too hostile to the Communist Party.A new vetting and screening committee will ensure Hong Kong institutions will be filled only with "patriots," a term which China says includes people who love the country in its present-day form, led by the Communist Party.It remains unclear what space will be left for meaningful opposition in Hong Kong as well as to what extent and on which issues vetted politicians could have differing views on how the city should be governed.Analysts said the key risk is that if governing institutions are filled only with "true patriots" without true opposition, politicians would compete over who is more loyal to the Party rather than who has the best ideas for the city.Read | Hong Kong electoral changes undermine trust in China: UKElectoral committee reshuffledThe electoral committee stacked by design with pro-Beijing figures will get 300 extra seats, bringing the total to 1,500.An announcement of the draft decision did not spell out its future composition in full, but the 117 seats occupied by district councillors, the only fully democratic institution in Hong Kong - empowered, however, only to perform menial duties related to bus stops or garbage collection - is likely to be scrapped.The new seats are likely to be filled with more pro-Beijing people from various organisations. The electoral committee will then pick many of the seats in the legislature.Beijing reasserts control over legislative councilRiding high after the 2019 protests, democratic politicians won 90% of the district council seats in a vote later that year. That gave them a slim hope - or from Beijing's point of view, raised a risk - of them winning a tiny majority in the city's mini-parliament in since-postponed 2020 elections.The Legislative Council had 70 seats, with only half directly elected in geographical constituencies. The rest represented industry and professional interests in functional constituencies mostly stacked with pro-Beijing people.The Council will now have 90 seats, with the extra seats picked by the electoral committee. Five seats given previously to district councils via functional constituencies will likely be scrapped.Local media has said geographical constituencies will be restructured into 18 from five previously, with the first two winners past the post, ensuring the pro-Beijing candidate - likely to get the second place according to polls showing a 60%/40% democratic/establishment split - will probably get a seat.If any opposition candidate is allowed to run after passing patriotic vetting, they will then face ongoing screening, limiting their options for exercising opposition too passionately or through filibustering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-electoral-system-here-are-key-points-on-china-s-move-to-overhaul-it-101615453842786.html
11-03-2021||World||Myanmar military using 'battlefield weapons' against protesters, says Amnesty||Amnesty International accused Myanmar's military government on Thursday of increasingly using battlefield weapons against peaceful protesters and conducting systematic, deliberate killings.Myanmar has been roiled by protests and other acts of civil disobedience since a Feb. 1 military coup that toppled the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi just as it was to start its second term. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.The military “is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country,” Amnesty International said in a report.“By verifying more than 50 videos from the ongoing crackdown, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab can confirm that security forces appear to be implementing planned, systematic strategies including the ramped-up use of lethal force. Many of the killings documented amount to extrajudicial executions,” the report said.Security forces have used live ammunition against protesters, causing the deaths of about 60 people.There were new but unconfirmed accounts of additional deaths Wednesday and Thursday as police attempted to break up anti-coup protests in cities and towns across the country using tear gas and other weapons.As widespread protests against its takeover continue, the junta is facing a new challenge from the country's ethnic guerrilla forces, which until recently had limited themselves to verbal denunciations of last month's coup.Reports from Kachin, the northernmost state, said guerrilla forces from the Kachin ethnic minority attacked a government base on Thursday and were in turn attacked. The armed wing of the Kachin political movement is the Kachin Independence Army, or KIA.“This morning in Hpakant township, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO/KIA) attacked a military council battalion based in Sezin village, and the KIO/KIA’s Hpakant-based 9th Brigade and 26 battalions were attacked by helicopter. Both sides are still investigating,” The 74 Media reported on Twitter.A Facebook page for the Kachin Liberation Media said the KIA had overrun the government outpost and seized ammunition. It warned the government against using lethal force to break up anti-coup protests in the Kachin capital, Myitkyina, where two demonstrators were killed this week.The reports could not be independently confirmed, and ethnic guerrilla armies as well as the government often release exaggerated information. However, even making such an announcement amounts to a sharp warning to the government.The Kachin actions come a few days after another ethnic guerrilla force belonging to the Karen minority announced it would protect demonstrators in territory it controlled. The Karen National Union deployed armed combatants to guard a protest in Myanmar’s southeastern Tanintharyi Region.Myanmar has more than a dozen ethnic guerrilla armies, mostly in border areas, a legacy of decades-old struggles for greater autonomy from the central government. Many have formal or informal cease-fire agreements with the government, but armed encounters still occur.There has been speculation that some ethnic groups could form a de facto alliance with the protest movement to pressure the government.The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday unanimously called for a reversal of the military coup that ousted Suu Kyi’s government and strongly condemned the violence against peaceful protesters. The council also called for “utmost restraint” by the military.A presidential statement approved by all 15 council members was formally adopted at a virtual meeting. The British-drafted statement calls for the immediate release of leaders including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint who have been detained since the army's takeover. It supports the country’s democratic transition and “stresses the need to uphold democratic institutions.”The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions on two adult children of Myanmar’s junta chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. They are the latest in a series of sanctions imposed by the U.S. since the military seized power and began its deadly crackdown on protesters. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Myanmar’s military leaders should not be able “to derive benefits from the regime as it resorts to violence and tightens its stranglehold on democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-using-battlefield-weapons-against-protesters-says-amnesty-101615453532215.html
11-03-2021||World||No decision yet on US force posture in Afghanistan, says Tony Blinken||The Biden administration is currently reviewing its Afghanistan policy and has so far not made any decision on the American force posture in the war-torn country, Secretary of State Tony Blinken has said, ahead of the May 1 deadline for a final withdrawal of US troops - stipulated in a Taliban-US deal last year.The Biden administration has decided to review the Doha deal the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban in February 2020. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington's 18-year war in the country. The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.“I don't want to prejudge the outcome of that review,” Blinken told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.“There haven't been any decisions made yet on force posture when it comes to May 1 but as we are doing the review we are also pressing ahead with the diplomatic effort to try to drive the two parties to negotiate and to put in place agreements that would be the foundation for a just and durable peace in Afghanistan,” Blinken said.“That of course is a very tall order but one that we are working on and especially enlisting others into the effort because as we were discussing a little bit earlier neighbouring countries have a huge stake in Afghanistan not being a terrain for civil war that spills over the borders and they have influence with various parties,” he said in response to a question.“So we are engaging them, we are engaging the UN and others to try to move the parties to a meaningful negotiation even as we are looking very hard at the obligations the Taliban has made in the agreement that you reference particularly with regard to not supporting terrorist groups that could strike the US and reducing violence,” he said.US special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad spoke to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and they discussed the latest developments pertaining to the Afghan peace talks.India, a major stakeholder in Afghanistan, has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban.India has extended developmental assistance to tune of around USD 3 billion in the last few years to Afghanistan.The US, Blinken said, has boosted diplomatic efforts in Afghanistan, ahead of the May 1 deadline for a final withdrawal of US troops. The president's goal is very clear, he said.“It's to bring our troops home. And it's to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorism and an ongoing threat to the United States,” he said.“We are engaged in a diplomatic effort right now to try to drive the two parties to negotiate and to move forward on commitments that the Taliban made to the US a year ago to negotiate meaningfully on a peaceful future for Afghanistan. Not only are we doing that, as important, we're enlisting other countries, the United Nations, in that effort. Many of Afghanistan's neighbours have a real stake in its future and influence with the parties,” Blinken said.While the diplomatic effort is ongoing, the US is reviewing its own troop posture, including the May 1 deadline, he said.“We haven't made any decisions yet about that, and we went to see where this effort goes to actually get the parties to engage in a meaningful way. The Taliban made other commitments when it comes to reducing violence, when it comes to non-harbouring or supporting terrorists. We want to see them make good on those obligations,” Blinken said.The Biden administration on Tuesday said the US is working closely with Afghan parties to encourage progress on a political settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire, asserting that any durable outcome has to be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, and it is not for the US to dictate the deals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-decision-yet-on-us-force-posture-in-afghanistan-says-tony-blinken-101615453689737.html

The demonstration comprised 120 vehicles and it concluded at the Chinese consulate in the city.The event this year drew support from other rights groups confronting China’s domestic human rights violations, including those backing democracy in Hong Kong and opposing the persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang province.While messages of solidarity came from the leader of the Opposition in Canada, Conservative Party leader Erin O’Toole and New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, the event witnessed the participation of groups such as Canada-Hong Kong Link, Federation for Democratic China and World Uighur Congress.Pointing to Chinese aggression on the border with India and in the South China Sea, Youdon Tsamotshang, board chair of Students for a Free Tibet Canada and one of the principal organisers of Wednesday’s event, said, “The Tibet issue is a marker. We’ve suffered for the last 62 years. Now the rest of the world is bearing the brunt of China’s policy.”The event marked the anniversary of Tibetans’ resistance against Chinese occupation in Lhasa, which resulted in the movement being crushed by Beijing, forcing the Dalai Lama to escape to India in 1959, where he remains in exile.Organisers of the event in Toronto called upon the Canadian government to take legislative actions targeting China similar to that in the US and “stand by the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Buddhist community’s wishes to be in charge of the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation process”.That there is momentum in Canada for those opposing China’s policies was also evidenced by a poll released on Wednesday by Maru Public Opinion, which showed that 52% of respondents viewed China as the highest security threat faced by Canada, outstripping Russia, North Korea and Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibetans-in-canada-hold-rally-to-mark-1959-uprising-against-chinese-occupation-101615454133991.html

11-03-2021||World||China for decades waged campaign to destroy Tibet’s proud culture, history: Nancy Pelosi||China for decades has waged a campaign to destroy Tibet's proud culture and history, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has alleged, asserting that the US will continue to stand with the Tibetan people and honour those who sacrificed all for their rights and freedom.Speaking on the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day on Wednesday against the Chinese occupation of the remote Himalayan region, Pelosi said, “Sixty-two years ago, brave Tibetans rose up against the Chinese invasion to protect their way of life and culture. Today, we continue to stand with the Tibetan people and honour those who sacrificed all for their rights and freedom.”“Tibetan men, women and children want simply to practice their faith, speak their language and celebrate their culture free from violence and intimidation. Yet, Beijing for decades has waged a campaign to destroy Tibet’s proud culture and history, which remains a clarion call for action to freedom-loving people worldwide,” the top Democrat said.That is why, last year, the US reaffirmed its bipartisan, bicameral support for the people of Tibet by enacting the Tibet Policy and Support Act, which strengthens diplomatic ties between the US and the Central Tibetan Administration and makes clear that decisions regarding Tibetan religion should be made solely by Tibetan religious leaders, she asserted.Previous US president Donald Trump in December last year had signed into law a bill which called for establishing a US consulate in Tibet and building an international coalition to ensure that the next Dalai Lama is appointed solely by the Tibetan Buddhist community without China's interference. This prompted China to warn that the act will seriously disrupt and hurt bilateral relations.The new Joe Biden administration on Tuesday said the Chinese government should have no role in the succession process of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.“This year, as we mark this solemn anniversary, we continue to take inspiration from the Dalai Lama’s powerful message of peace, faith and love,” Pelosi said.“Guided by His Holiness’s spirit of hope, we will never rest in our efforts to advance freedom and opportunity in Tibet and throughout China – because if we do not stand up for human rights in China due to commercial interests, then we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights in any other place in the world. We will not be deterred in this vital mission,” said the House Speaker.The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader has been demanding meaningful autonomy for Tibetans.The 85-year-old Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile is based on Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.China views the 14th Dalai Lama as a "separatist" working to split Tibet from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-for-decades-waged-campaign-to-destroy-tibet-s-proud-culture-history-nancy-pelosi-101615445248760.html
11-03-2021||World||Porsche’s hometown offers clues to Germany’s Post-Merkel future||When the Green leader of Germany’s third-largest state flouted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coronavirus plan earlier this year, it was the latest sign that the former fringe party is confident enough to challenge the authority of her conservative bloc.“I am fully in line with Merkel, but I have my own way,” Winfried Kretschmann said in a national TV appearance, explaining the move with a mix of independence and respect that’s cementing support among local voters.In a state election on Sunday, the 72-year-old former student radical and anti-nuclear activist is on track to build out his advantage and secure a third term running Baden-Wuerttemberg -- an industrial powerhouse in Germany’s southwest known for fast cars and cuckoo clocks.Current polls suggest Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is set for its worst performance ever in the state. The historic defeat would come with the party on the back foot over a scandal involving claims of politicians profiting off the coronavirus pandemic. If trends continue, the Greens’ unusual strength in Baden-Wuerttemberg could be a sign of things to come.CDU officials in Berlin fear the Greens could abandon their alliance in the state and instead form a coalition with the Social Democrats and the pro-business Free Democrats, according to people familiar with the party’s deliberations.That would leave Merkel’s party out of government in Stuttgart -- the state capital and hometown of Porsche and Mercedes-Benz -- for only the third time since World War II, a tough setback ahead of September’s national election.Falling out with the Greens in a region that represents about 15% of the German economy and 13% of the population could ultimately raise questions about the likeliest coalition in Berlin after Merkel steps down.CDU officials are increasingly concerned that the “Merkel bonus” will evaporate as it moves closer to the September vote, especially if she continues to struggle with the pandemic, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are internal.While similar three-way alliances are unlikely on the federal level, sidelining the CDU in Baden-Wuerttemberg would signal the Greens are ready to battle Germany’s biggest party for control in the post-Merkel era.The scandal over allegations that politicians in Merkel’s bloc benefited financially from face-mask contracts is a significant blow. Two officials, including one from Baden-Wuerttemberg, have resigned in recent days, hitting the group just before the weekend’s elections.Citizens of Rhineland-Palatinate are likewise voting on Sunday, and with corruption claims swirling, the CDU is expected to lose support in that SPD-led western state as well.For the national election, the conservative bloc is also anxious about how voters will react to the group’s chancellor candidate. The choice -- which will make it even clearer that Merkel is no longer the face of the bloc -- is between the CDU’s new chief Armin Laschet and Markus Soeder, the head of the Bavarian CSU sister party. A decision is expected by late May.Around the same time, the Greens will choose their own contender. Co-leaders Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck are both seen as capable challengers.“We can perform miracles” and do nothing less than transform Germany, Baerbock said at a party convention in November.The Greens -- who served as the junior partner to the Social Democrats under Gerhard Schroeder -- have surged in recent years, bolstered by widespread German concerns about climate change. They were briefly neck-and-neck with the CDU/CSU before the coronavirus crisis.A successful run this election cycle could have a ripple effect across Europe and chart a path for other environmental groups to push for power.The cornerstone of the party’s national campaign involves a plan to invest 500 billion euros ($600 billion) over 10 years -- equivalent to an annual boost of about 1.5% to Europe’s largest economy.While the CDU squirms at the prospect of more borrowing, the Greens want to finance the transition to a clean economy by raising debt and taxing big tech companies and the wealthy, who tend to vote for the conservatives.Kretschmann, a former school teacher and devout Catholic, played a key role in the party’s mainstream shift. He was the first Green state premier, when elected in 2011. Despite initial fears of anti-auto policies, his pragmatic approach has contributed to the second-lowest unemployment rate in Germany’s 16 states.The party is now involved in 11 regional governments, but Baden-Wuerttemberg is the only coalition it leads.Heading into the state’s vote, the Greens’ support has risen to 32% from 30.3% in the 2016 state election, according to a poll by INSA. The CDU, which once regular won majorities there, could decline to a new low of 25% from 27%.Despite policy differences, Kretschmann is an advocate for an alliance between the Greens and the CDU/CSU on the national level. He says the mix could help in the fight against climate change, which will only be successful if it “promises prosperity and doesn’t create fear,” he said this week on ZDF television.“Two important parties from different camps would come together,” Kretschmann said. “That’s not a bad thing in difficult times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/porsches-hometown-offers-clues-to-germany-s-post-merkel-future-101615444398672.html
11-03-2021||World||US, China diplomats to hold first in-person talks of Biden presidency||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with top Chinese officials on March 18 in Alaska, the White House said on Wednesday, the first high-level in-person contact between the two sparring countries under the Biden administration.The meeting, taking place on Blinken's return from his first overseas trip to key US allies Japan and South Korea, will come amid what is shaping up to be a major US diplomatic push to solidify alliances in Asia and Europe to counter China.National security adviser Jake Sullivan will join the meeting in Anchorage with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and State Councillor Wang Yi, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, adding that the administration would approach its relations with China "in lockstep" with its partners."It was important to us that this administration's first meeting with Chinese officials be held on American soil, and occur after we have met and consulted closely with partners and allies in both Asia and Europe," Psaki told a news briefing.She said the meeting would be "an opportunity to address a wide range of issues, including ones where we have deep disagreements."China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment.President Joe Biden's administration has committed to reviewing elements of US policies toward China, as the world's two largest economies navigate frosty relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during Donald Trump's presidency.Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, held their first phone call as leaders last month and appeared at odds on most issues, even as Xi warned that confrontation would be a "disaster" for both nations.Testifying before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Blinken signaled next week's meeting would not be a return to regular senior-level dialogues used under past US administrations, which had been increasingly criticized in Washington for yielding little progress on US grievances with Beijing."There's no intent at this point for a series of follow-on engagements. Those engagements, if they are to follow, really have to be based on the proposition that we're seeing tangible progress and tangible outcomes on the issues of concern to us with China," Blinken said.US DIPLOMATIC PUSHBlinken also said that if China insists it is not violating the human rights of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, it should provide the world access to the area.UN experts and rights groups say China has detained more than a million Uighurs and other minorities there, actions the United States has deemed a genocide. Beijing denies abuses, saying facilities in the region are for vocational training to counter the threat of terrorism.The talks will follow the visit by Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to Japan and South Korea next week, as well as an online summit on Friday between Biden and the leaders of Japan, India and Australia.That will be the first leader-level meeting of the four-country group, known as the Quad, seen as part of US efforts to boost its diplomacy in Asia to balance China's growing military and economic power.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the timing of the meeting sends the message to Beijing that US alliances are strong.Discussions are likely to focus on China's policies toward Hong Kong, its pressure on Taiwan, its treatment of Uighurs, and what Washington sees as economic coercion against Australia, she said."If the Chinese repeat their messages contained in recent speeches that the US is to blame for the problems in the US-China relationship and therefore the ball is in the US court, then nothing positive will come of this meeting," Glaser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-diplomats-to-hold-first-in-person-talks-of-biden-presidency-101615443692825.html
11-03-2021||World||'Unforgettable memory': Japan falls silent to mark decade since tsunami disaster||Japan fell silent on Thursday to mark 10 years since the worst natural disaster in the country's living memory: a powerful earthquake, deadly tsunami and nuclear meltdown that traumatised a nation.A minute's silence was observed across the country at 2.46 pm local time (0546 GMT), the precise moment a 9.0 magnitude quake hit off the northeast coast on March 11, 2011.Around 18,500 people were killed or left missing in the disaster, most of them claimed by the towering waves triggered by one of the strongest quakes ever recorded.The ensuing nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant blanketed nearby areas with radiation, rendering some towns uninhabitable for years and displacing tens of thousands of residents.Speaking at a ceremony in Tokyo's national theatre, Emperor Naruhito said the "unforgettable memory of the tragedy" persisted a decade on."Many of those afflicted, in spite of their having suffered from unimaginably enormous damage, have overcome numerous hardships by helping one another," he added.The annual memorial event was held before a smaller audience than usual, with the capital and nearby areas currently under a virus state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the challenges faced by survivors had been compounded by the pandemic and natural disasters, including a recent strong quake in the region, classified as an aftershock of the 2011 tremor.But he said Japan had always "overcome every crisis with courage and hope".Private and public commemorations were seen across Japan as bereaved local residents laid flowers at graves and placed letters to missing family members into the sea.As the sun rose in Fukushima prefecture's Hisanohama, 78-year-old Toshio Kumaki walked along a giant sea wall built after the tsunami and offered a prayer.Around 60 people were killed in Ohisa, one of the districts adjacent to the beach, when tsunami waves of seven metres washed ashore, wiping away everything but a tiny shrine.Kumaki's eyes filled with tears as he remembered the disaster. "It was really scary."Tributes and condolences poured in from around the world, with everyone from UN Secretary Antonio Guterres to singer Lady Gaga offering their thoughts on the anniversary.- 'People died before my eyes' -Searches for those still missing are taking place this week, as loved ones refuse to relinquish hope of finding them even a decade on.The chances of success may appear slim, but just last week the remains of a woman missing since the tsunami were identified, in what her surviving son described as a chance to process his emotions and move forward.The disaster is being marked just two weeks before the Olympic torch relay kicks off in Fukushima prefecture, nodding to efforts to cast the event as the 'Reconstruction Games'.The pandemic has cast a long shadow over the Olympics, forcing their unprecedented year-long postponement, but the government and organisers are hoping the relay will bring the spotlight back to the region.A decade on, the disaster has shaped Japan's preparations for natural disasters, with many towns along the coast building new or higher sea walls.Evacuation routes and plans have been refined and improved in a country that regularly deals with disasters ranging from typhoons to earthquakes.Nayuta Ganbe in Miyagi's Sendai city speaks often at events about disaster prevention, sharing his experience of the tsunami, but he usually marks the anniversary privately."It's the day when I lost my classmates. People died before my eyes. March 11 is a day that I hoped would never come again," the 21-year-old told AFP recently.But this year he has decided to participate in an event on the anniversary, hoping it will help him with the ongoing work of processing the trauma he experienced.For others, the anniversary will be a moment for private reflection on a tragedy that continues to reverberate.Tens of thousands of people who evacuated fearing radiation are still displaced, and around two percent of Fukushima remains off-limits.Most of Japan's nuclear reactors are still offline, and government plans to revitalise the sector are controversial.Reverend Akira Sato, who ministered at several churches that in areas still largely off-limits around the Fukushima plant, will be spending the day in reflection at one of the churches he had to abandon."Together with my wife, I will silently think back over the days of the disaster and offer a prayer."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unforgettable-memory-japan-falls-silent-to-mark-decade-since-tsunami-disaster-101615443124920.html

The corridor will facilitate travel for commercial, tourism and official purposes.The talks come as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to travel to the UAE on Thursday, his first known visit to the Gulf country after they normalized their relations last year.Israel and the UAE last year agreed on 28 direct weekly flights connecting Tel Aviv with Abu Dhabi and Dubai before Israel barred foreign flights to limit exposure to new virus strains.Israel leads the race to vaccinate its population. It has fully inoculated more than half its residents, while the UAE is on track for that goal by March-end.

11-03-2021||World||US blacklists Islamic extremist groups in Congo, Mozambique as terrorist units||The United States on Wednesday blacklisted two Islamist extremist groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique as foreign terrorist organizations over accusations of links to Islamic State (ISIS).The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Congo and its leader Seka Musa Baluku and Mozambique's Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama and its leader Abu Yasir Hassan were also named "specially designated global terrorists."The designations prevent travel by members to the United States, freeze any US-related assets, ban Americans from doing business with them and make it a crime to provide support or resources to the movements.The United States dubbed the groups ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique."The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) announced the launch of the Islamic State Central Africa Province (ISCAP) in April 2019 to promote the presence of ISIS associated elements within Central, East, and Southern Africa," the State Department said in a statement."Although ISIS-associated media portray ISCAP as a unified structure, ISIS-DRC and ISIS-Mozambique are distinct groups with distinct origins," it said. "These groups have committed or pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism."The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan insurgent faction active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has committed a spate of brutal reprisal attacks on civilians since the army began operations against it in late 2019.Also read: US assumes leadership of Quad, says President Joe Biden convened upcoming summitThe ADF has been blamed for the killing of over 140 people since the start of the year, in almost weekly attacks in Congo’s restive east. The group killed around 850 people last year, according to UN figures.Islamic State funding and recognition has driven the ADF into a new phase of deadly expansion, said Laren Poole from the Bridgeway Foundation, a US based thinktank."We believe that targeting the group's financial and recruitment networks will provide the most effective way to reduce the Islamic State in DRC's capacity for violence," Poole told Reuters.Some analysts, though, have questioned links between the ADF and Islamic State."These new sanctions probably won't have much effect on the ground, just as the sanctions on ADF in 2014 changed nothing," said Dan Fahey, a former member of an independent group of experts charged with monitoring UN sanctions on DRC."It is a symbolic act, and a bit surprising because the group of experts has consistently downplayed the nature and strength of the ISIS influence in Congo," he added.Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, known in Mozambique as Al-Shabaab, staged its first attack in 2017. First known mainly for beheadings, the fighters declared allegiance to Islamic State in 2019 and have since increased attacks in scale and frequency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-blacklists-islamic-extremist-groups-in-congo-mozambique-as-terrorist-units-101615428128675.html
11-03-2021||World||Chinese lawmakers set to tighten control on Hong Kong||China’s ceremonial legislature plans to endorse the Communist Party’s latest move to tighten control over Hong Kong by reducing the role of its public in picking the territory’s leaders.The measure adds to a crackdown against a protest movement calling for greater democracy in Hong Kong. The crackdown has prompted complaints Beijing is eroding the autonomy promised when Hong Kong return to China in 1997 and has hurt its status as a global financial center.The National People’s Congress, which was due to end its annual meeting Thursday, will endorse “improvements to the electoral system” of Hong Kong, the body’s Standing Committee said. The plan would give a pro-Beijing committee power to appoint more of Hong Kong’s lawmakers, reducing the number elected by the public.The NPC also was due to endorse the ruling party’s latest five-year development blueprint. It calls for stepping up efforts to transform China into a more self-reliant technology creator — a move that threatens to worsen strains with Washington and Europe over trade and market access.The legislature has no real power but the ruling party uses its annual meeting, the year's highest-profile political event, to showcase economic and political plans.Its approximately 3,000 delegates are picked by the party, not the Chinese public, and routinely endorse decisions already made by party leaders. A symbolic vote of support by the NPC shows an issue is a party priority.Last year, the party used the NPC session to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. Under that law, 47 former legislators and other pro-democracy figures have been arrested on subversion charges that carry a possible maximum penalty of life in prison.On Sunday, Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended the latest proposed changes in Hong Kong as needed to protect its autonomy and defend its “transition from chaos to governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-lawmakers-set-to-tighten-control-on-hong-kong-101615441545611.html
11-03-2021||World||US will speak out forcefully against China committing 'genocide': Official||Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the US will speak out forcefully against China committing "genocide" against the Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang province, as several lawmakers expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in the communist nation, ahead of the first face-to-face meeting of top American and Chinese officials next week since President Joe Biden took office.The White House and State Department said on Wednesday that Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan will see China's top foreign policy officials, the foreign affairs chief of the ruling Communist Party of China, Yang Jiechi, and State Councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi on March 18 in Anchorage, Alaska.Blinken told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee during a Congressional hearing that the US will continue to speak out forcefully and shine a light on "egregious violations of human rights" by China.“We have been clear and I've been clear that I see it as genocide, other egregious abuses of human rights, and we'll continue to make that clear,” he said, responding to a question by Congressman Michael McCaul who asked what additional steps is the Biden administration is prepared to take to stop this "genocide".“I think there are a number of things that we can do, should do, and will do. First of all, it's important to speak up and speak out and to make sure that other countries are doing the same thing. The more China hears not just our opprobrium but a chorus of opprobrium from around the world, the better the chance that we'll get some changes,” Blinken said.“We have a number of steps that we have taken or can take going forward, to include for those directly responsible for acts of genocide, gross human rights violations, sanctions, visa restrictions, etc. I think it would be very important, if China claims that there is nothing going on, that it gives access to the international community, to the United Nations."If they have nothing to hide, show it to us, show the world. And so, we'll be calling for that,” he said. "Then there are a series of practical things that are very important. For example, we should make sure that we are not exporting and others are not exporting to China any products that can be used for the repression of their people and their minorities," he said.Similarly, America shouldn't be importing products that are created by forced labor, including from Xinjiang. "So, those are some of the practical things that we can and should do, but for short we're going to start by speaking out forcefully on this,” Blinken said.Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick asked, “What can the administration do to protect the Uighur community and the Uighur minority, bring about the end of this ongoing genocide in China and will you be raising these concerns of grave human rights violations when you meet with the Chinese officials in Alaska?”Blinken responded, “I have spoken already to my Chinese counterpart, raised those concerns directly with him, President Biden has raised those concerns directly with (President) Xi Jinping in his conversation with him. We will certainly be raising them again in Alaska.”The meeting with the Chinese in Alaska will come just just days after Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin see their Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo and Seoul to reaffirm US treaty alliances with those nations.It will also come less than a week after Biden holds a virtual summit with the top leaders of India, Japan and Australia to discuss Indo-Pacific policy.US-China relations nose-dived while Donald Trump was president, with his administration taking multiple actions against Beijing for its actions against Uyghur Muslims and other minorities in Xinjiang and in Tibet, its crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, aggressive actions toward Taiwan and staking claims to territory in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-speak-out-forcefully-against-china-committing-genocide-official-101615439982601.html

A total of two million Covid-19 doses will be exported to Canada by mid-May under the agreement, while India has not ruled out additional consignments.The organisers of the billboards said they are pleased that their campaign commenced on the eve of the first anniversary of the World Health Organization declaring the coronavirus disease as a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-billboards-in-canada-thank-indian-pm-modi-for-providing-covid-19-vaccines-101615441052921.html
11-03-2021||World||Families of Boeing crash victims renew push for FAA changes||Relatives of some of the passengers who died in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines marked Wednesday's two-year anniversary of the disaster by seeking the improbable: a reversal of government orders that let Boeing 737 Max jets fly again.They are also seeking the removal of several top officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the plane and let it keep flying after another Max crashed in Indonesia, five months before the Ethiopian accident. A total of 346 people died in both crashes. The family members say they are trying to prevent a third crash.The parents of 24-year-old Samya Rose Stumo met with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for nearly an hour, then joined other families at a vigil outside FAA headquarters in Washington. In Toronto, the family of Danielle Moore, who was also 24, planned to protest outside the U.S. consulate.FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson has personally vouched for the plane's safety. A military and airline pilot before heading FAA, Dickson flew a Max in September. Boeing says Max jets have made 9,000 flights for 14 airlines without incident since returning to service late last year.A longtime FAA engineer wrote to Stumo's parents last month and detailed how a critical flight system was approved despite what he considered a shocking design flaw: It could change the plane's trajectory if a single sensor failed.Joe Jacobsen told the family that FAA delegated the review of most aspects of the flight system to a small number of Boeing engineers. Jacobsen said he and other FAA engineers didn't know about the design of the system, called MCAS, until after the first crash, and that if they knew, they would have flagged the problem.“Please accept my deepest apologies for my inability to stop the chain of events that led to the tragic loss of your beautiful daughter,” Jacobsen wrote to Michael Stumo and Nadia Milleron.Boeing had to revise the system before the FAA and other regulators would allow the plane to fly again, but Jacobsen wrote that more needs to be done — Boeing merely improved the plane's design from an F to a D. His letter was first reported by the Seattle Times.Milleron said it took her hours to read Jacobsen's email, which prints out at five pages — she kept stopping, pacing the room, thinking about her daughter.“It's just really hard to read these things," she said. “You wish you could reach back in time and change it so Samya could be alive and the other people could be alive.”Michael Stumo said the email made him more certain that top FAA officials, particularly the head of the agency's safety office, must go. The couple and their son asked Buttigieg to remove at least four officials including Dickson and the head of the FAA's aviation safety office.A Transportation Department spokesperson said Buttigieg expressed his sympathy to the family and believes the FAA needs to put in effect changes that Congress made last year in its oversight of aircraft manufacturers.The FAA referred to previous comments including a video Dickson made in November, when he announced the end of the 20-month grounding of the Max. Dickson said changes demanded by his agency fixed the problems that played a role in the crashes, and added that he was “100% comfortable with my family flying on it.”In December, Congress approved changes in FAA's process for certifying new planes. The FAA will still rely on Boeing engineers to make critical safety assessments, but will be able to choose those employees and communicate directly with them.Last month, the Transportation Department’s inspector general criticized the FAA's oversight of Boeing in a blistering report. The watchdog issued 14 recommendations to “restore confidence in FAA’s certification process and ensure the highest level of safety.” The FAA said it will follow the recommendations, but it will take nearly five years.The grief of relatives of other passengers has not eased in the last two years either. Nor were they satisfied in January when Chicago-based Boeing agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecution for fraud. The company admitted that two former test pilots hid information about changes to MCAS from the FAA.“The truth is that 346 people are now dead because Boeing cut corners, lied to regulators, and simply considers this the cost of doing business,” said Yalena Lopez-Lewis, whose husband Antoine Lewis, died on the Ethiopian plane.“This crash should never have happened, and the people at Boeing should be held accountable for their terrible actions,” said Linet Mwirigi, whose husband Cedrick Asiavugwa was also on the Ethiopian Airlines Max.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-of-boeing-crash-victims-renew-push-for-faa-changes-101615440181569.html
11-03-2021||World||Hong Kong court grants bail to 5th pro-democracy activist, jails another||A Hong Kong court on Thursday granted bail to a fifth pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker but revoked bail for another, after both were charged with subversion under the national security law.They're part of a group of 47 activists and former lawmakers who were arrested over their involvement in an unofficial primary election last year, aimed at determining the strongest candidates in a legislative election that was later postponed due to the pandemic.Authorities say the primary was part of a plot to paralyze the government and subvert state power, as at least some of the activists had planned to vote down major bills and force Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to resign if their pro-democracy camp had gained a legislative majority.The city’s High Court on Thursday granted bail to former Democratic Party lawmaker Helena Wong, who was one of the candidates in the primaries.Her bail conditions include surrendering all travel documents and observing a curfew. She is also banned from speaking with foreign officials, making speeches or engaging in acts that violate the national security law, and running for office.Despite releasing Wong, the court revoked bail granted to another activist, district councilor Ng Kin-wai. Ng will be remanded in custody.Both Wong and Ng are part of a group of 15 defendants who were initially granted bail last week, although they were all later kept in custody while the Department of Justice filed an appeal.Prosecutors have since dropped their appeal against four other defendants, who were released last Friday.The other nine defendants will have their bail reviewed on Saturday and Monday.The remaining 32 defendants who last week were either denied bail or withdrew their applications for bail will continue to stay behind bars. The next hearing is May 31.The mass charges against the activists marked the most sweeping action taken against the city’s pro-democracy camp since the national security law was implemented last June.Under Hong Kong’s common law system, defendants are usually granted bail for non-violent crimes. But the national security law removed the presumption of bail, with a clause saying it will not be granted unless the judge has sufficient grounds to believe defendants “will not continue to commit acts endangering national security.”The national security law criminalizes secession, subversion, collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs as well as terrorism. Serious offenders could face life imprisonment.Critics say the law, which was imposed by Beijing in response to sometimes violent pro-democracy protests in 2019, erodes the rights and freedoms promised to Hong Kong under the “one country, two systems” framework following the handover from British colonial rule in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-court-grants-bail-to-5th-pro-democracy-activist-jails-another-101615440109507.html
11-03-2021||World||Myanmar's military junta removes Rakhine rebels from list of terrorist groups||Myanmar's military junta has removed Arakan Army (AA) insurgents from its list of terrorist groups because the faction has stopped attacks and in order to help establish peace across the country, state media said on Thursday.The move comes at a time the army is struggling to contain daily protests against its Feb. 1 coup in which elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown.The AA is fighting for greater autonomy in the western Rakhine state and over the past two years had become one of the most formidable forces in challenging an army that has been fighting various ethnic wars for some seven decades.The AA had been placed on the list of terrorist groups last year under Suu Kyi's government."The designation of this group as a terrorist group is terminated from March 11, 2021," The state-run Mirror Daily said, citing the end of attacks and the junta's vision of building "nationwide eternal peace".The AA, which agreed on a temporary ceasefire in November, did not respond to a request for comment.Some of Myanmar's more than two dozen ethnic armed groups have criticised the coup and even shown support for anti-coup protesters, but have not significantly stepped up military action or abandoned ceasefire deals.The AA had not voiced support for the protesters and there have been very few protests in Rakhine state, which came to world attention in 2017 when some 700,000 people from the Rohingya Muslim minority fled an army crackdown.The AA's ranks are largely drawn from the ethnic Rakhine and Buddhist majority in what was an independent kingdom until the 18th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-military-junta-removes-rakhine-rebels-from-list-of-terrorist-groups-101615439633658.html
11-03-2021||World||Huawei confirms senior executive seeking HSBC records in Hong Kong court||Chinese tech giant Huawei confirmed Thursday that senior executive Meng Wanzhou is taking HSBC to court in Hong Kong to access banking records she says will help her battle extradition from Canada to the US.Chief financial officer Meng -- whose father is the company's founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei -- has been in a two-year battle against extradition over charges Huawei violated US sanctions on Iran.Meng is accused in the US of defrauding HSBC by falsely misrepresenting links between Huawei and a company that sold telecoms equipment to Iran.Last month she lost a similar bid at Britain's High Court, which ruled the court in Canada where the extradition battle is taking place was the "appropriate forum" to decide whether the HSBC records were necessary for a fair hearing.Now her lawyers are hoping Hong Kong's courts will rule in her favour."The application made by Ms. Meng in Hong Kong is a request to obtain evidence under Hong Kong Law to demonstrate her innocence in respect of the allegations made against her by the United States of America," a Huawei spokesperson told AFP."Whatever the court rules, Ms. Meng will continue defending her legitimate rights in the Canadian proceedings."The first hearing will take place on Friday according to the website of Hong Kong's judiciary.HSBC did not respond to requests for comment.Meng's arrest on a US warrant during a Vancouver stopover in December 2018 -- and Beijing's subsequent detention of two Canadians -- caused a major diplomatic rift between Canada and China.She has denied hiding Huawei's relationship with the covert subsidiary Skycom in Iran from HSBC and her lawyers say the documents will help prove that.Her extradition case in Vancouver is expected to end in mid-May, barring appeals.The Hong Kong filing comes at a time of intense scrutiny of Hong Kong's judiciary as Beijing's cracks down on dissent in the semi-autonomous financial hub.The city's independent courts and common law traditions are a core part of its reputation as a reliable and dependable business hub.But China's authoritarian leaders have begun exercising ever greater direct control over the city following huge democracy protests in 2019.Last year it imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, including granting Beijing's courts jurisdiction in some cases.Beijing and Hong Kong authorities are also drawing up broad plans to ensure all politicians and public officials are "staunch patriots", including within the judiciary.HSBC is headquartered in London but has a major presence in Hong Kong.It makes the vast majority of its profits in Asia, especially Hong Kong and China, and has publicly backed Beijing's national security law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-confirms-senior-executive-seeking-hsbc-records-in-hong-kong-court-101615439404332.html

Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter will star in two new public service announcements (PSA) for the coronavirus vaccine alongside former First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Rosalynn Carter, the Ad Council announced on Thursday."The science is clear. These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease," said President Bush in one of the PSAs with Obama and Clinton, urging Americans to get vaccinated."That's the first step to ending the pandemic and moving our country forward," said Obama.Noticeably absent in the vaccine PSAs, created by nonprofit the Ad Council, are former President Donald Trump and Melania Trump. During his run for re-election last year, Trump widely touted his administration's role in bringing a vaccine to market.When asked about Trump's absence, a spokesman for the Ad Council said one of the PSAs was filmed at President Joe Biden's inauguration in January, which Trump did not attend.The spokesman added the organization was pleased when Trump recently advised Americans to "go get your shot" after receiving the vaccine.The new ads are part of the Ad Council's nationwide vaccine education campaign titled "It's Up To You." More than 300 partners are supporting the nonprofit in the effort to battle hesitancy about the vaccine's safety and help convince more people to get the shot.A second PSA features each of the presidents and First Ladies wearing masks and receiving a dose of the vaccine."Now it's up to you," Carter says in the ad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-presidents-and-first-ladies-promote-vaccine-in-new-advertisements-101615439323743.html

In between these visits, he has effectively been held under house arrest in Beijing and never been allowed to travel freely or to speak openly with foreigners,” the HRW report said.You, a member of the secretariat of the CPC central committee and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC central committee, “expressed hope that the Panchen Lama would actively safeguard national and ethnic unity”.According to an official statement, You extended congratulations to the Panchen Lama on the progress he has made in various aspects and encouraged him to further his research on Buddhism.According to the CPC’s mouthpiece, People’s Daily, Gyaltsen Norbu was confirmed and approved by the state council, or the Chinese central government, as the reincarnate of the Tenth Panchen Lama on November 29, 1995 “after the lot drawing from a sacred, golden urn in strict compliance with religious rituals and conventions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panchen-lama-says-buddhism-in-tibet-will-be-sinicised-adopt-socialist-traits-101615439553367.html
11-03-2021||World||UNSC condemns violence against Myanmar protesters, asks army to show restraint||The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday condemned violence against Myanmar protesters and called on the army to show restraint, but failed to denounce the military takeover as a coup or threaten further action due to opposition from China and Russia.More than 60 protesters have been killed and some 2,000 people have been detained by security forces since the Feb. 1 coup against elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group said.On Wednesday, security forces firing teargas and rubber bullets trapped hundreds of anti-junta protesters late into the night in two districts of Yangon.Some protesters who managed to evade blockades set up by police in surrounding streets told of scores of arrests and said that some of those who got caught were beaten.In a bid to increase pressure on the military as it continues its crackdown, the U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two children of military leader Min Aung Hlaing and six companies they control."The indiscriminate violence by Burma's security forces against peaceful protesters is unacceptable," said Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Andrea Gacki.Campaign group Justice for Myanmar said in January that Min Aung Hlaing, who has been commander in chief since 2011, had "abused his power to benefit his family, who have profited from their access to state resources and the military's total impunity."The UK is also exploring fresh sanctions, foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a tweet.In New York, the United Nations Security Council said in a statement that it "strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protesters, including against women, youth and children."The council calls for the military to exercise utmost restraint and emphasizes that it is following the situation closely."But language that would have condemned the coup and threatened possible further action was removed from the British-drafted text, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.A junta spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he hoped the Security Council statement would push the military to realize it "is absolutely essential" that all prisoners are released and that the results of a November election are respected.The army has justified the coup by saying that the election, won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, was marred by fraud - an assertion rejected by the electoral commission. The junta has promised a new election, but has not said when.Guterres acknowledged that Myanmar was not a "perfect democracy" before the coup."It was still heavily under military control in many aspects, which makes this coup even more difficult to understand, especially the accusations of electoral fraud by those that were largely in control of the country," he said.Civil DisobedienceState television MRTV announced arrest warrants against some of the best-known youth protest leaders and showed a picture of 29 wanted protesters. The protesters have been calling for international protection and action against the junta.On Wednesday, police stormed a compound in Yangon housing railway staff and surrounded hundreds of protesters in North Okkalapa district, in another part of the city. More than 100 people were arrested at the two sites, witnesses said.Many of the railway staff are part of a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and included strikes at banks, factories and shops.Police and the army did not respond to requests for comment.One youth said in a message to Reuters that other protesters had been beaten and slapped. He escaped by hiding in a large washing machine, he said."Tomorrow I will keep protesting. I will not stop. The goal is very clear that we want democracy. We want our elected government back," he said, not wanting his name published.In the central towns of Mingyan and Monywa, people defied night curfew orders to hold candlelight vigils.One protester told Reuters from the southern coastal town of Myeik that he had been brought to Myeik Air Base and beaten with belts, chains, bamboo sticks and batons."The soldiers said, 'This is the hell room, why don't you guys have a taste?'" he said, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals. Reuters was unable to contact the police in the town or the airbase for comment.Some police have refused orders to fire on unarmed protesters and have fled to neighbouring India, according to an interview with one officer and classified Indian police documents.An Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta will be paid $2 million to "assist in explaining the real situation" of the coup to the United States and other countries, documents filed with the U.S. government show.Ari Ben-Menashe told Reuters on Saturday his task was to convince Washington that Myanmar's generals wanted to move closer to the West and away from China. He said they wanted to resettle Rohingya Muslims who fled a 2017 assault for which the U.N. has accused the military of overseeing a genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-condemns-violence-against-myanmar-protesters-asks-army-to-show-restraint-101615438785081.html
11-03-2021||World||China blasts BBC report after summoning UK ambassador||China is complaining anew about recent reporting by the BBC, days after summoning the British ambassador to Beijing to register displeasure over a recent article she penned defending press freedom.The Chinese Embassy in London posted a statement on its website Thursday saying it had written to the BBC expressing “strong dissatisfaction" and urging the broadcaster to “abandon bias, correct its mistake and report China in a objective, fair and balanced manner."On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry summoned Ambassador Caroline Wilson over her article posted on the embassy’s Chinese microblog in which she said critical reporting of China did not imply hatred or disrespect for the country itself. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday said Wilson’s article reflected her “deep-rooted ideological prejudices.”The criticism reflects deep Chinese anger both over the BBC's reporting on sensitive issues such as the coronavirus outbreak and abuses against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, and the British governments decision to open a pathway for residency and eventual citizenship for millions of Hong Kong residents.China last month banned the BBC from the small number of hotels, residential compounds and offices where it had been shown, in apparent retaliation for its reporting on China and Britain's revocation of the license of state-owned Chinese broadcaster CGTN.Britain has condemned a Chinese crackdown on civil liberties in the former British colony of Hong Kong that has gathered pace with the imposition last year of a sweeping national security law and the Chinese parliament's moves to eliminate even the possibility of government critics running for office in the semi-autonomous city.Scores of activists have been rounded up and accused of violating the law, while free speech and assembly have been severely curtailed, seemingly betraying China's commitment to allow Hong Kong to retain its own social, political and legal systems for 50 years following the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.In its letter, the Chinese Embassy singled out a BBC Radio 4 report titled “The Disinformation Dragon” that aired on Tuesday. The report made “groundless accusations against China on issues related to, among others, information, Covid-19 and diplomacy."“China has always been a country of propriety and deeply values harmony. We have never been the one that starts provocations and have no intention to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. It is the others who keep meddling in our domestic affairs and smearing China," the letter said.In his criticism of Wilson's article, Zhao said China had stated to her its “solemn position on the relevant issue."“Ambassador Wilson’s article, with a confused logic, avoids all the facts, including the British media’s disinformation and false reporting on China," Zhao said.He accused Wilson of ignoring the alleged suppression of Chinese media in the West and of praising "the so-called Western experience in an arrogant tone" and making “irresponsible remarks about China’s system and media."Wilson responded on Twitter, writing: “I stand by my article. No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170 pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-blasts-bbc-report-after-summoning-uk-ambassador-101615439113740.html
11-03-2021||World||Indonesian volcano spews new burst of hot ash, gas clouds||A rumbling volcano on Indonesia’s Sumatra island unleashed an avalanche of searing gas clouds flowing down its slopes during eruption on Thursday. No casualties were reported.Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra province was shooting smoke and ash as high as 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) into the air and hot ash clouds traveled up to 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) southeast, Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center said.There were no casualties from the eruption, said Armen Putra, an official at the Sinabung monitoring post. He said villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater’s mouth and should be aware of the peril of lava.The alert is being maintained at the second-highest level while authorities are closely monitoring the volcano after sensors picked up increasing activity in past weeks.The 2,600-metre (8,530-feet) mountain has been rumbling since last year. It was sending volcanic materials more than 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky and depositing ash on nearby villages when erupted early this month.Some 30,000 people have been forced to leave homes around Sinabung in the past few years.Sinabung was dormant for four centuries before exploding in 2010, killing two people. Another eruption in 2014 killed 17 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.The volcano, one of two currently erupting in Indonesia, has sporadically come to life since then.Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-volcano-spews-new-burst-of-hot-ash-gas-clouds-101615438643899.html
11-03-2021||World||Numbers behind Japan's recovery from tsunami disaster||Ten years after a massive earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s northeastern coast, triggering meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, much has been achieved in disaster-hit areas but they are still recovering. Numbers show how much progress has been made and what still remains.___9.0 EARTHQUAKEThe magnitude 9.0 earthquake was one of the strongest temblors on record. It struck off the coast at 2:46 p.m. and generated a towering tsunami that reached land within half an hour.___18,426 DEADThe National Police Agency says 18,426 people died, mostly in the tsunami, including 2,527 whose remains have not been found. Local authorities still regularly conduct searches in the sea and along the coast for traces of those still missing. None of the fatalities has been directly linked to radiation.___42,500 PEOPLE HAVEN'T RETURNEDNearly half a million people were displaced across the northeastern region. Ten years later, 42,565 people, including 35,725 from Fukushima, still haven’t been able to return home.___$295 BILLION COSTThe government has spent 32 trillion yen ($295 billion) for the region's recovery, including construction of roads, seawalls and houses, and support for people's livelihoods. In addition, Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of the destroyed nuclear plant, says its costs for decommissioning, compensating evacuees and decontamination of radioactive materials outside the plant will total 21.5 trillion yen ($200 billion), though analysts say it could be much higher.___2.4% OFF-LIMITSA decade after the disaster, no-go zones remain in nine Fukushima municipalities surrounding the wrecked nuclear plant. The area accounts for 2.4% of prefectural land, down from more than 10% in the initial no-go zone. Decontamination efforts, such as the removal of topsoil and tree branches and the washing down of roofs, helped reduce radiation levels. But many residents are reluctant to return because of a lack of jobs and continuing radiation concerns.___14 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WASTEAbout 14 million tons of radioactive soil, trees and other waste from decontamination efforts across Fukushima are packed in massive numbers of plastic waste bags piled at temporary storage sites. The bags, enough to fill 11 enclosed baseball stadiums, are now being transported to a medium-term storage facility being built in the two towns that are home to the Fukushima nuclear plant. The government has promised to remove the bags from the prefecture in 30 years, but a final repository has not been determined.___432 KILOMETERS (270 MILES) OF SEAWALLMuch of Japan's northeastern coastline hit by the tsunami has been fortified with enormous concrete seawalls as high as 15 meters (50 feet). All of the walls have been completed except for sections of the eastern coast of Fukushima. When completed, the total length will be 432 kilometers (270 miles). Critics say the walls look like giant fortresses and block sea views, while posing a possible risk of preventing water from flowing back to sea if they are breached by a future tsunami.___4,000 NUCLEAR PLANT WORKERSAbout 4,000 workers are employed every day at the damaged nuclear plant to help in its decommissioning, which officials say will take up to 40 years, a target critics say is overly optimistic. They are removing spent fuel rods from cooling pools, reinforcing a seawall to protect from future tsunamis, treating radioactive cooling water leaking from the reactors and removing highly contaminated debris.___1.24 MILLION TONS OF RADIOACTIVE WATERSince the disaster, contaminated cooling water has leaked from the damaged reactor containment vessels into the basements of reactor buildings, where it mixes with groundwater. Much of the water is treated and stored in 1,000 huge tanks now crowding the plant. The operator, TEPCO, says the tanks currently contain 1.24 million tons of water and will be full in the fall of 2022. It says the water and tanks need to be removed to make room for facilities needed in the decommissioning process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/numbers-behind-japan-s-recovery-from-tsunami-disaster-101615437538971.html
11-03-2021||World||Hong Kong: Less residents turn up to get vaccinated amid reports of side effects||Fewer Hong Kong residents are showing up to get vaccines from Chinese maker Sinovac Biotech Ltd. amid reports of side effects, even as demand was strong for shots developed by BioNTech SE-Pfizer Inc. on the day of their debut.The number of people who received their scheduled Sinovac immunizations at community vaccination centers fell to 72% on Wednesday, down from a high of more than 90% last week. More than one-third of those who signed up for the vaccine, 36%, were no-shows on Tuesday.The BioNTech vaccine, brought into the city by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co., was administered to 91% of those signed up to get it on Wednesday, the first day it was available.The skipping of Sinovac vaccine appointments comes after the city reported three deaths and three critical illnesses among the more than 130,000 people inoculated to date. While none have been linked to the Sinovac vaccines, hesitancy around getting the shots has risen among residents. Authorities preliminarily ruled out a tie between the vaccines and the first two deaths and two critical cases, while they are still analyzing the more recent reports.“It’s understandable some residents are worried about the latest serious adverse events and even deaths following vaccination,” Secretary for the Civil Service Patrick Nip said on Tuesday. All of the serious side effects will be reviewed closely by an expert committee, as is common procedure, he said.India and mainland China also had sluggish starts to their vaccination efforts, due at least in part to distrust and concern over the recently-released Covid-19 vaccines.Hong Kong began its public vaccination campaign on Feb. 26, prioritizing people aged 60 and older, health-care staff and other essential workers. Starting Tuesday, it expanded its priority groups to cover 3.7 million people, about half of its population, adding those in high-risk contact positions like teachers, public transportation drivers and restaurant workers.Other countries also have reported fatalities among people who have received inoculations, though the numbers have been small and nearly all cases involved underlying conditions. None of the deaths or serious complications have been tied to the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-less-residents-turn-up-to-get-vaccinated-amid-reports-of-side-effects-101615438010505.html

The country has thus far reported more than 29 million cases.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky has said the recent plateau of Covid-19 cases appeared to be trending downward, while new hospital admissions and coronavirus-related deaths were also decreasing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-finds-covid-19-drove-15-spike-in-us-death-rate-in-2020-report-101615429873435.html
11-03-2021||World||NASA's Perseverance 'SuperCam' begins hunt for past life on Mars||The bundle of instruments known as SuperCam on board the Perseverance Mars rover has collected its first samples in the hunt for past life on the Red Planet, mission scientists said Wednesday.The return to Earth years from now of the rocks and soil it retrieves "will give scientists the Holy Grail of planetary exploration," Jean-Yves le Gall, president of France's National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), which mostly built the mobile observatory, commented via a YouTube broadcast.These "pieces of Mars", he said, may "finally answer this fascinating and fundamental question: was there ever life elsewhere than Earth?"After seven months in space, NASA's Perseverance rover gently set down on Martian soil last month and sent back black-and-white images revealing the rocky fields of Jezero Crater, just north of the Mars equator."The critical component of this astrobiology mission is SuperCam," said Thomas Zurbuchen, deputy head of NASA's Science Mission Directorate.Mounted on the rover's mast, the shoebox-sized gizmo is packed with spectrometers, a laser, and an audio recording device to analyse the chemistry, mineralogy and molecular composition of Mars' famously red surface.SuperCam's laser can zap objects smaller than a pencil point from as far away as seven metres (20 feet), and enables the observation of spots beyond the reach of the rover's robotic arm."The laser is uniquely capable of remotely clearing away surface dust, giving all of its instruments a clear view of the targets," said Roger Wiens, an engineer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and SuperCam principal investigator.The mission suffered a serious mishap before liftoff, revealed LANL's Scott Robinson, who said more than 500 engineers and scientists contributed to the project."The mast unit optics were destroyed in a freak accident just four months before delivery," he explained. "The team scambled to pull together spare parts to rebuild the telescope from scratch."The accident turned out to be a blessing in disguise.A 'freak accident' In reassembling the unit, engineers discovered what Robinson described as a "Hubble-like" flaw in the original mirror.Shortly after the Hubble Space Telescope's launch in 1990, operators realised that the observatory's primary mirror had an aberration -- later corrected -- that affected the clarity of images.Scientists believe that around 3.5 billion years ago the crater in which Perseverance landed was home to a river that flowed into a deep lake, depositing sediment in a fan-shaped delta.The rover is tasked with collecting more than two dozen rock and soil samples in sealed tubes, to be sent back to Earth sometime in the 2030s for analysis.About the size and weight of an SUV, Perseverance is equipped with a two-meter (seven-foot) robotic arm, 19 cameras, two microphones as well as other cutting-edge instruments.A small helicopter drone tucked under its belly will attempt the first powered flight on another planet in a few weeks' time.One instrument on board is designed to make oxygen from Mars' primarily carbon dioxide atmosphere, something that would greatly facilitate human habitation.Perseverance is the fifth rover to set wheels down on Mars, all of them from NASA. The feat was first accomplished in 1997.Its core mission lasts just over two years, but the rover could remain operational well beyond that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-supercam-begins-hunt-for-past-life-on-mars-101615429742226.html
11-03-2021||World||Andrew Cuomo groped female aide in governor's residence: Report||An aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the Democrat groped her in the governor's residence, marking the most serious allegation among those made by a series of women against the embattled governor, according to a report published in a newspaper Wednesday.The Times Union of Albany reported that the woman, who was not identified, was alone with Cuomo late last year when he closed the door, reached under her shirt and fondled her. The newspaper's reporting is based on an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the woman's accusation. The governor had summoned her to the Executive Mansion in Albany, saying he needed help with his cellphone, the newspaper reported.The three-term governor faces harassment allegations from five other women, including former aide Charlotte Bennett. The 25-year-old's attorney, Debra Katz, said in a statement released Wednesday evening that the latest allegations are “eerily similar” to Bennett's own story.Bennett has said she was summoned to the Capitol on a weekend and left alone with Cuomo, who asked her for help with his cellphone. She has said Cuomo asked about her sex life and propositioned her.“The Governor’s sexual harassment, which Charlotte Bennett reported, was buried by his aides and never properly investigated," Katz's statement said. "Because of their enablement, another young woman was left in harm’s way.”The woman whose account was reported by the Times Union also indicated that Cuomo had touched her and made flirtatious comments on multiple occasions. According to the newspaper, her allegations came to light as Cuomo staffers watched the governor's March 3 press conference, his first after initial sexual harassment claims made in late February.In it, he denied ever touching a woman inappropriately. The aide subsequently became emotional, and told a female supervisor who approached her about her encounters with the governor. At least one supervisor reported the allegation to an attorney in the governor's office Monday, the newspaper reported.Prior to Wednesday’s report, the allegations against Cuomo include a combination of claims that he made the workplace an uncomfortable place for young women, ranging from flirtatious comments to a nonconsensual kiss.At least five accusers — Bennett, Lindsey Boylan, Anna Liss and Karen Hinton — worked for the governor in Albany or during his time in President Bill Clinton’s Cabinet. Another, Anna Ruch, told The New York Times that she met Cuomo at a friend’s wedding.The three-term governor has denied inappropriately touching anyone, but said he is sorry if he made anyone uncomfortable and didn’t intend to do so.“As I said yesterday, I have never done anything like this. The details of this report are gut-wrenching," Cuomo said through a spokesperson Wednesday evening. "I am not going to speak to the specifics of this or any other allegation given the ongoing review, but I am confident in the result of the Attorney General’s report.”State Attorney General Letitia James has put together an investigative team to probe Cuomo’s workplace conduct. The governor has called on lawmakers and the public to await the results of that investigation. Federal investigators are also scrutinizing how his administration handled data concerning Covid-19 outbreaks at nursing homes.Cuomo has been under fire for weeks, beginning with revelations that his administration withheld details from the public about the pandemic's death toll among residents in state nursing homes. Scrutiny of the governor — who received accolades during the height of the coronavirus pandemic for leadership that yielded a book deal and calls for a national political career — intensified when former adviser Boylan, 36, reiterated harassment claims made in December, fleshing them out in a late February blog post.It was unclear if the latest allegation would further erode Cuomo’s support in the Legislature. While several state legislators from both parties have called for Cuomo’s resignation or impeachment, most have indicated they will wait for the probe's conclusion.Cuomo has repeatedly maintained he won’t resign."How can we allow this man to lead our state? We must impeach,” Democratic Assembly member Zohran Kwame Mamdani tweeted Wednesday night.Republican Assembly member Mike Lawler on Twitter called Cuomo “a sexual predator" who should be charged.Both lawmakers had previously called for Cuomo's impeachment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-cuomo-groped-female-aide-in-governor-s-residence-report-101615427970010.html

It's time for diplomacy. It's time for dialogue," said Zhang Jun, after the UN Security Council agreed to condemn Myanmar's military over its actions since ousting civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month.Diplomats told AFP that the statement agreed by the Security Council "strongly condemns the use of violence against peaceful protesters," the second show of unity on Myanmar in just over a month for its 15 members, including China.Zhang said that "China has participated in the (statement) negotiation in a constructive manner."It is important the Council members speak in one voice. We hope the message of the Council would be conducive to easing the situation in Myanmar."The international community should create an enabling environment for relevant parties in Myanmar to address differences under the constitutional and legal framework."China's friendship policy toward Myanmar is for all the people of Myanmar. China stands ready to engage and communicate with the relevant parties, and play a constructive role in easing the current situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-de-escalation-dialogue-in-myanmar-says-chinese-envoy-to-un-101615423464873.html
11-03-2021||World||'We make lives better': Facebook moves to dismiss federal, state antitrust suits||Facebook has asked a court to dismiss state and federal antitrust lawsuits that accuse it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors.The social media giant said Wednesday that the complaints “do not credibly claim" that its conduct harmed either consumers or market competition.The antitrust suits, filed in December by the Federal Trade Commission and 48 states, are seeking remedies that could include a forced spinoff of the social network’s popular Instagram and WhatsApp services.“As we said when the FTC and the state attorneys general announced these lawsuits, people around the world use our products not because they have to, but because we make their lives better," Facebook said in a statement.The FTC suit asserts that Facebook has engaged in a "systematic strategy” to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals like Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. New York Attorney General Letitia James, in announcing the states complaint, echoed this sentiment, saying that Facebook “used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users.”The FTC declined to comment.In an emailed statement, James said Facebook is “wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint."“We are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook’s illegal conduct," the statement said.Big Tech companies are facing growing opposition from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on the power they have amassed over the past decade. There’s little likelihood the pressure will ease up. President Joe Biden has said that a breakup of tech giants should be seriously considered.Lawmakers and consumer advocates have accused Facebook of anticompetitive behavior, most starkly in buying up aspiring smaller rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp and by copying competitors.Critics say such tactics squash competition and could limit viable alternatives for consumers looking, for instance, for comparable services that do less tracking for targeted advertising. Businesses, including mom and pop shops, might have to pay more for ads if they have fewer choices to reach consumers online.The lawsuits could take years to resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-make-lives-better-facebook-moves-to-dismiss-federal-state-antitrust-suits-101615422906636.html
11-03-2021||World||Covid-19 relief bill: US households to get $1,400 payments from this month, says White House||Households will begin receiving the $1,400 stimulus payments included in the pandemic-relief bill approved by Congress before the end of March, according to the White House.“The Treasury and IRS are working to ensure that we will be able to start getting payments out this month,” the White House said in a blog post Wednesday. Government agencies “are building on lessons learned from previous rounds of payments to increase the number of households that will get electronic payments, which are substantially faster than checks,” the post said.President Joe Biden plans to sign the $1.9 trillion stimulus legislation into law on Friday, a package that includes more than $410 billion of direct payments for most Americans.Individuals who earn as much as $75,000, or couples making $150,000, plus their children or adult dependents, qualify for the full $1,400 per person. Single parents with at least one dependent who earn $112,500 or less also get the full amount. Families in which some members have different citizenship and immigration classifications are also eligible for a payment, if at least one person has a Social Security number.The payments phase out much more quickly than in previous rounds: An individual with income of $80,000, or a couple with $160,000, get nothing.For those who have already filed their tax returns, the IRS will use income data for 2020 to determine eligibility and size of payments. For people who have yet to file, the IRS will review 2019 tax data to determine the payments.The IRS will send the payments via direct deposit for individuals for whom they have bank-account information on file. Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and other federal benefit recipients will receive their payments the same way they typically get their monthly transfers. Others will be sent paper checks or prepaid debit cards.Other aid in the bill that Biden will sign spans jobless benefits to child tax credits. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “This legislation puts nearly $1 trillion in the pockets of the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-relief-bill-us-households-to-get-1-400-payments-from-this-month-says-white-house-101615421970625.html
11-03-2021||World||US, Chinese officials will meet for 2-day summit next week in Alaska||US secretary of state Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with their Chinese counterparts in Alaska next week, according to two people familiar with the matter.Blinken and Sullivan’s meeting with Yang Jiechi, a member of the ruling Politburo, and Wang Yi, the foreign minister, would represent the highest-level in-person exchange between the two sides since President Joe Biden took office in January. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on February 10.Ties between the US and China sank to their lowest level in decades under former president Donald Trump, with both nations ramping up sanctions and tariffs, expelling journalists and closing consulates.Plans for the meeting were reported earlier by the South China Morning Post. In response to a question about the Post’s report on Tuesday, US state department spokesman Ned Price said the agency didn’t “have any future travel or meetings to announce at this time”.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian declined to comment about the report when asked about it at a regular briefing Wednesday in Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-chinese-officials-will-meet-for-2-day-summit-next-week-in-alaska-101615416152381.html

11-03-2021||World||Congress OKs $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill in win for Biden, Democrats||A Congress riven along party lines approved a landmark $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill Wednesday, as President Joe Biden and Democrats claimed a triumph on a bill that marshals the government’s spending might against twin pandemic and economic crises that have upended a nation.The House gave final congressional approval to the sweeping package by a near party line 220-211 vote precisely seven weeks after Biden entered the White House and four days after the Senate passed the bill without a single Republican vote. GOP lawmakers opposed the package as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the crises are easing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMost noticeable to many Americans are provisions to provide up to $1,400 direct payments this year to most adults and extend $300 per week emergency unemployment benefits into early September. But the legislation goes far beyond that.The measure addresses Democrats' campaign promises and Biden's top initial priority of easing a one-two punch that first hit the country a year ago. Since then, many Americans have been relegated to hermit-like lifestyles in their homes to avoid a disease that's killed over 525,000 people — about the population of Wichita, Kansas — and plunged the economy to its deepest depths since the Great Depression.“Today we have a decision to make of tremendous consequence,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., “a decision that will make a difference for millions of Americans, saving lives and livelihoods.”For Biden and Democrats, the bill is essentially a canvas on which they've painted their core beliefs — that government programs can be a benefit, not a bane, to millions of people and that spending huge sums on such efforts can be a cure, not a curse. The measure so closely tracks Democrats' priorities that several rank it with the top achievements of their careers, and despite their slender congressional majorities there was never real suspense over its fate.They were also empowered by three dynamics: their unfettered control of the White House and Congress, polls showing robust support for Biden's approach and a moment when most voters care little that the national debt is soaring toward a stratospheric $22 trillion. Neither party seems much troubled by surging red ink, either, except when the other is using it to finance its priorities, be they Democratic spending or GOP tax cuts.Republicans noted that they've overwhelmingly supported five previous relief bills that Congress has approved since the pandemic struck a year ago, when divided government under then-President Donald Trump forced the parties to negotiate. They said this one solely reflected Democratic goals by setting aside money for family planning programs and federal workers who take leave to cope with COVID-19 and failing to require that shuttered schools accepting aid reopen their doors.“If you're a member of the swamp, you do pretty well under this bill. But for the American people, it means serious problems immediately on the horizon,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., referring to the added federal borrowing the measure will force.A dominant feature of the 628-page bill is initiatives making it one of the biggest federal efforts in years to assist lower- and middle-income families. Included are expanded tax credits over the next year for children, child care and family leave — some of them credits that Democrats have signaled they'd like to make permanent — plus spending for renters, feeding programs and people's utility bills.Also Read: Biden to order additional 100 million doses of J&J Covid-19 vaccine to boost supplyBesides the direct payments and jobless-benefit extension, t he measure has hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, state and local governments and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color, pension systems and student borrowers, and subsidies for consumers buying health insurance and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners.“Who’s going to help? Do we say this is all survival of the fittest? No,” said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky. “We rise to the occasion. We deliver.”Underscoring the bill's focus, the independent Tax Policy Center said the measure would give almost 70% of its tax breaks this year to households earning $91,000 or less. In contrast, the Trump-era GOP tax bill gave nearly half its 2018 reductions to the top 5% of households earning around $308,000, said the research center, which is run by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.The measure was approved amid promising though mixed signs of recovery.Americans are getting vaccinated at increasingly robust rates, though that is tempered by coronavirus variants and people's growing impatience with curbing social activities. The economy created an unexpectedly strong 379,000 jobs last month, though there remain 9.5 million fewer than before the pandemic struck.Republicans said the country will pay a price for the extra spending.“It's certainly good politics to say, ‘Hey, we’re going to hand you a check for $1,400,” said Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina. “But what they don't talk about is what this bill costs.”An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Biden’s response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans. According to a CNN poll released Wednesday, the relief bill is backed by 61% of Americans, including nearly all Democrats, 58% of independents and 26% of Republicans.Yet until November 2022, when control of the Senate and House will be at stake, it will be uncertain whether voters will reward Democrats, punish them for the expenditures or make decisions on other, unforeseen issues.The bill's pathway has underscored Democrats' challenges as they seek to build a legislative record that will persuade voters to support them.Democrats control the Senate, split 50-50, only because Vice President Kamala Harris gives them the winning vote in tied roll calls. They have just a 10-vote advantage in the House.That's almost no wiggle room for a party that ranges from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on the conservative side to progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.On the relief bill, progressives had to swallow big concessions to solidify moderate support.The most painful was dropping the House-approved federal minimum-wage increase to $15 hourly by 2025. Moderates also succeeded in trimming the emergency jobless benefits, which in an earlier version were $400 weekly, and phasing out the $1,400 stimulus checks completely for earners at lower levels than originally proposed.Keeping Democrats united won't get easier as the party tries advancing the rest of its agenda. There are fault lines within the party over priorities like immigration, health care and taxes.At some point it seems likely that progressives will draw their own lines in the sand. They are already demanding that the party revisit the minimum-wage boost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-oks-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-in-win-for-biden-democrats-101615404205231.html
11-03-2021||India||Try 16+ as adults in POCSO cases: Panel||The Union government should reduce the age for trying people as adults under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act from 18 to 16 to check increasing crimes against children, a top panel has recommended, according to people familiar with the matter.The committee noted that cases registered under POCSO rose from 32,608 in 2017 to 47,325 in 2019 – an increase of nearly 45% in two years — and made important recommendations to check cyber crime, improve the condition of sex workers and increase police accountability in cases of crimes against women. It also noted that the stringent law was often misused to criminalise consensual relationships, the people quoted above added.Currently, someone between 16 and 18 can be tried as an adult, under POCSO or the Indian Penal Code, only if they are charged with heinous crimes such as murder or rape. The decision usually lies with a juvenile justice board. If tried as juveniles, they are sent to a reform home, not a jail, and a process of rehabilitation is also drawn up.The people quoted above said the members of the parliamentary panel on home affairs felt that juveniles convicted of minor sexual offences may grow up to commit more heinous crimes if left unchecked. Therefore, it asked the Union home ministry and women and child development ministry to see if the age limit could be reduced to 16.The recommendations come at a time when there has been an alarming rise in cases of teenage boys raping or assaulting very young girls, some aged 3 or 4. Several experts say this trend necessitates the move to reduce the threshold for trying suspects as adults. However, some other experts argue the reducing the age would be contrary to the jurisprudence of juvenile justice.The panel’s recommendations will now be tabled in Parliament as early as next week.The panel also noted that there was potential of misuse of the law, citing information from states about cases where an 18-year-old boy has been arrested under POCSO for marrying a juvenile girl with her consent. The panel also commended Uttar Pradesh for its good conviction rate under the law.POCSO, enacted in 2012, was brought in to check mounting crimes against children and lists the maximum punishment as life imprisonment and death. It defines a child as anyone under 18. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 – which governs proceedings against minors in India – was amended in 2015 to try some juveniles between 16 and 18 as adults if they were accused of heinous crimes that attracted a minimum punishment of seven years. The change came in the backdrop of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, where one of the accused was 17 and tried as a minor.“For heinous offence, children over 16 can be tried as adult, the provision already exists….This recommendation does not take into account numerous studies and the Tamil Nadu government’s submission that Pocso is being utilised to criminalise adolescents in consensual relationships,” said child rights expert Swagata Raha.Enakshi Ganguly, co-founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights, warned of the possibility of criminalising consensual sex. “We are seeing a spurt in such incidents across the government. Are we going to institutionalise this now? We need to be in a preventive mode, not a penal one.”The people quoted above said the panel noted that cybercrime against women and children rose from 4,330 in 2017 to 8,684 in 2019 and transcended geographical boundaries. Therefore the panel recommended that law enforcement agencies across the country coordinate to check such crimes, the people added, on condition of anonymity.The panel’s discussion also focused on criminals using Virtual Private Network (VPN) – which allow a user to mask their location – to access the dark web, bypass cybersecurity walls and remain anonymous. It recommended that the Union government permanently identify and block such VPNs.The committee received several submissions about women complainants finding it difficult to lodge police complaints and suggested strict action against police officers and law enforcement personnel who refused to file such cases, or registered false cases. The panel recognised that the government did not support the sanctity of sex work but highlighted the need to safeguard them from violence, protect their rights and provide them legal aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/try-16-as-adults-in-pocso-cases-panel-101615487100445.html
11-03-2021||India||Unions issue ‘indefinite strike’ notice to Vizag steel plant||Hyderabad: Worker unions of the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), also known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, on Thursday issued a notice to the company’s management, stating they would go on an indefinite strike after March 25, in protest against the Centre’s decision to privatise the steel plant. The unions also demanded repeal of the approval accorded on January 27 by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for 100 per cent strategic sale of the RINL and scrapping of the inter-ministerial group constituted to study the strategic sale. Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Samithi (struggle committee to protect the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant), a joint action committee of all trade unions, served the notice to chairman and managing director of RINL P K Rath, in accordance with the provisions contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 22 of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947. The JAC said as per the rules, they were giving a notice of 14 days to resolve their issues. “We propose to call a strike on or after March 25, 2021 for the reasons mentioned in the notice,” the JAC said. The trade unions also demanded scrapping of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with South Korean steel major POSCO on October 23, 2019, for floating a joint venture for the construction of an integrated steel plant on RINL lands. They asked the RINL management to suspend the recently concluded memorandum of understanding with National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) India Ltd for redevelopment and monetisation of land parcels of the steel plant located at Maddilapalem in Visakhapatnam. When contacted, RINL official spokesperson R P Sharma said the management has just received the notice adding that it would try to convince the employees to withdraw their strike call. “The management will call the trade union leaders for talks shortly for negotiations. After all, operation of the steel plant is a question of bread and butter for the employees. They cannot stall the production,” Sharma said.They also demanded that all the left-out R-Card (rehabilitation card) holders (those who had given away their lands in 1980s in lieu of the promised jobs in the steel plant) be given permanent employment. The JAC of trade unions, who stepped up their agitation against Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s categorical announcement in the Lok Sabha on Monday that the Centre would go ahead with 100 per cent disinvestment in the RINL, are planning to follow the strategy of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, demanding repeal of controversial farm legislations. They are planning to invite farmers’ leader Rakesh Tikait and others to a rally in Visakhapatnam on March 28 to address the steel plant workers. “We are studying their model of agitation and if possible, we shall adopt their strategy to wage a long-drawn battle to prevent privatisation of the steel plant,” trade union leader J Ayodhya Ramu said. The main reason for the disinvestment, according to the RINL management, was that the steel plant had been consistently making losses over a period of time. In 2017-18, it suffered a loss of ₹1,369 crore. Though it could recover briefly by making a net profit of ₹97 crore in 2018-19, it plunged into huge losses to the extent of ₹3,910 crore in 2019-20. Meanwhile, support has been pouring in from various quarters to the agitating workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. Popular Telugu film star and former Union minister Chiranjeevi expressed his solidarity with the steel plant workers. “Visakha steel plant is a symbol of numerous sacrifices. It is the right of the Andhra people and their self-respect. Let’s rise above parties and regions. With a steely resolve, let’s save Visakha steel plant,” Chiranjeevi tweeted late on Tuesday, adding that it was intolerable to declare that the plant was being privatised because it was in losses while all these years it had been deprived of captive mines. Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president K T Rama Rao, too, announced that he would stand by the people of Visakhapatnam in their fight against privatisation of the VSP. “If necessary, with permission of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we will visit Visakhapatnam to extend our support,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unions-issue-indefinite-strike-notice-to-vizag-steel-plant-101615487074296.html
11-03-2021||India||Woman injured herself: Zomato delivery person on assault case||Bengaluru: A Zomato delivery person who was booked for allegedly punching a woman, on Thursday claimed that she injured herself after accidentally hitting her face with her ring. Talking to Hindustan Times from Electronic police station in Bengaluru, the accused, identified as Kamaraj, said, “As soon I reached her home, I told her that I was stuck in traffic as I had to deliver another order. I apologised for the delay. She was very rude... She said she didn’t want to hear any excuses and that I didn’t deliver food within time. She then took the food from me and refused to pay, saying it should have come within the time mentioned.” He said fearing he would have to pay ₹198 for the food, he asked her for money. “I told her I am not her slave and that she should behave with respect. She started shouting at me saying ‘what will you do?” Kamaraj told HT. On Wednesday, Bengaluru-based content creator Hitesha Chandranee had posted a video on social media in which she alleged that the Zomato delivery person assaulted her following an argument over a delay in delivery. She also claimed that Kamaraj barged into her house, verbally abused her and punched her in her face. “He started screaming at me, saying ‘Am I a slave or what? You are asking me to wait here.’ It was really threatening for me. I tried to shut my door, but he pushed the door, took my order from the table by entering my home, punched me in my face and ran away,” she said on Wednesday. Kamaraj claimed that while he went to deliver the food, the woman was on call with Zomato customer care and she cancelled the order. “Since the order was cancelled, I was asked to pick up the food to return. When I was asked for the parcel back, she refused. As I insisted and took the food back, she began cursing in foul language and threw her sandals at me,” he alleged. He added that unlike the woman’s claim, it was she who began physically assaulting him. “As she was hitting me, I tried to block using my hands. When she tried to push my hand away, a ring on her finger hit her nose,” he said. “I told the police that if you look at the cut, you can see that it was not caused by a punch, but something sharp. If you look at the video, you can see the ring on her finger,” Kamaraj said, adding, “Yes, there is a mistake from my end, that I was late. But what did I do to get hit by sandals or get dragged to a police station?” Responding to Kamaraj’s claims, Chandranee said she did not demand any refund from him. She added that she did not “return the parcel to the delivery executive, even though the order was cancelled, because he had pushed the door”. “I held onto the packet so that I can make him stay back while I called for help, since he had pushed the door. About his claim that I attacked him first, why didn’t he seek help from others in the building, why did he run away?” she asked.She added that the ring on her hand, which has a stone on it, didn’t cause the injury. “It is impossible for the ring on my finger to hit my nose in such an awkward angle. It was he who attacked me first,” she said.Meanwhile, Electronic City Police have registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) against Kamaraj. He was arrested on Wednesday and let off on station bail the same day. Talking about the investigation, officials said that statements from both parties are being collected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-injured-herself-zomato-delivery-person-on-assault-case-101615486954914.html

Bengaluru accounts for most of the 7,831 active cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Karnataka and 12,381 deaths (until 5 pm on Thursday). “In the last 24 hours in neighboring Maharashtra, more than 13,000 cases of coronavirus have been discovered, which bothers me. Consider this a cautious bell. No matter if it is a festival, or any event, wear a mask and maintain physical distance. Stay away from crowds,” K. Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said in a Twitter post on Thursday. Bengaluru reported 492 new cases on Wednesday. The state reports the total number of cases in 24 hours. There are a total of 189,226 active cases in the country while 158,189 people have succumbed to the infection so far, the Union health ministry said. Karnataka, which was one of the first states to impose the lockdown last year, was also among the first to relax restrictions to allow economic activities to resume in the cash-starved state. Bengaluru, with a population of over 10 million, has let its guard down in the past few months despite the threat of the novel coronavirus disease being just as potent as last year. Stating that some private schools in the state have restarted physical classes without government’s approval, Sudhakar warned them of strict action. Among those who violate Covid-19 regulations include the political class in Karnataka with leaders across parties holding meetings, public gatherings and other events in the last few months. Besides, the budget session of the Karnataka legislature is currently underway. Meanwhile, the state has also confirmed 29 people infected with the UK strain of virus and one with the South African strain. Bengaluru, which has seen a steady rise in cases, has recorded a total of 409,655 Covid-19 cases since March 8 last year, when the first case in the state was reported in the city. It has accounted for 4,514 out of the total 12,381 deaths due to the infection in the state, according to the health department data. Other districts in the state with high active cases include Belagavi with 97 cases, Dakshina Kannada 213, Kalaburagi 242, Tumakuru 198, Mysuru 178 and Udupi with 124 cases. Marshals of the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the city’s civic body) on Thursday visited several temples to ensure people adhered to the Covid-19 guidelines on the occasion of Mahashivratri. Lack of proper safety precautions, parties and other public events have given rise to clusters in the city, according to officials and elected representatives. Bengaluru has, so far, conducted tests on nearly eight million people, including 35,790 on Wednesday. According to BBMP data, the city has an active rate of 1.35% with 0.87% fatality rate. The Karnataka government has banned all late-night parties in the wake of surge in Covid-19 cases. So far, Karnataka has conducted 34,359 vaccination drives, in which 1,174,247 people have been vaccinated, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-among-top-10-cities-with-maximum-active-covid-19-cases-101615486954355.html
11-03-2021||India||5 years on, Geeta may be reunited with family||BhopalHearing and speech impaired Geeta, who was repatriated from Pakistan in 2015, might soon be reunited with her family in Maharashtra, an official in Madhya Pradesh’s social justice department said on Wednesday. A DNA test to ascertain the parentage is yet to be done, Suchita Tirkey, joint director of MP’s social justice department. Geeta was found on the Samjhauta Express in Lahore in 2000. Since then, she was living at the Karachi centre of Edhi Welfare Trust, from where she was repatriated to India with the help of late former foreign affairs minister Sushma Swaraj.Since her return to India, more than 24 couples claimed Geeta was their daughter. However, DNA tests of none of them matched with her. Gyanendra Purohit, convenor of the Indore centre of Anand Foundation said that 71-year-old Meena Dinkar Pandhare, a resident of Maharashtra’s Naigaon, has claimed Geeta is her daughter from her first marriage. “Everything which Geeta shared about her childhood memories -- sugarcane fields, maternity home in front of a railway station, diesel engine and food habits -- matched with that of Pandhare’s village,” Purohit said. We believed Meena’s claim when she said that Geeta must have a burnt mark on her stomach, Purohit said. “Geeta was not keen to confirm the birthmark but when a woman police constable checked, she found the exact mark on her stomach,” he said. Meena lived in Jintur in Parbhani district when her daughter, Radha, went missing. In July last year, officials at the Anand Foundation began a fresh search for Geeta’s parents with the help of her facial features, food habits and childhood memories. In October 2020, when they rescued another girl from MP’s Dewas district, the officials realized that Geeta may be from Maharashtra. “The girl also had a right nose piercing like Geeta. We asked her whereabouts and the girl informed that she belonged to Marathawada. We got in touch with Pahal Foundation of Parbhani in Marathawada, which also works for speech and hearing-impaired people, and sought their help to find Geeta’s parents,” said Purohit.“In December, Meena, who is illiterate and knows only Marathi, contacted us that her daughter went missing in 1999-2000. Geeta also confirmed everything Meena said but when she came to know about her economic condition, she was reluctant to move in with her mother. However, the mother visits the shelter frequently with food,” he said. Pahal foundation convener Aniket Salgaoncar said, “We are happy that Geeta found her mother. But she doesn’t want to move with her mother, and it is obvious because she met her mother after 20 years. She wanted to do a job so we are providing skill training to her.” Bilquees Edhi of the Edhi Welfare Trust said she has been in touch with Geeta, media reports said. “She has been in touch with me and this weekend she finally told me the good news about meeting her real mother,” Bilquees said.“Her real name is Radha Waghmare and she found her mother in Naigaon village in the state of Maharashtra,” news agency PTI quoted her as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-years-on-geeta-may-be-reunited-with-family-101615486654401.html

The second squadron will be raised in mid-April after the first one has been fully raised in Ambala, said one of the officials cited above.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. IAF’s Ambala-based Golden Arrows Squadron has already inducted 11 Rafale jets so far. Both Rafale squadrons will have 18 jets each.“Ten more jets are expected to arrive in India from France by April-end. With this, the first squadron will be fully formed and the raising of the second squadron will begin,” said a second official.All the 36 planes are likely to join the IAF’s fighter fleet by the year-end. The 11 Rafales inducted so far arrived in three batches from France between July 2020 and January 2021.“Located in the crucial Siliguri corridor, the Hasimara airbase will cover both central and eastern Tibet. The Rafale will augment and add a bigger punch along with the IAF’s Su-30 MKIs which are already based in the Brahmaputra valley,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The IAF has operated the fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China since early May 2020 and where both sides are negotiating disengagement of troops at friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).India’s Rafale jets are equipped with modern weapons such as the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles and the Hammer smart weapon.Meanwhile, the commanding officer of the Rafale squadron at Ambala, Group Captain Harkirat Singh, is being posted to the eastern sector to oversee the raising and operationalisation of the second squadron, people familiar with development said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-rafale-squadron-to-be-raised-in-hasimara-in-april-officials-101615486534404.html
11-03-2021||India||Eco-tourism projects: Experts flag concern over easing of guidelines||NEW DELHI The environment ministry’s forest advisory committee last month eased norms for ecotourism projects by allowing them to build “non-permanent” structures in protected areas without permission from the central government -- a move that experts fear could cause developers of such projects to construct a rash of the same in the absence of a definition for “non-permanent”, something the committee is yet to decide on. The decision that only construction of permanent structures will be considered to be “non-forestry” activity and require prior approval of the central government, and that no central government approval is required for other eco-tourism activities involving non-permanent constructions was taken in a meeting of the forest advisory committee on February 17, according to the minutes of the meeting uploaded on the Parivesh website on Thursday. According to the minutes, the issue was first considered by FAC in its meeting held on April 23, 2019 and again on January 23, 2020. FAC in its meeting held on April 23, 2020 recommended that only construction of permanent structures for the purpose of ecotourism on forest land be considered as non-forestry activity, requiring prior approval of the central government. But the minutes added that two other clauses were still causing ambiguity. On February 17, FAC decided to delete two clauses: 12.13 and 1.18 in guidelines on forest conservation published in ministry’s Handbook on Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 and Forest (Conservation) Rules 2003. Section 12.13 of the handbook states that “ecotourism is a non-forestry activity and will be allowed in Protected Areas if the said activities are part of the management plan/ tiger conservation plan and are duly approved by the Central Government,” and Section 1.18 states that “ecotourism is a non-forestry activity requiring prior approval under FC Act.” Independent experts said this could mean building of temporary structures and trails in eco-sensitive zones which will impact both wildlife and rights of forest dwellers.“It has been decided to consider eco-tourism to be a forestry activity. It will be considered a non-forestry activity only when it involves construction of permanent structures. We are yet to conclude what exactly is a permanent structure. It’s a subjective matter. For example, if local materials are used or bamboo structures are created those are also eco-friendly in nature,” said a senior official from the forest conservation division of the environment ministry.“With a view to remove ambiguity and to bring in more clarity about nature of structures to be considered permanent for the purpose of ecotourism in forest areas, the matter was deliberated at various levels in the ministry. Based on the consultation with concerned divisions and officers of the environment ministry, attempt was made to define the permanent structure, but appropriate definition has not been finalized. Further it is observed that the ministry is in the process of formulating ecotourism guidelines to regulate ecotourism activities in the forest area,” the minutes state.“This clarification from FAC is significant. Ecotourism activities can include creation of temporary or permanent infrastructure which can cause fragmentation of forest areas as well as can disturb both livelihood use and areas important for wildlife. Such infrastructure can include internal roads, camping areas, forest trails and other support facilities including that related sanitation or recreation. Therefore, a precautionary approach that draws from wildlife, forest conservation and forest rights related legislations will be important to inform such an interpretation,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research responding to the minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecotourism-projects-experts-flag-concern-over-easing-of-guidelines-101615486294969.html

The DMK and the Congress are contesting the upcoming polls in alliance. “DMK and Congress have 108 sitting MLAs together and while we have retained most of incumbent constituencies, the rest has been shared with our allies,” a DMK leader part of the seven-member seat sharing committee said on condition of anonymity. “We are left to confirm constituencies only with CPI (M).” The DMK was also scheduled to release its election manifesto on Thursday, but it has been delayed.“We are likely to release the constituencies and candidates list Friday,” a senior DMK leader said on condition of anonymity. On if the DMK would have an advantage in releasing its candidates list after the AIADMK, the leader said, “Their list is irrelevant to us. We have our own way and formula of fielding candidates.” The Congress list shows that the party will be in direct contest with the Bharatiya Janata Party in five seats-- Coimbatore South, Karaikudi, Ooty, Vilavancode, Colachel. The two parties will also face off in the bypoll to the Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat, which fell vacant after Congress MP H Vasanthakumar died due to Covid-19 complications last year.The BJP is contesting the upcoming elections in alliance with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and has so far only identified the 20 constituencies it will contest on. The AIADMK, meanwhile, has already released its list of 178 candidates for the polls. The party on Thursday signed an agreement of six seats with GK Vasan’s Tamil Maanila Congress. It also allotted seven seats to smaller parties. In a related development, AIADMK’s Sattur MLA MSR Rajavarman quit the party on Thursday in protest against the denial of a ticket and joined the AMMK. The AMMK is now fielding Rajavarman from the constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-releases-list-of-25-constituencies-for-tn-to-face-bjp-in-5-seats-101615486294376.html
11-03-2021||India||Injuries result of an accident: Initial probe, witness accounts||Kolkata: Preliminary investigation by the police and a section of the eyewitnesses hinted on Thursday that the injuries sustained by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram may be the result of an accident and not a deliberate conspiracy. Further investigation is, the police said. The East Midnapore police registered a case in Nandigram under Indian Penal Code sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt).“No one has been arrested till Thursday evening. So far, we have not found anything which could suggest that it was a deliberate attempt or a conspiracy. But investigation is still going on based on a complaint we have received,” said a senior police official of East Midnapore district. “We have not received any report on the incident so far. It is still under investigation,” P Nirajnayan, director general of police, said.On Wednesday evening, Banerjee had alleged that 4-5 men had deliberately attacked her while she was interacting with the public in Nandigram.But a section of eyewitnesses and a video, which surfaced during the day, hinted that Banerjee was injured when her white SUV hit an iron pillar jutting out of the road.“When Banerjee saw the crowd gathered on both sides of the road at Birulia Bazar in Nandigram, she half opened the front door and stood on the car. She was holding the car with one hand and was waving the other hand. The car, hit an iron pillar and the door closed with a bang. Banerjee got injured,” said Animesh Das, a local resident.“There were at least two iron pillars, around the height of a man’s waist, jutting out of the road in Birulia Bazar. The car door hit the first pillar and this led to the accident,” Prabir Samanta, another local resident. The TMC, however, maintained that it was a ‘deep rooted conspiracy” against the chief minister and demanded an independent investigation. TMC leaders also pointed out that Banerjee’s vehicle had suffered no damage or dents – and used it to disprove the accident theory.“Some people are concocting a story that the car hit an iron pillar. This is false. There are no scratches or dents on the car door. Some people pushed the door in such a way that it hit Banerjee’s leg with great force,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister. The BJP too demanded a probe. “We want her to return to the field at the earliest. Else against whom we would score the goal. All her party leaders have shifted to the BJP,” said Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/injuries-result-of-an-accident-initial-probe-witness-accounts-101615486236010.html
11-03-2021||India||Injury to Mamata latest flashpoint between TMC, BJP||Kolkata: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were locked in a political tussle on Thursday over injuries sustained by chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the incident dominated popular discussions in the state roughly three weeks before the high-stakes assembly polls. The TMC said it will make the “deliberate attack” on Banerjee a poll issue and organise silent protests across the state from Friday.“We are going to organise silent rallies in every block and wards across the state on Friday between 3 pm and 5 pm. People carrying black flags, wearing black badges and covering their mouth with black cloth would participate in the rally,” said Partha Chatterjee, state minister. Since Wednesday night, TMC workers staged protests, blocked roads and burnt tyres in every district. Clashes were also reported between TMC and BJP workers in some places though no one was seriously injured, police said.TMC workers also performed pujas at various temples and offered prayers at mosques seeking her speedy recovery. Many other leaders referred to previous attacks on Banerjee and said it will be a major issue in the polls.“The only woman chief minister in the country was injured and attacked. The Prime Minister and the Union home minister however didn’t show the courtesy to call up. We condemn this,” said Saugata Roy, TMC parliamentarian. From her hospital bed, Banerjee said she would hit the campaign trail again in two or three days and start attending party meetings, on a wheelchair if needed. The TMC also appealed to party workers to maintain peace.“We appeal to all our workers to not let their emotions overflow. We understand your concerns and we’ll keep updating about Hon’ble @MamataOfficial’s health. We request to maintain peace and not resort to means, which Didi would not approve of. Let us all pray for her speedy recovery,” the party tweeted.During the day, the BJP mounted its attack on Banerjee. It demanded that pictures of the incident be made public and sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the incident. “Even our workers had sustained injuries. They underwent treatment and then returned to give a befitting a reply. They didn’t stage any drama. But she doesn’t have the strength to give a befitting reply anymore and hence only staging a drama. She has done PhD in drama,” Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president, told reporters.Later in the day, BJP leaders said they would not indulge in any politics over her injuries. “We will not do any kind of politics over the chief minister’s injuries. We pray for her early recovery and return to the political stage,” said BJP spokesman Samik Bhattacharya.Biswanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University, said all will depend on whether there is a strong anti-incumbency against Banerjee. “If the anti-incumbency factor is strong against Mamata and people have decided that BJP can be an alternative force, then it won’t matter whether she fights the election on a wheel chair. But if Mamata is still acceptable and people still wants her as the chief minister then the TMC could encash from this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/injury-to-mamata-latest-flashpoint-between-tmc-bjp-101615486174294.html
11-03-2021||India||Left minister ‘regrets’ Sabarimala incidents||Thiruvananthapuram Kerala temple affairs minister Kadakampally Surendran on Thursday said “incidents” at the Sabarimala shrine in 2018 over the entry of women devotees pained him and shouldn’t have happened, prompting opposition parties to blame him and the ruling Left government for the violence and protests that lashed the temple three years ago. Addressing mediapersons, Surendran said the final verdict of the Supreme Court on the issue would be implemented only after consultations with believers, political parties and the general public.“The incidents that took place in Sabarimala in 2018 was something which had pained all of us. It should never have happened. It has pained everyone...it has pained me also,” Surendran said. In 2018, the apex court overturned decades-old customs to allow women of menstruating age to enter the hill shrine, triggering massive protests and five shutdowns during the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018 after the state government tried to enforce the verdict. Nearly a dozen women between 10 and 50 were stopped from entering the temple.In 2019, the top court referred the review petitions to a larger bench, which is yet to begin hearings.“The case is before a larger bench of the Supreme Ccourt and once the final verdict comes the government will consult all,” said the minister, who is seeking re-election from Kazhakoottam constituency in the April 6 polls.He also pointed out that the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government recently withdrew all cases that were not of a serious criminal nature in connection with the Sabarimala agitation.The issue has been raked up by the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the state elections. The Congress has said it will bring in a law to negate the SC order, and the BJP has promised to remove government control from all shrines in Kerala.The BJP accused Surendran of presiding over the attacks on innocent devotees, saying “he won’t be forgiven even if takes thousand dips in river Ganga”.“Let him first withdraw the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that vitiated the whole issue. He was the temple affairs minister when innocent devotees were attacked for chanting hymns. It is nothing but cheap stunt for votes,” said BJP state president K Surendran. The BJP leader was jailed for over a month during the agitation. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala sought an apology from Vijayan. Vijayan had said the government had not erred even after the ruling CPI(M) admitted that lapses had occurred in the handling of the Sabarimala issue, he said.“So, the chief minister himself should publicly admit his mistake and apologise to the people,” the Congress leader said. “Can the CM assure that no woman would be allowed to enter the hill shrine violating the customs, in future?” the leader of opposition.The ruling LDF received flak from various sections after the violent protests and suffered a drubbing in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, winning just one of the 20 seats in the state.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-minister-regrets-sabarimala-incidents-101615486115776.html
11-03-2021||India||Karnataka cops may soon get access to facial tech||An inconspicuous allocation of ₹699 crore in Karnataka’s latest budget to install 7,500 surveillance cameras in Bengaluru is likely to enable the state capital’s police to introduce facial recognition technology and machine-learning based video monitoring, officials said, even as experts flagged privacy concerns stemming from the possible plan.While the project has been in the pipeline for three years, Bengaluru Police officials said the latest funding announcement by the state government was a crucial development.A senior police officer said on condition of anonymity that the 7,500 cameras will include fixed day-and-night surveillance cameras, body-worn cameras and drones equipped with high-resolution image capturing devices. The police will also procure facial recognition cameras and registration plate recognition devices. All cameras will be connected to a 40-seat Command and Control Centre, with two centres that will be mobile.The 7,500 cameras are only the front-end of the entire project. According to another senior officer, close to 30% of the funds will be used to create a back end . The officer said that to optimise the CCTV network, the police will introduce technologies such as facial recognition.“We want to have surveillance capability where a vehicle spotted at one traffic signal can be identified and tagged so that other cameras can trace the vehicle and predict its possible path. Similarly, we want to be able to track persons who are of interest using the technology,” the second officer added, asking not to be named.He said that the proposed network will create the capability to go through recorded footage and identify patterns. “The technology will help us go through hours of footage and find patterns such as cars with a certain colour or all the buses that passed through one area.”The officer explained that the system would depend on the footage collected from the CCTV cameras installed across the city.“Apart from the CCTV cameras operated by the police, the Karnataka Public Safety Act gives us access to CCTVs of any establishment, which gets at least 100 visitors a day.In the case of a situation where CCTV footage needs to be analysed in real-time or in retrospect, it will be done at the command centre. The same footage or analysis can be sent to respective police stations as well... using an internal network,” he said.Vidushi Marda, a lawyer who works on emerging technologies, said that facial recognition and other similarly placed biometric applications are increasingly becoming popular with law enforcement agencies.“As these systems contemplate collecting, analysing sensitive personal data, and basing consequential decisions on these inferences, keep in mind that these technologies are not silver bullets but rather fallible and often clunky in how they operate on the ground, lending a whole new layer of concerns in accuracy. In the absence of a data protection framework, this is a worrying prospect.”“The assumption of the legality of these systems needs to be meaningfully scrutinised as well; in my reading, there is currently no legal framework from which these systems draw their legitimacy,” she said.“Most recently, the Lucknow Police also announced plans to use emotion recognition technologies to identify ‘distressed’ women on the streets.”A senior Bengaluru Police officer, however, said that the technology will be used only for detection and surveillance related to a crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cops-may-soon-get-access-to-facial-tech-101615485768033.html
11-03-2021||India||Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar to visit India on March 22||Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar is set to visit India on March 22 against the backdrop of a fresh US initiative to find a political settlement in war-torn Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.Atmar will travel to Delhi after a meeting of the “extended troika” on Afghanistan convened by Russia on March 18, and the visit will provide him an opportunity to exchange notes on recent developments related to the troubled peace process with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar, the people said on condition of anonymity.There has been a flurry of developments related to Afghanistan over the past few days after US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s letter to President Ashraf Ghani outlining the next steps in the peace process and a draft “peace agreement” were accessed by Afghanistan’s Tolo News channel.The US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke to Jaishankar on phone on March 7 and visited Islamabad the following day. Khalilzad met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and stressed the need to “accelerate progress towards a just and durable peace in Afghanistan”, an official US statement said.Blinken’s letter, which hasn’t been denied by the US or Afghanistan, outlined four elements as part of a high-level diplomatic effort to move toward a political settlement and a permanent ceasefire. These elements include asking the UN to convene a meeting of Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan, and the Turkish government hosting a meeting of the Afghan government and the Taliban to finalise a peace agreement.The US has also prepared a 90-day proposal for reduction in violence, while the draft peace agreement talks of the formation of a transitional government involving the Taliban.India has been kept out of the March 18 meeting of the “extended troika” called by Russia. The original members of the troika – Russia, the US and China – will be joined by representatives of Pakistan, the Afghan government and the Taliban. People familiar with developments said India had been kept in the loop about Russia’s plans to convene this meeting.The people said the Russian side expects to include India in troika consultations at a later stage as part of the ongoing efforts to forge regional consensus on the Afghan peace process.India, which is yet to open a channel with the Taliban, has persistently called for an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process which leads to a settlement that preserves the gains and democratic processes established over the past two decades. India has key stakes in peace and stability in Afghanistan, having pledged $3 billion for the reconstruction and development of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-foreign-minister-haneef-atmar-to-visit-india-on-march-22-101615483362687.html
11-03-2021||India||China parliament nod to dam near Arunachal||Beijing: China on Thursday gave the go-ahead to the construction of a dam and hydropower plant on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet, close to the border with Arunachal Pradesh, labelling it as a key project.Rising in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), the Yarlung Zangbo flows into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.India has expressed concerns over four planned dams on the upper and middle reaches. However, some officials say that constructions may not impact the quantity of the Brahmaputra’s flows to a large extent.The project was approved by China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), at its closing session on Thursday as part of the country’s 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2021-25) for National Economical and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.The project was first announced in November last year.At the time, China said it was within its legitimate rights to build a dam on the lower reaches of the river, also called Yarlung Tsangpo, close to the India border but gave the assurance that the hydropower project will take into account the interests of downstream countries such as India and Bangladesh.This week, at least two top Chinese officials spoke about the importance of the project during the just-concluded annual session of China’s NPC.He Lifeng, the director of China’s top planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said “the development of hydropower on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river” is a world-class landmark project alongside the Sichuan-Tibet railway and the coastal railway project along the Yangtze river.Last Saturday, Che Dalha, deputy Communist Party chief of TAR had said authorities should “strive to begin construction this year”.“Comprehensive planning and environmental impact assessments for the project should be approved as soon as possible,” he said on Saturday, according to a press release quoted by Reuters and published Monday on an official regional government website.A TAR government report published in January mentioned hydropower development in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River several times.The new dam’s ability to generate hydropower could be three times that of central China’s Three Gorges Dam, which has the largest installed hydropower capacity in the world.“China will build a hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo River, one of the major waters in Asia that also passes through India and Bangladesh…,” the state-run tabloid Global Times said in a report on the project in November last year.“There is no parallel in history (of the project… it will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry,” Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China, or POWERCHINA, said then.The paperwork on the dam began with POWERCHINA on October 16 signing a strategic cooperation agreement covering the 14th Five-Year Plan with the TAR government.When asked in December about the project and its impact on lower riparian countries, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying brushed aside apprehensions.“Hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right. When it comes to use and development of cross-border rivers, China always acts responsibly. We have a policy featuring development and conservation, and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment with due consideration for its impact downstream and taking into account interests of upstream and downstream regions,” she said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-parliament-nod-to-dam-near-arunachal-101615485394249.html

11-03-2021||India||Centre says collaboration with private hospitals helped in acceleration of Covid-19 vaccination drive||The Centre on Thursday said the acceleration in delivering Covid-19 vaccine shots has been achieved in collaboration with the private sector which administered more than 23 per cent of the doses.Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 71.23 per cent of coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered in government hospitals, while 28.77 per cent of these doses have been contributed by private facilities."The acceleration has been achieved with active collaboration with private sector facilities," he said.Bhushan also gave data of the states/UTs where the vaccinations in private facilities are below the national average. He also gave the data of percentage of private facilities in these areas.These states/UTs include Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Meghalaya, Chhattisgarh and Odisha."These are the states/UTs where we requested that private hospitals need to scale up," he said.The senior official said vaccine doses are being administered in private hospitals empanelled under the Ayushman Bharat Yojna, Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and state government health schemes."In places like Odisha, Maharashtra, Delhi and Telangana, these also include such private facilities which are not covered under the above three categories. These have been permitted because they have adequate number of space, cold chain, vaccinators and arrangements to address adverse event following immunisation," he added.Talking about accelerating deliverance of vaccine doses, Bhushan said on March 4, 10 lakh vaccines were administered in 24 hours, while on March 8, 20 lakh vaccines were given in 24 hours.Asked if the pace of vaccination has dropped, the health secretary noted, "What we are looking at is a steady increase. We are not trying to win a race. He said the government has made its system flexible so that those private facilities that have the capacity can do Covid-19 vaccination 24 hours seven days a week."While for state government hospitals, the advice is they should do it for minimum four days a week because they have other work also which is non-Covid essential facilities. The states have been given discretion, we do not want to adversely impact the non-Covid essential health services which are delivered by the same hospitals," he said.Bhushan added that till 1 pm on Thursday, 2,56,90,545 Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered, out of which, 67,86,086 doses were given to those above 60 years and people aged 45-60 years with comorbidities.As many as 71,97,541 healthcare workers have been given the first dose, while 40,13,890 have been given the second dose. As many as 70,55,074 frontline workers have been given the first dose, while 6,37,954 have been given the second dose, the official said."Till yesterday (Wednesday), we completed 53 days of vaccination administration in India. According to Our World in Data, in the first 53 days, US vaccinated 3.68 crore doses which started its vaccination in December last year. India which started its vaccination programme on January 16 has given 2.56 crore vaccine doses, Brazil which started its vaccination process a day after India has administered 1.13 crore doses, while the UK which started the same on December 8 last even before the US has administered 94 lakh doses," he said."Just 0.020 per cent adverse event post immunisation has been reported with 0.00025 per cent resulting in hospitalisation in India," Bhushan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-collaboration-with-private-hospitals-helped-in-acceleration-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101615478947346.html

11-03-2021||India||Safe houses be made available in Punjab, Haryana for couples marrying against family, suggests HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has suggested that safe houses should be made available in the two states as well as in Chandigarh, their common capital, to protect life and liberty of couples who married against the wishes of their families."Number of such petitions are being filed by the couples who performed marriage against the wishes of their parents and relatives. This court is also being approached by the couples stating to be in a live-in relationship," Justice Avneesh Jhingan pointed out in an interim order on Wednesday.The court was hearing a writ petition that had sought issuance of directions to the Punjab government to protect life and liberty of the petitioners, who married on March 4 against the wishes of their parents.Non-acceptability of inter-caste marriage is a social problem which needs to be dealt at multifarious levels, the judge said, adding that inter-caste is not the only reason for non-acceptability of marriage, there are numerous other socio-economic reasons acting as hurdles for the young couples for selecting life partner of their choice."Over the period it is experienced that number of such petitions are filed as a matter of routine. It is evident from most of these petitions that the day the marriage is performed, a representation is made and in some cases even the writ petition is drafted/filed on the same very day. In most of the cases, there is even no proof of submission of the representation," he said."The petitions of such nature are either disposed of, without commenting on the validity of the marriage and directing the official respondents to consider the representation or notice of motion is issued to the official respondents. In latter case by the next date, the police officials record the statements of the petitioners. By and large, the statement is that there is no threat perception existing," Jhingan said.The judge said the net result is that the petitions involving serious and eminent threat get mixed up in number of petitions filed in routine and another aspect of the matter is, the couples who are apprehending threat perception have to travel all the way to this court for completing the formalities for filing the writ petition and this further exposes them to threat.Taking into consideration the fact that in these cases time is the essence, the court said one of the way to tackle the problem is that safe houses should be made available in each district of both the states, as well as in Chandigarh.A website or an on-line module should be provided for such couples to raise their grievances without being physically present, it said, adding that providing a 24x7 help desk at tehsil level for filing of such representations by aggrieved persons or through someone can be of great help."An existing cell in the Police department can be deputed or a new cell can be created which can deal with the representation in a time-bound manner, in any case not beyond 48 hours. It can also be ensured by authorities that in case a request is made by the couples during the period of consideration of the representation, they be provided shelter in safe house," the high court said.It also said that Legal Services Authorities with the passage of time have been able to reach at the grassroots level and they can set up a 24x7 help desk for such couples with telephone service and internet connectivity at the local level."The entire endeavour of the exercise is that some sort of workable mechanism is put in motion to ensure the protection of life and personal liberty as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Further that only in exceptional cases, the couples have to take trouble to approach this Court alleging infringement of the rights," the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safe-houses-be-made-available-in-punjab-haryana-for-couples-marrying-against-family-suggests-hc-101615478405360.html

Mumbai on the other hand witnessed a dip from yesterday's figure (1,539) and recorded 1,508 cases in the last 24 hours. The Centre on Thursday expressed concerns over the Covid-19 situation of Maharashtra as eight districts of the state have the highest number of active Covid-19 cases in the country. The districts include Pune (18,474), followed by Nagpur (12,724), Thane (10.460), Mumbai (9,973), Bengaluru Urban (5,526), Ernakulam (5,430), Amravati (5,259), Jalgaon (5,029), Nashik (4.525) and Aurangabad (4,354)."We are very worried about Maharashtra — across several districts. We have seen their names. As we came here, we came to know that very strict lockdown is being imposed in Nagpur in particularly. So we are reaching a situation where those approaches are being brought back. This is a very serious issue for us," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.Earlier in the day, the Nagpur administration announced a strict lockdown from March 15 to March 21 to combat the spread of the infection. Apart from essential services, everything else, including private offices, will remain closed.Before Nagpur, several other districts like Amravati, Nashik, Yavatmal, Amravati imposed restrictions triggering speculations about whether the entire state will be again placed under lockdown. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray earlier expressed reservations against lockdown, but on Thursday he said that strict measures may be taken at some places but as a last resort. As he addressed the state in the evening, he reiterated that he is not in favour of lockdown.Since the middle of February, Maharashtra started seeing a sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, which has so far been attributed to laxity in testing, tracking. The Centre had sent a team to the state to probe into the reasons behind the spike. In its report, the expert team dismissed any link between the mutant strain of Covid-19 with the spike and mentioned that general carelessness, absence of fear, pandemic fatigue, crowded public transport, elections as the reasons for the surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-14-317-new-infections-highest-in-2021-101615474369371.html

The second squadron will be raised in mid-April after the first one has been fully raised in Ambala, said one of the officials cited above.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal.

The Rafale will augment and add a bigger punch along with the IAF’s Su-30 MKIs which are already based in the Brahmaputra valley,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The IAF has operated the fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China and where both sides are negotiating disengagement of troops at friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).India’s Rafale jets are equipped with modern weapons such as the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles and the Hammer smart weapon.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases such as Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions - ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard points.Meanwhile, the commanding officer of the Rafale squadron at Ambala, Group Captain Harkirat Singh, is being posted to the eastern sector to oversee the raising and operationalisation of the second squadron, people familiar with development said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-rafale-squadron-to-be-raised-in-bengal-s-hasimara-in-april-101615473901498.html

The reasons include allegation from Indian companies that the state-run firm's project does not comply with preferential market access norms and is inclined towards foreign companies.The company has called for proof of concept from India vendors for participation in the proposed 4G tender.Leading companies like TCS, Tech Mahindra, Sterlite and L&T have purchased documents for the proof of concept.BSNL has nearly 1,600 queries after the pre-bid meeting, which will be answered shortly, the report said."It is unfortunate to note that 4G service is yet to commence by BSNL when other TSPs (telecom service providers) are preparing to roll out 5G services in the country."The committee desires that there should not be any further delay in allocation of 4G spectrum to BSNL and they should be allowed to roll-out 4G service at the earliest," the panel said.The government has identified that physical assets worth ₹67,837 crore of BSNL and ₹17,985 crore of MTNL can be monetised.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has informed the committee that in the past one year, monetisation was a problem as land and rent prices have fallen. The year 2021-22 is going to be critical because the DoT hopes to monetise more properties."Expected revenue from monetisation of land/building assets of BSNL and MTNL during 2021-22 is ₹1,200 crore and ₹300 crore, respectively," the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsnl-may-turn-profitable-from-2023-24-shows-parliamentary-panel-report-101615470931250.html

The new CM has tenure of almost a year before the state goes to polls next year. His predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat resigned on Tuesday.Calling Khanduri his “political guru”, Rawat said, "He is like a father figure to me from whom I have learnt a lot. It is all because of his teachings that I am today the CM of the state.""He is my ideal and will try to implement his teachings while serving the people of the state as CM in my tenure," the CM added.The senior politician was all praise for his protege."He is a very dedicated member of the organisation after joining it in the early days of his student life. When I entered politics after my stint in the army, he helped me a lot in understanding different things in politics."He has a very clean and non-controversial background which reflects in his character. The people of Uttarakhand would be able to see it in his governance and stand behind him in the next elections to support the party," said Khanduri.Khanduri after being the CM twice between 2007-2009 and 2011-2012, became MP of Pauri Garhwal district in the 2014 general elections.He, however, did not contest the 2019 elections due to ill health after which Rawat was given the ticket on the same seat by the party which he won by defeating Khanduri's son Manish Khanduri, who fought on a Congress ticket, by over three lakh votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-uttarakhand-cm-tirath-rawat-calls-on-his-political-guru-on-day-1-101615468045137.html

"We have renegotiated the price which is significantly lower than ₹200 per dose," the secretary said, without disclosing the new price. This is, however, the rate at which the government is procuring the vaccines. The new price is around ₹157.50, reports said.However, it is not clear whether this will impact the amount that people are paying to get vaccinated at private hospitals. In the second phase of pan-India vaccination where senior citizens and people with co-morbidities between the age group of 45 and 59 are getting inoculated, private hospitals have been allowed to charge around ₹250 which includes ₹100 for the administration of the dose, thereby reducing the price of the vaccine dose to ₹150.2 million Covid-19 vaccine doses delivered in a day for the first time: GovtBefore the first phase of the vaccination began on January 16, India procured 110 lakh doses of Covishield at the cost of ₹200 per dose, excluding ₹10 extra. From Bharat Biotech, the Centre had procured 38.5 lakh dosed at a rate of ₹295 per dose. But as Bharat Biotech provided 16.5 lakh doses free of cost, the price was around ₹206. In later phases, the Centre procured several crores of doses at the previous rate only.As vaccination has been thrown open to the public belonging to priority groups, both Covaxin and Covishield are being equally charged at ₹250. State governments are not having to bear any cost for vaccination as the Centre is procuring and supplying the doses.The ministry, however, did not mention whether a similar price negotiation is going on with Bharat Biotech.More than 2.56 crore doses of Covi-19 vaccines have been administered till Thursday. This includes more than 67 lakh people above 60 years and people aged 45-60 years with comorbidities, apart from 71 lakh first doses and 40 lakh second doses have been given to healthcare workers and 70 lakh first doses and 6 lakh second doses have been given to frontline workers till date, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-procurement-price-renegotiated-much-lower-than-rs-200-per-dose-101615467906866.html

It should not have happened. It hurts believers, it has pained me also,” he said. The minister’s regret follows criticism on the issue by the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party in the run up to the polls.The minister is seeking re-election from Kazhakoottam assembly constituency (on the outskirts of state capital) in April 6 elections. “The case is before a larger bench of the Supreme Court and once the final verdict comes, the government will consult all,” he said. However, the BJP said he presided over the attack on innocent devotees and “won’t be forgiven even if (he) takes thousand dips in river Ganga '', and that he was now shedding crocodile tears eying votes.“Let him first withdraw the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that vitiated the whole issue. He was the temple affairs minister when innocent devotees were attacked for chanting hymns. It is nothing but a cheap stunt for votes,” said BJP state president K Sunedran, who was jailed for more than a month during the agitation. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala asked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to tender an apology first.Also Read: Faction feud delays Congress’s candidate list in KeralaThe flip-flop on the temple issue is seen as one of the reasons for the drubbing of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the last general election in which it lost all but one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats. When the opposition raked the emotional issue again, the government withdrew many cases registered during the stir last month.The temple and surrounding areas witnessed violence in 2018 when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict that allowed women of all ages to worship at the temple, ignoring the age-old tradition that barred women of child-bearing age due to the peculiar nature of the presiding deity. The apex court held that the practice was against gender justice. The state witnessed five shutdowns in 2018 over the issue. After widespread violence, revision petitions were referred to a nine-member bench by the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-temple-affairs-minister-regrets-sabarimala-stand-in-poll-season-101615467702058.html

The four citizen-centric areas for reforms identified by the Department of Expenditure were — implementation of One Nation-One Ration Card system; ease of doing business reform; urban local body and utility reforms; and power sector reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-states-bring-into-force-one-nation-one-ration-card-system-101615464260749.html
11-03-2021||India||India likely to block China's Huawei over security fears: Officials||India is likely to block its mobile carriers from using telecom equipment made by China's Huawei, two government officials said, under procurement rules due to come into force in June.New Delhi is wary about awarding new technology business to Chinese firms both because of security fears and a desire to get Indian manufacturers to produce more telecoms equipment.A US campaign to curb Huawei has triggered bans or limits on the use of its equipment around the world but the situation in India has been amplified by strained relations between New Delhi and Beijing over their shared border.India's telecoms department said on Wednesday that after June 15 carriers can only buy certain types of equipment from government-approved "trusted sources" and said New Delhi could also create a "no procurement" blacklist. Huawei is likely to feature on this embargoed list, the two officials, who declined to be named, told Reuters."We cannot prioritise economic gains if an investment poses national security risk," one of the officials said.The telecoms department, which did not comment on Thursday about Huawei, is yet to provide further details on the plans for trusted sources or a procurement blacklist.However, a third official, who also declined to be named, told Reuters that ZTE Corp, another Chinese firm which has a smaller presence in India, could also be excluded.Huawei and ZTE are under scrutiny for allegedly installing "backdoor" vulnerabilities to spy for the Chinese government.Both have denied the allegations and Huawei has previously told Reuters it is ready to enter into a "no backdoor" deal with India to allay security concerns.Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Two of India's three big telecoms carriers, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, use Huawei gear. Any restriction on Huawei gear is likely to push up costs, industry analysts say.The Chinese firm's equipment and network maintenance contracts are typically cheaper than European competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia and there is limited availability of such gear in India.India has begun to fast-track approvals of some of the more than 150 Chinese investment proposals worth over $2 billion it had put on hold after a June standoff between the two neighbours on the disputed Himalayan border."We have started giving some approvals to investment proposals even from China, but we will not give any approvals in sectors like telecom infrastructure and financials," a senior government official told Reuters.The officials also said that India is unlikely to overturn last year's ban on more than 100 Chinese mobile apps or allow Chinese companies to bid for stakes in state-run firms such as Air India and refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd.India plans to raise $23.57 billion in the 12 months from April 1 by selling state-run companies.India's finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The India-China border clash, the worst in nearly four decades, had soured already fragile relations and "regaining trust would be a long road from here", one of the sources said.India's technology ministry did not respond to a request for comment on app bans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-block-china-s-huawei-over-security-fears-officials-101615466768102.html

Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul on Thursday said the situation of Maharashtra is worrying as part of the state is going back to strict lockdown. But Maharashtra is not the single reason for concern. "Would like to caution Delhi-NCR, Gurugram, part of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad too some extend. These areas are seeing a slight rise in the number of cases," Paul said adding that the pandemic is not over yet.Maharashtra Covid-19 situation very worrying, says Centre as lockdowns return"The pandemic is not over until it's over. We are in a position to give a strong fight against the virus as we have vaccines now. Nobody should take the virus for granted. Nobody should lower their guard," Paul said.Delhi on Thursday reported 409 new infections, which is the highest in more than two months. On January 3, the Capital recorded 424 daily cases.For the past few days, Delhi has witnessed an uptick in the number of daily Covid-19 infections as the number stayed above 300. Noida is reporting an average of 10 to 15 new infections per day and the number of daily infections in Gurugram is between 60 to 80.Delhi health minister Satyender Jain has recently dismissed the rise as worrying as he said Delhi has entered the endemic stage where a disease, in this case Coronavirus, becomes prevalent among the population, but the intensity recedes. However, the Centre has been constantly pointing out that Delhi is one of the states that is showing an upward trajectory in the number of daily cases, though it is not among the top six contributing states.India on Thursday recorded 22,854 new Covid-19 cases which has been the highest in many months. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu reported 86 per cent of new cases. Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana are the states in focus as their daily increase is also significant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-watchful-centre-s-word-of-caution-for-delhi-ncr-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101615465746778.html

The foundation of the MEMU coach project was laid by then UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in September 2013, months before NDA formed its government at the Centre. The project was sanctioned during the second tenure of Ashok Gehlot as Rajasthan chief minister who has, time and again, reiterated the resumption of stalled projects of the state, such as, the MEMU coach factory; and the Banswara-Dungarpur-Ratlam rail project. Speaking at the virtual inauguration of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in January, Gehlot urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restart the sanctioned and stalled railway projects on priority. “MEMU coach factory in Bhilwara was sanctioned, and inaugurated but stopped. Oil and gas are there in Jaisalmer and Barmer – country’s 20% oil is supplied from Barmer. Now the refinery work has also started. The demand for rail line to connect Mundra-Kandla port with Jaisalmer-Barmer has been there for the past 40 years,” he stated. Also Read | Rajasthan CM: 1st dose of vaccination stopped at health centres due to shortageHowever, the ministry of railways informed the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, “Coach factories are set up keeping in view the overall requirement of Railways. With the increase in productivity of the existing coach factories over the past few years, there is no requirement to set up additional coach production unit at Bhilwara at present.” Railway minister Piyush Goyal gave a written reply to MPs Arjun Lal Meena and PP Choudhary’s questions as to by when the Bhilwara MEMU rail coach factory and Jaisalmer-Barmer to Kandla port rail project would be ready. “Jaisalmer and Barmer are already connected by Broad Gauge line to Kandla Port. However, for direct connectivity, surveys for Jaisalmer to Barmer and Barmer to Bhabhar were completed in 2012-13. As these projects were not viable financially and since adequate connectivity already exists, the projects have not been taken up,” the minister said. Commenting on the development, state transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said Rajasthan has given 25 MPs who should raise the issue. “The government of India is being biased towards a Congress-ruled state,” he alleged. However, BJP spokesperson and MLA Ramlal Sharma said only those projects can be taken up which are feasible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthans-coach-project-not-viable-scrapped-govt-in-ls-101615464094216.html

In a statement, the police’s crime branch said Ganai has been retrospectively retired from the service with effect from March 31, 2019.“With access to corridors of power, the accused rose from a daily wager in the office of executive engineer, electric division, Budgam, to special secretary (legal) to the government of Jammu & Kashmir by managing out of turn promotions which prima facie appear to be in violation of rules and regulations and would be probed,” the statement said.It added Ganai, who was until March 5 the special secretary and should have retired two years back as per his real date of birth, also unsuccessfully sought induction into the Kashmir Administrative Service in technical quota. “The accused passed the equivalent of matriculation examination in 1980 as a private candidate and joined as a daily wager in the office of executive engineer electric division Budgam.”The statement said Ganai was regularised in 1985 as a field executive. “In 1989, the accused was appointed as [a] public law officer in the same office and climbing the ladder reached to the rank of special secretary (legal)... the officer got all education equivalent of higher secondary and graduation (college) without attending any regular schools and colleges.”The statement cited an inquiry and added allegations of forgery and misuse of official position has been found to be prima-facie true against Ganai and a criminal case has been registered against him. It added after Ganai’s arrest, unverified complaints have started pouring regarding more such cases of violation of rules. The statement said they too will be probed.“It has prima facie been established that Ghulam Mohi-Ud-Din Ganai forged and manipulated his own date of birth in his service records in connivance with others in order to take illegal monetary gains for himself and enjoy powers as senior legal officer of the Union Territory,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkofficial-arrested-for-forging-date-of-birth-101615463013898.html

Rekha Sharma said that the incident lowers the dignity of women and the person sitting on the tractor. "If women toil for livelihood, I have no problem. But if a man, a political leader, is sitting on a tractor and a woman is pulling it, it lowers the dignity of women and person on the tractor," Sharma told ANI."Mr Hooda should've thought," she said. "If the women think they were made to do this forcibly, they can come to us but even if they're doing it willingly, the one on the tractor should think that this shouldn't be done," Sharma told ANI.Sharma said that if the commission receives a complaint, it will take action. "Even if we don't get a complaint, it's condemnable," the NCW chief said.Hooda, a former chief minister of the state, sat in the driver's seat of the tractor as Congress legislators pulled it with ropes on the way to the state assembly on Monday. The Congress leaders were protesting the rise in fuel prices across the country. Hooda alleged that the lopsided policies of the government have resulted in all-round inflation.A day later, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said it pained him when he saw Hooda riding a tractor being pulled by women legislators. While referring to the Congress’ protest against rising fuel prices in the state assembly, Khattar said he could not sleep at all. “This treatment to women MLAs was worse than bonded labour,” he said while winding up the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governor’s address.However, Hooda countered the chief minister’s remark over the party’s protest and said that it was women who were feeling the pinch of rising prices of cooking gas and other essentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lowers-dignity-of-women-ncw-chief-on-women-legislators-pulling-bs-hooda-s-tractor-101615456029699.html

"We are very worried about Maharashtra — across several districts. We have seen their names. As we came here, we came to know that very strict lockdown is being imposed in Nagpur in particularly. So we are reaching a situation where those approaches are being brought back. This is a very serious issue for us," Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.Paul said that two lessons can be learnt from the sudden rise. "One, don't take the virus for granted. It can come up unexpectedly. We still don't know part of its dynamics. It also tells us that if we want to remain free from this virus, we need to adhere to all Covid-19 appropriate guidelines. This also includes vaccination," Paul said suggesting that vaccination in areas that are emerging as hotspots should be intensified or prioritised.Covid cases soar in Maharashtra, CM Uddhav Thackeray mulls lockdown in some placesPune, Nagpur, Thane, Mumbai, Amravati, Jalgaon, Nashik, Aurangabad, Bengaluru Urban, Ernakulam are the 10 districts with the highest number of active Covid-19 cases, the ministry said. "Out of these 10 districts, eight are in Maharashtra. There is a rise in active cases, which had declined as low as 1.35 lakh on February 12," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Watch: Uddhav Thackeray takes vaccine dose; strict lockdown likely in some places"On September 18, 2020, the country had more than 10 lakh active cases. From 10 lakh we came down in January and further in February and now the graph is rising again," Bhushan said.Maharashtra, Punjab are the states where active cases have gone up astronomically, the health secretary said excluding Kerala, West Bengal from the bracket as the number of active cases dipped in these states in the past few days. Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana are at the tipping point. They are yet to "decline to a surge", the secretary said.Maharashtra has been witnessing a sharp spike in the number of fresh Covid-19 cases since mid-February. Districts like Amravati, Pune, Jalgaon imposed local restrictions to contain the spread of the infection. On Thursday, the Nagpur administration announced a strict lockdown from March 15 to 21, during which only essential services will be allowed. All private offices will remain closed and government offices will work at 25 per cent capacity.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has not been in favour of lockdown so far but the CM on Thursday said strict lockdown measures will be enforced in some parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-covid-19-situation-very-worrying-says-centre-as-lockdowns-return-101615461814093.html

We are not putting any restrictions on the number of pilgrims who can come to Char Dham shrines as we did last year due to Covid-19. The general precautions for checking the spread of Covid-19 will have to be taken by all,” said CEO Raman.Last year the portals of Kedarnath shrine were opened on April 29 and the first prayers were offered on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help the country fight against the coronavirus pandemic. This year, the officials and the priests are expecting a good rush on the first day of the shrine reopening.In February, the date for opening the portals of Badrinath shrine - May 18 - was declared on the occasion of Basant Panchami.According to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board officials, last year overall some 3.1 lakh pilgrims came for Char Dham Yatra, including 1.3 lakh pilgrims for Kedarnath.The Char Dham shrines were opened for pilgrims on July 1 last year by the state government.Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri are collectively called the Char Dham and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, then moves to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.Located at a height of nearly 3,500 meters above the sea level, Kedarnath temple is near Mandakini river in Rudraprayag district. According to tradition, the shrine was built by Pandavas and revived by Adi Shankaracharya. The shrine was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods, with Kedarnath town suffering extensive damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-shrine-opens-on-may-17-no-restrictions-on-number-of-pilgrims-101615461989039.html

In 2017-18, it suffered a loss of ₹1,369 crore. Though it could recover briefly by making a net profit of ₹97 crore in 2018-19, it plunged into huge losses to the extent of ₹3,910 crore in 2019-20.Support for the agitating workers of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant has been pouring in from various quarters. Popular Telugu film star and former Union minister K Chiranjeevi expressed his solidarity with the steel plant workers.“Visakhapatnam Steel Plant is a symbol of numerous sacrifices. It is the right of the Andhra people and their self-respect. Let’s rise above parties and regions. With a steely resolve, let’s save Visakha Steel Plant,” Chiranjeevi tweeted late on Tuesday.He said it was not justified to say that the VSP is being privatised because it is incurring losses since all these years it has been deprived of captive mines.Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president K T Rama Rao, too, announced that he would stand by the people of Visakhapatnam in their fight against privatization of the VSP. “If necessary, with permission of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we will visit Visakhapatnam to extend our support,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/staff-of-vizag-steel-prep-to-intensify-stir-may-go-on-indefinite-strike-soon-101615461458412.html
11-03-2021||India||Plea filed in SC seeks release of Rohingyas detained in Jammu jail||An application has been moved in the Supreme Court to seek the release of over 150 Rohingya refugees detained in a Jammu sub-jail and stall their deportation by the Centre.The application was filed by two Rohingya Muslim refugees, Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir as part of a petition that has been pending the consideration of the top court since 2017.According to the application, nearly 150 to 170 Rohingya refugees in Jammu were detained in a sub-jail on or around March 7 after verification by their embassy, and face the threat of being deported.“Disturbing reports from the Rohingya families have come in that subsequent to a biometric verification of Rohingya refugees undertaken by the Jammu and Kashmir administration, some people never returned to the camps from the verification but were detained and jailed by the police,” stated the application filed on behalf of the two men by advocate Prashant Bhushan.Also Read | 18 more Rohingyas detained; count at Kathua holding centre reaches 197The jail where they have been detained has been converted into a holding centre and the Inspector General of Police (Jammu) has indicated that the detained refugees could be deported back to Myanmar, the application said.On March 7 (Saturday), HT had reported that at least 155 illegal Rohingya immigrants who escaped persecution in Myanmar and were living in Jammu and Kashmir were on Saturday sent to a “holding centre”, under Section 3(2)e of the Foreigners Act. The immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required under Section (3) of the Passports Act, said officials. Inspector general of police (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh had said on Saturday , “155 illegal immigrant Rohingyas staying in J&K were today sent to the holding centre established vide home department notification dated March 5, 2021,” adding, “This was done under section 3(2)e of the Foreigners Act. Due process of law was followed in this exercise. These immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required in terms of section (3) of the Passports Act.”Bhushan asked the court to consider issuing directions to immediately release the refugees detained illegally and direct the government to grant them refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). The application also included a request that the government not proceed with the deportation of the detained refugees, and instead, allow United National High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to intervene and determine the protection needs of the Rohingya refugees not just in Jammu but in camps across the country.According to information provided in the application, there are close to 6,523 Rohingyas in Jammu who have escaped from Myanmar fearing persecution. Some of them have cards issued by UNHCR acknowledging their status as refugees. India does not have any legislation recognising refugees, but the country adheres to the principle of non-refoulement (not sending refugees to a place where they face danger) as part of the customary international law.On March 10, HT had reported that the verification of illegal Rohingya immigrants in Jammu had halted for the third consecutive day, but 18 more immigrants were shifted overnight to the Hiranagar sub jail — a temporary holding centre in Kathua district — taking the total number of inmates to 197 on Tuesday. “The number of inmates at the holding centre is now 197. The figure had gone up to 199, but a couple was let off,” said an official, who didn’t wish to be quoted. The detentions have been made under Section 3(2) e of the Foreigners Act since the immigrants were not found with valid travel documents required in terms of Section (3) of the Passports Act, said a police official.The original petition was filed by Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir in the Supreme Court, and the matter was last taken up in 2017. During those proceedings, the Centre had filed a scathing affidavit, accusing Rohingya Muslims in India of having links with Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence and terror organisation Islamic State and thus posing a serious threat to national security.But the petitioners, who represented the large population of Rohingya Muslims spread across India, told the court that military operations against Rohingyas led to a lot of bloodshed and violence, forcing a lot of them to seek safe haven in India. They opposed the government’s response and claimed it was wrong to label all Rohingya refugees as having links with terror outfits without any criminal case being lodged against them in this regard.By an order dated October 13, 2017, the Supreme Court had allowed the two petitioners to move the court in case of any contingency. The present application was filed in light of this permission granted by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-filed-in-sc-seeks-release-of-rohingyas-detained-in-jammu-jail-101615461934016.html

It should never have happened. It has pained everyone...it has pained me also," Surendran told television channels.The minister, who is contesting the April 6 Assembly election, has come out with the statement at a time when the opposition Congress and BJP are raking up the Sabarimala issue against the Marxist government in the poll-bound state.Also read: Kerala to drop anti-CAA, Sabarimala stir cases ahead of assembly pollsKerala had witnessed high drama during the nearly three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018 with around a dozen women in the 10-50 age group being prevented from entering the Sabarimala temple by protesting devotees after the doors were opened for women following the apex court verdict, permitting women of all age groups into the shrine.The LDF, particularly the CPI(M), had drawn flak from several quarters over the women's entry issue for its alleged hastiness in implementing the Supreme Court order.In the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, post-Sabarimala agitation, the LDF had suffered a massive drubbing, losing 19 out of the total of 20 seats.The CPI(M), however, regained lost ground by winning the recent civic body polls.The party, which conducted a door-to-door campaign post the LS polls, had admitted that a section of believers had misunderstood the Left on the Sabarimala issue.Surendran, however, expressed hope that people were no more worried about those incidents now."The case is currently before the larger bench of the Supreme Court and whatever be the verdict, the government will implement it only after discussing it with everyone including believers, political parties and general public," the minister said.He also pointed out that the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government recently had withdrawn all cases that were not of serious criminal nature in connection with the Sabarimala agitation and that was a message.However, the BJP on Thursday rejected the minister's statement and demanded an apology from him for whatever he had done at the Lord Ayyappa temple.Party's state president K Surendran said the minister would not be forgiven for the cruelty and injustice shown to Sabarimala, even if he takes a dip in the Ganga a thousand times.He also said Kadakampally Surendran was now crying out of fear of losing the coming polls and the people of the state would not believe him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restricting-women-s-entry-to-sabarimala-should-not-have-happened-kadakampally-101615454059225.html
11-03-2021||India||Internet and Mobile Association urges govt to regulate, not ban cryptocurrency||Industry body IAMAI (Internet & Mobile Association of India) on Wednesday appealed to the Indian government to not impose a blanket ban on cryptocurrency and said that the aim should instead be to develop a robust mechanism to regulate the related ecosystem in the country.Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.As per IAMAI, the crypto community consists of over 10 million crypto holders having over USD 1 billion worth of crypto assets, over 300 startups generating tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and taxes.The jobs are being generated across a variety of functions - legal, compliance, tech, marketing, business development, finance, etc - in India and abroad, IAMAI noted."Given the scale and diversity, the good governance and regulation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in India is critical and will give impetus to the Government of India's Digital India vision," it said, adding, "There's a daily trading volume of USD 350 million - USD 500 million.""Hence, we are urging the government to define the cryptocurrency regulation framework after due consultation with IAMAI and stakeholders such as India crypto-asset user groups and the exchanges that facilitate buying and selling," IAMAI said.Banning cryptocurrency will have an "adverse" impact and will lead to a loss in investments and hit 10 million Indian crypto customers, IAMAI noted.The cryptocurrency community in India had expressed its apprehension when the central government was in talks of introducing a bill in the Parliament to ban all cryptocurrencies. Several quarters had also expected India to launch its own digital version of the rupee in its stead.Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das had also said that the apex bank has certain "major concerns" over the impact that cryptocurrencies may have on the financial stability in the economy and has conveyed the same to the government.The RBI had virtually banned cryptocurrency trading in 2018 and had directed all entities regulated by the central bank to cease dealing in virtual currencies.The Supreme Court had also asked the Centre in 2019 to frame policies for crypto, and in 2020, struck down the curbs imposed by the RBI.However, earlier this month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the government is still formulating its opinion on cryptocurrencies and will take a "calibrated" position.The Reserve Bank had through various public notices on December 24, 2013, February 1, 2017, and December 5, 2017, cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-and-mobile-association-urges-govt-to-regulate-not-ban-cryptocurrency-101615457160624.html

11-03-2021||India||PM Modi says creating wealth, values for humanity at core of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'||Asserting that a self-reliant India is good for the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that creating wealth and value "not only for ourselves but for the larger humanity" is at the core of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat'.Speaking at the launch of the Kindle version of Swami Chidbhavananda's 'Bhagavad Gita' via video conferencing, the prime minister said the epic's core message to people is to perform action and asserted that 1.3 billion people of India have decided their course of action which is to make India 'Aatmanirbhar' or self-reliant.In the long term, a self-reliant India is in everyone's interest, he said."At the core of Atmanirbhar Bharat is to create wealth and values not only for ourselves but for the larger humanity. We believe that an Atmanirbhar Bharat is good for the world," he added.In the recent past, when the world needed medicines, India did whatever it could to provide them, the prime minister said, referring to India providing medicines and now vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic. "Our scientists worked in a quick time to come out with vaccines. Now, India is humbled that vaccines made in India are going around the world. We want to heal as well as help humanity. This is exactly what the Bhagavad Gita teaches us," Modi stressed.He said the Bhagavad Gita was born during conflict, a reference to Mahabharat, and many feel that humanity is passing through similar conflict and challenges now, Modi said."The world is fighting a tough battle against a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. The economic and social impacts are also far reaching. In such a time, the path shown in Bhagavad Gita becomes ever relevant," he asserted.It could provide strength and direction to once again emerge victorious from the challenges humanity faces, he said"In India, we saw many instances of this. Our people-powered fight against Covid-19, the outstanding spirit of the people, the courage of citizens, one can say that behind this is a glimpse of what the Gita highlights," he said.Noting that E-books are becoming very popular specially among the youth, Modi said, therefore, this effort will connect more youngsters with the noble thoughts of the Gita.The beauty of the Gita is in its depth, diversity and flexibility, he said. He quoted a peer reviewed journal of cardiology published by the University of Oxford which talks at length about the relevance of Gita during the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.Modi said this e-book will also deepen the connect between the eternal Gita and the glorious Tamil culture and enable the Tamil diaspora spread across the world to read it easily.He praised the Tamil diaspora for scaling new heights in many sectors and yet carrying the greatness of its culture wherever they went.Paying homage to Swami Chidbhavananda, the prime minister said the mind, body, heart and soul of the Swami was devoted to India's regeneration. He said the beauty of the Gita is in its depth, diversity and flexibility. Modi asked youngsters to read Gita, saying its teachings are extremely practical and relatable. In the middle of their fast-paced lives, Gita will provide an oasis of clam and peace, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-creating-wealth-values-for-humanity-at-core-of-aatmanirbhar-bharat-101615452369060.html

In the past, even more candidates-- 203 in 1971 and 230 in 1977 contested using our party symbol but then our allies were very few,” said a senior DMK leader, who is part of the seven-member seat sharing committee. “We were able to persuade our allies to contest under our symbol,” he added.The DMK completed its seat sharing agreements for the assembly polls on Wednesday by signing a one-seat agreement with the All India Forward Bloc. While the DMK will contest on 173 seats, it has persuaded at least six of its 12 allies to field 14 candidates under its symbol.The DMK’s rising sun and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) two leaves symbols have more recall value among the electorate, especially those in the rural pockets and older generation voters. The voting pattern from previous elections, particularly in rural areas has shown that voters traditionally choose one of the two symbols notwithstanding the candidate or their alliance.The parties who will contest under the DMK symbol include Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) in six constituencies and Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) in three; besides other smaller parties. “Winning possibilities are more if we contest under the DMK’s symbol and it will reach more people,” said KMDK’s general secretary E R Easwaran.The move will provide DMK support in the western belt, a stronghold of the AIADMK. KMDK contested in six constituencies in the 2011 assembly elections with the DMK using a hat symbol, but didn’t win. In 2016, they went on their own, contesting in 72 seats using a gas cylinder symbol and yet had no luck. In 2014, they aligned with the BJP and came back to the DMK’s fold 2019 for parliamentary election and contested using the DMK’s rising sun symbol and got their first electoral win in Namakkal Lok Sabha seat.Vaiko, who quit the DMK in 1994 and launched MDMK said after signing the deal that it was practical to contest using the DMK symbol to avoid complications and also since the party has not been able to establish its own common symbol.Also Read: In 2nd list, AIADMK banks on incumbentsThe DMK is likely to release its first list of candidates Thursday even as AIADMK has released two lists totalling 177 candidates and named constituencies given to PMK (23) and BJP (20) on Wednesday.In the previous assembly elections in 2016, the AIADMK came to power after winning 135 seats it contested out of 234. DMK contested in 180 and won 88 while its ally Congress contested in 41 and won 8.

She was one of the editors of the 'toolkit' document.On February 3, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg had shared this 'toolkit' in a tweet, which she later deleted.

11-03-2021||India||Unnao: Where feudalism, crime and a compromised state machinery meet||Kaushal Singh, a resident of Hasangunj hamlet in central Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district, was four when his father was murdered. His father was walking down the main avenue, or Bada Chauraha, in Unnao to meet his lawyer near the district court when he was shot twice in the head. His killer, whom police later said was a henchman acting on behalf of a local don, put his revolver back and walked away – no one in the crowded street attempted to stop him. It was 1981. Singh grew up hearing up stories about his father from his mother, who longed for revenge. She told him that his father was hindering the rise of an upper-caste don who held sway over local politics and therefore was gunned down. The shooter was caught a few months later and sentenced to life in jail. In 2003, the shooter was released from jail on parole. Days later, while standing outside the Unnao district court, he was killed by two gunshots. The shooter was Kaushal Singh. Also Read | 21-year-old man, teen aid held for poisoning Dalit girls in Unnao“Kaushal killed him at the very spot his father was killed, at the same time. After shooting him twice in the head, Kaushal shouted ‘mera badla pura hua’ (I have taken my revenge), boarded a tempo and left,” said Asad Maqbool, a sub inspector at Unnao police station who arrested Singh later. Kaushal was sentenced to jail but expressed no regret. “I spoke to him after his arrest, his life mission was to kill that man to get his family to reclaim the position it deserved, “ Maqbool said. Such stories of revenge, feudalism, crime and enmity abound in the cramped bylanes, chowks and crossroads of Unnao. Sandwiched between Lucknow and Kanpur and on the banks of the Ganga, Unnao traces its history back almost 900 years, through the reigns of the Mughals to the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, when the modern administrative district was laid out. Today, it lies at the heart of what is called the badlands of Uttar Pradesh, where local strongmen have fiefdoms shaped by caste and crime and the heft of a political leader is measured by the length of his cavalcade, his crime record, and his ability to bend the law. As a result, political influence, law enforcement and feudal power often have blurred boundaries, resulting in uneven policing, rampant crime against women and caste-based persecution. The region grabbed national headlines in 2017 after former Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar raped a minor girl and then dodged the law for months, banking on his caste and feudal networks. In 2018, a minor Dalit girl said she was gang-raped by men who also videographed the crime and another Dalit girl was burnt alive. In 2019, a 23-year-old woman was set on fire while on her way to court to testify in her assault case. In 2020, a group of five men gang-raped a young woman on the pretext of helping her in a previous gang rape case. And just last month, a 21-year-old man poisoned three minor girls because one of them rejected his advances. To be sure, such gruesome crimes are not specific to the political party in power and are also reported from other districts — such as Hathras in western UP where a Dalit woman was gang-raped and killed in October. But experts and activists say the socio-political fabric in Unnao ensconce key conditions that let crime fester and make law enforcement tough. “The remnants of the feudal system reign large in Unnao. Mixed with caste hierarchies, it helps the powerful, with large tracts of land, exert influence on the administration, police and politicians. As a result, the weaker sections and victims have no redressal system,” said Poonam Kaushik, a woman’s right activist. 2 Unnao has a decades-old relationship with organised crime due to its proximity to major economic centres and borders with five districts. Stories of notorious rivalries between top dons, many of whom were upper-caste landowners, abound in the dusty district headquarters and the countryside. Take the enmity between Nepal Singh and Baggad Singh in the late 70s, which claimed 80 lives. Or the terror-filled reigns of Munshi Mahipal, Ganga Pille or Lalai Singh that spawned urban legends. “It was said that Lalai Singh cannibalises his victims after murdering them,” said veteran local journalist Shailendra Tiwari. The most famous of these tales involved two seniors. In the early 1980s, don Kishan Maharaj at 70 murdered rival crime boss Babu Tiwari, 80, in Achalgunj in full public view. The murder — in which Maharaj first overpowered Tiwari and then called on bystanders to watch him kill his rival — sparked a blood feud that lasted three generations and cost at least 60 lives on both sides, said local police. “There was a time in the 1970s and 80s when killing a man on kutcheri (court) premises or the bus adda (terminal) or bada chauraha (main junction) was the fashion…people elicited pride in doing this and calling it a masculine thing,” said SN Bajpai, a political analyst. The state government doesn’t publicly release district-wise crime figures but a senior police official said the district saw two cases of crime against women every day in 2020 – a year when restrictions on movement and fear of the coronavirus meant that people rarely stepped out of their houses. A woman was molested every two days, and abducted every 1.5 days.Experts and local activists cite three main reasons for the region’s blood-soaked history. One, feudal attitudes abound in a region with large landowning families, many of whom hail from upper-caste communities. This became more pronounced in the 1980s and 90s as other states raced past UP, which despite its industrial past and substantial factories, struggled to adapt to the new economy. But the state’s political heft was still outsized in national politics, which meant the influence of local strongmen, who commanded fierce caste and clan-based loyalties, soared. This meant that the political establishment had less incentive in reining in local centres of power and establish an uniform rule of law. “The history of Unnao is bound with feudalism,” said Mohammad Arif, a local observer. “The ruling class use people to settle their scores and it sets off a cycle.” In many cases, the local don had ties to large tracts of land, the local dominant caste group and the political administration. In the absence of large-scale economic development, the don wielded disproportionate economic and social power, and therefore the ability to sway elections. His power was also exemplified in exaggerated shows of masculinity that hindered, among other things, women’s independence. Two, ties between land, influence and honour remain strong. This is important in a state where possession of land is not only a marker of economic mobility but also social might. “Access to land not only guarantees commodity production, food security and better living standards but also provides them better social status and condition. The very nature of control of land is related to land right, which in a nutshell refers to land title in terms of ownership and possession, which cement economic prosperity and social status,” argued a 2019 paper by scholar Bibhuti Bhushan Malik. The mismatch in land holdings between dominant and weaker communities creates a skewed power dynamic in favour of upper-caste communities. For Dalits and other marginalised castes, therefore, the only way to dignity is through land. With women shut out of the land inheritance process, power and impunity gets concentrated in the hands of men. “In the absence of land reforms, power gets concentrated in the hands of strongmen. In many cases, institutions meant to enforce law and order become biased towards local power centres. As a result, those with no land or dependents like women have no control over administration,” said Kaushik. Three, the air of invincibility shrouding local strongmen. Due to caste and other ties, the strongmen have people of the same caste or community controlling other powerful administrative unit such as the police station, politician or media. Moreover, because of their aura and hold over the electorate, the strongmen are influential players in politics, which further colours the administrative response. “In many cases, police have refused to act on strongmen from dominant communities because of caste or clan ties. This kind of impunity is often created by land owning and political influence that is gained through a life of crime,” said Ajay Kumar from the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies. In the absence of constant and stringent policing, men from dominant communities develop an aura of invincibility and aren’t afraid of law enforcement. In many cases, such impunity lasts for generations as dominant families build on their political power with each passing generation. “Unnao is a place where power talks,” said Anand Mohan Jaiswal, who headed several police stations in the district. 3 In many ways, the 2017 rape of a minor girl by Sengar, and the case that followed, encapsulated how strongmen function in Unnao. A four-time MLA, Sengar raped the young woman, his neighbour, in June, 2017. The case found prominence in April 2018 when the survivor tried to immolate herself in front of the chief minister’s residence and her father died in jail. Sengar was born in a powerful Thakur clan that had a stranglehold on the region due to their holdings in land, sand mining and brick kilns. His grandfather, Babu Singh, was the village chief and passed the mantle on to Sengar. Also Read | CBI indicts 3 IPS, IAS officers for not acting on Unnao rape survivor’s complaints against MLAAfter the position was reserved for women, Sengar’s mother Chunni Devi took over. His wife Sangeeta is the sitting Zila Parishad chief while his brother’s wife is the current village head. Sengar was in almost every major party and won from three separate constituencies in the district. He built his reputation as the strongman and held a big Sunday meeting where people from far-flung villages in the district came to resolve disputes, or beg for jobs. In contrast, the survivor’s father and uncle used to work for the MLA and otherwise eked out an income from a small plot of farmland. Sengar’s community connections and political heft helped him hatch a “criminal conspiracy” with police officers to “falsely implicate” the survivor’s father, according to a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charge sheet. With the help of his connections, Sengar was able to rally his supporters to beat up and intimidate the father, even call up senior police officers. He even kept tabs on the father’s police interrogation by calling the police officers present 10 times – out of a total of 36 calls placed by either associates of Sengar, the MLA, or police officers in a two-hour period. The former MLA also called up the government medical officer and forced him to keep the father in jail. He died five days later. The extent of the impunity was underlined by the fact that three of Sengar’s men gang-raped the girl a week after the original crime in an alleged bid to keep her quiet about the MLA. Sengar’s dismissal from the party and his conviction in 2019 did little to dent his popularity in the region. In his home village, residents still flaunt their association with the MLA and say his influence is unmatched. “He’ll win again if he stands here,” said a local villager on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unnao-where-feudalism-crime-and-a-compromised-state-machinery-meet-101615445793622.html

It is celebrated on the 14th day of the dark fortnight of the Magha month, as per the Hindu lunar calendar, and marks the night of the marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.However, amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, there are several restrictions and guidelines put in place to ensure the safety of the devotees offering prayers on the holy day.The Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, which usually draws thousands of pilgrims and sadhus on the festival is seeing a dip in the number of visitors this year due to the health crisis.Meanwhile, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, just like every year, thousands of Shiva followers assembled at Har Ki Pauri ghat to take a holy dip. The city is considered one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage centres because according to popular legend, it was here that Lord Shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his hair.In Madhya Pradesh, priests at Ujjain's Mahakal Temple offered prayers and performed 'abhishek' of Lord Shiva on the occasion of Mahashivaratri. Following the traditional rituals, priests were seen offering milk and honey to 'Shivling,' an iconic representation of Shiva- one of the deities of the Hindu triumvirate.In Gorakhpur, pious devotees arrived in large numbers at Jharkhandi Mahadev Temple to offer prayers to their Lord.In Varanasi, a sea of Shiva lovers arrived outside Kashi Vishwanath Temple and queued up for 'darshan' this morning.However, due to an uptick in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Trimbakeshwar Temple in Nashik and Babulnath Temple in Mumbai will remain closed for devotees on the occasion of Maha Shivratri.Also read: 57-day Magh Mela to end with Maha Shivratri bathingMaha Shivratri is considered auspicious for spiritual growth.

He, however, did not condemn the government’s stand against the discussion. “I don't blame the government of India for doing its job, for speaking up for its point of view. But we must recognise there is another point of view and that in democracies, elected representatives are free to air their point of view on this,” Tharoor added.The Congress MP was referring to a debate on Monday in the British parliament, which was a response to a public petition signed by more than 115,000 people. During the discussion, Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democratic, and Scottish National Party lawmakers called on the Boris Johnson government to raise their concerns about the handling of the protest and media freedoms in India.On Tuesday, British envoy Alex Ellis was summoned by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation that conveyed India’s “strong opposition to the unwarranted and tendentious discussion on agricultural reforms in India in the British Parliament”, a statement from the external affairs ministry said. The foreign secretary said the debate “represented a gross interference in the politics of another democratic country”, and he advised British MPs to refrain from “practising vote bank politics by misrepresenting events, especially in relation to another fellow democracy”.The Indian mission in London called the debate a “distinctly one-sided discussion”. “We deeply regret that rather than a balanced debate, false assertions – without substantiation or facts – were made, casting aspersions on the largest functioning democracy in the world and its institutions,” the mission said in a statement.According to Tharoor, it wasn’t something “so surprising”. “We should take it as a normal give and take that happen between democracies,” he told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/just-like-we-discuss-palestine-shashi-tharoor-on-farm-stir-debate-in-uk-parliament-101615442902095.html
11-03-2021||India||NHRC recommends alert system to trace missing children in India||An early warning system should be developed in India on the lines of America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert to trace the missing, runaway, trafficked, and abducted children, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has recommended.The AMBER Alert was created in 1996 after Amber Hagerman, 9, was kidnapped and murdered in Texas. Under the system, once a child is abducted, law enforcement agencies notify broadcasters and state transportation officials for alerts. The alerts are issued by suspending regular programming on radio and television. They are also issued via emails, SMS, and electronic billboards on highways.At a meeting, the NHRC’s Core Group on Children cited growing numbers of missing children to recommend the alert system. As many as 73,138 children went missing in India in 2019 alone, according to National Crime Records Bureau. The group has said the issue should be made a national priority and recommended incentives for police to proactively investigating cases of missing children.Also Read | NHRC notices to Jharkhand govt, ministry of social justice over delay of pensionThe group has also recommended the revival of the Union home ministry’s Operation Smile under which drives were carried nationally to trace the missing children from 2015 to 2017. Over 70,000 children were traced under the scheme.The group has also recommended a single comprehensive national standard operating procedure (SOP) to ensure uniformity by doing away with other overlapping procedures. It has said roles of each stakeholder, especially district child protection units, should be defined. There are overlapping Union home and women and child development ministries’ SOPs on missing children.At the meeting, the group’s members flagged a “lack of accountability in law enforcement agencies and civil servants” and said it was “hindering effective implementation of various policies and guidelines”. “There is a need to fix accountability for delay or non-registration of FIRs [first information reports],” according to the minutes of the meeting seen by HT. The members underlined the need for using artificial intelligence and heat-map for data collection and identification of the most vulnerable spots and routes. “There is a need to look at why children are leaving home, look at what prevents us from identifying those indicators early on, examine the impact of the response system on children’s right, etc. There is a need to research and evolve a model procedure for investigation for missing children, incorporating all the good practices and doing away with the redundant practices,” said the minutes.Child rights lawyer Bhuwan Ribhu and Asha Bajpai, a former law professor at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, are among the members of the group. The group also includes representatives from the women and child development ministry, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, and NHRC.Bharti Ali, the co-founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights and a member of the group, said this is an issue on which all stakeholders like ministries of home and women and child development have been involved in a dialogue for a long time. “There are SOPs but they are not being implemented on the ground. Then there is duplication... of data.”Ali said the time police and other authorities take to react when a child goes missing is crucial. “Tracing mobile numbers of children or mobile numbers used by children to reach out to their parents when they are lost or have been kidnapped is not done timely. The time lag is very crucial, and many children can be traced if promptness is shown as soon as the parents share such numbers with the police.”The home ministry did not immediately respond to HT’s query on the recommendation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-recommends-alert-system-to-trace-missing-children-in-india-101615443273273.html

"Long live Canada-India friendship," the billboards installed by an organisation named Hindu Forum Canada also said.Starting with the immediate neighbours, India has delivered millions of doses of Made in India vaccine to various countries around the world including Canada. In the coming weeks, the government is planning to further extend the assistance to 49 more countries in Europe, Latin America, South-east Asia, the Pacific Islands and Africa.India will also deliver 200,000 doses to United Nations (UN) peacekeepers, Union minister of external affairs, S Jaishankar had announced on February 18. "Keeping in mind the UN Peacekeepers who operate in such difficult circumstances, we would like to announce today a gift of 200,000 doses for them," Jaishankar had said at the United Nations Security Council debate.He also said India has been "very much" at the forefront of the global fight against the pandemic and is providing vaccines to the world under 'Vaccine Maitri' initiatives. "We are working actively with GAVI, WHO and ACT Accelerator. Our contribution has also supported the SAARC," he also said.The Vaccine Maitri initiative was launched by India on January 20 and under this initiative, the government is gifting the Covid-19 vaccine to various countries. The initiative has earned India praise from around the world, especially in small countries such as the Commonwealth of Dominica. Last week, a group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries commended India for supplying Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries during a discussion at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The World Health Organisation also thanked India for promoting supporting vaccine equity.In February, The United States also lauded India and its pharmaceutical companies for playing a role in producing "life-saving" vaccines for the world. The US also said that it is looking forward to an 'overarching' memorandum of understanding to enhance health partnership with India.The assistance comes as India is inoculating millions of people in the country as well. It is using two vaccines—Covishield manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Covaxin developed by Hyderabad's Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Medical Council of Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology—for the immunisation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/billboards-praising-india-for-sending-covid-19-vaccine-come-up-in-canada-101615441082818.html

It also plans to move all Rajdhani trains to the push-pull mode of transportation.The push-pull mode of operating locomotive-hauled trains allows trains to be driven from both ends with locomotives attached to the front as well as the rear.“Indian Railway has further carried out trials on Rajdhani Express trains on Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi-Kolkata routes. It is possible to reduce the journey time by 60 to 90 minutes on these routes with [the] operation of Rajdhani Trains in push-pull mode,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.“Advantages of running trains in [the] push-pull mode include enhanced safety of train operation, reduced journey time, comfortable ride [jerk free] and cost-effectiveness. The push-pull composition is also [a] future-ready solution for up to 160 kmph speed potential, as trains can be run with existing rolling stock [electric locomotives and LHB coaches]. Besides it can also do away with the noisy and polluting power cars, thereby saving on precious diesel.”The railways first in 2016 began running trials of passenger trains with the push-pull locomotives between Jaipur and Jodhpur.Also Read | Railways to roll out first 500 Tejas sleeper coaches in FY 22In the push-pull concept, the locomotives are connected on both ends of a rake and operated in such a way that the tractive and electrical braking efforts are always synchronised.“We have developed 12 rakes of Rajdhani on [the] push-pull system that save 60-90 minutes on the journey on a daily basis. We plan to move all Rajdhani trains to [the] push-pull system in a phased manner. In the future, we also plan to convert our Shatabadi trains to the same mode,” an official said, requesting anonymity.The Rajdhani Express trains between Mumbai and Delhi run on the push-pull mode.

The two leaders agreed on continued support for each other against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement.The Prime Minister and Crown Prince reviewed the functioning of the bilateral Strategic Partnership Council established in 2019 and expressed satisfaction over the steady growth in the India-Saudi partnership, according to the statement.The telephonic conversation comes almost six months after their previous call in September last year when the two leaders discussed the challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic.During the call on Wednesday, Modi discussed with the Saudi leader his wish to further expand trade and investment between the two countries and also brought to spotlight the opportunities that the Indian economy offers to Saudi investors. They also reviewed regional and international developments of mutual interest, according to PMO.Also, in the wake of the pandemic, Modi and Crown Prince Salman vowed continued support in the spirit of the special friendship and people-to-people links between India and Saudi Arabia.The Prime Minister reiterated his invitation to the Saudi Crown Prince to visit India at an early date.

11-03-2021||India||Covid: High death risk after surgery within 6 weeks of testing +ve, says study||Surgery should be delayed for at least seven weeks after a patient tests positive for Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as patients are more than two-and-a-half times more likely to die after their operations, if the procedure takes place in six weeks following a positive diagnosis, according to a new global study.The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of planned delay before surgery in patients who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes Covid-19.Researchers, whose findings were published in Anaesthesia, performed an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of 140,231 patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery in 116 countries during October 2020.Surgical patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality.“31 doctors of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, participated in the study, including patients from surgery, paediatric surgery, orthopedics, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac anesthesia, neurosurgery and neuroanesthesia. For the first time, it gives us evidence about the least amount of time delay in doing surgery that would optimise final outcomes,” said Dr Shilpa Sharma, paediatric surgeon, AIIMS, New Delhi, who is also the lead author from the hospital.Also Read | CDC finds Covid-19 drove 15% spike in US death rate in 2020: Report“However, this needs to be balanced by the disease risk to the patient. At AIIMS, we have been doing RTPCR /CBNAAT routinely for screening all surgical patients. Many times these have come positive, and where possible, we have delayed the surgery and waited for the patient to recover,” she added.Adjusted 30-day mortality in patients who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.5%. This was increased in patients operated at 0-2 weeks (4.0%), 3-4 weeks (4.0%), and at 5-6 weeks (3.6%), but not at 7-8 weeks (1.5%) after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, according to the study paper.Patients operated within six weeks of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were also at an increased risk of 30-day postoperative pulmonary complications.These findings were consistent across age groups, differing severity of the patient’s condition, urgency of surgery, and grade of surgery and in sensitivity analyses for elective surgery.“These risks decreased to baseline in patients who underwent surgery after at least seven weeks or more of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. These findings were consistent across both low-risk (age < 70 years..) and high-risk (age ≥ 70 years) sub-groups. Therefore, surgery should be delayed for at least seven weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection to reduce the risk of postoperative mortality and pulmonary complications,” said researchers in the paper.“In addition, we have shown that patients who are still symptomatic seven weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection and undergo surgery, also have an increased mortality rate. As such, these patients may benefit from a further delay until their symptoms resolve,” they added.According to researchers, this is the first study to provide robust data regarding the optimal timing for surgery following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researchers also stated in the paper that while cut-offs beyond seven weeks were not formally tested, they are unlikely to offer a significant advantage, since adjusted mortality rates for delay intervals post seven weeks were broadly stable.“Moreover, overall mortality following a delay of at least seven weeks was similar to mortality in patients who did not have pre-operative SARSCoV-2 infection.The study holds significance as it offers evidence to support the safe restarting of surgery in the context of a rapidly increasing number of people who have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-high-death-risk-after-surgery-within-6-weeks-of-testing-ve-saysstudy-101615433312660.html

11-03-2021||India||India, China will continue talks to resolve remaining issues along LAC: Govt||India on Wednesday said it will continue discussions with China to resolve the remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh and achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points to restore peace and tranquillity in the border areas at an early date.In responding to a question in Lok Sabha on whether China has admitted loss of lives of their commandos in the Galwan encounter, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said the Central Military Commission of China on February 19 announced awarding posthumously honorary titles and merit citations to Chinese soldiers."As per the announcement, these titles were awarded for the role of these soldiers in the faceoff at Galwan Valley in June 2020," he said.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the fierce hand-to-hand combat in the Galwan Valley clash, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.For the first time, China officially acknowledged last month that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clash with the Indian Army."Government will continue discussions with the Chinese side to resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and achieve the objective of disengagement from all friction points and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas at an early date," Muraleedharan said.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.In his response, Muraleedharan also referred to defence minister Rajnath Singh's announcement in Parliament on February 11 that India and China reached an agreement on disengagement in the North and South banks of Pangong lake."The disengagement in the Pangong Lake area has been completed," he said.After completion of the disengagement process in Pangong lake areas, senior military commanders of India and China held another round of talks on February 20 with a focus on taking forward the disengagement process in other friction points.In the talks, India pitched for a faster disengagement process in areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang to bring down tension in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-will-continue-talks-to-resolve-remaining-issues-along-lac-govt-101615428999790.html

11-03-2021||India||China poses greatest long-term strategic threat in 21st century: Pentagon||China poses the greatest long-term strategic threat in the 21st century, a top Pentagon commander told lawmakers on Wednesday, alleging that Beijing's very pernicious approach to the region includes a whole of party effort to coerce, corrupt and co-opt governments, businesses, organizations and the people of the Indo-Pacific."...the greatest long-term strategic threat in the 21st century ... is the People's Republic of China. In stark contrast to our free and open vision, the Communist Party of China promotes a closed and authoritarian system through internal oppression, as well as external aggression," Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of United States Indo-Pacific Command, told members of the House Armed Services Committee."China's very pernicious approach to the region includes a whole of party effort to coerce, corrupt and co-opt governments, businesses, organisations and the people of the Indo-Pacific," he said.As China continues to increase the size of the PLA and advance their joint capabilities, the military balance in the Indo-Pacific is becoming more unfavourable for the United States and its allies, Davidson said."With this imbalance, we are accumulating risk that may embolden China to unilaterally change the status quo before our forces may be able to deliver an effective response. The greatest danger the United States and our allies face in the region is the erosion of conventional deterrence vis-a-vis the People's Republic of China," he said.Absent a convincing deterrent, China will be emboldened to continue to take action to supplant the established rules-based international order and the values represented in the vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said."Our deterrence posture in the Indo-Pacific must demonstrate the capability, the capacity and the will to convince Beijing, unequivocally, that the cost of achieving their objectives by the use of military force are simply too high. Indeed, we must be doing everything possible to deter conflict. Our number one job is to keep the peace. But we absolutely must be prepared to fight and win should competition turn to conflict," he told the lawmakers.Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey told lawmakers that the US is not asking nations to choose between the United States or China."In fact, we welcome and encourage all nations across the Indo-Pacific to maintain peaceful, productive relations with all of their neighbours, China included. Framing the strategic competition that we find ourselves in with China as a choice between us or China, or as a choice between nations is really a false choice,” he said."The choice that our allies and our partners and everyone in the region faces is between supporting the existing international order, the existing system. It's free and open. It's the system that we helped to create and that we've supported, and that we believe has benefited everybody in the region, including China--and the alternative now that China is presenting, which is a closed system and a more authoritarian governance model," he said.So it's a competition between systems, and it's a choice between systems, he told the lawmakers.Responding to a question, Davidson alleged that the Chinese are trying to basically impose Chinese national law on the international regime that provides for the freedom of navigation and freedom of the seas. "We've spoken quite a bit about the Chinese use of lawfare. This is one of the methodologies in which they do it.""It's not just the naming or renaming of features that have had long standing names and the region, it's the redefinition of what they might be, because, rocks islets, islands all have very specific navigational rights associated with them, as well as their continued militarisation of the features that they built out early in the last decade," he said.Their continued militarisation is to deter not only the United States, but truly cow all of US allies and partners in the region, and certainly the South China Sea claimants from their absolute rights to operate and those rights that they enjoy for economic resource extraction of freedom of the seas, freedom of the airways, et cetera, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-poses-greatest-long-term-strategic-threat-in-21st-century-pentagon-101615427659242.html

We are still monitoring the situation and measuring the level of the particulate matter regularly. The rise in pollution level was due to lack of wind movement and cloudy sky. As a matter of precaution, we have advised the district administration to stop construction activities and shut down some industries which are probably adding to the pollution," said Mohapatra. High PM2.5 and PM10 levels can potentially impair lung function.Though the condition improved a little bit on Wednesday, students said they faced a burning sensation in the nose and eyes while travelling to the college. The heavy smog also reduced visibility during driving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smog-engulfs-rourkela-schools-colleges-polluting-industries-closure-sought-101615427955721.html

Respective state governments are, therefore, responsible for initiating and developing urban transport infrastructure, including metro rail projects/MetroLite/MetroNeo in cities or urban agglomerates.The Central Government considers financial assistance for metro rail proposals, on the basis of the feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned state governments.

India was previously classified as an electoral democracy.V-Dem Institute’s report comes close on the heels of the annual report on global political rights and liberties by US-based Freedom House, which downgraded India’s status as a democracy and free society to “partly free”.

11-03-2021||India||India’s largest floating solar power plant to be commissioned by NTPC in May||India’s largest floating solar power plant of 100 MW capacity, belonging to the National Thermal Power Corporation, is expected to be commissioned at Ramagundam in May this year, NTPC southern region executive director CV Anand said on Wednesday.Addressing a virtual press conference in Hyderabad, Anand said the floating solar photo-voltaic project would be spread over 450 acres on the water surface of Sri Ram Sagar Project reservoir. This will be the largest floating solar plant in the country in a single location as of now. The total cost of the project would be ₹423 crore, including GST, he said.“NTPC is utilising the water bodies and huge reservoirs to set up these floating solar units, because it requires huge expenditure for ground-mounted plant. For setting up one MW solar photo-voltaic plant on ground, we require five acres,” he said.The NTPC has successfully completed pilot projects at Kayamkulam (100 KWH) capacity and Kawas (1 MW). “Now, we are implementing large floating solar plants,” the executive director said.The NTPC southern region has taken up setting up of solar power plants of the total capacity of 450 MW. Of this, 217 MW plants would be floating on water bodies. Apart from the 100 MW plant at Ramagundam, the corporation is setting up 92 MW floating unit at Kayamkulam gas plant in Kerala and a 25 MW unit at Simhadri power plant in Visakhapatnam.“We are actually slightly delayed in implementing these floating solar projects due to the Coronavirus pandemic,” Anand said.Regarding other solar power projects of the NTPC southern region, he said a 5 MW solar plant was set up at Port Blair Solar in Andaman & Nicobar Islands on March 30, 2012, that catered to the power needs of the Union territory; a 10 MW solar plant was commissioned at Ramagundam December 31, 2013 and the phase I- of the 250 MW (5X50 MW) Ultra Mega solar project was commissioned at N P Kunta village of Anantapur district in Andhra.In addition, the NTPC is setting up a 230 MW ground mounted solar power plant in Ettayapuram near Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu by next year. On an average, the cost of setting up solar plant is around ₹4 crore per MW, he said.Explaining about other ventures of the NTPC southern region, the executive director said it was in the process of commissioning 2x800 MW coal fired thermal power project at Ramgundam in Telangana. The phase I unit of 800 MW will be commissioned by January 2022 and the phase II of 800 MW by March 2022.NTPC Southern region has total installed capacity of about 9,125 MW, out of the corporation’s total capacity of 64,880 MW in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-largest-floating-solar-power-plant-to-be-commissioned-by-ntpc-in-may-101615410322573.html

The authorities had rescued 67 women, mostly minors, from the so called ‘spiritual university’, where they had been confined in cages, fed like animals and weren’t allowed to meet their parents.Dixit, 79, has been absconding since then and is suspected to be hiding in Nepal.The Delhi high court handed over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation in December 2017 after which the agency formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to locate him and even announced a reward of ₹5 lakh for any information on his whereabouts. However, he has been untraceable.The Interpol red notice, which is a global arrest warrant for a fugitive, will empower Nepal authorities to trace Dixit, arrest and hand him over to India, said an official.The CBI has already chargesheeted Dixit in June 2019 in two rape cases. In one of them, CBI stated Dixit raped the complainant from 2011 to 2015 on various occasions in different branches of Adhyatmik Vidyalaya. CBI had claimed the girl was brought to Lucknow and given some intoxicated substances in milk after which she was allegedly raped.Similarly, in the second chargesheet, CBI said Dixit, being head of the Ashram and a spiritual teacher, committed rape on a minor against her will at two different Ashrams at Kampil (Uttar Pradesh) and Vijay Vihar, Delhi during May/June 1999. “It was also alleged that the accused threatened the victim and gave life threat to her family members,” according to a CBI statement in 2019.The North Delhi corporation had demolished the illegal ashram structures in January 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/godman-on-interpol-radar-for-sexually-abusing-minors-101615410042713.html
11-03-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s response on denying women cadets entry to NDA, Naval Academy||The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Ministry of Defence to explain its policy to exclude women cadets from being trained for armed forces at the prestigious National Defence Academy (NDA) and the Naval Academy.A petition filed by advocate Kush Kalra brought the issue before the Court which has issued notice to the Centre, the NDA, the Department of Defence through the Chief of Defence Staff, and the Union Public Services Commission that invites applications from eligible male candidates and even conducts examination for entry into NDA.Finding this to be a barrier for eligible women for pursuing their dream to serve in the Armed Forces, the petition said, “Eligible and willing female candidates are not allowed to take the said Examination (of NDA and Naval Academy) on the sole ground of their sex…and this act of discrimination is a dishonour committed by the Respondents to the Constitutional values of Equality (Article 14) and Non-Discrimination (Article 15) in the Constitution of India.” Besides, the petition even alleged violation of Article 16 (equal opportunities in matters of public employment) and Article 19 (freedom to practice profession).A bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice on the petition filed through advocate Mohit Paul. The petitioner told the Court that the occasion to file the petition came after the top court delivered a landmark verdict in February 2020 allowing women short service commission officers in the Army to be eligible for permanent commission. At present, the only route for women to enter Armed Forces is through applying for short service commission.An application moved by a prospective female cadet was also entertained by the Court as the applicant demanded that “systematic discriminatory treatment meted out to eligible female candidates aspiring to join the NDA to train as future officers of the Indian Armed Forces” be done away with.The applicant said, “The relief claimed by the petitioner, if granted by the Court, would possibly be the breakthrough step in moving towards facilitating equal representation of genders in the Armed Forces.” Presently, the sex ratio in the Armed Forces is skewed. As per a recent statement by the Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik in the Rajya Sabha, women officers in the Army constitute a negligible 0.56 per cent, 1.08 per cent in the Air Force, and 6.5 per cent in the Navy, the application said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-response-on-denying-women-cadets-entry-to-nda-naval-academy-101615408171043.html
11-03-2021||India||Gymkhana directors move SC against takeover by govt||The directors of Delhi Gymkhana Club, one of the oldest clubs in the Capital have approached the Supreme Court challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order naming an administrator to manage the affairs of a private club.Challenging the NCLAT’s February 15 order, nine directors of the club said in their appeal that “the appointment of administrator destroys the autonomous functioning of a private club without satisfying the threshold criteria for exercise of power under Section 241(2) of the Companies Act.”Section 241(2) of Companies Act states, “The Central Government, if it is of the opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest, may itself apply to the Tribunal for an order under this Chapter.”The Club established in 1913 is registered under the Companies Act and holds a perpetual lease over a prime plot of 27.3 acres in the heart of Lutyens Delhi. In 2016, the Club claimed that some disgruntled members filed a complaint with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs alleging mismanagement. This led to an inquiry by the ministry and two inspection reports , the second running into around 4,000 pages. On the basis of this, the ministry approved the filing a petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging that the activities of the club were being conducted in a manner “prejudicial to public interest”.NCLT admitted the petition filed by the Union Government against Delhi Gymkhana Club and held that the affairs and management of the private club involved “public interest”. In an interim order on June 26, 2020 , it sought constitution of a committee to examine and recommend changes in the character of the club. Both the Club and the Centre moved appeals before NCLAT which led to the appointment of an administrator . The appeals body also dismissed the club’s appeal . NCLAT’s order was damning. It said: “Under the garb of distinctive character of the club which is a relic of the imperial past, the doors of membership are virtually limited to people having blue blood in their veins thereby perpetrating apartheid and shattering the most cherished constitutional goal of securing social justice and equality of status and opportunity.”In the appeal, the directors , led by Major Atul Deb (Retd) claim that the order passed by NCLAT set a dangerous precedent by allowing government to interfere into the affairs of a private club.“Governments are not and ought not to concern themselves with the affairs of private member clubs,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gymkhana-directors-move-sc-against-takeover-by-govt-101615409495212.html
11-03-2021||India||HC stays Delhi govt order suspending perks for Nexon EV||The Delhi high court on Wednesday stayed a Delhi government order by which it suspended the subsidy to buyers of the Tata Nexon EV after complaints of sub-standard range performance, saying the officer who passed the order of suspending the subsidy did not have anything before him which could show that the vehicle did not meet the required efficiency or to prove that the bare minimum rules were not met.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that a statutory body, like the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune, gave a certificate to Nexon EV that it meets the requirement of over 300km/charge, and it was on this basis that the manufacturers, Tata Motors had applied for subsidy. ARAI is an autonomous body affiliated to the Union ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises.Under its Electric Vehicles (EV) policy, the Delhi government offers subsidies, and road tax and registration free waivers, for electric vehicles bought in the Capital. On March 1, the AAP government suspended the subsidy offered for Tata Nexon EV after complaints that the car didn’t meet the per-charge range claimed by the manufacturer.A Tata Motors spokesperson on Tuesday said the Delhi high court has issued a notice on the company’s writ petition and granted interim relief by directing a stay against the delisting of Nexon EV from Delhi government’s eligible list of vehicles. “The high court has granted time to the Delhi government to file a counter affidavit in the matter,” the spokesperson said.Though the Delhi government did not comment on the HC’s order, it constituted a five-member committee to look into the complaints regarding Tata Nexon EV. The committee has been asked to take a final decision in the matter by March 20.A senior transport department official said the committee, headed by deputy commissioner (transport) Manoj Kumar Pandey, will evaluate the mileage range of the EV as claimed by Tata Motors, its actual mileage in city conditions in Delhi to examine and verify the complaints made by complainants. The panel also has representative from the company and experts from other groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-delhi-govt-order-suspending-perks-for-nexon-ev-101615408576725.html
11-03-2021||India||Search warrant for Pracha office stayed by Delhi court||Delhi court on Wednesday stopped the city police from searching the premises of advocate Mehmood Pracha, the lawyer representing several accused and victims of north-east Delhi riots cases.Chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) Pankaj Sharma said “till the pendency of this application, the search warrant issued against the applicant is stayed”.Pracha’s office was searched by the city police on Tuesday in connection with an FIR alleging that the advocate had tutored a witness to initiate a false case.When Pracha learned about the alleged raid, he filed an application before CMM Sharma seeking modification of a March 2 order, wherein the judge had given permission to the police to search his premises in Nizamuddin East for the only purpose of seizing a computer.In his application, Pracha said the demand of the investigating agency for the hard disk of the computer is illegal as all documents are already in the police’s possession from an earlier search on December 25, 2020.On Wednesday, the court reserved its order on the advocate’s plea which has also sought a direction to the police to retrieve only the “relevant information from his hard disk” in the presence of a magistrate.Pracha said a soft copy of the materials was as good as a hard copy under the Information Technology Act. He said that he would sacrifice himself but would not give up the confidential information of his clients which is stored on the hard diskDuring the course of arguments, the advocate also argued that it was clear from the video of the riots that his complaint was not false.“Larger issues are involved. Entire judicial system is involved,” he pleaded.Opposing the plea, the Delhi Police said seizing the original hard disk was essential as it ought to be sent to a forensics laboratory for examination. They said a mirror hard disk can be put back into the computer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-warrant-for-pracha-office-stayed-by-city-court-101615406103415.html

11-03-2021||India||Praise for justice Indu Malhotra days before her retirement||“You are an icon”, Supreme Court judge Dhananjay Y Chandrachud told justice Indu Malhotra on Wednesday in what was perhaps the last sitting of the two judges together.Justice Malhotra, one of the two women judges in the apex court, retires on March 13 after a tenure of almost three years. She will sit in the top court as a judge for the last time on Friday. Previously a senior advocate, justice Malhotra joined the bench on April 27, 2018.On Wednesday, she sat with justice Chandrachud on a special bench to hear a review petition in a criminal case related to the early release of a life term convict who has served more than 20 years in jail in Uttar Pradesh.The petition was dismissed after the bench found substance in the report of the state government that the enmity, which resulted in the murder in the present case, still existed, and that there were five cases pending against the convict’s son at the moment.After the proceedings, justice Chandrachud realised this could be the last time when he was sitting with justice Malhotra on a bench in the Supreme Court -- judges in the top court sit with the Chief Justice of India on the day of their retirement as per convention.“Sister Indu, it was a privilege sitting with you on the bench. I will miss sitting with you, Indu,” justice Chandrachud said to the judge who returned the compliment by saying she would also miss sitting with him in the court. Justice Chandrachud then recalled his message to justice Malhotra on March 8, International Women’s Day. “I had sent you this message on the Women’s Day too: Indu, you are an icon, for women and for all of us. God be with you always.”A Supreme Court judge retires at the age of 65. After justice Malhotra’s retirement, the apex court will be left only with one woman judge, justice Indira Banerjee, who is set to retire in September 2022.Justice Malhotra’s career has seen an interesting journey: from teaching students political science in Delhi colleges in the 1970s to joining the Bar in 1983; from topping an advocates’ exam in 1988 to being only the second woman to be designated as a senior advocate after 30 years in 2007; and from taking up the cause of preventing deaths due to road accidents to being the first woman lawyer to be directly appointed from the Bar to the Supreme Court in April 2018. With her elevation, the Supreme Court, for the first time in its history had three sitting women judges with justices R Banumathi and Indira Banerjee being the other two. Justice Banumathi retired in July 2020.During her stint, Justice Malhotra made the mark as a judge who was a stickler for principles of law and not afraid to express her point of view.In September 2018, when the Supreme Court, by a 4-1 verdict, threw the Sabarimala temple open to women of all age, justice Malhotra dissented with the four male colleagues. “Rationality cannot be used to judge faith,” she said in her judgment, adding that followers must be allowed to follow their own faith in a secular polity and that it was not for courts to determine which religious practices are to be struck down except in issues of social evil like “Sati”.She stuck to her views when the review petition was filed in the Sabarimala case and agreed that the review petition should remain pending until a larger bench determined questions related to essential religious practices in all faiths.Justice Malhotra, however, was with her four male colleagues when the same bench unanimously struck down Section 497 (adultery) in the Indian Penal Code, ruling it was unconstitutional since the very basis for criminalising adultery was that a woman was considered as the property of the husband and could not have relations outside the marriage.She was a prominent voice throughout the hearing on decriminalisation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which made gay sex a crime punishable by up to a life term. “History owes an apology to the members of this community and their families, for the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they have suffered through the centuries. The members of this community were compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution,” she wrote in her concurring verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/praise-for-justice-indu-malhotra-days-before-her-retirement-101615401804749.html
11-03-2021||India||Sainik Schools being set up with help from NGOs, states: Govt tells Parliament||The government on Wednesday told Parliament that it is working on a new scheme to set up more Sainik Schools in the country in partnership with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), private schools and state governments. This comes weeks after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her budget speech on February 1 that India will set up 100 new Sainik Schools in partnership with NGOs, private schools, and states.Currently, there are 33 Sainik Schools in the country that account for a large number of candidates who join the armed forces.“The endeavour is to provide schooling opportunities in ‘CBSE plus’ type of educational environment by involving desirous government/private schools/NGOs to partner in establishing/aligning their system with Sainik Schools’ ethos, value system and national pride,” minister of state for defence Shripad Naik told Lok Sabha in response to a question.Sainik School alumni have risen to top ranks in the military including service chiefs such as Generals Dalbir Singh and Deepak Kapoor.“It (the proposal) envisages enrolling existing/upcoming schools to be run on the lines of Sainik School curriculum. The schools are proposed to be affiliated to Sainik Schools Society. Detailed guidelines and requisite approval are at an advance stage,” the minister told the lower house.VK Krishna Menon, who was India’s defence minister during the India-China 1962 war, had come up with the idea of setting up Sainik Schools.Figures testify the role of Sainik Schools as feeder institutions for the armed forces. In 2018, the National Defence Academy (NDA), known as the cradle of military leadership, inducted a total of 662 cadets of whom 147 (22.2%) were from Sainik Schools. The preceding year the number was even higher. In 2017, of the 644 cadets who joined NDA, 179 (27.8%) were from Sainik Schools. Similarly, of the 595 cadets who joined NDA in 2016, 158 (26.5%) were alumni of Sainik Schools. Some select Sainik Schools have begun opening their doors to girls too since 2018, with the government opening up more avenues for women in the armed forces in recent years.As reported by Hindustan Times on March 8, the Indian Navy has deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years, with the service focusing on steadily opening more roles to them.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the Indian Air Force decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.Until now, Sainik Schools were set up after receiving requests from state governments/union territories, which have to provide infrastructure such as land and educational/ residential buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sainik-schools-being-set-up-with-help-from-ngos-states-govt-tells-parliament-101615400048155.html
11-03-2021||India||70.66% voter turnout at AP municipal polls||Hyderabad: The first real electoral contest in Andhra Pradesh since 2019’s Lok Sabha and state assembly elections saw around 70.66% of voters exercise their franchise in elections for 71 municipalities and nagar panchayats held on Wednesday, state election commission (SEC) officials said. The votes will be counted on March 14 and the results will be announced on the same day, they added. The voter turnout in 12 municipal corporations in the state, however, remained low and stood at 57.14% at 5 pm when the voting process concluded. “The final polling percentage in both the municipalities and municipal corporations might go up slightly, as those who were in the queues at the time of closing hours are being allowed to cast their votes,” state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar said. In all, 581 divisions in 12 municipal corporations and 1,632 wards in 71 municipalities and nagar panchayats went to polls on Wednesday. Of the total, representatives in 490 wards were elected unanimously. According to reports reaching the SEC office, polling was largely peaceful, barring stray incidents of clashes between workers of the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in some areas. “There was enthusiastic participation of voters in the polling process. Women, old people and physically challenged people, too, exercised their franchise in large numbers,” the SEC said. While the elections to the gram panchayats held in four phases in February were on a non-party basis, the elections to the urban local bodies – municipalities, nagar panchayats and municipal corporations -- were held on party-basis. Since this is the first major electoral battle in the state after the general elections in 2019, both the YSRCP and the TDP took them seriously. While YSRCP is hoping to retain its hold, the TDP has pulled out all stops to regain its lost ground in the state. The YSRCP has already bagged Pulivendula, Punganur, Macherla and Piduguralla municipalities as candidates in majority of the wards in these municipalities were elected unanimously. The TDP, however, accused the ruling party of resorting to large scale irregularities in the municipal elections by misusing official machinery and police forces. TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu alleged YSRCP leaders attacked TDP workers to prevent free and fair elections. Naidu urged the SEC to take stringent action against the conniving officials and the erring YSRCP leaders. It was the duty of the SEC to punish the culprits responsible for the election violations and ensure a democratic polling process, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7066-voter-turnout-at-ap-municipal-polls-101615401451559.html

Trade unions plan to hold talks with farmers who have been protesting outside the Capital’s borders against the three contentious agricultural bills since November 27, to understand how to plan and manage a lengthy protest. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of Vizag Steel Plant Parirakshana Samithi, a joint action committee (JAC) of the trade unions, late on Tuesday.“We shall serve the strike notice to RINL management on Thursday. All the workers will go on an indefinite strike from a date which will be decided later. We have also decided to constitute committees with employees working in various departments of the steel plant and launch a campaign till March 19, preparing the workers for a long-drawn agitation,” J Ayodhya Ramu, president of Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the recognized trade union of RINL, said. RINL workers are planning to hold discussions with top farm leaders, including Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait. “We are studying their model of agitation and if possible, we shall adopt their strategy to wage a long-drawn battle to prevent the privatization of the steel plant. We have invited the farm leaders to Visakhapatnam on March 28 for a meeting with steel plant workers on how to go about with the future course of action,” the trade union leader said.Meanwhile, the trade unions have decided to stage a dharna in front of the steel plant on March 15. “On March 16 and 17, representatives of the trade unions will visit Delhi to represent our issue with the floor leaders of all political parties and request them to take up our case in Parliament,” Ramu said. The JAC has also decided to hold a massive rally titled ‘Karmika Garjana’ (roar of the workers) at Trishna Grounds near the Steel City in Visakhapatnam on March 20. Prominent national trade union leaders, including G Sanjeeva Reddy of INTUC, Tapan Kumar Sen of CITU, Amarjeet Kaur of AITUC and Surendranath Pandey of BMS are likely to attend this public meeting. The steel plant workers have intensified their agitation following a statement by Union finance minister in Lok Sabha on Monday on the Centre’s plan for 100% disinvestment of its shares in the RINL which has a production capacity of 6.3 million tonnes per annum, and makes products used in the construction sector.  RINL has at least 17,000 permanent employees and 14,000 contract employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-unions-plan-meeting-with-farmers-in-delhi-to-intensify-stir-101615401450916.html
11-03-2021||India||Zomato delivery boy ‘punches’ woman, arrested||A Bengaluru-based content creator on Wednesday alleged that she was punched by a delivery person from the food delivery company, Zomato. Hitesha Chandranee, who posted a video on social media, alleged that incident happened on Tuesday, following an argument over a delay in delivery. She claimed the delivery person barged into her house, verbally abused and assaulted her resulting in a fracture to her nasal bone.The woman registered a complaint with Bengaluru’s electronic police station, based on which, the delivery executive was taken into custody, said police.In the video, Chandranee claimed that she placed an order on the Zomato app around 3.20 pm. Even after an hour, when she didn’t receive the order, she contacted support to cancel the order or provide a refund. As she was talking to customer service, the delivery person arrived; she took the order, but when she told him to wait, she claims, he started abusing her.“He started screaming at me, saying ‘Am I a slave or what? You are asking me to wait here.’ It was really threatening for me. I tried to shut my door but he pushed the door, took my order from the table by entering my home, punched me in my face and ran away,” she said.Chandranee said she has suffered a fracture to her nasal bone. “I was given high-power antibiotics and painkillers because of which I am able to talk... My eyes water and my nose bleed as soon as I start talking,” she added in the video.Police said the delivery executive presented a different version of the story. “According to him, he wanted to hand over the food and get on with another delivery. The woman demanded a refund, which was beyond his capacity. As she refused to accept the order, there was a verbal altercation. When she tried to hit him with her sandals, he pushed her in self-defence, which resulted in the injury,” said an electronic city police station official.Meanwhile, Zomato said that the delivery executive has been delisted from the platform pending an investigation. “We deeply regret this incident and apologise to Hitesha for this traumatic experience. We are in touch with her and are providing our complete support through the necessary medical care and investigation. Meanwhile, we have delisted the delivery partner from our platform.”Earlier, Zomato responded to Chandranee’s tweets, saying: “We can assure you this is not the experience our delivery universe stands for. Our local representative shall be in touch with you shortly to help you with the police investigation along with assistance on the medical care required. We can’t emphasise how sorry we are, rest assured we’ll take necessary actions to prevent such incidents from happening in future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zomato-delivery-boy-punches-woman-arrested-101615401330607.html
11-03-2021||India||7 hydel projects ‘vulnerable’ to damage from disasters||A disaster risk management company has listed seven hydropower projects in Uttarakhand (apart from the Rishi Ganga and Tapovan Vishnugad projects on the Rishi Ganga river, both of which were destroyed in the February 7 floods) as extremely vulnerable to damage by floods, avalanches and other natural disasters.RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm said in its advisory dated February 11 that although this event damaged two hydropower projects, many other hydropower projects are vulnerable to natural disasters caused by floods, cloud bursts, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), avalanches, landslides, and rockslides, in the Himalayan region. The advisory lists Lata Tapovan (171 MW) on Dhauli Ganga; Vishnuprayag (400 MW) on Alaknanda; Tehri (1000 MW) on Bhagirathi; Vishnugad Pipalkoti (444 MW) on Alaknanda; Naitwari-Mori (60 MW) on Tons; Phata Byung (76 MW) on Mandakini and Singoli Bhatwari (99 MW) also on Mandakini. Each of these projects costs ₹7 to 8 crore per MW.“RMSI applied its understanding of the Uttarakhand geography with its machine learning-based models for landslide and avalanche and hydrodynamic models for flood and GLOF to do a quick review of the hydropower projects in Uttarakhand. We found several of them at risk from these hazards,” said Pushpendra Johari, senior vice president sustainability, RMSI.The analysis has been contested by some of the project developers. “I haven’t seen this advisory yet. But I believe it’s based on half-cooked information. Tehri has been standing strong for two decades... In 2013, Tehri helped save Rishikesh and Haridwar from the floods. Tehri is built to face a one-in-10,000-years disaster. Vishnugad Pipalkoti , located next to Tapovan Vishnugad , which was destroyed in the February 7 glacier breach disaster, wasn’t affected,” said Rajeev Kumar Vishnoi, director (Technical), THDC (Formerly Tehri Hydro Development Corporation Limited).The advisory states that the Rishi Ganga Power Corporation and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) are assessing the damage to their projects on account of the February 7 disaster, which has resulted in the deaths of at least 150 people, mostly workers on the project site. Preliminary estimates suggest damages worth ₹1,500-2,000 crore.The floods also washed away five bridges of the Border Roads Organization (BRO) that connected narrow roads in the hills with 13 villages, including Gahar, Bhangyun, Raini Palli, Pang Lata, Suraithota, Tolma and Fagrasu.NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad project was under construction when the disaster occurred, while the Rishi Ganga project resumed generating power since June 2020. Nearly 75% of the total cost of the Tapovan-Vishnugad project, estimated to be about ₹4,000 crore has been spent. NTPC officials did not respond to requests for comment.Johari said the analysis highlights the importance of disaster-proofing projects. “We can make the slope stable by applying natural vegetation, slope stabilisation techniques as well as (building) retention walls to stop the slides from either impacting the dam or river. Similarly, small interventions upstream of the dam such as creating structures below the river bed that are covered with steel mesh that separates the debris from the water when it flows over it, can reduce the impact of debris flows like what happened in the recent event.”Some independent experts, however, said disaster management firms have started seeing a business opportunity in Uttarakhand.“We clearly said in our report that projects in the para glacial zones (2200-2500 m height) and those located north of the main central thrust (a geological fault in the Himalayas) are extremely vulnerable to landslides, GLOFs and floods. So, this advisory comes as no surprise,” said Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body formed in 2013 to study the environmental impact of hydropower projects after the 2013 Kedarnath floods.A senior retired geologist said on condition of anonymity that “both hydropower and disaster management businesses are benefitting from the risks. Tehri is quite downstream while many are upstream and in really dangerous locations. So of course, there is risk, but we don’t know yet how many models have been used for such analyses.”The Kathmandu based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development said last week that there is a link between the February 7 disaster with infrastructure development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-hydel-projects-vulnerable-to-damage-from-disasters-101615400975589.html
11-03-2021||India||Quad summit timing reflects Biden admin’s priorities: US||Washington: The timing of the first summit-level meet of the Quad — short for Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — reflects the “importance we place on close cooperation” with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region as it will be one of the earliest of President Joe Biden’s multilateral meetings, the White House said late on Tuesday.Biden will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Australia’s Scott Morrison and Japan’s Yoshihide Suga virtually on Friday in a meeting that will cement the status of the security grouping that has moved rapidly towards acquiring an institutional structure in recent years.“That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks to the importance we place on close cooperation with our allies and partners in the Indo- Pacific,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary at her daily news briefing on Tuesday.President Biden has held virtual bilateral summits with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico — the US’s two closest neighbours — and one multilateral meeting, a private video conference with his G-7 counterparts.“A range of issues, of course, will be discussed -- we expect to be discussed, I should say -- facing the global community from the threat of Covid, to economic cooperation, and of course, to the climate crisis,” Psaki said of the upcoming Quad meet.The first summit-level meeting was announced by the external affairs ministry in New Delhi this week. “The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region,” the ministry said of agenda. “The Summit will provide an opportunity to exchange views on contemporary challenges such as resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change,” it added.The US National Security Council accorded some more context to the meeting. “@POTUS and this administration are committed to working with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to secure the peace, defend our shared values, and advance our prosperity,” it said in a tweet, using the acronym used in the US President’s twitter handle.Formed in the aftermath of the 2004 Tsunami — though some say it was started in 2007 — the Quad seemed to be all but over in 2008 chiefly due to Australia’s reluctance to continue. The grouping was revived in 2017 and the first meeting took place on the sidelines of an ASEAN meeting in Manila, 2017. It was held at the level of officials.The first Quad ministerial-level meeting was held in September 2019 on the margins of the UN General Assembly meetings in New York. They met again in October 2020 and in February 2021 after President Biden took office.And now, the first Summit is on Friday.Reports have suggested it was the US that pushed hard for a summit-level meeting. The Biden administration made clear its enthusiasm for the grouping very clear and explicit form the start. “I think we really want to carry forward and build on that format, that mechanism, which we see as fundamental, a foundation upon which to build substantial American policy,” Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser, said in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-summit-timing-reflects-biden-admin-s-priorities-us-101615401151121.html
11-03-2021||India||Deeper ties, Indo-Pacific on the agenda of US defence secy visit||Washington The United States will seek to deepen the “Major Defense Partnership” with India during Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s visit and advance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and the western Indian Ocean region, which is an emerging area of interest for coordinated action by the two countries.Austin will reach India next week after visiting Japan and South Korea. This will be his first trip overseas after taking office and, notably, it is to the Indo-Pacific, reflecting the importance the Biden administration is according to the region. He will begin the tour on March 13 with a visit to the US Indo-Pacific command headquarters in Hawaii.In his meetings in India, Secretary Austin will “discuss deepening the US-India Major Defense Partnership and advancing cooperation between our countries for a free, prosperous and open Indo-Pacific and Western Indian Ocean Region,” the defense department said Wednesday.“Major Defense Partnership” is a description unique to India-US defense ties. India was designated a Major Defense Partner by the Obama administration in 2016, and it was elevated by the Trump administration to Strategic Trade Authorization tier 1 status, which allows India license-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies, same as NATO allies of the United States.India’s defense purchases from the United States have ballooned in recent years. It is using an increasing number of US platforms — such as P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, C-130J and C-17 military transport aircraft, AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters, Precision Guided-Excalibur artillery shells, and M777 howitzers. India had ordered Apache and MH-60R multi-mission Seahawk helicopters worth $3.1 billion in February, a top US military commander told lawmakers at a hearing Tuesday. And, according to reports, India is in talks with the country for armed drones.It could not be immediately ascertained if new deals will be announced during Austin’s visit.The US defense secretary will begin his tour on Saturday, day after the first summit of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — or the Quad, as the group comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan is popularly called — underscoring, once again, the importance the Biden administration is giving to the region.The Indo-Pacific and Europe will see the “most robust” US military presence under President Joe Biden, as stated in a National Security Strategic Guidance released last week.In his meetings with his counterparts and other officials in the region, the Pentagon said, Austin will “reinforce the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region – founded on respect for international rules, laws, and norms”, the US department of defense said.The secretary will be joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken for 2+2 meetings with their counterparts in Japan and South Korean, both treaty allies of the United States. India and the US also had a similar 2+2 dialogue in New Delhi in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deeper-ties-indo-pacific-on-the-agenda-of-us-defence-secy-visit-101615401150551.html
11-03-2021||India||Ambani security threat case: Cop transferred amid Maha row||Mumbai: Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said that Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze was being removed from the crime intelligence unit till an investigation into the mysterious death of Mansukh Hiran, linked to a vehicle found parked with explosives outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence, was concluded.The announcement came even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) reiterated its demand for action against Vaze for his alleged role in the death of the 48-year-old auto parts dealer, who was linked to the vehicle found parked outside billionaire Ambani’s residence Antilia on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threat letter.Assistant police inspector Vaze, the 49-year-old head of the crime intelligence unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was leading the investigation into the car found parked outside Antilia.“Police officer Sachin Vaze will be removed from his current posting in the crime branch till the investigation is not completed. I am taking this decision in view of the rising demand from the opposition,” Deshmukh said in the Maharashtra legislative council.Later in the day, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said a picture of policeman Vaze as “Osama Bin Laden” was created by the opposition BJP, which wanted to “hang Vaze first” before his alleged role was investigated in the death of Hiran.On Wednesday, Vaze held meetings with senior Mumbai police officials including commissioner Parambir Singh. “I will clarify my side of the story and release a statement on Thursday,” he said.An Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) team investigating the murder of Hiran recorded Vaze’s statement over several hours on Monday. On Tuesday, Maharashtra leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that Hiran was likely murdered and demanded the arrest of Vaze, based on the statement that Hiran’s wife, 43-year-old Vimla, gave to the ATS investigators on March 7, two days after her husband’s body washed up on the Reti Bunder creek in Mumbra, Thane district.According to Vimla’s statement, Vaze was known to Hiran and had borrowed the SUV in question in November and returned it four months later in February. Her statement also said that Vaze had been with Hiren through the course of the investigation when the SUV was traced back to him.Fadnavis’s demand on Tuesday caused uproar in the assembly, with the ruling parties of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government trading charges with the opposition over unrelated cases, including the death by suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli parliamentarian Mohan Delkar, in February.Vaze’s transfer came after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar spoke to Thackeray on Wednesday morning, a senior party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambani-security-threat-case-cop-transferred-amid-maha-row-101615401090580.html

The opposition parties have been demanding a separate debate on rising fuel prices in the House.The Opposition disrupted both Houses of Parliament for three consecutive days over fuel price hikes and three contentious farm laws before proceedings were adjourned till Monday. After negotiations with the Opposition failed, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said: “PM Modi wanted to make a statement in the House on the 75th Independence celebrations ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. But due to lack of consensus, the statement will not be made. It will happen when a consensus is reached.”Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla earlier called leaders of different political parties to end the Parliament logjam but the opposition parties insisted on a separate debate on fuel price hikes, people aware of the developments said. The government managers have maintained that the issue can be taken up during the debate on demand for grants and the finance bill.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said the government was “guilty of monumental mismanagement of the Indian economy” and is “not allowing a normal functioning of the highest institution of India democracy”. The party’s Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma alleged that “the opposition is being deprived and denied continuously their right to raise issues, which matter to the people of India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-won-t-make-march-12-statement-as-oppn-seeks-debate-on-fuel-price-101615400970038.html
11-03-2021||India||India to extend vaccine coverage to those above 50 in next phase||As India is fast ramping up daily coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccinations, the next in line among the high priority groups are those above 50 years of age.According to the list of priority population groups drawn by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), after nearly 30 million health care and frontline workers, the next in line were individuals above 50 years of age, and those with comorbidities.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The groups were demarcated in the beginning and are now being covered gradually. India is a large country, and to vaccinate 1.3 billion people simultaneously is not feasible. The government had to prioritise. Health care and frontline workers were top priority as this category is directly involved in Covid-19 management and is at maximum risk. Now that it has opened for general population, which is a larger number, the age group has been further sub-divided,” said a senior government official, in the know of the development.As per the expert recommendation, the above 50 years of age category to be vaccinated on priority was further sub-divided into eligible beneficiaries — those above 60 years of age and in the specified comorbid groups, those between 45 and 59 years of age — who were given priority.“Now that there has been a sharp vaccination scale up over the past few days, it is being deliberated to also open up the next category in line, which is above 50. NEGVAC recommended including 50 plus population group also, and the process could start soon as the capacity is clearly in place,” said the official.In an official statement issued on Tuesday, Union health ministry announced that at least 2 million vaccine doses were administered across the country, making it the highest in a single day so far.Also Read: Panel clears withdrawal of ‘clinical trial’ tag for Covaxin“The scale up has been tremendous and we intend to take it to five million per day, and the way vaccination process is going, it will happen soon. Vaccination centres will also be expanded to anywhere between 50,000 to 100,000 across the country to make it possible. All this is doable as we have the capacity and have vaccinated about 170 million children in a week against Polio under the national immunisation drive,” said Dr N.K. Arora, member, National Task Force on Covid-19 related matters.Over the past few weeks, the government has taken several measures to ramp up Covid-19 vaccination process, which includes making changes to the CoWIN platform to allow self-registration, flexible timings and days, walk-ins etc.In its latest advisory to states during a high-level review on Tuesday, the Centre asked them to involve the private sector hospitals in a big way and provide enough stocks to last at least for 15 days to facilitate booking of slots well in advance for the convenience of eligible beneficiaries.“…register and activate all private facilities and also provide sufficient stock of vaccines to the private facilities for 15-28 days so that these facilities can offer online open slots to citizens. Visibility of more open slots not only assures the citizens about the services but also helps avoid overcrowding on account of perceived scarcity in absence of clear visibility of vaccination slots,” said the health ministry in a statement.States were particularly urged to leverage the private sector to the maximum in order to enhance coverage, registering and activating as many private facilities that fulfill the laid down criteria by the central government as possible.“…providing sufficient stock of vaccines is necessary for these centres to work at their optimum and providing any other facilitation required,” the health ministry statement read.Experts also said that expanding coverage was the best way to ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination.“To ramp up vaccination, it’s imperative to open up the facility beyond essential services. The numbers will further go up as more India-manufactured vaccines will gradually get added to the bucket, and more beneficiaries in general population get vaccinated as it will build vaccine confidence. Important figures of the country getting the shot also helps,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-extend-vaccine-coverage-to-those-above-50-in-next-phase-101615400969543.html
11-03-2021||India||1999 Kargil war: Ex-Pak envoy denies US diplomat’s claim||The former Pakistan High Commissioner to India Ashraf Qazi (1997-2002) has denied that he approached US ambassador to India Richard Celeste (1997-2001) to get the US to back Pakistan during the Kargil War of 1999. Responding to revelations in Celeste’s forthcoming book reported by Hindustan Times last month, Qazi said: “My government did not instruct me to do any such thing as its communications with the US would naturally be through either our mission in Washington and/or the US mission in Islamabad.’’The book Life in American Politics & Diplomatic Years in India published by Har-Anand Publications and expected to be out by September, quoted an exchange between the two diplomats at the height of the Kargil War in 1999. Celeste writes that Qazi dropped in one night: “He was seeking our help to persuade the Indians to “cease their aggressive actions in Kargil.” I pointed out that the Indians had held these posts for some time. Ashraf repeated the claim that civilian “freedom fighters” had occupied the positions. “Ashraf.” I said, “I’m going to let you tell me what your government wants you to tell me. But I know that it is not true and I am embarrassed for your sake. I’m your friend so I’m going to be honest with you. We know who trained and equipped those troops and we know how they are being supplied and directed. Our government cannot accept your plea.”Celeste goes on to add how, in a meeting with Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif shortly after this, President Bill Clinton asked him to “withdraw troops” from Kargil. Then came a call from the US president to Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee, “That call from Clinton to Vajpayee was without precedent in Indo-US relations,’’ the former ambassador writes. Indeed, some experts mark it as a key turning point in India’s relations with the US.Speaking to HT from Islamabad, Qazi said that he and the American envoy lived across the road from each other and did have a good relationship. “Dick Celeste is indeed a good friend of mine and during the Kargil crisis he and I had a few private conversations. But he is certainly mistaken in claiming I was “seeking [US] help to persuade the Indians to cease their aggressive actions in Kargil” to which he allegedly replied “our government cannot accept your plea”.”Qazi added: “My government did not instruct me to do any such thing as its communications with the US. That would naturally be through either our mission in Washington and/or the US mission in Islamabad. It would certainly not ask its envoy in India to get in touch with his US counterpart for any such purpose. Nor would I presume to be officially conveying, as Celeste puts it, “what your government wants you to tell me” without any instructions to do so. ‘’Qazi said that while he was sure that Celeste’s book was not ill-intended, its claims were ”simply not true.”Reacting to Qazi’s comments, Celeste said: “Ambassador Qazi is a well respected diplomat and a dear friend. I accept the fact that our recollections differ and, in my case, would acknowledge an aging mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1999-kargil-war-ex-pak-envoy-denies-us-diplomat-s-claim-101615400609479.html
11-03-2021||India||'Set up help desks near Covid-19 vaccination centres': PM Modi in BJP MPs’ meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Bhartiya Janata Party(BJP) lawmakers and officials to set up help desks next to Covid-19 vaccination centres across the country, to help guide people, increase awareness of the vaccination drive, even ferry the old and the infirm to and from vaccination centres (much as is done during elections), people familiar with the mater said.The Prime Minister was addressing members of parliament and while he highlighted the work done by the government over what has been a trying year for the country and pulled up MPs who played truant, the emphasis of his talk was on India’s ongoing vaccination drive, the largest such exercise in the world , as the country aims to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people against the coronavirus disease.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"BJP should help people get their vaccines,’’ he told the MPs this morning, according to three people who asked not to be named. “Why should we only set up help desks during elections. There are so many people who come without their I-card, who need some kind of help and so we should be there.’’“Even if you have to park their cars, or help the elderly get to the vaccination camps, do that,” the PM said at the meeting according to a second person, a BJP MP.Party president JP Nadda reiterated the message, the people said, and added that all state units should work to make the drive a success. He said that he units have already been instructed what to do. HT has reviewed a letter sent to all states by the party’s national general secretary, Arun Singh. It reads: “Party help desks to be set up at all vaccination centres in all mandals (divisions) for general awareness campaigns and help. Arrangements to be made for commuting of elderly and sick people to the vaccination sites and hospitals and drop them back.’’Arun Singh’s letter dated March 5 lists 12 ways in which party lawmakers and officials can help .According to the BJP MP cited above, Nadda, a former Union health minister recalled how PM Modi told him in early march last year that it would be a tough year on account of the pandemic (although cases in India didn’t really start climbing till April). ” At that time we hardly had any testing labs, but now we have 1000s, we have our own personal protection kits (PPEs); we have been able to tackle the pandemic successfully with Modiji’s vision.’’Both the vaccines administered in India are locally made -- one, Covishield is the Indian version of Astra Zeneca-Oxford’s vaccine, made by Serum Institute, and the other, Covaxin, has been locally developed by Bharat Biotech.Commenting on the meeting, inister of parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi said: “PM Modi said that all the MPs and party workers should help eligible people get COVID-19 vaccines including helping them reach the vaccination centres.’’“The Prime Minister is a statesman and he advised us to work in a non electoral role,’’ said MP Rakesh Sinha. ``In situations where people require our assistance and sympathy, PM’s concern is beyond political and guided by social concern during the vaccination drive.”The Prime Minister also had some tough words for those who’ve been irregular with their attendance in the house. ”You are here because of the people, the party has made you win, why do we always have to tell you to attend parliament? I don’t want to keep repeating this,’’ he said, according to a second BJP MP.The MPs, however, were told they would get a long weekend with Friday being off, along with Thursday, which is a holiday on account of Shivratri . “They gave us the list of bills that will be brought till March 25; the finance bill expected on the 19th. And the session may end by March 25,’’ said the first MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-centre-for-mps-gets-lukewarm-response-101615400549401.html
11-03-2021||India||Tirath Singh Rawat’s ability to take everyone along key factor for selection||When the assembly elections were held in Uttarakhand in 2017, Tirath Singh Rawat was not given a ticket despite being the president of the party in the state and a sitting legislator. He did not sulk or protest, and patiently waited till 2019, when he was awarded a Lok Sabha ticket from Garhwal. It is the sitting MP’s unflinching loyalty, and his ability to get along with different communities and factions, that has got him the top job in the state, according to several party insiders that HT spoke to.“Satpal Maharaj was given his seat in 2017 (from Chaubhattakhal),’’ said MLA Munna Chauhan, “But Tirath Singh ji maintained the discipline. Today he’s been rewarded with the CM’s post.”At the state MLAs’ meeting on Wednesday, also attended by the party’s members of Parliament from the state, outgoing CM Trivendra Singh Rawat proposed Tirath Singh Rawat’s name. It was supported by all the other CM aspirants, including Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank”.The ability to take every one along was a prerequisite for any new incumbent since the outgoing CM’s apparent lack of coordination with his party MLAs and his cabinet colleagues led to a virtual rebellion in the state, with senior leaders complaining that Trivendra Rawat never consulted them before taking major decisions.“The BJP in Uttarakhand has been known for factionalism. Every leader here has his own followers and their areas of strength. In their midst, the new CM is someone who is totally uncontroversial and very, very modest. He has time to sit and talk to all,’’ said a member of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), in which Tirath Singh Rawat served as national secretary and organising secretary before his political career took off.“I met him last month, and he sat with me for hours; he is very, very down to earth,’’ said the person quoted above.A second key factor supporting his candidacy was that while he is a Rajput, he is seen as someone who is acceptable to Brahmins. The Brahmin lobby in the state has been unhappy with Trivendra Rawat after he constituted the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board in January 2020 to manage all temples in the state.”From Brahmins managing these temples, it was handed over to bureaucrats. This decision by Trivendra Rawat deeply upset the community, ” said a third leader who asked not to be named. “They don’t have the same problem with Tirath Singh ji.”The new CM is also from Pauri Garhwal, where five out of nine chief ministers in the state have come from. “A few days ago, when CM Trivendra Rawat carved out a new division of Garsain out of the existing Kumaon and Garhwal regions, it led to an outcry all over social media from many who considered themselves Kumaonis or Garhwalis but were now part of Garsain. Hopefully, Tirath ji will change these orders,” the third leader said.It will be a challenging road ahead for Tirath Singh Rawat, with just a year to go for the assembly polls. Apart from handling some of the tricky problems cited above — the new board for temples, the new division of Garsain — he has to manage his own election from an assembly seat in the next six months, and then ensure a win in the MP by-election in his seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirath-singh-rawat-s-ability-to-take-everyone-along-key-factor-for-selection-101615399289368.html

11-03-2021||India||With 69% quota, Tamil Nadu hub of politico-legal battle on affirmative action||In the backdrop of the Supreme Court seeking the views of states to re-examine the 50% cap on reservation, all eyes are on Tamil Nadu—which is not only among the seven states that breach the cap by providing 69% reservation based on caste in public employment and educational institutions, but is a pioneer in the most expansive affirmative action programme in India. Both the major Dravidian parties—Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)—and their ideological parent body, the Dravida Kazhagam (DK), have fought for reservation as a measure of social justice. The reservation policy had been in operation since the 1920s, with late chief minister J Jayalalithaa playing an important role in providing legislative support to the 69% reservation in the 1990s. Also Read | Tamil Nadu: TTV Dhinakaran’s AMMK releases first list of candidatesIn 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that reservation cannot exceed 50% in Indra Sawhney versus Union of India, based on which the Madras high court directed the state to bring it down to 50% in the 1994-95 academic year. “There was a fear in Tamil Nadu that it will be affected by the Mandal commission which was challenged by Indra Sawhney (1992) case,” says retired justice of Madras high court K Chandru. In 1993, the assembly under Jayalalithaa passed the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993, now known as the Tamil Nadu Act, 1994 to keep its reservation limit intact at 69%. Jayalalithaa then led a delegation to Delhi and urged the central leadership, which resulted in the then President Shankar Dayal Sharma giving his assent to the Bill in a month. The late AIADMK leader and former CM also ensured a special legal protection by bringing the legislation under a constitutional amendment under the Ninth Schedule to ensure that its validity could not be challenged judicially (for violating Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution). However, the Supreme Court, in a case in 2007 (IR Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu), ruled that the court has power to review any legislation added to the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, and so the Tamil Nadu law that increased reservation to 69% is open to review. “The Supreme Court said the court has got the power of judicial review even to see whether the inclusion (of a law to the ninth schedule) is valid or not. By this time, several other states not only had OBC reservations but had exceeded the 50% cap,” says Chandru. The composition of the 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu is the following: Backward Caste (BC) are eligible for 30% reservation (26.5% + 3.5% internal reservation for Muslims). In the 1990s, BC Muslims were part of the BCs, but this was carved as a separate sub-category during DMK regime in 2007. Most Backward Caste (MBCs) are eligible for 20% reservations, broken down into 10.5% for Vanniyars, 7% for Denotified Communities (which constitute 28 castes) and 2.5% for others (41 castes). Scheduled Castes in the state have 18% reservations, and Scheduled Tribes one per cent, taking the total upto 69%. Under the existing 20% MBC quota, the AIADMK government, led by chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, announced on February 26 that the Vanniyar community will be allocated 10.5% internal reservation. This announcement came hours before the Election Commission announced poll dates for Tamil Nadu as the AIADMK was under pressure from its ally, the PMK, which has been demanding a separate quote for Vanniyars—their core vote bank for close to four decades. The PMK revived this demand in the run up to the assembly elections slated for April 6 but scaled it down settling for an internal reservation. Previous chief ministers hadn’t heeded the PMK’s demand. Palaniswami too says that the Bill was passed temporarily based on the Justice Janarthanan Committee (who was heading the backward classes commission until 2018) and that the reservation slab would be modified by the Justice A Kulasekaran Committee, appointed in December 2020 to collect quantifiable data on caste, communities and tribes. The last caste-based census was conducted in 1983.“This will open a Pandora’s Box, now every caste and community will start demanding a share for themselves,” says political commentator Sriram Seshadri. “It’s debatable whether this reservation will hold good in the eyes of the law as courts have rejected such reservations in the past.”Besides the political imperatives dictating the reservation policy, there is also legal uncertainty. The petitions challenging the Tamil Nadu law, on the grounds that open category students were at a disadvantage since reservation in admissions were being carried out in an increasing number of seats, have been long-pending in the Supreme Court “Every year, petitions are filed with respect to medical college admission that if the state follows the Indra Sawhney judgement, they (students) would have received a seat which was denied because of the 1993 law. Supreme Court, then, started passing curious orders to calculate the difference between the two caps—so each year, among whoever is left out, about 40-50 students would get admitted through interim orders. This went on for 19 years. Even before the Maratha reservation case, the Tamil Nadu case was there before the Supreme Court. There isn’t a scientific approach on deciding on what is important.” Seshadri says.The AIADMK says that the party will continue to fight for the 69% reservation to uphold the social justice fabric of the state. “[Former Tamil Nadu chief minister] MG Ramachandran had increased the state’s 50% reservation to 68% which Amma [Jayalalithaa] sealed at 69%. Legal challenges have been present and Tamil Nadu has been a forerunner in challenging it,” says AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan. The AIADMK’s ally, the BJP, at the Centre announced 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) in 2019 which the state has not accepted as a reservation policy. The state passed a resolution in the assembly that EWS certificates will be provided only for those applying to Central government and Central institutions. The DMK and DK challenged the EWS in court. “Economic status is fungible, that is if someone is a poor man tomorrow, he may become a millionaire and billionaire overnight. But this is not the case for socially and educationally backward people—their status cannot change overnight,” says advocate and DMK spokesperson A Saravanan. “This is the precise reason why we oppose EWS and we always stick to social and educational backwardness to be the criteria for determining or giving reservation. There is no need to re-examine Tamil Nadu’s current 69% reservation as one formula will not fit all. We have this formula based on the number of communities and how backward they are. This decision can’t be made from Delhi which is impinging on state autonomy.” DMK has also criticised the AIADMK for rushing the internal reservation for Vanniyars as an electoral move.“Reservation combined with several educational institutions being opened across the state by both DMK and AIADMK governments has ensured upward mobility and high social development indices in Tamil Nadu. This has helped produce first generation diploma holders and degree holders since the 1990s who are children of daily-wage workers,” says consultant and independent researcher in the social development sector Geetha Narayanan. “But we need more sociological research to understand who truly requires reservation as the creamy layer in various castes (the land-holders and power-holders) is repeatedly benefitted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-tamil-nadu-s-reservation-policy-101615315765316.html
11-03-2021||Today's||The hypocrisy of India’s secular polity||At a media conclave in 2018, Sonia Gandhi made a candid confession. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), she claimed, had managed to convince many people that the Congress is a “Muslim party”. Her remarks, in a sense, were an admission that Nehruvian secularism had failed to combat the rising tide of political Hindutva. Gandhi’s words also echoed the party’s AK Antony committee report, drafted in the aftermath of the 2014 poll debacle but never made public, that the Congress was seen as “pro-Muslim” and “anti-Hindu”. Three years later, the party’s predicament is even starker, with its secular identity once again being questioned for aligning with Muslim parties.In Kerala, the Congress’s long-standing alliance with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is under the scanner with both the ruling Left Front and the BJP targeting the party for being partial to the League’s interests. In Assam, the Congress has tied up with businessman-politician Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), a party representing the concerns of the state’s Bengali-speaking Muslim immigrant population. And in West Bengal, the Congress is part of a Left-led alliance that includes the Indian Secular Front (ISF), a party started by Abbas Siddiqui, a cleric, whose public utterances are contentious. In each instance, the BJP has unsurprisingly been flagging these alliances to consolidate its Hindu votebank.The nature of these alliances and the reaction to them reflect the deepening crisis within the Congress and, indeed, within mainstream secular politics. For the Congress, this is a crisis that has been building up for decades, ever since Indira Gandhi inserted “secularism” in the Preamble in 1976. Her move was driven by realpolitik, designed to consolidate her hold among the minorities while cornering her political rivals. Unlike Jawaharlal Nehru, for whom secularism was an article of faith, Indira Gandhi was guilty of practicing lip-service secularism, especially after returning to power in 1980. Then be it in Punjab, Assam or Jammu and Kashmir, she appeared to shun the pretence of secularism in the race for votes by aligning with religious forces of all hues.Rajiv Gandhi, as prime minister (PM), put further strain on secular values by appeasing both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists. The politics of running with the secular hare and hunting with the communal hound through the turbulent 1980s would culminate in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and propel the BJP into a position of power.Since then, while the saffron brotherhood has gone from strength-to-strength, the Congress has struggled to find a consistent ideological and organisational response to the challenge posed by strident Hindutva nationalism. The party has oscillated between a Manmohan Singh as PM affirming that minorities, particularly Muslims, have the “first claim” on government resources to a Rahul Gandhi going temple-hopping ahead of a Gujarat election and the party asserting that he is a “janeudhari” Hindu. As a result, the centrist secular space that rejects religion as a marker of political identity has over time been hollowed out.The Congress now finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place. Appealing to any kind of Hindu sentiment only leaves it looking like a “B team” of the BJP, an unconvincing copy of the original party of majoritarianism. The shortlived Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh attempted this with its version of cow politics but with little resonance on the ground. On the other hand, forging alliances with smaller, Muslim-centric parties also appears like a temporary fix for uncertain electoral gains. For example, in Assam’s surcharged post-Citizenship (Amendment) Act politics, the Congress-AIUDF alliance may sweep the Muslim-dominated seats of lower Assam but will inevitably spark off a counter-polarisation in the rest of the state. In a sharply divided Bengal, a tie-up with the ISF is not only ideologically incompatible but will only further split the Muslim vote between Mamata Banerjee and the Left-Congress-ISF alliance, thereby improving the BJP’s chances. Ironically, the Left, which attacks the Congress in Kerala for its IUML partnership, has had few compunctions in pushing for an alliance with an Islamist party in Bengal — it is these underlying hypocrisies in the secular project that have weakened it morally and politically.Sadly, the worst sufferers in the credibility crisis facing mainstream secularism have been the minorities. Isolated and demonised by the Hindutva brigade, their patriotism routinely called into question, the Rightward lurch in Indian politics has only made Muslims feel fearful and resentful. Their anxieties and grievances with secular politics have seen many younger Muslims turn to the likes of Asaduddin Owaisi as potential protectors and defenders of the faith. In the recent Gujarat local body polls, for example, Owaisi’s party, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) won seven of the eight seats it contested in Godhra and emerged as the main Opposition party in Modasa town. Most of these seats were previously won by the Congress. Clearly, even Muslim voters are looking for alternatives that go beyond clichéd and bogus definitions of secularism.Post-script: The BJP has attacked the Congress’s secular vision for aligning with an Islamic cleric in Bengal. However, the party happily advertises the fact that India’s most-populous state is run by a saffron-robed Hindu head priest affiliated to a religious monastery. Or are the rules in votebank politics different for different people?

11-03-2021||Today's||China’s hydro hegemony is overstated. But India needs a plan||China is planning to harness the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, or the Brahmaputra, as it is known in India. Many of these planned water-related projects, under China’s new five-year plan (2021-2025), will be built disconcertingly close to India’s border. China’s overdrive on transboundary rivers has strategic content, underpinned not only by its low-carbon energy economic growth, but also fashioned by the desire to use international rivers as instruments of politico-diplomatic leverage. As an upstream country, China shares more than 50 major international watercourses with 14 downstream neighbours. The volume of water flowing out of China to other countries is about 730 bcm (billion cubic meters), which is 30 times the volume flowing into China. This, undoubtedly, is a strategic asset. The Chinese leadership, while harnessing the rivers, has, as and when required, used them for coercion and compliance, or what the Marxist political philosopher Antonio Gramsci termed as “a mix of force and consent”. It is not uncommon to hear China as a “hydro-hegemon”.China has a legacy of controlling rivers and a history of hydraulic engineering. When Mao Tse-tung established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, he issued directives to harness rivers and viewed Tibet as a water-tower. As Mao set about transforming China into a modern industrialised socialist State, he would often say, “Nature is an enemy that had to be beaten”. Rivers, as Mao realised, symbolised political supremacy. Today, China has a powerful hydraulic bureaucracy, with large investments in the hydropower sector, mega dams, and water diversion projects.Despite India being a lower riparian State on the Brahmaputra, it is not completely in a disadvantageous situation. Since 56% of the Yarlung Tsangpo/Brahmaputra flows in Chinese territory, one can be easily mistaken into believing that China controls a large share of the water. However, the Yarlung Tsangpo/Brahmaputra’s volumetric is not proportional to its length inside China.The Yarlung Tsangpo is a trans-Himalayan river where the annual precipitation, as studies reveal, averages about 300 mm. Once it crosses the Himalayan crestline, the annual rainfall is about 2,000-2,100 mm. This means that when the Yarlung Tsangpo reaches India, it swells because of the monsoon rain and also the contribution of the tributaries such as the Luhit, Dibang and Siang/Dihang. Data suggest that both during the lean and peak flow, the total annual outflow of the Yarlung Tsangpo from China is less than that from the Brahmaputra. This means that India has ample water on its side to harness.India needs to have more water development footprints in the Northeast, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. To enhance economic growth in the region, it needs to build water storages and, thereby, exert prior downstream riparian appropriation rights. India’s water storage capacity is less than 250 bcm – pitiable as compared to China. It must also not be forgotten that China’s claim to the Arunachal Pradesh territory (South Tibet) is also a claim to the vast amount of water flowing in the area. However, hydro projects in Arunachal Pradesh have to be framed in a consultative manner with wider stakeholder and inter-provincial participation in the Northeast, particularly with Assam, which is downstream to Arunachal Pradesh to avoid inter-state water conflicts.Equally significant are the potential waterways and navigation in the Northeast. With the National Democratic Alliance government’s investment in inland waterways, the Brahmaputra National Waterway 2 will act as a critical economic corridor with direct access to the Chittagong Port in Bangladesh and the Haldia Port in West Bengal and boost trade with Southeast Asian countries.China’s upstream position is a reality, but its dominance on the Brahmaputra is overstated. It’s time to de-emphasise China’s hydro-hegemony. Pursuing a more meaningful water dialogue on hydrological data-sharing is essential, but India would require building a lower riparian coalition with Bhutan and Bangladesh on the Brahmaputra.

11-03-2021||Today's||Instituting accountability on the Internet||The internet grew in the last three decades as a global, open network connecting people, enabling the exchange of ideas. But, in recent years, it has morphed into something very different. The internet is increasingly being carved up and dominated by platforms, aka intermediaries that, in turn, wield tremendous influence and power over what a netizen consumes.In India, these internet players are regulated by the Information Technology (IT) Act. It was pushed, in its current form, by the United Progressive Alliance government in 2008 — and provides, through Section 79, a safe harbour for these intermediaries. This means they have little or no responsibility for the content and material they carry — a provision that has been brazenly misused to escape accountability.For decades, their influence and power have grown unchallenged, even as they have distanced themselves from the regulatory rules and laws that real life publishers/content creators have to comply with and operate under. Remember, all non-digital media and content creators have significant regulations and rules to comply with.For all its power to do good, these intermediaries, operating in this type of rule-less environment, have exercised power — for years hidden, but now out in full view — to shape/distort narratives and, therefore, incite public opinion and behaviour sans accountability. When used by bad people, this becomes a dangerous force multiplier to create violence, hate and divisions — with no corresponding accountability and compliance requirements under any law.The debate around the growing power of these unregulated “platforms” and the need for some rules has waxed and waned. After every period marked by critical commentary, people and governments have tended to move on, allowing consolidation of power and lack of regulation to continue uninterrupted.The lack of accountability of platforms, combined with non-traceability of illegalities, poses huge risks to a democracy because of the ability to violate offline laws in the online world without fear or consequence. This also represents an unprecedented power in the history of mankind — a person sitting somewhere in Silicon Valley has the power to amplify/mute a person far away or allow inciteful or illegal content to continue, without being accountable to any law in the jurisdiction where this content is being consumed or consumer being impacted.Our Constitution has defined free speech under Article 19 and the limits that can be put on that right to free speech in Article 19(2). The principle that all platforms should normally abide by, therefore, is simple — any content or speech on a platform can be taken down if it meets the test of 19(2) and that alone. India has a surfeit of laws to protect the individual and the State — both in the real world and in the online world. However, specifically vis-à-vis the internet, the laws and regulations are a mix of old, inflexible and static. Consumers have very little protection against digital platforms when many use so-called “guidelines” and “algorithms” to decide to mute or amplify content on totally non-transparent terms — repeatedly violating Article 19’s guarantee to free speech. All social media platform takedown “policies”, “community guidelines” or “algorithms” must be compliant with, and not go beyond, Article 19(2) exceptions. And this standard must be equitably applied to all, as per Article 14. But none of this is followed by these platforms.India is the largest connected nation in the world, and under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has made huge strides in Digital India. It is fitting that India leads the way in addressing these challenges with the new intermediary guidelines. These guidelines harmonise offline and online rules. The same type of accountability and rules that applies to a broadcast TV platform will apply to digital platforms. It permits transparent self-regulation to evolve, and it also permits the continuation of the safe harbour under Section 79 as long as the platform exercises due diligence on its users — implying that platforms have to take responsibility for traceability in the event of inciteful and/or illegal content. To ensure that the costs of compliance don’t become a burden on start-ups and smaller enterprises, the guidelines specify a higher threshold of compliance for Significant Social Media Intermediaries. But most importantly, it establishes an important principle in this debate of regulating tech — the principle of accountability to the consumers and communities they serve — by ensuring that consumer redressals are an obligation of these platforms and are not evaded.These new rules are the right way forward and will continue to evolve. The values of a free and open internet, consumer rights and, at the same time, accountability of platforms are all being met with this contemporary regulatory regime — that will continue to evolve. India has signalled that it will harness the good of the internet effectively to fuel its rise. At the same time, it is proceeding to evolve a culture of accountability that ensures that the internet never becomes a safe haven for those who seek to misuse it.Rajeev Chandrashekhar is a BJP MP, national spokesperson of the party and a member of JPC on data protection bill The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/instituting-accountability-on-the-internet-101615464757496.html
11-03-2021||Today's||How we the people are responsible for the spread of the virus||The virus has moved in Delhi from “pandemic” to “endemic”, says Delhi’s health minister. And I have heard a senior virologist say exactly that about the country. They may well be right. But what matters is that the virus is still very much around, and we are as responsible for it being so as the virus itself is.We?Yes, we. And that includes just about everyone except health workers who have been given but a small token of our appreciation by being made the first to be vaccinated. And even there, we want them to be protected because we want them to continue to protect us.And the ‘we’ starts with our political class. As they bared their upper arms for the jabs before cameras, did all our leaders wear masks? Alas, not all of them. Our vice-president, M Venkaiah Naidu, and external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, did.They wore masks, correctly, admirably, over mouth and nose as the needle went in. And they sent two clear messages across — wear masks, get vaccinated. There may well have been others like them who did. But not all our other leaders did so. It is not as if the nation would have failed to recognise them, masked. And why could the officials on duty not have whispered just two words to them, “Sir, mask…”And now, with elections, leaders are going to be needed to campaign. They will need crowds. Where does social distancing go? A great responsibility rests on leaders and their compliance to health protocols during elections. But our leaders are only what we or the majority of us are. Put differently, what we are, our leaders are.And what are “we” doing?We have to but step outdoors to see us as we always are — mixing, milling about in clusters and crowds, holding hands, eating, chewing, spitting, with the gentlemen among us secure in the belief that incontinence is integral to the Indian male’s vested rights. All this, let us recognise, is not a class matter. The well-to-do in malls and cinema houses galumph around like elephants in musth, maskless, careless, shameless. Travelling by air, the “business class” is no model of compliance. Small wonder that the virus thrives.Can the authorities who are serious about supporting the vaccination roll-out with a compliance roll-in, consider three urgent suggestions?First, about masks. Let the non-wearing of masks be visited with condign fines on the spot. This is not difficult to do in places of public concourse, on trains, in buses, in cinema houses, shopping plazas, with a “virus police” on duty. Mumbai has started, late, perhaps, but it has. Other cities must follow suit.Second, about elections. Let the vaccination drive be opened immediately to all registered voters in poll-bound regions straightaway, irrespective of the age and co-morbidity criteria. And let no political campaigner do any campaigning, whether as a speaker at rallies or otherwise, unvaccinated. And let all poll personnel, including security forces, report for duty only after being vaccinated.Third, about farmers. The spike in parts of north India, including Punjab, may be because of many reasons, pandemic, endemic or other. But common sense tells us that the prolonged farm protests, with groups of protesters moving back and forth from their villages to the rallies, are both at risk and unwittingly, innocently, risk-enlarging.As a health measure first and last, let the government announce the revocation of the three farm bills and a reconsideration of their provisions by the Inter-State Council (ISC) with farm leaders being heard at it, after the majority of the nation has been vaccinated and the number of new cases has been brought down to, and kept at, negligible figures. And let farm leaders agree to this arrangement, disband the protest, again as a gesture to health concerns, for a later engagement on the contentious issues at the ISC in a post-Covid-19 situation.If these steps are taken, the virus can be more swiftly brought under control. If they are not taken, the vaccines and their amazing creators and disseminators would have been weakened by us.Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-we-the-people-are-responsible-for-the-spread-of-the-virus-101615382132374.html
11-03-2021||Today's||In Kabul, a strategic defeat for the US||The elaborate United States (US) draft “Afghanistan peace agreement”, and its impatient letter to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, once again reveal the strategic defeat of the US in a country that has been “the graveyard of empires”. America’s new desire to shift the onus of resolving the Afghan mess from its shoulders alone to a group of countries, including India, only starkly profiles its Afghan failure. The Joe Biden administration will doubtless justify this collective approach as part of its commitment to multilateralism to address international issues. This does not, however, disguise its ongoing desperation to extricate itself from a 20-year-long morass of its own making.The three-part draft containing ideas for a new constitution, the establishment of an interim government — called “the Peace Government” to take the global mind away from the wheel turning full circle two decades after the Bonn agreement set up an interim administration — and principles for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire are hardly realistic in many crucial elements. It claims to represent “a variety of ideas and priorities of Afghans on both sides of the conflict”, but reflects US concerns and aspirations for Afghanistan in their very selection and enumeration. In the absence of corroborative evidence, it is difficult to visualise how the Taliban and the Kabul authorities will take a giant leap of faith for peace, with the former abandoning fundamental sources of strength and the latter their current political offices.The Taliban’s strength is derived from the success of its armed cadres. Aided by Pakistan, the Taliban first demonstrated that the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces could not crush it. This also meant that NATO could not prevent the spread of Taliban influence and, in many cases, control of a significant portion of Afghan territory.A principal reason for Taliban’s strength lay in its bases in Pakistan which, because of the US policy of self-denial, remained protected. Later, as US forces withdrew, armed Taliban elements kept the Afghan security forces under pressure, preventing the Afghan government from achieving stability. Will the Taliban, now, agree to the imposition of crippling conditions, including abandoning its foreign (read Pakistani) bases, draining the effectiveness of its armed cadres?This question is all the more pertinent if it is put in the context of the US proposal that the constitution of the Afghan Republic is to be “the initial template from which the future Constitution will be prepared”. Many Taliban leaders may construe this as a way of the international community seeking to pressure them ab initio in abandoning the founding principles of the Islamic Emirate. Will the lure of becoming full participants in the Peace Government be sufficient to make many in the Taliban senior leadership consider pulling up their roots?The president of the Peace Government is to be decided by the “two parties”. Let alone the Taliban, it is most unlikely that even the Kabul political elite will accept Ghani in that office. Thus, the US letter to Ghani virtually asks him and his administration to do the honourable deed of falling on their swords for Afghanistan’s future. Ghani and his colleagues have given no indication of a desire to do so, despite the caution that if US troops withdraw by May, the Taliban will irresistibly gain ground. Vice-President Amrullah Saleh is certainly not the kind of person who will fold up — his courage and ghairat (honour) will never allow that. The fate of the US advice on them is, therefore, uncertain even if Abdullah Abdullah, former president Hamid Karzai and professor Abdul Rasul Sayyaf encourage them to accept the inevitability of an interim government.These imponderables are largely intra-Afghan. In addition, there are others which stem from the proposed group of countries — Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, India and the US — to “discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan”. The US wants the United Nations (UN) to convene a meeting of this group believing that these countries “share an abiding common interest in a stable Afghanistan and must work together if we are to succeed”. Iran’s inclusion is because of Biden accepting the reality of the positive or negative role it can play in Afghanistan; Russia, China and Pakistan will welcome Iran. Reports indicate that India’s inclusion was resisted by China and Pakistan, with even Russia conceding only India’s “eventual deeper involvement in dedicated dialogue formats”. Is the group’s membership now a closed issue or will Russia demand the inclusion of Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbours apart from Saudi Arabia?India is the only country of the group of six that has stubbornly and rigidly avoided formally and openly accepting the Taliban. Can it continue to do so any longer? Over the past few months, India demonstrated that it counted with the Kabul elite even while it stressed its continuing support to the Ghani administration. The larger strategic aspects of the India-US relationship and India’s utility to help move sections of the Kabul elite in a direction which the US would want is responsible for its inclusion. But India’s justified satisfaction over this development cannot mean that it should continue to turn its back on the Taliban, despite the unsavouriness of its ideological positions and the violence it perpetrates. It should use the opening provided by this US initiative to urgently invite a Taliban delegation and convey its positions on Afghanistan and the region directly to it.Vivek Katju is a retired diplomat who headed the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division in the ministry of external affairs for six years and served as ambassador to AfghanistanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-kabul-a-strategic-defeat-for-the-us-101615382130157.html
11-03-2021||Editorials||Wooing the Hindu vote||In West Bengal, chief minister (CM) Mamata Banerjee declared she was born in a Hindu family, recited from Hindu scriptures, and warned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not to play the “Hindu card” with her. The card, one assumes, refers to the BJP’s effort to often portray itself as the defender of majority interests, and its rivals as somewhat insensitive to Hindus while being closer to Muslims. As a Hindustan Times data-based analysis showed, Ms Banerjee’s efforts at countering possible political polarisation on religious lines did not stop at the level of rhetoric. There has been a dip in the number of Muslim candidates the Trinamool Congress has put up in the elections — from 54 in the 2016 polls to 45 in 2021, with the biggest fall in south Bengal where the BJP is hoping to make substantial inroads. Not putting up a Muslim candidate, by this logic, prevents the BJP from turning the election into an “H-M”, Hindu-Muslim contest. In Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal, on Wednesday, said his government’s ideal was “Ram rajya” — and enunciated a set of governance principles under the framework of what Ram rajya would constitute. In addition, he declared that his government would facilitate the pilgrimage of the city’s elderly to the Ram temple in Ayodhya once it is constructed. Mr Kejriwal has, for at least three years now, been carefully portraying himself as a Hindu leader — advertising his devotion to Hanuman, staying away from potentially polarising issues such as the Shaheen Bagh agitation and organising pujas under state government auspices, among other steps. Ms Banerjee and Mr Kejriwal represent strong regional challengers to the BJP. And their position today is a reflection of how far the BJP has moved the needle of Indian politics. If secular politics, in the past, was electorally equated with being seen as sensitive to Muslim aspirations, secular politicians, today, are investing all their energy in both, not being seen as pro-Muslim, and being seen as adequately sensitive to Hindu sentiments. The Congress has attempted to do this too, most recently seen in the Rajasthan government’s decision to legalise mining to supply stones to the Ram temple construction. What this, however, indicates is that even if the Opposition is able to defeat the BJP electorally and politically, the BJP’s ideological dominance is only getting reinforced. This will have implications for representative democracy and inter-community ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/wooing-the-hindu-vote-101615464273961.html
11-03-2021||Editorials||An expansive fiscal programme in the US||In the United States (US), the Congress has passed a $1.9-trillion stimulus package, shepherded by the Joe Biden administration, to aid citizens, especially among low-income and poorer segments, in times of the economic distress caused by Covid-19. The pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to lives and livelihoods, and was among the key reasons why Donald Trump lost the presidential election. The package — which was a key electoral plank of Mr Biden — includes direct income assistance; extension of unemployment benefits; financial support for expedited vaccination; relief for schools; support for infrastructure; and tax credits for children, among other steps. The package is extraordinary for its scale, and is in line with a central Keynesian principle — enhanced public spending will spur demand and have a multiplier effect. And it is the kind of scheme that other countries — if they had the resources available to the US and a more inclusive economic imagination — should consider. It is also correct in identifying vaccination as the key vehicle, which can lead to economic recovery. At the same time, the package will possibly have inflationary consequences, not just for the US but globally in terms of commodity prices as the US economy bounces back. If there is domestic inflation, expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, which, in turn, as a piece in this newspaper warned on March 1, can result in capital from advanced countries returning home. This is, to be sure, a medium-term, rather than an immediate, concern. But Indian policymakers would do well to keep a close eye on the impact of the package on the US economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/an-expansive-fiscal-programme-in-the-us-101615464213889.html
11-03-2021||Editorials||Why India must protect the Aravallis | HT Editorial||Last week, the Haryana government approached the Supreme Court (SC) to seek approval to begin mining in the Aravallis in Gurugram and Faridabad. In its petition, Haryana said the ban on mining was forcing the state to pay extra for sourcing minerals from adjoining states, and this higher cost was also affecting public projects. It also contended that opening up mining would help address unemployment. In 2009, the SC imposed a ban on mining in the Aravalli hills in Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat till statutory provisions for restoration and reclamation were complied with.There has been civil society resistance against opening up the region for mining because the Aravalli is the National Capital Region’s critical water recharge zone, climate regulator, wildlife habitat and barrier against desertification. Haryana has the lowest forest cover in India (3.62%), and most of this is concentrated in the Aravalli hills in south Haryana. Allowing mining in the little forest cover remaining will lead to a deep environmental impact.All Aravalli range states — Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi — are responsible for its destruction. While economic growth is important for improving the lives and livelihoods of citizens, governments must understand that unsustainable development may lead to short-term gains, but will spell disaster for citizens, the economy and the country in the long-term. In fact, Covid-19, which Haryana uses as a rationale to lobby for reopening mining, has shown how deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, and mismanaged urban growth can create a fertile ground for pandemics. India’s states must choose their development path wisely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-india-must-protect-the-aravallis-hteditorial-101615382134010.html
11-03-2021||Editorials||The switch in Dehradun | HT Editorial||In 2000, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government took a major political decision to create three new states — Uttarakhand was carved out from Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh, and Jharkhand from Bihar. Among the three, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand have been plagued by political instability for much of their political existence as separate units. Jharkhand has seen 11 chief ministers (with the same individual returning to office multiple times in the case of Shibu Soren, Arjun Munda and Hemant Soren), and the last Raghubar Das government was the first to complete its five-year term. Uttarakhand has had 11 chief ministers (with BC Khanduri and Harish Rawat returning to office), and only one of them (ND Tiwari) had a full five-year term. It is in this backdrop of larger instability, both due to intra-party and inter-party issues, in some of India’s younger, smaller states, that Uttarakhand will now have a new chief minister, Tirath Singh Rawat.But Mr Rawat’s ascension, a result of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership asking Trivendra Singh Rawat to put in his papers after internal discontent, cannot just be explained as yet another instance of the political churn in states which are still in the process of institutionalising their party systems and political culture. It is significant, for it says something about the BJP. Under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the party’s track record suggests that once the central leadership selects a leader as CM, the BJP stays the course. Be it Manohar Lal Khattar or Yogi Adityanath or Raghubar Das or Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP did not let external criticism dictate a shift in the leader. In the current case though, the BJP leadership gave in — primarily because the criticism against Trivendra Singh Rawat was emanating from within BJP’s own legislative ranks and from the larger ideological fraternity. The fact that elections are due next year added to the sense of urgency.The episode also throws up an interesting facet of political leadership in democracies — the criticism against the outgoing CM was that he relied excessively on bureaucrats and ignored political inputs. In some ways, this is good, for it insulates the administration from day-to-day political pressures brought on by legislators. But political voices can’t be ignored either in a democracy. This is the balance a successful politician-administrator has to strike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-switch-in-dehradun-hteditorial-101615382131270.html
