27-03-2021||Delhi||Satyendar Jain takes stock of cleaning of 600 water bodies in city||Delhi water minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday chaired a meeting to take a stock of 600 water bodies and lakes in the city that need to be cleaned. The minister directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to clean at least 200 of these water bodies before the advent of monsoon this year. “He (Jain) directed the DJB officials that priority should be given to cleaning of all water bodies and lakes. The arrangement for treated water, however, should go on simultaneously. Officials were further directed by the minister to complete the work within the given time frame,” read a statement issued by the Delhi government about the meeting. It further said, “The source of water is being arranged either through the construction of decentralised STP (sewage treatment plant) or laying conveyance line from existing STP. The minister opined that rainwater can also be collected in the water bodies and lakes provided that they are clean.” Reviewing individual projects of lake revival, Jain directed that for the desired quantity of water — 10-12 MGD (million gallons per day) — to the Paschim Vihar lake area, a dedicated pipeline should be laid from Keshopur STP to Paschim Vihar lake. DJB officials in the meeting committed that all the pending work will be completed in six months and informed that treated water from Keshopur STP will be used for groundwater recharge in 200 acres of green area across Najafgarh drain. “The minister directed that DJB should complete the Najafgarh lake rejuvenation project and develop it as a polishing pond to improve the incoming 5 MGD of water from Najafgarh STP, using natural wetlands and aeration to BOD (biological oxygen demand; a metric for water pollution) 3 mg/L. Sludge generated from this STP will be used in Pappankala STP, where the surplus capacity of treatment is available. This will result in a saving of ₹ 30 crore of the DJB,” the minutes read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/satyendar-jain-takes-stock-of-cleaning-of-600-water-bodies-in-city-101616868519040.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Mercury jumps to 40.9°C in Mumbai, temperature to dip from Monday||The maximum temperature in the city, as per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station in Santacruz, touched a season high of 40.9 degrees Celsius on Saturday. This is 7.7 degrees Celsius above normal and up from 38.2 degrees recorded the day before. IMD, which had issued a yellow alert on Thursday, warning of heatwave conditions along the Konkan coast, said that temperatures are expected to remain high for at least the next 24 hours.“Heatwave conditions are due to hot and dry winds blowing from the north and northeast of the city, passing over Rajasthan. Starting Monday, when sea breezes will begin setting in at earlier hours of the day, the temperature will drop and remain between 35 to 37 degrees Celsius till the first week of April. After that we will see temperatures rise again,” said an official from IMD’s Mumbai centre.Saturday’s maximum reading also marked Mumbai’s third-highest March reading over the past 10 years. The highest maximum temperature ever recorded in the city (in March) was 41.7 degrees Celsius on March 28, 1957. Such high readings (above 40 degrees Celsius) have been recorded in March on five other occasions in the past 10 years — in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2020.A similar jump in mercury was also seen at the IMD’s Colaba observatory, where the maximum temperature touched 38 degrees Celsius on Saturday, up from 35.7 degrees Celsius on Friday. IMD Mumbai defines a heat wave for the area when the maximum temperature remains at least 4.5 degrees above normal (with a recorded reading of at least 37 degrees Celsius). If both the IMD’s weather stations in Colaba and Mumbai simultaneously record such high temperatures for a period of 48 hours, a heat wave is declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mercury-jumps-to-40-9-c-in-mumbai-temperature-to-dip-from-monday-101616868461141.html

The DVR is assumed to be a crucial evidence in the investigation into the Antilia explosives case, as prime accused Sachin Vaze had reportedly frequented the commissioner’s office during the case, the party said.The Congress also questioned why the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been investigating the case, has not summoned Singh yet for the probe, as the key accused and the vehicles seized were from his office. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, in a press conference on Saturday, asked if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not want Singh to be questioned.Sawant said that the DVR obtained by the Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) during its probe in the Antilia explosive scare was taken back by Singh, hours after its seizure. “ATS had obtained the DVR on March 10, but Singh office called ATS chief Jai Jeet Singh and directed him to return the electronic evidence as the images were unclear. But it has gone missing since then. The records are very crucial to establish the movements of officers like Vaze and others who are accused in the case. Also, the movements of the vehicles used in the explosive scare are reportedly seen in the CCTV footage of the DVR. It needs to be investigated as to who is behind the disappearance of the DVR. If NIA fails to investigate, the state government should do it,” he said.Sawant also claimed that while NIA has booked Vaze in the case under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), it is “surprising” that the central agency has not reached to the officers who are likely to be at the helm of the conspiracy. “Apart from Vaze, two other assistant police inspectors and two drivers who have been questioned by NIA are from Singh’s office. Despite this, their boss [Singh] is not questioned by NIA. Surprisingly, the BJP, which had sought Singh’s suspension last year under Article 311 of the Constitution in the Arnab Goswami case, is now backing him. The BJP has been diverting the attention of the people from the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran death cases by raising the issues in the Rashmi Shukla case and the letter by Singh,” Sawant alleged.Singh did not respond to calls and messages, seeking his response on Sawant’s comments, while leader of Opposition and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis rubbished the Congress leader’s claims. “The CCTV footage/ DVR is always available with the source server with a backup data. The servers are in the possession of the concessioner of CCTV surveillance network in the city. The mirror images of the footage are always available with the authorities. The ruling party leaders who are Vaze’s real patrons are now scared as the investigation by NIA will unearth the truth,” the former CM said in Nagpur. He also said the ruling party leaders are scared about the police transfer scam, after he demanded an inquiry by a central agency in the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-why-has-ex-mumbai-top-cop-not-been-quizzed-yet-asks-congress-101616868459142.html

Justice Bobde, who was in Goa as the chief guest to inaugurate a new high court complex, requested Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who was also in attendance, to expedite his pending proposal for a new building in Mumbai. “Bombay also needs a new building. The Bombay building was constructed for seven judges. It is now housing more than 40. It is impossible and there is a proposal pending with the government. Mr Law Minister, I would request you to expedite it,” Justice Bobde said. The Bombay HC is presently housed in a heritage structure that was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 2018. The work on the present building of the HC was commenced in April 1871 and completed in November 1878. It was designed by British engineer Col. James A Fuller, part of The Victorian and Art Deco Ensemble of Mumbai. In 2016, it was announced that the premises of the Bombay HC would be shifted to Bandra-Kurla Complex. Justice Bobde also said that discussions concerning the improvement of judicial infrastructure should go beyond just buildings and spaces. “Discussions on infrastructure have been largely quantitative, that is on building more courtrooms. Though building more courtrooms is necessary and important, there was very little emphasis on modernising existing courtrooms. In this regard, though the pandemic has posed a lot of problems to access to justice, it has paved the way for modernising the courtroom,” Justice Bobde said.“I see a trend of having smaller courtrooms in the future because of Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad’s ministry. The e-filing and data which can be contained is going to take away the need for many storage rooms and many rooms which are necessary for storing paper. The Supreme Court (SC) has done its bit on issues of court infrastructure. It has devised benchmarks and frameworks for minimum standards,” he added. According to the law ministry, 8.2 million cases were heard through video conferencing. The SC heard 59,309 cases, Hcs heard 2,758,560 cases and subordinate courts heard 5,446,876 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-in-urgent-need-of-new-building-cji-sa-bobde-to-law-minister-101616867259049.html

27-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 40 hours later, fire at Bhandup mall housing hospital doused||Close to 40 hours after a fire broke out on Thursday night at Dreams Mall in Bhandup, killing nine Covid-19 patients admitted in Sunrise Hospital inside the building, it was extinguished around 3.30pm on Saturday. According to the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB), the operations went for as long as there were a lot of shops inside the mall delaying cooling operations.According to MFB officials, several retail shops inside the malls had goods stored, affecting firefighting operations. There were several small offices of companies in the service sector. A MFB official said, “Although firefighting went on for 40 hours, operations were easier when compared to the blaze at City Centre Mall last year. Then, the operations went on for 56 hours where mobile phones and batteries led to constant fires at isolated spots.”The MFB official added, “In case of Dreams Mall, the fire was covered from all sides by Friday night, but still we had smoke and due to which we were undertaking cooling operations since Friday night. The cooling operations will still be undergoing, and we will also start investigations simultaneously.” The MFB also maintained that the firefighting equipment inside the mall were not functional. The MFB had also issued a notice to the mall for non-compliance of fire safety violations in November 2020. On Thursday night around 11.45pm, a level-four fire was reported at the ground-plus-three Dreams Mall in which nine patients lost their lives at Sunrise Hospital on the third floor of the mall. Six out of the nine patients were on ventilator and they lost their lives during the transit. Overall, 78 patients were at the hospital at the time of the incident. Two patients had already lost their lives before the fire.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal late on Friday ordered an inquiry into the incident, to be conducted by the disaster management cell of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The scope of the Inquiry will be to ascertain the cause of the fire jointly with the fire brigade, fix responsibility on the official in case of illegality found in the structure, followed by investigating whether all permissions were in place. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar, while speaking to reporters on Saturday, said, “An inquiry has been ordered into the unfortunate incident. The report is expected to be out in the next 15 days, and until that the Mumbai Police has assured appropriate action.”The Sunrise Hospital in a statement on Saturday said, “The Dreams Mall has been managed by court appointed administrator since 2018 by as per National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) court order. The mall was under NCLT and the court appointed administrator was ordered to look after the operations. All the operations at the mall and the licenses of the mall are the responsibility of the court appointed administrator. All the hospital permissions and licenses were taken and are in order and have nothing to do with the mall compliances. We wish to clarify that dreams mall is being run by mall administrator and the original owners of the mall Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan were nowhere involved in the management of this mall since 2018.”Amid the firefighting operations, shop owners on Saturday protested outside the Dreams Mall demanding compensation from the authorities for the damage. Imtiaz Nakhwa, a shopkeeper, said, “The shopkeepers are demanding compensation for the damage caused to our property. The authorities have given compensation for the Covid-19 patients, but nothing for the shop owners.”Meanwhile, on the other hand, several bank account holders of Indian Overseas Bank located inside the mall are in distress due to the fire. Ajay Tembhekar, regional manager of Indian Overseas Bank, said, “The fire has not impacted the bank or the lockers inside the bank’s branch. We would like to ensure our customers that they will be able to access their lockers and bank accounts once we are able to operate the branch in the coming two to three days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-40-hours-later-fire-at-bhandup-mall-housing-hospital-doused-101616866779000.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC warns dissenting minority trying to stall redevelopment of societies||Observing that dissenting members have no separate identity from that of their cooperative housing society and they cannot oppose society’s decisions taken in properly convened meetings, the Bombay high court (HC) last week issued a stern warning to dissenting minority members who try to stall redevelopment of their society by refusing to vacate their respective tenements.The court was hearing an arbitration petition filed by Westin Sankalp Developers for eviction of two dissenting members of Kandivli’s Basant Bahar Cooperative Housing Society who were opposed to redevelopment of the society’s property.Noting that most often dissenting minority members rake up frivolous grounds to oppose and stall redevelopment of their societies, single-judge bench of justice Gautam Patel said “every such untenable and unsustainable objection by a dissenting member is a colossal waste of judicial time.”The bench warned that “the next such matter will receive, first, an order of immediate eviction of the dissenting member (i.e., vacating that very day, or at best the next), and, second, an appropriately severe order of costs.”HC clarified that cost will be imposed on dissenting members “keeping in mind the costs incurred by the society, the loss to other society members, and the actual loss suffered by the developer on account of the delay occasioned by such members.”The developer complained that though they have spent considerable amounts on getting redevelopment plans sanctioned and acquiring transferable development rights from the market, the work was stalked as two of the 14 members of the society were opposed to the work and had refused to vacate their respective tenements.The dissenting members, on the other hand, maintained that they were not a party to the development agreement signed by the society with the developer and therefore the developer could not have involved the arbitration clause of the agreement against them.The argument, however, failed to impress upon justice Patel. The single-judge bench rejected the argument observing that the law on the point is very well settled - individual members of a society do not have a separate identity and their identity is subsumed and merged into that of the society.“They do not have the right to oppose the decision of the society taken in a properly convened meeting. They cannot hold society to ransom. They cannot prejudice the rights of their fellow members and neighbours in the society,” said the bench.HC added that the development agreement signed by the society binds the dissenting members. “The Development Agreement is itself backed by an undisturbed general body resolution of the Society,” said the court. HC has now directed the two members to vacate their respective flats by April 30, failing which the court receiver will forcibly evict them along with their belongings, if necessary with the assistance of the local police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-warns-dissenting-minority-trying-to-stall-redevelopment-of-societies-101616866239039.html

If such an order is to be implemented, questions will be raised about the alleged violators and why no action was taken against them. In an absence of particulars of the violators and prayer being based on specific violations, only a formal order can be passed that the Noida authority and the UPPCB may look into the grievance of the application as per the law. The order is given accordingly,” read the order issued on March 25.Plastic is sold in violation of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2018, and the Uttar Pradesh Plastic and other Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Regulation of Use and Disposal) (Amendment) Ordinance 2018, it added.Abhisht Gupta, the petitioner, said, “About 200 volunteers collected plastic from over 50 sectors of Noida — from roadsides and other open places — on February 21, and by the end of the day, we had collected 1,245 kgs of plastic. This is the scale at which plastic is being used in the city. It’s criminal that such a menace is still being faced by the city and going to a court was the only option I had.”When asked, UPPCB officials said they will ensure that the plastic waste is in check. “The pollution board has ensured that there are no plastic manufacturing units in the city. The main issue with the plastic waste in Noida is due to its storage, distribution and use. The plastic items mostly come to Noida through neighbouring cities, and it’s the urban local bodies that must ensure that this is curbed,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.SC Mishra, project engineer, Noida authority, said, “We have seen the NGT order, and we will act accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ngt-orders-up-pollution-board-noida-authority-to-enforce-ban-on-single-use-plastic-101616865999492.html

At least 30 stolen phones were recovered from them.The suspects were identified as Manmeet (the alleged kingpin), Aayub and Aamir, all from Delhi. The trio was allegedly a part of a gang known as the ‘Sardaar gang’, said the police.“The gang has been active for over five years now and is responsible for more than 250 snatchings in the NCR,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Rannvijay Singh.Police officials said that the suspects allegedly targeted passersby and snatched phones and chains whenever the opportunity came. They mostly roamed on two motorcycles and after snatching, the suspects allegedly exchanged vehicles to evade capture.Police said Aamir allegedly used to purchase the stolen goods from the others. Police officials said that phones were also sold to random people and in grey markets as well in NCR after changing their IMEI numbers.“There are more people associated with the gang along with more buyers and jewellers. We are working on identifying and nabbing them,” said Singh.Police recovered two bikes stolen from Ghaziabad, two knives and 30 mobile phones from the suspects, some of which were stolen from Gautam Budh Nagar’s Surajpur and Phase 2 police jurisdictions.“They have extensive criminal histories and have also gone to jail a couple of times since 2018 from our district and ten times from Delhi as well,” said Singh.Police officials said that the snatchers allegedly kept weapons on them during crimes but so far no incidents of violence have come to light. The trio was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gang-involved-in-over-250-snatchings-busted-in-noida-101616865998374.html

This has been happening for the past two weeks now,” said the woman in her police complaint.Based on her complaint, a case was registered against the suspect under sections 354 (sexual harassment) and 354D (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code.“The suspect had been following the woman for the last 15 days on his motorcycle and saying objectionable things to her. He would start stalking her in the evening as soon as she left her office. He would follow her around for nearly one or two kilometres before going back to Ghaziabad.

27-03-2021||Noida||Traffic crawls at Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway||Greater Noida: The traffic near the Jewar toll plaza on the Yamuna Expressway moved at a snail’s pace on Saturday, especially from noon to 3pm, as scores of people took to the road to travel from Noida and Delhi to their home towns for Holi.The huge pile-up of vehicles near the toll plaza compelled some commuters to take to social media and post photos and videos stating that the waiting time was between 30-45 minutes.Tagging Nitin Gadkari, minister for road transport and highways, in his tweet, Manish Bajpai, a commuter, wrote, “This is the status of Yamuna Expressway Jewar toll plaza and queue is 45 minutes long! Wondering how much fuel is burnt for no reason? Please do something to save this.” Vivek Gupta, another commuter, wrote, “Imagine spending 30 minutes on a toll plaza in 2021.”Stretching 165 kilometres, the Yamuna expressway connects Delhi to Agra via Greater Noida. This is also a significant route connecting the national capital region to western UP and Bihar. The six-lane access-controlled expressway has four toll plazas and six interchanges along the entire length.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, (traffic) Gautam Budh Nagar, said a number of people were travelling home for Holi. “This is the reason why the traffic movement slowed down on the Noida-Agra side of the expressway at all the six toll booths. A team of traffic police also reached the spot. We talked to the toll operator and introduced a token system to ease traffic,” he said.As part of the token system, the toll executives went up to each vehicle, issued them tokens and received the toll tax. “This exercise came in handy as the commuters only had to show the token at the toll booth and exit, without having to stop for toll payment," said Saha. The traffic police said they are making arrangements for smooth traffic flow on Sunday as well.The Yamuna Expressway Authority has planned to implement FASTags on the expressway from April 1. On an average, around 28,000-30,000 vehicles ply on the Yamuna Expressway per day and the toll is collected manually.Meanwhile, the traffic police are also making arrangements to ensure the safety of motorists and check for violations like drunk driving, overspeeding, reckless driving, dangerous driving, etc. during the festive season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-crawls-at-jewar-toll-plaza-on-yamuna-expressway-101616865938396.html
27-03-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Positivity rate up from 2.1% to 4.6% in one week||The Covid-19 test positivity rate, the total confirmed positives out of the samples tested, shot up to 4.6% from almost 2.1% in a week, even as Gurugram reported 245 new infections on Saturday. To end the rapid transmission chain, the district health department has restarted evening testing camps in crowded areas of the city.“Testing has been increased exponentially this week to almost 5,000 per day. Mass screening through rapid antigen test is also ongoing to identify clusters in densely populated areas. As a part of it, evening testing camps has also started outside crowded areas like malls and markets from Friday onwards,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, mentioning evening camp has been held outside Ambience mall and Galleria mall in the last two days from 5pm to 8pm.Currently, Gurugram is among the 46 most-affected Covid-19 districts across the country. In the last seven days, daily infections are up from 141 (on March 20) to 245 on Saturday, taking the active case count to 1,516 and the total tally to 61,972. This suggests cases are increasing at a positivity rate of 4.6%, just below the 5% threshold established by the World Health Organisation as an indicator of the infection spread being under control.Due to the resurgence of cases, the union ministry of health and family welfare on Saturday held a meeting with the officials of 12 states and 46 districts, where the spike has been highest. Three Haryana districts, Gurugram, Kurukshetra and Karnal, featured on the list.According to the statement issued by the ministry, the second wave reflected more laxity in Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and containment and management strategy at the ground level. To handle the situation, the state has been directed to ensure effective containment and contact tracing for at least 14 successive days in the worst affected districts for breaking the chain of transmission.The state administration has been directed to adopt strategies of increased testing, effective contact tracing and isolation of infected people within 72 hours, focus on micro-containment zones, strengthening public and private hospital infrastructure, compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour in crowded places through heavy fines and vaccination.“Due to festivities, it is likely daily cases will further increase after Holi. A detailed strategy on effective containment and contract tracing will be prepared on March 30. If required, the existing reserved bed capacity for Covid-19 patients will be increased from 35% to 50% but currently, it is not required as hospitalisation has been low in the district,” said Yadav.As per the district health bulletin, at least 116 severe to moderately ill patients are currently admitted to hospitals, while five are at Covid care centres and over 1,395 are in home isolation. The death toll stands at 364.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-positivity-rate-up-from-2-1-to-4-6-in-one-week-101616865879617.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Land within SGNP to soon be clear of encroachments||Several acres of land within the confines of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) that were cordoned off and deforested in violation of the Forest Conservation Act (1980) during the Covid-19 induced lockdown last year, will soon be cleared of encroachments, as the forest department is planning to conduct a series of demolition drives in the area early next month.Officials in the SGNP administration said that the land in question, which abuts Aarey Colony’s Sai Bangodapada village and is spread over at least 20 acres of protected forest land, has been notorious for encroachments. “The area is very much within the national park. We had attempted to remove the violators sometime last year, but enforcement teams faced resistance on the ground. There is a proper encroachment removal drive being planned for early next month, for which we will request adequate police bandobast,” said G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP.The forest department had previously run into conflicts with encroachers in the region. On March 23 last year, five forest officers who went to Sai Bangodapada to question the locals were allegedly attacked. One of them had to be admitted to Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Centre with injuries. A few days before that, a forest guard had also been beaten up in the nearby Filterpada slum. A forest department official, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the area has turned into a hub for the production of illicit liquor. “You will see stacks of chopped branches which are used as fuelwood in manufacturing alcohol illegally. There are a few kachas structures in the area where this is being done,” said the officer.According to environmentalists who have been tracking the area, the scale of encroachments near Sai Bangodapada runs into at least 100 acres. In a petition addressed to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray last year, activists had stated, “The section of Sanjay Gandhi National Park that borders Aarey from Bangodapada is being systematically decimated. Over a hundred acres of protected national parkland has been cordoned off in many places, deforested, fifty-year-old trees chopped down and burnt in many places inside the park boundaries near the Vihar lake.”“At many places, barbed wire fencing has been put up. Please note that these areas are not the ones used for cultivation by the tribals for many decades but are fresh acts of destruction not more than two months old. Bootlegging is seen at some places too,” the petition said. “Sanjay Gandhi National Park, unlike Aarey, is already a declared forest. There is no reason why any action needs to be taken to protect this park should be delayed,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-land-within-sgnp-to-soon-be-clear-of-encroachments-101616865879079.html
27-03-2021||Gurugram||Strict enforcement of mask rule on the cards to curb Covid-19 transmission||District officials are targeting to penalise around 5,000 people over the next three days to strictly enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and curb transmission of coronavirus infections due to Holi celebrations.“It has been decided in a district-level meeting that more than 1,000 people in a day will be challaned if they are found without face masks in public places or while commuting in groups in personal or public vehicles. Last year, Covid-19 cases drastically increased after Diwali. The purpose is not to repeat a similar situation and to control the transmission after Holi, as cases have been growing exponentially,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Deputy commissioner Yash Garg on Saturday, in a video to citizens, reiterated orders restricting Holi celebrations in public places, farmhouses, marriage and banquet halls, community centres and hotels. “If anybody is found violating norms, action will be taken against Section 188 of the IPC and sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The order will remain in force till March 29 evening,” read an order issued in the regard.Gurugram police on Saturday said that police teams have been deployed in most of the major markets to enforce mask discipline and to implement directions issued by the state government for restricted Holi celebrations. “Out teams are deployed and issuing challans to those not wearing masks. Mask discipline and social distancing measures will be enforced strictly,” said Subash Boken, PRO, Gurugram police.Multiple studies suggest that 90% of people are aware that wearing masks is a preventive step against coronavirus infection, but only 44% actually wear face masks, according to a statement issued by the health minister. One infected person could spread Covid-19 to an average of 406 individuals in a 30-day window, if left unchecked, as per studies.Earlier this week, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar directed the district to increase the number of fines issued to those flouting mask norms. The union ministry of health and family welfare on Saturday also issued a similar directive to the 46 worst-affected districts on Saturday. The Gurugram administration has been advised to strictly enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour by imposing heavy fines for violations as festivals of Holi, Shab e-barat and Easter have to be celebrated within residences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/strict-enforcement-of-mask-rule-on-the-cards-to-curb-covid-19-transmission-101616865819503.html

The HSVP had raised several objections to the CAG audit report.“The Supreme Court order will go a long way in protecting the interest of investors in the infra sector,” a spokesperson for IL&FS said.Officials of the HSVP said they have received the order and are studying it. “We are seeking a legal opinion in this matter and will take further action based on it,” said Ajit Balaji Joshi, chief administrator, HSVP.The appropriation of any amount from the escrow account shall be subject to further orders of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) or other competent legal authority, the apex court held.The Gurugram Rapid Metro project, which was developed by IL&FS through its subsidiary special purpose vehicles (SPVs) - Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon Limited (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon South Limited (RMGSL), between 2009 and 2013.The concession agreement was terminated in 2019 as HSVP failed to meet its obligations, following which the company demanded payments as per the agreement. The IL&FS company spokesperson said that agreements pertaining to advertising rights, construction of parking, real estate developments and several other revenue streams were not activated due to which the company decided to terminate the concession agreement. However, HSVP refuted the contention of IL&FS SPVs and challenged the matter in the high court, according to IL&FS.The high court ruled in September 2019 that operations and maintenance of the Metro link should be handed over to HSVP and directed the CAG to carry out a financial audit of total debt due. Following the audit, the HSVP was directed to deposit 80% of the debt due in an escrow account within 30 days of submission of the CAG report and directed that other disputes be settled through arbitrationThe company officials said that the project was handed over to HSVP in October 2019, as per court orders. They stated that auditors appointed by CAG submitted their report on debt due and determined the same at ₹2,407 crore. The report was taken note of by the court on September 28, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rapid-metro-case-sc-orders-hsvp-to-deposit-rs-1-925-crore-in-escrow-account-101616865818361.html

Commercial activities can’t be run from residential units,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement. Action against illegal constructions and building plan violations, and encroachments in markets has been initiated across different agencies this week in the city and DTCP, MCG and HSVP officials said that a sustained drive will be carried out in their areas. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran said that they removed several encroacments and demolished illegal vends in sector 15 part II as it was done earlier in sector 23, and sector 4 market. “We removed several illegal vends and this drive will be carried out in all the HSVP markets to ensure that the problems faced by residents are resolved,” said Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP. The enforcement team of MCG Gurugram also visited several sites in old city such as New Colony, Krishna Colony and adjoining areas and removed some constructions. Bhath, who has additional charge of enforcement in MCG said thay there were several complaints that property owners had illegally removed seals from the sealed buildings where Show cause notices, demolition orders were already issued. “The properties where the seals were removed were visited and sealed again and the non compoundable violations made in form of projections were demolished,” said Bhath. Officials of all three agencies said that they will work in tandem to ensure violations are curbed across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-puts-75-property-owners-in-sushant-lok-1-on-notice-for-building-violations-illegal-activities-101616865760875.html
27-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG trial to pedestrianise Sadar Bazar fails to take off||The municipal corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG’s) efforts to pedestrianise Sadar Bazar ended in failure on Saturday as vehicles ruled its narrow lanes.From March 20, the MCG had scheduled a ban on vehicles. But the same day the market saw protests from shopkeepers against the decision.MCG met the protesters and decided to instead seek to request customers to park their vehicles at the three designated spots near the market. But on the ground, there were no officials at any of the entry or exit points of the market to direct the customers.On Saturday, the market’s narrow lanes filled with two-wheelers and four-wheelers.On the main street of the market, a 600 metre stretch between Jama Masjid and Head Post office where the trial was concentrated, barring the installation of benches, a few streetlights and pots, there was little to suggest change.“The MCG’s executed the trial without any planning or consent. Most shopkeepers were opposed to the idea and throughout the trial, people arrived in their vehicles. There was no change. We had the same stance last month as well when a similar trial was aborted,” said Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar traders association.Gupta said that the MCG did not take into account that if visitors could not bring their vehicles in, they would simply choose not to come.“Sadar Bazar is a large market with more than 1,200 shops. Travelling to different corners of the market will amount to more than two kilometres of walking. People would then choose to go to a nearby mall or sector market for their shopping. This we cannot allow,” said Gupta.Jitender Garg, joint commissioner, MCG who is overseeing the project said that the civic body will use the learning to try it out once again.“Our focus is on the future. Around 200 volunteers from various civil defence teams will be on the ground in the next trial. Our approach with the shopkeepers will be much sterner,” said Garg, who added that he has called for a meeting with representative of various associations and traders of the market on Tuesday.He said the next trial will be two weeks long, likely next month and will focus on building awareness.“We are likely to allow entry of vehicles in then and hopefully by the third trial, our gradual changes would make it completely vehicle-free,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-trial-to-pedestrianise-sadar-bazar-fails-to-take-off-101616865759728.html
27-03-2021||Gurugram||This Holi, farmers near Haryana-Rajasthan border will burn copies of farm laws, not asura||: Farmers protesting near Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera on the Haryana-Rajasthan border will mark the upcoming Holi festival by burning copies of three farm laws that were passed by the central government in 2020. According to the farmers, they will burn copies of the farm laws as part of Holika Dahan — a pyre lighting ritual symbolising the victory of good over evil, an asura, on the eve of Holi.They said that the act is to “demonstrate their anger against the government’s refusal to accept the legitimate demands of the farmers”.Farmers from across India have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the central government in September 2020. According to the protesting farmers, the new laws might leave them at the mercy of private corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops.Sanjay Madhav, a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting near Delhi borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) in Rajasthan, said that the farmers will burn copies of the farm laws and “remember the sacrifices of people who died during the course of the agitation”.“More than 300 farmers have sacrificed their lives since the movement against these black laws started. Can’t mark a festival without remembering their sacrifices. We will remember the sacrifices of our brothers and sisters and take a pledge to continue this agitation till the laws are repealed. We will burn copies of the farm laws during Holika Dahan and strengthen our agitation till the government repeals these laws,” said Madhav.Also, several cultural programmes have been organised at the protest site ahead of Holi. Performers from the Shekhawati region in Rajasthan joined the agitation on Saturday. “Holi is celebrated days in advance in this region. Folk artistes from the Shekhawati region joined us today, and voiced support for the farmers through their songs and performances,” he added.Madhav also said that a group of supporters from northern Rajasthan will join the agitation on Sunday, and other farmer groups are expected to join the protest in April. “We are expecting the numbers of protesters to swell by the first week of April. Farmers who were occupied with the crops will be back soon,” said Madhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/this-holi-farmers-near-haryana-rajasthan-border-will-burn-copies-of-farm-laws-not-asura-101616865760342.html
27-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG directs banks to get licence for ATMs with dish antennas; or to be sealed||According to a release issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), banks erecting dish antennas on automated teller machines (ATMs) are now required to obtain a licence from the civic body. The MCG will seal such ATMs without a licence, said the officials.The MCG, however, has not announced a deadline for obtaining the licence.As per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation (Communication and Connectivity Infrastructure) Bye-laws, 2013, an applicant is required to pay a processing fee of ₹10,000 per antenna, a licence fee of ₹5,000 per antenna per annum, and a compounding fee of ₹2,500 per antenna per annum if the person has already put up an antenna without obtaining a prior permission from the MCG. The applicant can obtain a licence from the civic body after paying all the above, said the MCG officials.The official data provided by the MCG’s planning branch revealed that many banks have installed ATMs within the limits of the MCG area without taking any prior permission from the civic body, according to RS Bhath, district town planner (DTP), MCG.“Since October 2020, such banks have been constantly directed to submit applications for regularisation of illegal dish antennas installed on the ATMs after paying the requisite fee and the charges, but none of them have submitted applications for the same,” said Bhath.Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG, said that if the banks concerned don’t obtain licences, the MCG will start sealing their ATM booths.In July 2020, the MCG’s planning branch had asked Prahlad Rai Godara, lead district manager (LDM), for submitting contact details of all the banks in the city. Subsequently, the MCG had issued notices to all the banks concerned in October 2020, to share details of their ATMs — according to the locations and get them regularised under the bye-laws. According to the LDM data in 2020, there are around 537 bank branches in urban areas of the city, and 1,489 ATMs in Gurugram.Earlier, the Haryana accountant general (audit) had directed the MCG in July 2016, to seal around 400 ATMs in the city, if the banks failed to obtain licenses under the bye-laws within 90 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-directs-banks-to-get-licence-for-atms-with-dish-antennas-or-to-be-sealed-101616865759013.html
27-03-2021||Noida||Surge in Covid cases forces GB Nagar admin to increase daily testing to 7,000||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration called upon an urgent meeting on Saturday evening amid reports of 182 coronavirus (Covid-19) cases emerging in the district between March 20 and 26 to decide measures to be taken to curb the spread of the disease. One of the many measures to be implemented is increasing the number of Covid-19 tests to 7,000 per day, said officials.Suhas L Y, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that health officials have been asked to increase surveillance activities at public places and contact tracing. “We are aware that the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has had a direct impact on its neighbouring districts in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Of the 182 cases detected in the district between March 20 and 26, over 40% of the cases had contacts in Delhi. When almost all restrictions have been eased and commercial activities started, we have no option other than proper surveillance and observing all precautionary measures,” he said.Attributing the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases to the district’s floating population and movement, with over one lakh vehicles crossing the Delhi-Noida border daily, the district magistrate said that only mass awareness about social distancing and sanitisation can check the spread of the virus. “In the meeting with officials of different departments, I have asked them to make arrangements for Covid-19 helpdesks at their establishments and not to allow entry to any employee having influenza-like symptoms (high fever or cough). Health officials have been asked to conduct up to 7,000 tests per day and enhance contact tracing in the district. They have also been asked to keep strict surveillance in crowded areas. I myself will keep a tab on daily testing and contact tracing,” said Suhas. He further said that in the current situation, early and timely tracking of new cases is the main focus of the administration. “We cannot rule out further spread of Covid-19 given that festivals like Holi and Shab-e-Baraat are round the corner. Our focus is on reducing the number of fatalities and curing maximum infected patients on time. For that, we have adopted the ‘tracking, testing and treating’ methodology, in which we are ensuring maximum contact tracing, testing nearly 4,000 people every day and treating infected patients as per symptoms. While the recovery rate in Gautam Bugh Nagar is still nearly 99%, the case fatality rate (CFR) is 0.35% compared to the state ‘s CFR of 1.43% (as on March 26),” said Suhas. The district magistrate further said that after achieving the target of inoculating 65,048 persons above 60 years and those between 45 and 60 years with comorbidities in the third phase of the vaccination this month, the district health department has been assigned to inoculate at least 1.35 lakh people in April. “Since everyone over 45 years will be covered under the vaccination drive from April 1, we have decided to double the vaccination booths at all private and government hospitals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/surge-in-covid-cases-forces-gb-nagar-admin-to-increase-daily-testing-to-7000-101616865758432.html
27-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, Noida get 370K Covid-19 vaccination target for April||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday issued fresh Covid-19 vaccination targets for April, in which people aged over 45 years can get the shots from April 1. The Ghaziabad district has been given a target of covering 216,000 beneficiaries while Gautam Budh Nagar is to cover 162,000 beneficiaries in the coming month. The overall vaccination target given to the 75 districts of the state is a total of 12,073,200 for April. This time, the state government has also defined targets to be met on “major days” – Monday, Thursday and Friday – and also for “minor days” – Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday – as well as the weekly target assigned to each district.Previously, the state government had not assigned daily or weekly targets but had given a combined monthly target.“The daily and weekly targets have been assigned this time to better monitor and to expedite the vaccination process in the wake of the rising tally. On “major days”, all district hospitals, community health centres (CHC) and even primary health centres (PHC) administer shots, however, PHCs do not administer shots on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. So, these are called “minor days” when we have a smaller number of healthcare centres running,” said an officer from the district health department. As per official figures, Ghaziabad for April has been assigned a target of vaccinating 14,000 beneficiaries each of the three major days while 4,000 beneficiaries each are to be vaccinated on the minor days. This provides the district a weekly target of vaccinating 54,000 beneficiaries per week. Likewise, GB Nagar is given a weekly target of vaccinating 40,500 beneficiaries per week with 10,000 per day on major days and 3,500 each day for minor days. “We are gearing up and will open more private and government healthcare facilities to meet the fresh target given for April. Till March 27, we have achieved about 111% of our target given for March. To meet the rise in the number of beneficiaries in the month of April, we will be doubling the daily target of our vaccination centres,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. For the third round of vaccination of senior citizens and people having co-morbidities, GB Nagar was assigned a monthly target of 65,048 beneficiaries while Ghaziabad was given a target of vaccinating 93,480. According to sources, Ghaziabad, till March 27, administered shots to 73,693 beneficiaries, which is about 78.8% of the given target of 93,480. The sources said that it is unlikely that the district will be able to meet the target for March. “It is likely that in remaining days, the maximum vaccination that can be achieved will be about 10,000 beneficiaries and it is likely that the target for March will be missed. It is also due to the fact that people will not turn up due to the festive season coming around. Above all, we also have about 20,000 odd doses of vaccine available with us and the next consignment will be received only on April 2,” said an officer from the health department, requesting anonymity. When approached for response, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that 30 more vaccination centres at government healthcare centres will be roped in for vaccination starting April 1. “We are assured that we will be able to get good coverage for vaccination starting April 1 and we are also expediting the vaccination process to complete 100% of the target given for March. We do not have a shortage of vaccines in our stock. We have held a review meeting with our officials and all targets will be achieved,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-noida-get-370k-covid-19-vaccination-target-for-april-101616865638401.html

27-03-2021||Noida||Covid crisis: Ghaziabad bans Holi milan, dance parties||Ghaziabad: Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey issued directions on Saturday to ban Holi milan programmes, and rain and other dance parties, among similar events with an immediate effect in the district, even if prior permissions were taken for the same.This comes in furtherance to the directions issued by Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari on March 23 for regulations in the wake of panchayat elections and festivals. The decision was also taken in light of rising coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Ghaziabad, with 54 new cases reported on Friday. Last time, the daily case tally had gone above 50 was on December 29, 2020, when 59 fresh cases were reported in a single day. In its Saturday order, the administration stated that prior permission is required for processions and public events, and that the organisers will have to furnish an affidavit saying that they will comply with the conditions mentioned in the chief secretary’s order and will ensure compliance of the Covid-19 protocols.“The directions have been issued to ban parties and Holi milan programmes, not events like weddings,” said Pandey, adding that people must wear masks, and maintain social distancing in public places.Meanwhile, markets in Ghaziabad have been buzzing ahead of Holi, and according to the traders’ association, people have been seen not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing. “The Holi milan programmes are conducted every year. This year, people are not maintaining social distancing even amid a surge in coronavirus cases. Only 25-30% customers can be seen wearing masks in markets of trans-Hindon areas in Ghaziabad, but they also don’t maintain social distancing. They coronavirus guidelines are not being followed on the ground,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener, Vyapari Ekta Samiti in Ghaziabad’s Indirapuram.Most of the traders at busy markets had similar complaints.“Many visitors — about 65-70% — wear masks, but there is absolutely no social distancing. Beyond a limit, we can’t ask customers to follow Covid-19 guidelines. There is hardly any enforcement. So, many shopkeepers provide free masks to their customers, and have sanitisers at the shops,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson, Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.Commenting on this, Pandey said, “We have issued advisories and guidelines, and strict enforcement will be ensured in markets so that people wear masks and maintain social distancing.”According to the Ghaziabad health department, 187 Covid-19 cases were reported in February, but the tally has been at 301 this month so far. The most-affected localities in the district so far in March are Shastri Nagar and nearby areas (61 cases), Raj Nagar (60), Ghukna (25), Indirapuram (23), Vasundhara (16), and Vaishali (10), among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-crisis-ghaziabad-bans-holi-milan-dance-parties-101616865518427.html

However, Singh moved a lower court, challenging the decision. Later on February 25, a court of special session judge directed the jail administration to shift the former legislator back to Dhanbad, but the same was yet to be complied with.Niraj Singh and four others were killed in an indiscriminate firing at Dhanbad’s steel gate on March 21, 2017.It was alleged that Sanjeev Singh and around nine others intercepted Niraj’s SUV at the steel gate and opened firing, in which four people, including Niraj, were killed.Following the incident, Sanjeev was arrested and sent to Dhanbad jail. A month later, he was shifted to Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Central Jail. The former legislator approached the Dhanbad court at the time and then the Jharkhand high court for shifting him back to Dhanbad jail. On court’s order, he was sent to Dhanbad jail in 2018.In his recent petition, Singh argued that his shifting to one jail from another was violation of the relevant provisions of the Prisoners’ Act, 1900, rules of Bihar jail manual and Supreme Court’s orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jailed-former-bjp-mla-files-contempt-case-against-ig-101616864378324.html

The SEC has already sent letters to the district magistrates of all 38 districts to furnish the names of all contestants for six posts, from ward member to district board member in rural local bodies, who did not furnish election-related expenditure. In the last panchayat polls, there were around 10-12 lakh candidates for 2.54 lakh posts in three tier local bodies. The election expenditure limit for candidates for Mukhiya (village head) is ₹40,000, for panchayat samiti member ₹30,000 and for district board member ₹1 lakh. Under the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006, all candidates are required to furnish election expenses through an affidavit within 15 days of completion of polls. There are provisions in the Act that erring candidates would be served notices and could even be debarred from contesting election for three years after a proper hearing by the SEC. “In panchayat elections, a large number of candidates usually do not file election related expenditure. This is why we have initiated this move so that we can assess how far the rule was complied with by all contesting candidates in the last polls. We will appropriate action later against erring contestants,” said secretary (SEC) Yogendra Ram. “Only a few districts have so far sent names of candidates not having given election related expenditure after the polls. We have sent reminders to all DMs to send the names and number of candidates at the earliest,” said an SEC official. In fact, SEC officials admit the exercise of serving notices to candidates having not furnished information about poll expenses should have started within a few months after the completion of the 2016 April-May panchayat polls. “The returning officers should have ensured that notices were served to all such candidates.Now that the panchayat polls are near, it would not be easy to serve notices and complete hearing against erring candidates. But yes, it would send a strong message to candidates that they cannot take panchayat polls lightly and have to comply with all rules,” said another official. Meanwhile, the SEC has also directed all DMs to send a list of booths and blocks which are located in remote areas having no proper communication system in place, especially internet facilities. “We have asked the DMs to identify shadow zones in their respective districts where net connectivity is poor or not available at the booths. This is being done so that proper arrangement for net connectivity could be put in place. This time, there will be high dependability on digital and computer based network for holding polls, including use of EVms and webcasting,” said the SEC secretary. This time, the number of booths for the panchayat polls would be around 1.19 lakh.Local body pollsWhat’s the ruleUnder the Bihar Panchayat Raj Act, 2006, all candidates are required to furnish election expenses through an affidavit within 15 days of completion of polls.Election expenditure limits ₹40,000: For Mukhiya candidates ₹30,000: For panchayat Samiti member  ₹1 lakh: For district board member||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchayat-elections-poll-panel-seeks-list-of-contestants-in-2016-who-didn-t-report-expenses-101616863778269.html

Even as Punjab government experts claim that the peak of the second wave had not come yet, the state has added 43,883 fresh cases to its kitty this month till March 26 as compared to 59,000 in September, the month when the state state had been hit by the virus the most. Positivity rate and CFR down The only relief the state has had so far is that its positivity rate has come down to 3.9%, compare to 4.5% which the state had reported at the peak of the disease in 2020. Last week, the state’s daily positivity ratio had touched 6.8% , this increase was also pointed out by the Union government. However, now, as per the state’s nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar for covid-19, it has been 6% for the past three days,primarily because the state’s testing has reached an all-time of 40,000 tests a day. “As we have been carrying out record number of tests, our positivity rate has automatically come down. The decrease in CFR is because daily cases are increasing,” said the nodal officer. Peak likely in second or third week of April Projections from state government experts show that the state may hit a peak of the disease in the third week of April, when the case count may be between 4,000 and 4500 cases a day. “This time, the peak may be more serious as people are not following restrictions and are not adhering to social distancing protocols,” claimed Dr Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjabs-covid-numbers-in-march-signal-uphill-battle-in-second-wave-101616863420003.html

After the hurdles faced while exporting mangoes last year due to lockdown, producers and traders are hoping for a good season this year.“The situation was different last year. Due to the Covid pandemic the airlines were not operating. The export of this season has begun and it is expected to be up to the level of 2018 and 2019. The export is done through various modes of transportation such as air, marine and by road,” said Bhaskar Patil, deputy general manager of the Konkan division- Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board.According to the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board officials, it is not possible to give the details of the export quantity of the mangoes yet as the records are kept by the customs department.The export of Kesar mango from Marathwada will begin from the second week of April. Currently, in Pune, the demand is more than the supply. It has kept the rates of Devgad Alphonso afloat. The Karnataka mango is expected to hit the local market in large quantities in the second week of April.Rates of Devgad Alphonso mangoes is 800-1,500 per dozen, while the rate of Karnataka mangoes is 500-1,000 per dozen.Devgad Alphonso mangoes have been available in the local market since February last week. Traders observed that currently, the demand is slightly more than supply. It has kept the rates afloat. “From the second week of April Karnataka mango will be available in the large quantity in the market. Rates are expected to drop then,” said Rohan Ursal mango trader at Market Yard, Pune.Last year after lockdown many mango producers were involved in direct trading with housing societies. Based on last year’s experience many are likely to opt for the same. “Last year farmers directly contacted housing society members and sold the fruit. This trend is likely to continue. Currently, we are receiving 10-12 tempos each day of Alphonso mangoes,” said Baba Bibawe, head of the fruit market department, Market Yard, Pune.“The season has begun. We hope that it will turn out better than the last one. Also, I want to request the government agencies to strictly observe the geographical indication (GI) nomination compliance. When the Karnataka mango starts to come into the market, it is sold as Alphonso. Which happens every year and there has been no effective way to stop this. We, original Alphonso mango producers have to suffer because of this,” said Prabhakar Gogate, Alphonso mango producer in Devgad.Mango pricesDevgad Alphonso- ₹800-1,.500 per dozenKarnataka mango- 500-1,000 per dozen(Rate varies depending upon the quality and the size)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traders-hope-to-revive-mango-export-after-facing-hurdles-due-to-lockdown-last-year-101616862578206.html

27-03-2021||Other||Despite police crackdown, no stopping hooch trade in Amritsar, Tarn Taran||The illegal business of illicit liquor trade continues unabated in Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts, despite the police and the excise department cracking down hard on it. Last year’s hooch tragedy that killed 140 persons has also failed to act as deterrent. Huge quantities of illicit liquor and many arrests have been reported from the two districts on a daily basis this year. Organised liquor smuggling cartels have also been busted. In March, Amritsar Rural Police unearthed six illicit liquor-making rackets. Over 525 tonne of lahan (raw material used for producing illicit liquor) and over 50 running stills (equipment) have been seized. Punjab Police and excise department officials say unemployment, high prices of liquor sold at government-approved shops and mild punitive action under the Excise Act means the illegal trade tempts many. Patti MLA Harminder Singh Gill said Punjab Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was passed during the budget session of Punjab Vidhan Sabha. Police, however, continue to invoke Sections under the Punjab Excise Act, 1914. Ajnala DSP Vipan Kumar said they were waiting for a circular on the law.“Most accused are unemployed and we book them under the Excise Act. Jobs, especially in border villages, are meagre and many, especially the poor, enter the trade to make ends meet. The lockdown led to loss of jobs and some of them started the illegal business,” said a senior police official. He added that most accused have no background of drugs smuggling. “Around 99% consumers of illicit liquor are from the labour class, who cannot even afford the cheapest liquor from government-approved wine shops. Those arrested recently had selling one-liter bottle of illicit liquor at ₹200. A 750ml bottle of the cheapest liquor costs more than ₹300 at approved shops,” he said. Another police official said, “Many accused face over 10 cases under the Act. They get bail easily and re-start business. We need stricter laws.” With the recent busting of a racket in Kotli Sakka village racket, Amritsar police arrested four people, including its kingpin Bhagwant Singh. Bhagwant faces 12 cases under the Excise Act. He was also bailed out and re-started his business.  SSP (rural) Dhruv Dahiya said they were mulling using the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “Repeated offenders will be brought under the act so that their properties can be attached,” he said.Police say accused in all six rackets in March had been preparing illicit liquor by using jaggery and yeast. Excise inspector Ajnala Rajwinder Kaur said, “Sometimes, people use alcohol, pills and other chemicals, besides jaggery and yeast for making illicit liquor. This can be poisonous.”HT spoke to a man in Tarn Taran, who used to make illicit liquor from jaggery. He said the production cost of one-liter bottle of illicit liquor is between ₹70 and 80, and is sold at between ₹150 and ₹200. “Inferior quality jaggery, available at ₹30 per kg, is used in making illicit liquor.” He added in summers, jaggery and yeast is dissolved in a drum of water for at least seven days; in winters for 15 days. “This concotion, which is called lahan (raw material), is heated in a pot on a still for making illicit liquor.”BLURBPunjab Police and excise department officials say unemployment, high prices of liquor sold at government-approved shops and mild punitive action under the Excise Act means the illegal trade tempts many||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-police-crackdown-no-stopping-hooch-trade-in-amritsar-tarn-taran-101616862038778.html

The protest was organised by students and not by any organisation or group. Since the protesting group did not have any prior police permission for the protest, the police stopped the demonstration. For a brief period, there was tension at the spot as some students were taken into custody but later released after counselling. “From the last one year, everything is online, our classes, studies, work from home for parents, webinars and everything. Our demand is that our exams also be held online. The number of Covid cases is again on the rise in our state and we don’t want to risk our lives as the examination is going to be offline,” said Vijendra Naidu, a protesting student.A total of 30 to 40 students gathered at the Shaniwarwada inside premises initially at 12 noon on Friday, however, the number rose to 100 slowly as the message of the protest spread through social media. “We simply want an answer from the state government, on one hand, they are imposing lockdown in some cities and then forcing us to come to give the examinations. This is playing with the lives of thousands of students, instead, they should conduct the exams online and for that, we are protesting today,” said another student Chinmay Hawaldar.As the numbers grew, local police came to the spot and started talking to students. They appealed to students to go away from the spot, but as students were not ready to move then some protesting students were taken into custody. Vijay Tikole, senior police inspector at Vishrambaug police station said, “Our policemen spoke to the protesting students, made them aware that they didn’t have police permission and as per the Covid restrictions, gathering of such large number of students won’t be allowed. After the appeal from police, the students went away from the spot and no complaint was lodged against anyone.”As per the Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, the SSC class 10 board exams will commence from April 29 and end on May 20 while that of HSC class 12 board exam will begin on April 23 and end on May 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hsc-ssc-students-protest-at-shaniwarwada-taken-in-custody-and-released-101616854357695.html

Now they are co-owners and shareholders of their company, Thar Artisan Producer Company, launched with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). They are also part of the board of directors and have a say in costing, planning, production and wages.Safiyat (65), a Pakistani migrant who came to India in 1980, never thought that one day she would become a director of a company. “I experienced the pain of displacement. When I was only 14, my family got displaced from Pakistan’s Minau village in Sindh province and came to India. Initially, we took shelter in refugee camps. It is a long and painful journey to settle in India with so many hurdles,” said Safiyat.“After reaching India, we didn’t have any job or means to survive. Whatever we inherited was left behind in Pakistan. We reached India with empty hands; our only asset was our craftsmanship,” she said.After coming to India, the migrant families faced many challenges.“We were living under a threat of legal action against us. Our wish was only to keep ourselves alive. Citizenship was not an easy status to get from the government. They had many questions and we had very few answers,” said Tagi Devi, a migrant from Pakistan.These women have come from the Sindh region of Pakistan that is known for its signature handicraft work. Patchwork, appliqué, metal thread embroidery and glass work on naturally dyed clothes are in demand in the fashion world. These women create art pieces while working at home and are the bread earners for their families. Now, with their venture in place, they will try to market their folk craft directly, without working for middlemen for wages.“The middlemen took advantage of our situation, our illiteracy and our needs. They exploited us by giving us very low wages. We were getting only ₹10 to 50 a day while they were earning huge amounts by selling the products made by us,” said Jarrina, an artisan and a member of the board of directors.The NABARD will support the company with the assistance of ₹92 lakh for three years, after which the company has to be self-sustainable, said Dinesh Prajapat, deputy general manager and director, NABARD in Barmer.“The first instalment of ₹12 lakh has been allotted to the company. It is the first such project in India supported by NABARD,” he said.“These women have a unique talent. The products they are making have a demand all over the world. Despite their skills, they are the victims of middlemen that are exploiting them by giving low wages. It is because of these women artisans’ illiteracy and lack of marketing skills. Under this project, we will try to ensure them an opportunity to connect with the market directly and showcase their folk craft.”A non-governmental organisation, Society to Uplift Rural Economy (SURE), which works on issues related to rural economy and women empowerment, will act as a facilitator of the project.“SURE will act as a bridge between these female entrepreneurs and the market. Our aim is to help them in making this venture commercially successful,” said Lata Katchwah, secretary, SURE.“We have also planned to set up a common facility centre (CFC) that will provide the required facilities to these women who have been exploited by middlemen. With this project, we are expecting that soon they will become self-sustained and get the real value of their talent,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pak-refugee-women-in-rajasthan-float-company-to-market-craftwork-101616854118261.html
27-03-2021||Pune||Two decades of happiness…||So, I had planned this article to be the first in the series, but I kept writing about something else every week. I suppose I did not want to start this series by writing about a close friend, with “nepotism” being a commonly used word now. But this needed writing, especially because running a theatre company successfully for twenty years is no mean feat. And Akarsh Khurana has made running Akvarious Productions look very easy for the last two decades! I had met Akarsh when he visited Pune as a judge for the primary round at Thespo (For the uninitiated, Thespo is a theatre festival for those who are under twenty-five years of age, organised by Mumbai-based QTP, but more about them on another day). He gave us some advice after the play and we listened to it diligently, knowing fully well that he wasn’t selecting our play for the finals. And I thought that maybe this was the last I will interact with him. I did bump into him from time to time whenever we had a performance at Prithvi, but they were just an exchange of “hellos”. Amongst all the posters there, I would see the name ‘Akvarious Productions’ regularly. As we started using social media more and more I remember being surprised and envious of the number of shows and new productions AKvarious would churn out. I was a decision maker at a theatre group too and used to wonder how he found the time and the money to do this! A few years later he cast a friend of mine in one of his productions. Then he cast another friend. And another. Slowly his name started popping up in our regular conversations. I heard how they performed all over India and had amazing food everywhere they went. A few months later I started casting for a Marathi film that I was going to direct and wanted a Hindi speaking actor for a part. His name popped up again and I made the call. Even he agreed readily even though he was working on multiple things (which I later realised, he always is.) While working on the film he asked me if I would like to work in a play he was planning to open in a few months. I now suspect that he just knew the date when the play had to open and was still undecided about many of its aspects, including the script! I said “yes” and was waiting for him to call me to Mumbai for rehearsals. As is the custom now, a new WhatsApp group of the team was formed and we all used to chat there. But there was no call for rehearsals! I knew the opening day was close. The other actors used to work with him regularly so they seemed less concerned. Finally, one morning, I got a call for rehearsals! As I had expected (and hoped) there was a lot of good food, conversations and some rehearsal too. It was an interesting process as Akarsh had this knack of extracting whatever he wanted from his actors while letting them explore the character themselves. But what was more interesting was that he was doing it effortlessly. And just like that, we opened our play to good reviews! We performed the play in many cities over the next few years and have worked with each other on multiple projects hence. Now that I have worked with him for quite a bit and in multiple roles - as an actor when he is directing, his director when he is acting, his director when he is a writer, a writer when he is the director, his co-director on a project - I think I know the secret behind the success of Akvarious and Akarsh. It’s pretty simple really - he understands people. And by that, I don’t mean his audience, but his team members. And only someone who is honest to the core can do that. He knows how to build a team that is ready to take risks with them. Not all of them work. Some have misfired and have cost him dearly too. But he makes up for it by writing and directing mainstream cinema and web series and then spends that money on producing new plays! After twenty years, nearly fifty productions and around thirteen hundred shows, I feel that Akvarious has created a tribe of its own. A happy tribe, much like Akarsh. And there can be no bigger success than this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-decades-of-happiness-101616853697695.html
27-03-2021||Pune||Fire at Fashion Street was a tragedy waiting to happen||If Friday night’s fire at Fashion Street reduced over 600 shops to ashes within five hours, its alert was sounded around three years ago. In a statement issued on Saturday, the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) said that the cause of the fire incident on Friday night is not yet clear. PCB clarified, “There is no cantonment electricity connection and all stallholders obtained electricity connections from MSEDCL. The cantonment has only provided street lighting in the parking area. Some stallholders have taken electricity connections through one common connection of the MSEDCL, and others have taken individual connections. The board has not issued any No Objection Certificate (NOC) for obtaining electricity connection for MSEDCL.”According to the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), a report was submitted in 2018 highlighting the “risk” of similar incidents and possible difficulty to deal with it at Fashion Street due to the congested nature of the area. The joint fire audit report submitted by the chief fire officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and the fire brigade superintendent of PCB was discussed at the special board meeting held in 2018 under the chairmanship of the then PCB president brigadier Rajiv Sethi. The audit report says the market does not have sufficient exit points in case there is a fire and people have to be evacuated. “It is a very serious matter in respect to the Fashion Street report submitted by the fire department of PMC. Fashion Street has become a risky place for fire incidents. We will be collecting information about owners of all the stalls and take action against any illegal stalls,” Sethi had stated on the record. “It is required to do a fire safety assessment or audit,” said Dr DN Yadav, CEO of the Board. In 1997, MG road was cleared of unauthorised vendors and the administration provided these hawkers stalls of five feet by four feet and in total 565 shops came under the agreement. The report pointed out that many shopkeepers used plastic curtains as partitions, which are hazardous in the event of a fire and the narrow ways inside make it difficult to move. There are stall cafeterias or hotels outside the market which use fuels like LPG and kerosene, the report stated. According to the records and earlier verification carried out by the revenue staff of PCB, the place is not safe if any fire incident takes place. Also, it is difficult for a fire vehicle or ambulance to reach there due to narrow and congested roads. According to advocate MV Akolkar, president, MG road hawkers and pathari Seva Sanstha, as many as 448 hawkers were regularised at Fashion Street in 1997 though later some unauthorised hawkers also settled. He also questioned how electricity was provided to these unauthorised hawkers. “We are regular tenants since 1997 and 448 hawkers were allowed later PCB illegally allowed 200 hawkers inside. The parking space and approach road were encroached. The elected members got a proposal for the reconstruction of fashion Street which we objected to, and the matter is in court. The fire incident is fishy, and this appears to be a conspiracy against the traders. The outside space was encroached by hawkers who were permitted by PCB. The same finds mention in the 2018 fire audit report. Why did the board give NOC for installing electricity metre to illegal hawkers? The board is at fault and it is solely responsible for this current crisis. We suspect foul play in this fire incident,” said Akolkar. BOX – Second major fire tragedy in camp On March 16, as many as 25 shops were gutted in an early morning fire at British era Shivaji market located in Pune Cantonment area on Tuesday morning, according to fire officials. No casualties were reported even though property damage is being calculated by the local police. BOX: - Most heritage structures not on fire audit compliance list of PCB Over 100 heritage structures under Pune Cantonment area are not on the fire audit list of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), a revelation that came out after British era Shivaji market in camp was partly gutted in the fire. Among the important heritage structures are Albert Edward Library on East Street opposite Kayani Bakery, which was established in 1975, Victory Theatre which is a 100-year-old colonial-era theatre was once used as a playhouse for the British, 160-year-old Hindustan Covenant Church belonging to the British era which was burnt to ashes in Nov 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fire-at-fashion-street-was-a-tragedy-waiting-to-happen-101616853397739.html
27-03-2021||Pune||After fighting Fashion Street fire, PCB fire chief dies in road accident||Over 600 shops were completely gutted after a major fire broke out at the famous Fashion Street market in the Camp area of Pune late on Friday night, officials said. While there were no casualties in the blaze, the head of the Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) fire department was killed in a road accident while returning home after dousing the fire. Prakash Hasbe died after his two-wheeler came under the wheels of a bus on Saturday morning around 6.30 am. He was on his way home to Viman Nagar after dousing the fire at Fashion Street. According to police officials, Hasbe was riding home to his house in Nagpur chawl on his two-wheeler when his bike collided head-on with a PMPML bus. The driver of the bus was identified as Mallesh Nagnath Jadhav (36), a resident of Nigdi who has been detained by the police. “We have detained him, and a case is getting registered. The bike was moving on the slightly curved road connecting jail road police chowki to 509 chowk. There is no divider on the curve and both the vehicles collided head-on,” said senior police inspector Gajanan Pawar of Vimantal police station. A case under Sections 279, 304(a) of Indian Penal Code and Section 184 of Motor Vehicle Act is getting registered at Vimantal police station. PCB CEO Amit Kumar said, “He called me at around 2 am and briefed me that the fire was under control. He left the spot very late to go to Viman Nagar. After that, there was no information, his son who became anxious called saying that Hasbe did not return. Later, he received a call from someone that his father met with an accident and they were taking him to Sahyadri hospital. It’s a tragic incident which took place early morning.” Fashion Street adjacent to MG Road is a famous `window shopping’ destination that houses small outlets selling garments, shoes, goggles and other accessories. Local traders said there were 448 registered shops and over 200 unauthorised outlets located in the market. The clothes and other material in the market were gutted in fire, and it took six hours for the fire brigade to douse the blaze completely using 45 water tankers. The cause of what triggered the fire is being ascertained, officials said. Even though the market was shut, the fire brigade had a tough time negotiating the narrow lanes, which were encroached and had vehicles haphazardly parked. Precious time was lost in all this, said officials. Local trader Munaf Qureshi said “I have suffered loss of ₹30 lakh as the entire lot of brand new clothes was burnt in the fire. We have gone back by ten years due to this incident.” Another trader Nazim Sayyed said “We want the PCB to provide financial help so that we can start our business again. The traders are shattered as this incident has affected livelihood of hundreds of families.” The fire department received calls at 11 pm and water tankers were rushed to the spot but as the fire spread rapidly due to the small stalls being stacked with clothes, more tankers had to be sent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-fighting-fashion-street-fire-pcb-fire-chief-dies-in-road-accident-101616853217647.html

The Pune railway division has got two drone cameras from the Central Railways (CR) which will now be used for vigilance in and around the Pune railway station premises. According to the information given by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) of Pune division, these drones were received a few days back, and training to operate these drone cameras was given to 10 RPF policemen. Once all the necessary permission to use these drones are taken by the railways, the vigilance through the drone cameras will start at the Pune railway station. Various parts of the station will be covered with drone cameras, outside passenger circulation, railway tracks, parcel office area, Pune railway yard and nearby workshop. There will be a separate room for drone operations given at the RPF police station at Pune railway station. “We have got two drones from the headquarters and some of our policemen were given training about how to operate it. This will certainly benefit our overall vigilance at the station premises and will be helpful to us in patrolling,” said Ashwini Kumar, RPF senior police inspector and in-charge of Pune railway station RPF police station. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, a total of 200 train operations were carried out from the Pune railway station with more than two lakh travelling passengers. After the unlock process started and train operations resumed back from May 2020, slowly the number of train operations started increasing from the Pune railway station. Currently, around 100 train operations are done from the station with over 40,000 passengers traveling from the Pune railway station. “To keep a watch on suspicious persons, security of the railway’s property, standing trains at the platforms in the night and even during the emergency and festival seasons this drone vigilance will be very useful for us. These drones can fly up to 2 km from the network and their battery backup is 25 minutes. It also has real-time tracking system in it which is beneficial for the RPF policemen,” said Manoj Jhawar, Pune railway division spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/drones-to-monitor-suspicious-activities-at-pune-railway-station-101616853097699.html
27-03-2021||Pune||Raina, Bhosale with coach Kanitkar to represent India in Latvia||Ankita Raina, Rutuja Bhosale and coach Radhika Tulpule Kanitkar will be seen in action against Latvia in a Billie Jean King cup tie to be held at the National Tennis Centre Lielupe, in Jurmala on April 16-17. It is not the first time that the trio – two women players and a coach from Pune will be representing India on the international level. In the past, coach Nandan Bal along with Prathana Thombare and Raina were part of the Fed Cup (now Billie Jean King Cup) team against Kazakhstan. A team went down 3-0 and missed the world group berth in 2019. Before that in 2018, Asian games, Thombare and Raina was accompanied by Hemant Bendrey and Raina won the bronze medal. With Raina and Bhosale in top form, coach expects the duo to play a vital role in the team’s progress against Latvia. The winner of the tie will progress to the qualifiers, one step closer to the 12-team final. “The other girls in the team adds much needed balance to the team and we have good singles and doubles teams,” said Kanitkar who knows Raina and Bhosale since their junior team days. The other team members are Karman Kaur Thandi, Zeel Desai and Riya Bhatia (reserve). Vishal Uppal, former Indian Davis cup player will be the non-playing captain of the squad. The coach feels proud when she sees herself with the two more women from the city who are working hard for their country. “Tennis has improved a lot in Pune, from junior level to senior level we have champion players at every stage. In Maharashtra we are number one when it comes to producing quality players,” explained Kanitkar who retired from tennis in 2003 and runs coaching centre at Boat club. “I feel junior players should continue playing tennis so we can get more players like Raina and Bhosale,” added Kanitkar. For Kanitkar, it is the first time she will be on the senior team’s duty and before this she had travelled a lot with junior India teams. “It is like a dream come true to coach the senior team, all the players in our team are match winners. I have travelled with Rutuja during junior tours, and both (Raina) being trained under Hemant Bendrey sir. Both have reached the next level from where they had started,” said Kanitkar who knows both of them since their junior days. Raina’s take on team “Sania always tells you what you need to know and aspects to improve, I have been with her in the team now a lot of times and the best thing about her is that regardless of the result she will be very lively. Her personality is such that she makes the atmosphere very positive and in tense situations it’s very important,” added Raina who feels she has a strong team around. “Rutuja did well last year in Dubai and gave us the lead most of the time and she’s a fighter. Karman has a big serve and a big forehand and Zeel has been performing well. Riya has been more aggressive with her strokes and I hope she continues that. With Sania around, with her experience at a higher level we have a strong team,” added Raina. Bhosale ready for challenge Bhosale, who has played six tournaments post lockdown and won one singles and doubles title is ready for the upcoming tie. “Ankita and I train together at Hemant Bendrey sir which always helps. Now, Radhika ma’am who I have known for a long time will be help us on tour because sometimes I tend to get hyper and stuff on the court and she is a very calm person so her take on the situation will help me,” said Bhosale. For the Indian team, a tough contest is waiting ahead as the home team has the presence of 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko and Anastasija Sevastova. “It is going to be a tough tie because all these girls are very experienced. We will be playing on the hard court which gives us the better chance,” added Bhosale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/raina-bhosale-with-coach-kanitkar-to-represent-india-in-latvia-101616852917829.html

Speaking at the inaugural event of a new complex for the Bombay High Court at Goa at Penha de Franca overlooking the capital city of Panaji, the Union minister said, “I wish to congratulate the Chief Justice of India, SA Bobde, all Supreme Court of India judges who really rose to the occasion and ensure that the great wheel of justice does not stop. This unique innovation of India’s judiciary to allow virtual courts not to interrupt the wheel of justice will be indeed very remarkable. As I have said to friends, technology is very important. This is the age of technology, technology is power,” Prasad said. According to the law ministry, 82 lakh cases were heard through video conferencing, the Supreme Court of India heard 59,309 cases, the High Courts heard 27,58,560 cases and subordinate courts heard 54,46,876 cases.The CJI, who threw open the new court house, while speaking on the occasion, said that more than bigger and better court complexes, the need of the hour is to focus on modernising the courtroom. “Discussions on infrastructure have been largely quantitative, that is on building more courtrooms. Though building more courtrooms is necessary and important, there was very little emphasis on modernising existing courtrooms. In this regard, though the pandemic has posed a lot of problems to access to justice, it has paved the way for modernising the courtroom,” Justice Bobde said. “I see a trend of having smaller courtrooms in the future because of Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad’s ministry. The e-filing and data which can be contained is going to take away the need for many storage rooms and many rooms which are necessary for storing paper. The SC has done its bit on issues of court infrastructure. It has devised benchmarks and frameworks for minimum standards,” he added.The new building of the Bombay High Court at Goa will also witness, as its first event, a full-court meeting of the Bombay High CourtBesides five Supreme Court judges, around 62 judges of the Bombay High Court, including Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and its benches in Aurangabad, Nagpur and Goa, were also in attendance at the inaugural function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/union-law-minister-praises-judiciary-for-stepping-up-during-the-pandemic-101616851658339.html

27-03-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru has a school for women who wish to cycle!||For women who wish to pedal their way to a more sustainable way of commuting, an initiative that works to include more women in the cycling community has been launched in the city, called Cycle School for Women. A collective effort of Pedal in Tandem, Jhatkaa.org (a non profit, startup campaigning organisation), DULT (Directorate of Urban Land Transport ) and Church Street First, the aim is to make Bengaluru cycle-friendly especially for women cyclists. “We realised through various studies and surveys that there was a low participation of women in the city’s cycling community, due to various factors such as safety and personal inhibitions. We need to promote cycling infrastructure, with a focus on safety, keeping women at the centre of our initiative. To open streets for women cyclists would tantamount to the streets being safe for everyone,” says Nimisha Agarwal, a senior campaigner with Jhatkaa.org. At Cycle School for Women, workshops are being organised on Sundays at Church Street with a two-pronged approach. “First, we are teaching women to cycle, so that they can be a part of the thriving cycling community in the city. Bengaluru has been working towards greater pedestrianisation and cycle-centric infrastructure to its citizens. Secondly, we want to equip existing women cyclist with practical skills such as fixing a tyre, so that they can continue to use cycle as a mode of transport,” explains Gowri Omanakuttan, a campaigner with #BengaluruMoving, which aims at solving the mobility crises in Bengaluru, adding, “The workshops, part of a pilot project, have seen tremendous response; we have over 150 sign ups from women who are interested in learning or upgrading their skills.”Sonam Motreja, a resident of Shanthi Nagar who attended the cycle workshop feels this initiative will help women get over their inhibitions about cycling. ““I always wanted to go back to cycling, which I greatly enjoyed in my childhood. Women in general get perturbed by what society might think if they go out to cycle, especially if they are middle-aged. But it was heartening to see volunteers motivate women of all age groups, and were patiently teaching us. This will instil more confidence in women like me to go back to our favourite hobby!”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-has-a-school-for-women-who-wish-to-cycle-101616845248064.html
27-03-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: CricZone that bats (& bowls) for women||PUNE A single tweet or a social media post can change your life… that is the story of Yash Lahoti. Lahoti is founder of Breaking Boundaries, a company that has created a platform to promote women’s cricket - Women’s CricZone. In the beginningBorn and brought up in town called Malegaon in Akola district in Vidarbha, Lahoti did his schooling till Class 10 there. He completed his Class 12 education in Hyderabad and then came to Pune for his computer engineering course at the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT). Says Lahoti, “I started my engineering in 2013, but after the first year itself, I understood that it is not my cup of tea. I started taking lot of interest in events like the tech and cultural fests. I thought management is something I like. I loved marketing, getting sponsors, handling finance. So, after completing my engineering, I was searching for jobs in the marketing domain only. I joined Mojo Networks in July 2017, where I handled marketing activities and social media. I worked there for 13 months and left the job in August 2018.”Family supportI come from a Marwadi family and so starting a business was never a problem. When I called up my dad and said that I want to leave my job and start a business, his response was very clear –“do it”, but don’t stress too much. Lahoti said, “My dad says at no given point in time should you blame the business failure – if it did – on yourself alone.”Women’s CricZone (WCZ)Women’s CricZone was started to bridge the gap between coverage of women’s and men’s cricket. This gap has been prolonged for many years, where women’s cricket has not been given much importance. Cricket is generally liked in India and it grabs the majority of TV viewership. That was the point breaker, says Lahoti. He recalls, “I am also a big, passionate fan of cricket. For me it was like, why is it that women’s cricket is not getting traction? Or coverage? Or viewership? So, I started with a Twitter handle during the 2017 World Cup. I tried to provide information to the public and people liked it. The social media handle got some traction and then after three to four months, a lot of people started messaging me to create a website to give detailed information to the public. Since I was working at another company at the time, I knew that I would not be able to manage it all on my own. I could create a website, given my educational background of computer engineering, but I could not get necessary information or write. A lot of people offered their contribution as freelancers. So, December 2017 we did that.”A life-changing “tweet”Says Lahoti, “In March 2018, there was a tri-series between India, Australia and England, going on at the Brabourne stadium in Mumbai. I was in the city for some office work for a week and I was there watching the match in the first half. There was a 11-year-old girl sitting in the crowd, watching the match, along with her parents. It was interesting. She was sitting about 100 metres away from the commentary box where Isa Guha, Melanie Jones and Anjum Chopra were present. The little girl was trying to approach them but the security guards were not allowing her. Women CricZone had a decent social media following then and I dropped a tweet and tagged Anjum, Melanie and Isa. Melanie Jones replied to the tweet, but since she was on air at that time, Anjum and Isa came and sat with the girl in the crowd for 10 minutes. They asked the girl to come again after couple of days during the India-England game and offered her the opportunity to meet all the other cricketers. The little girl got autographs of all the players in the dressing room. That was the point when I thought women’s cricket is growing, but has not got the backing needed. That was the tipping point for me. I started making a business plan. It was clear that I can’t run this as an NGO and so I left my job and started this full time. Team building Lahoti says, “How to grow was the next big question. With the website we were able to reach out to normal fans, but how to reach stakeholders, who are either playing the game (male or female cricketers), or sponsors. So, we decided to create a high-quality magazine which covers different nuances of the women’s game. Sidhant Patnaik was editor-in-chief of our magazine, but he passed away. Ananya Upendran then joined us as managing editor. After Ananya, S Sudarshanan and Ayan Mukherjee joined our team and the total strength now is 10.”On the hiring strategy, Lahoti says, “Hiring is the most critical part of building a startup. That is something that will take you either to the top or bottom. You need to have right people at the right time in your startup.”First investors When I started in August 2018, I met Vinit Deo, founder of Posiview Consulting. Deo wanted to be an active part of my idea and joined me. Deo used to take care of finance and investment. Deo introduced us to serial investor Chinmay Bhosale. My uncle from Hyderabad too came on board. Our legal advisor is Vivek Sadhale of LegaLogic and he introduced us to Hodek Ventures, who were looking to invest in companies. Hodek’s managing director Abhijit Khanvilkar is also a cricket fan.Chitale Group partner Indraneel Chitale and Pranitya Wealth founder Praveen Bhalerao came on board too. Deo also was instrumental in getting Sunandan Lele as mentor and cricketer Kedar Jadhav as an investor. Mentors Lahoti says, “We have got good mentors who have guided us from time to time. After we raised our first round of funding, we started getting a lot of traction on our social media and website. One of our mentors advised us to start the magazine while the other suggested an award show. The first show was organised at Bhubaneshwar.”“Commentator Prakash Wakankar, Sunandan Lele, Vinit Deo, Indraneel Chitale everybody brings a lot of experience from their respective fields. These mentors give us solutions to our problems. They show us the path and we follow it.” Platforms and responses“In terms of engagements and conversations Twitter is the preferred platform and in terms of viewership, especially videos, Facebook is the platform which is driving our content. 85 per cent of our audience is from India and it is very widespread,” says Lahoti. Recalling the lockdown days, Lahoti says, “After the Covid-19 pandemic hit last year, we have reinvented ourselves. We initially focussed a lot on on-ground coverage. What to do when for seven to eight months there is no cricket at all? We started doing lot more video content. We didn’t want people to forget us. Now the matches have resumed, so we are also back covering the game.”Future plansSays Lahoti, “Last year was very challenging, but next year is going to be very interesting. Consider the December 2021 to March 2023 period - in about 14 months we have three world cups. We have the first under-19 women’s cricket World Cup; the 50-over and 20-over World Cups. Women’s cricket will be played at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July 2022. ICC has announced that there will be a women’s cricket global tournament every year from 2022 to 2031. So, for the next 10 years, there will be four 50-overs World Cups, four T-20 World Cups and two T-20 Champion’s Cups. The T-20 Champion’s Cup is a new category that ICC has introduced wherein the top six teams will participate. We are also expanding our portfolio and want to make women’s cricket content available and accessible to all.”Investor speakChinmay Bhosale“Of course, a combination of cricket and India is a no- brainer when it comes to business. However, what struck me the most was the fact that it also came with a cause - spreading women’s cricket in the world. Today, the success of WCZ has prompted official registered cricket boards as well as startups to take up to this idea which is eventually helping to spread awareness and popularity of women’s cricket. This was the fundamental vision behind supporting Lahoti in his endeavour, and the conviction on the vision was sufficiently strong to understand that money would also follow in due course. Today, most of the world cricketing bodies, ICC Hall of Famers and international women players have knowledge of WCZ’s work and that speaks volumes of the journey which Lahoti and team have managed to cover till date,” Bhosale says.Indraneel Chitale, partner, Chitale Group“Women’s cricket has been a fascinating area and the way the sport is picking up, I felt Lahoti was poised to become the go-to point in that industry. The diverse applications that the platform offers like data, association and now streaming, are great avenues and Lahoti has built a good team around him that led us to invest in this venture.”Vinit Deo, CEO, Posiview Group“Posiview Ventures looks at supporting entrepreneurs who work on startups that are “made In India”, for the World. When Yash met us we were impressed with his vision of being the World’s number 1 platform for Women’s cricket - a sport that is on the verge of take-off. With our network built over the last two decades, we could help Lahoti in creating an advisory board, get initial advertisers, as well as assist in putting together an organisational structure and processes to be ready for growth. We have already raised one round of angel funding from marquee investors and the next round is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-criczone-that-bats-bowls-for-women-101616844582160.html

First, it was said that it's a 14-day cycle between infection and recovery. Experts said if all activities close for 21 days, it won't spread. Lockdown was extended but it didn't stop completely. So I don't think lockdown is a solution,” he told news agency ANI.Jain’s comments come a day after Delhi logged 1,534 fresh cases, which takes the city’s total confirmed cases to 654,276. The daily spike reported on Friday was the highest since the beginning of this year.

We are also doing contact tracing and isolation,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Commenting on the vaccination drive in the city, Jain said not many people are tech-savvy and so they face difficulty in registering for the shot. “Even if they get registered they get busy & don't reach centers. So, the government has decided to keep 3 pm-9 pm as a window when people can go for vaccination without registration,” he told ANI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The minister asserted that hospitals in the city have a sufficient number of beds as of now. “The occupancy is around 20% now, 80% of the beds are unoccupied.

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda bus operators block road to protest govt tribute to Covid victims||Private bus operators blocked the road outside the Bathinda bus stand on Saturday in protest against the district administration and police after traffic was stopped from 11am to noon to pay tribute to those who lost their lives to Covid-19. The private operators alleged that the police stopped the buses forcefully, so now they have decided to block the road till 4pm. The Punjab government had directed that one hour’s silence be observed every Saturday to pay tribute to the people who had died due to Covid-19 in the state. During that hour, traffic movement would not be allowed on roads except state and national highways. Emergency services and supply of essential commodities were exempt from the order. Sunny Dhillon, the co-owner of a private bus company, said: “What will happen by stopping traffic for an hour? It won’t help the families of those who have died due to Covid-19. Instead, the police should have donated their day’s salary to help the families. To protest against the administration, we have now decided to block the road till 4pm,” he said. Superintendent of police Jaspal Singh said following state government directions, traffic was stopped for an hour in the city. “The protest is illogical as the traffic was stopped to pay tribute to the people who died of Covid-19. They should also pay respect to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-bus-operators-block-road-to-protest-govt-tribute-to-covid-victims-101616830116942.html

This is the sixth such racket to have been busted in less than a month by the Amritsar district rural police. Five such illegal manufacturing units were unearthed at Chapa Ram Singh, Lakhuwal, Khiala Kalan, Kotli Sakka and Jasso Nangal villages after the police conducted similar raids. The arrested accused are Balwinder Singh, Karnail Singh, Shamsher Singh and Sukhdev Singh of Chak Mishri Khan.

We are trying to find out to whom they had been supplying it.” He said the property of the accused, amassed through the illegal trade, would be attached. A case was registered under Sections 61-1-14 of the Excise Act at the Lopoke police station. Weekend night operations based on intel inputs Attari deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Gurpartap Singh Sahota, and DSP, detective, Gurinderpap Singh were part of the raiding team.

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||22 migratory birds found dead in HP’s Pong wetland, triggering bird flu fears||At least 22 migratory birds have been found dead in the Pong Dam wetland over the past two days, triggering avian flu fears barely three months after an outbreak in the region that left more than 5,000 such birds dead. The wildlife wing of the Himachal Pradesh forest department has put its teams on alert. “Twenty-two birds were found dead, and their samples have been sent for testing,” state forest minister Rakesh Pathania said on Saturday. Fourteen birds were found dead at Ransar Garhi and eight carcasses were spotted by villagers in the Nagrota Surian forest area. “The migratory birds have died an unnatural death over the past two days. We conducted an on-the-spot inspection and collected their blood, stool, tracheal and cloacal samples,” said Rahul Rohne, the divisional forest officer, wildlife, Pong Dam. The samples have been sent to the Northern Region Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar. Mortality mostly in bar-headed geese The mortality has been found mostly in bar-headed geese that migrate from Mongolia to Pong Dam in winter. This season, a total of 40,570 bar-headed geese were spotted at the lake. This is the highest number among bird species at the lake. Areas within a 3km radius of the spots where the carcasses were found dead have been put under surveillance and the forest department has constituted 10 teams to keep track of the situation. The forest staff with the help of the local panchayat representatives, mahila mandals and yuvak mandals are spreading awareness in villages surrounding the water body that is spread 240 sq km. Largest manmade wetland of North India The Pong Dam wetland in Kangra district is one of the largest manmade wetlands of North India, formed by the construction of the dam on the Beas river, in 1974. This is the first major wetland that offers a transitory resting reserve for migratory birds coming from the trans-Himalayan zone in winter when the wetlands in Europe and North and Central Asia freeze. Flocks of waterfowls that breed in these areas in summer undertake migration to Pong wetlands to spend winter in congenial climatic conditions from October to March every year. Wetland supports 415 bird species Pong wetland supports 415 bird species belonging to more than 60 families. The wetland has an untapped potential for bird watching, camping, water sports, nature/heritage tourism and other recreational activities. Rare species of vultures, falcons, Indian skimmer, red-necked grebes, white-fronted geese and waders have been sighted in the wetland. Bar-headed geese, which visit Pong in large numbers, constitute more than 40% of the world’s population of the species. This makes the wetland the largest single congregation destination for bar-headed geese not only in India but also in the world. More than 1.08 lakh birds belonging to 96 species were sighted at the lake this year.

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal MC polls: Covid norms go for a toss in campaign heat||With campaigning for the municipal corporation elections slated for April 7 intensifying, party workers from different camps have been seen blatantly disregarding coronavirus protocols even as the hill-state is witnessing a surge in cases.Though chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has asked authorities to pull up those not adhering to the pandemic protocols and his party had claimed to have transitioned to a virtual working style, most BJP party workers at an election rally in Mandi were without masks and sitting close together on Thursday. The CM was one of the few people seen wearing a mask.Not adhering to standard operating procedures can make such meets and rallies super-spreader events. When contacted, the chief minister said the government was keeping a strict vigil on the situation and will take all steps to check spread of the virus. “We have banned official fairs and festivals in the state. No indoor function, including political functions, can have more than 50% of the venue’s capacity with a limit of 200 people. Similarly, outdoor political, cultural and social functions must not have gathering of more than 50% of the capacity. SoPs must be diligently followed,” he said.BJP chief Suresh Kashyap said he had also observed that people were not adhering to the norms while attending rallies. “This is not the time to become lax. The state is already witnessing a spike in Covid cases. We will make sure all party workers wear masks and adhere to protocols. All party leaders have been instructed to make sure that guidelines are followed in letter and spirit,” he said.Congress leaders also admitted that the situation may very well spiral out of hand. “Increase in Covid cases is matter of grave concern. Therefore, I ensure that all party workers involved in election campaign wear masks and follow guidelines during electioneering, “said Harshwardhan Chauhan, five-time legislator and Congress observer for Solan municipal corporation.Guidelines issued to workers: BJP Himachal’s BJP media in-charge Rakesh Sharma, who is campaigning for the Dharamshala MC, said the party had issued guidelines to workers asking them to wear masks and carry extra masks to distribute among people without one. “We have also decided to hold corner meetings and avoid big rallies so that fewer people gather” he said.Amid the Covid surge, the state has made ‘no mask, no service’, the new guiding principle for common people in Himachal. The new guidelines came into effect from Friday. The government has proposed to start an aggressive campaign and to impose penalties on those not wearing masks. The government has also put restrictions on festivals and fairs in addition to social gatherings and cultural events at night.After a brief let-up in the beginning of the year, Covid cases are again on the rise in Himachal. The surge that began in the last week of February seems to be peaking.Himachal had recorded 2,971 new infections till March 25, a rise of over 167% as compared to February when 1,109 cases were reported in the state. Thirty-four people have died due to the virus while active cases are nearing 2,000. Since the outbreak on March 20, the state has recorded 61,616 infections while 1,016 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-mc-polls-covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-in-campaign-heat-101616819197078.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Fire breaks out at a godown in Mumbai’s Prabhadevi area, 15 fire tenders at spot||A fire broke out at a godown of electric wires in Mumbai’s Prabhadevi area on Saturday. At least 15 fire tenders have been rushed to the spot and fire fighting operations are underway.The level-three fire was reported at 5.42am in the basement of a ground-plus five-storey facility at Prabhadevi. No injuries have been reported so far.The Prabhadevi fire comes a day after a massive fire in a Covid-19-designated hospital in the city’s Bhandup area. Nine patients, of whom six were on the ventilator, died in the fire at the Sunrise Hospital, located inside the Dreams Mall on Friday.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the spot, has ordered an inquiry into the incident, and announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh to the family of the deceased, and asked for their forgiveness.“If there is any negligence or delay in it, it will be investigated and action will be taken against those who are responsible for it,” Thackeray said, adding that the hospital was functioning on temporary permission that was due to end on March 31.The firefighting system, including sprinklers, was not functioning at the hospital, officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said, adding that notice for non-compliance with fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered a fire audit of all the Covid-19 hospitals and health centres following the incident while the city’s mayor Kishori Pednekar has ordered an additional inquiry into how a Covid hospital was allowed to run inside a mall.There were 78 patients in the hospital at the time of the incident. Two were already dead after failing to recover from Covid-19 while nine died due to the fire, according to BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fire-breaks-out-at-a-godown-in-mumbai-s-prabhadevi-area-15-fire-tenders-at-spot-101616816108503.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Phone-tapping: Devendra Fadnavis says fact-finding report full of fallacies||BJP leader Devendra Fandavis on Friday alleged that the fact-finding report submitted to the Maharashtra government by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte over the phone-tapping allegations is full of fallacies.Kunte had been asked to submit the report into the alleged police transfer racket by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the wake of Fadnavis’s allegations that the state government suppressed IPS officer Rashmi Shukla’s letter to the then DGP, based on phone intercepts, on a “transfer scam”.Kunte’s report said, “Despite stamping the letter as TOP SECRET, Rashmi Shukla seems to have leaked the letter, which is very serious matter. If it is proved, she will be liable for strictest action against her.”Also Read: In Mumbai, an explosive scare, a murder, and now – a political crisisTalking about it, Fadnavis said on Friday, “The Indian Telegraph Act quoted in the report is presented to public in a manner convenient to the government. The report in itself is full of fallacies. Although there are sufficient provisions to tap the phone calls, the government is not ready to accept it.”“The then DGP Subodh Jaiswal had recommended a CID probe (into the alleged transfer scam) based on the conversations among police officials and other persons involved in it. Then why no action was taken on his recommendations?” he asked.The Act empowers the official to intercept calls to avoid any possible offence that could happen, he said, adding that the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of the Maharashtra police has all the rights to carry out phone-tapping.When asked about the leaking of ‘top secret’ report, the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly said, “I had only shared a two-page letter (related to Shukla’s letter), whereas it was state minister Nawab Malik who leaked some of its pages. I was even contacted by some journalists after they received the report from Malik.”If any action has to be taken, it should be against Malik, he added.“I think state ministers Malik or Jitendra Awhad had prepared the report and chief secretary Kunte must have signed it. I have enough proof with me. If there is a legal action, then I will produce it before the court,” he claimed.Out of all the names mentioned by Malik citing the list, 12 officials have received the postings as per their request, he claimed.Awhad had on Wednesday alleged that Shukla, then Commissioner of Intelligence, sought permission for intercepting the calls of certain persons, but actually the calls of some other persons were tapped.In his reaction, Nawab Malik said Fadnavis seemed to be afraid that a “person close to him” would be in trouble as an offence has been registered in the case.Amid the controversy over Shukla’s report, an FIR was registered on Friday against an “unidentified person” for leaking confidential documents from the SID.“A person close to him (Fadnavis) had tweeted about the report first...who gave the documents to the person close to Fadnavis?“I can see Devendra-ji is somewhat afraid after the offence has been registered. Legal action will be taken,” the NCP minister said.He also took exception to Fadnavis’s comments against the chief secretary “who is an honest officer”.Another NCP leader and minister Jitendra Awhad termed Fadnavis’ comments as “ridiculous”.By making such a comment, Fadnavis “insulted” Kunte, he said, accusing the BJP of working in a way that demoralises officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-mumbai-an-explosive-scare-a-murder-and-now-a-political-crisis-101616813256161.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||9 patients, 6 on ventilator, killed in fire at hospital in Mumbai mall||Nine Covid-19 patients, mostly senior citizens, were killed on Friday after a massive fire broke out at Sunrise Hospital, located inside the Dreams Mall in Bhandup, officials said. Six of the dead were on ventilators.The fire started on first floor of the mall on Thursday night and soon spread to the third floor, which houses the hospital. Officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said the firefighting system, including sprinklers, were not functioning. A notice for non-compliance of fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, they added.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the spot, ordered an enquiry into the incident, announced ₹5 lakh compensation to the family of the deceased, and asked for their forgiveness.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has ordered a fire audit of all the Covid-19 hospitals and health centres in the wake of the incident, and Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar has ordered an additional inquiry into how a Covid hospital was allowed to run inside a mall.“If there is any negligence or delay in it, it will be investigated and action will be taken against those who are responsible for it,” said chief minister Thackeray. “The hospital was functioning on a temporary permission that was due to end on March 31. Unfortunately, the fire started on the first floor [of the mall]. Many Covid patients were safely taken out of hospital.”Thackeray also pulled up the administration. “We wake up after such incidents and inquiries are ordered. I have already asked state authorities to carry out structural and fire audits of hospitals and Covid Care Centres and Jumbo facilities and ensure no such incidents happen. Some people who were on ventilators could not be saved. I ask for forgiveness for their families.”According to BMC, there were 78 patients in the hospital at the time of the incident. Two were already dead after failing to recover from Covid-related complications, and nine died due to the fire.The blaze was first reported at around 11.45pm on the first floor of the mall. MFB was yet to give details about the cause of the fire. Sunrise Hospital authorities contended in a statement that it responded responsibly to the incident, and called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread.“The fire was on the first floor of Dreams Mall, Bhandup, and not in the hospital. The smoke had reached up to Sunrise Hospital located at the top floor. All fire alarms beeped and hence all patients were safely evacuated due to the smoke to the fire refuge area .There were two dead bodies (due to Covid) which were also evacuated. There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilator and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals,” the hospital claimed.It further said that the hospital was started in “exceptional circumstances of Covid last year”, and was “functioning with all due compliances”.“The hospital staff did their best in safely evacuating patients on wheelchairs and beds to the refuge areas and by following the fire drills. The patients were then shifted with the help of local authorities... We have spoken to the authorities and request them to investigate and find the cause of the fire. The guilty need to be punished as the lives of people have been lost in the unfortunate incident,” the statement added.Hemant Parab, deputy chief fire officer, MFB, said the mall was in violation of safety norms. “In the backdrop of a fire last year in City Centre Mall, we had inspected this particular Dreams Mall. A notice was issued to them for non-compliance of fire safety violations due to certain concerns. During fire fighting also we observed that none of the fire safety mechanisms got activated inside the mall. We will conduct a detailed probe into the incident now.”Though the fire was brought under control by Friday afternoon, , firefighting was underway at the time of going to print. Till Friday evening, BMC had traced 46 patients who were evacuated from the hospital. Several of them shifted to nearby hospitals, whereas some opted to go back to their homes, the civic body said.A political slugfest also began after the incident, with the Bharatiya Janata Party blaming BMC of cutting corners to allow the hospital to function.“A case of homicide should be registered against the officials who allowed the operations of the hospital inside the mall. Despite repeated complaints by local BJP corporator Sakshi Dalvi, it was ignored due to political pressure. In reply to the complaint in writing, the Medical Officer Health Department of BMC said that they had issued a certificate of registration to Sunrise Hospital. The fire brigade also issued a no-objection certificate,” BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde said.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also visited the spot, said, “It seems that the authorities have not learnt from past incidents in Bhandara or even in Apex Hospital in Mulund last year. The government has not woken up even after similar incidents in the past. We cannot expect anything better from the BMC considering its system is filled with corruption.”The BMC, on its part, said it will probe if there were any other violations. “The hospital had occupation certificate and also the fire compliance to operate, but we are told there were fire violations inside the mall. However, that is under fire department’s purview, but I have asked my staff to investigate whether there were any other structural violations inside the mall,” assistant municipal commissioner V Acharekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/9-covid-patients-killed-in-fire-at-mumbai-hospital-101616796965257.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||High end job scam went for qualified people seeking managerial jobs with MNCs||Delhi Police has arrested five men who ran a “high-end job scam” in which they duped professionals looking for mid to senior managerial positions in multinational companies (MNCs), officers aware of the investigation said on Friday.The gang allegedly cheated about 500 jobseekers of nearly ₹7.5 crore. The gang’s kingpin, who was among those arrested, holds an MBA and a PhD in human resources (HR), police said.The group targeted people with an MBA or other postgraduate degrees, who had several years of experience, were earning six-figure monthly salaries, and looking to land senior posts such as senior manager or vice-president in leading private firms.The members of the group would gather the contact information of such jobseekers from their sources in recruitment agencies, police said.“An Uttam Nagar resident, who filed a complaint a few weeks ago, alerted us to the gang. He was duped of ₹20 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy. He further said the fraudsters first posed as representatives of a reputed recruitment agency, and later as senior managers of an MNC that the victim was hoping to join at some point in his career. The man was made to deposit the money into various bank accounts on the pretext of payments for the selection process, document verification, profile completion, aptitude test, references, and other such expenses.Investigators analysed the phone numbers from which the victim received calls, and examined the money trail, before zeroing in on an alleged fake call centre operating from Gurugram. The five men who were arrested include the alleged mastermind, 44-year-old Manoj Hota, and two of his associates, Ashish Ranjan and Abhishek Kumar, both of whom have engineering degrees. The other two men, Sonu Rawal and Shaik Pintu, did not hold degrees and primarily kicked off conversations with jobseekers.Roy said Hota was a visiting faculty in various universities and colleges -- he did not name them -- and at one point had tried to start his own college. He was deep in debt when he planned the job racket.His targets were well-placed individuals looking for high-paying private jobs so that he could make more money by targeting fewer people, police said. “He hired men with strong communication skills so that they could pass themselves off as senior managers of MNCs,” said the DCP. Ranjan served as the primary manager for the call centre, while Kumar was the “star caller” who lured job seekers.The DCP said the suspects have been booked for cheating, impersonation and forgery.The police have seized seven computers and 14 mobile phones from them, which they will examine to gather more evidence against the suspects. Officers involved in the investigation said police will also attempt to identify more victims and try to recover the money duped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-end-job-scam-went-for-qualified-people-seeking-managerial-jobs-with-mncs-101616796909172.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Both men were forced to clean the tank on threat of wage cut, say their families||Family members and relatives of the two men who died late Thursday while cleaning a septic tank at a banquet hall in east Delhi said their loved ones used to work as daily wagers in weddings and they never were made to clean tanks before. The families said the two men were not provided any protective gear or safety equipment by the management of the banquet hall where the tragedy took place. They were promised a meagre ₹1,500 per man for the job, police later said.The two men who died were identified as 35-year-old Lokesh Kumar and Prem Chand, 40. Both worked at wedding parties in the catering department and lived in Trilokpuri, east Delhi.HT visited the banquet hall on Friday afternoon but it was found locked. There was no one from the management outside the hall to comment on how the two men had entered the tank without protective gearDeepak Kumar, the deceased Lokesh’s, brother-in-law, said, “ I got information around 1am about Lokesh’s death. When I reached the banquet hall, their bodies were still inside the tank. Police took the bodies out by 2am after which we came to the hospital. I told my sister that her husband was unwell. Only by Friday afternoon could I tell her that he was dead,” Kumar said.Lokesh is survived by his wife, who used to work as a domestic help and their two children -- a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. Deepak said Lokesh was the only earning member of the family.Kumar said it came to them as a surprise that Lokesh had got into the septic tank to clean it. “He worked as a catering labourer at parties and wedding functions. He had never done tank cleaning work before. We have learnt that he and Chand both had been called in for a catering job but were then made to clean the septic tank. They were threatened that their payments would not be cleared if they did not clean the tank. They were also not given any protective gear to do the work,” Deepak said.Lokesh’s parents live in Shimla. He had four brothers who live with their parents.Prem Chand’s elder brother, Radhey Shyam, who works as a security guard, said he got a call around 7am informing him about his brother’s death. He also said his brother had never worked as a septic tank cleaner before.“My brother had never cleaned a septic tank. I’m sure he and the other person were both forced to do that job. We want adequate police action against the owner of the banquet hall and those who forced my brother to get into the tank without any protective gear,” Shyam said.Chand is survived by three brothers, wife and two sons -- aged 15 and nine years. All of them live in Trilokpuri.During the early hours of Friday, at least 40-50 people from the two men’s families and Delhi sanitation workers unions had also gathered outside the banquet hall and staged a protest there demanding the immediate arrest of the owner and the housekeeping manager. Both have been detained for questioning.Chairman of the union Sanjay Gehlot said despite the government providing machines to clean septic tanks and sewers, people continue to use daily wagers as that is the cheaper option. “This amounts to cruelty to humans. The workers were also not given any safety equipment or protective gear before they got into the tank. We demand that adequate compensation be given to the families of the two men,” Gehlot said.No compensation has been announced for the families as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/both-men-were-forced-to-clean-the-tank-on-threat-of-wage-cut-say-their-families-101616796880269.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s ambitious road revamp plan hits green ministry roadblock||The Delhi government’s ambitious project to redesign 540km of the city roads, along the lines of those in European countries, has hit a roadblock days after the work began, with the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on Thursday ordering an inquiry against the Delhi public works department (PWD) for allegedly damaging trees and undertaking constructions on a stretch of the Ring Road between Moti Bagh and Mayapuri demarcated as “deemed forest”.Prachi Gangwar, deputy inspector general (forests), regional office of the Union environment ministry, on Thursday sent a letter to the principal chief conservator of forests, Delhi forests department, to file a report on the violations and the action taken against the PWD for violating the Delhi Preservation of Trees (1994) Act.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.“You are requested to submit a factual report based on field inspection in reference of the complaint letter. In case a violation is reported in the matter, action is solicited as per the rules and guidelines of the MoEFCC,” read the letter from Gangwar.The forest department had on March 12 issued a notice to PWD to stop work on a stretch of the Ring Road between south Delhi’s Moti Bagh and Mayapuri for allegedly damaging trees (during trenching) in an area which is a deemed forest. This stretch is among nine roads that are to be redesigned on a pilot basis, as part of the Delhi government’s “redesigning and street scaping of roads” plan, announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in 2019.Ring Road also features in the original list of areas identified as deemed forest land in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court by the Delhi forest department in 1997 in the TN Godavarman Thirumulpad v Union of India case.In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acres having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,” are considered ”deemed forests”, according to the affidavit.For any “non-forest related activity” to take place in such an area, permissions have to be sought from the Union ministry of environment, under the Forest Conservation Act (1980).A senior forest department official said they are conducting inspections on the stretch and added that a detailed report will be submitted before the Union ministry.PWD officials confirmed that work on the portion of the road has been stopped on the forest department’s orders.“We have followed all guidelines. Such objections were not raised by the forest department earlier. However, the work on the stretch has been stopped after the notice,” said a PWD official aware of the project, asking not to be named.CM Kejriwal, this January, conducted a review meeting on the status of the road redesign project and directed officials to finish work by 2023. However, just days after initial work was started, the work was stopped, citing violations.These nine stretches include redesigning from Mayapuri to Moti Bagh; All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to Ashram; Outer Ring Road from Nigambodh Ghat to Magzine Road crossing; Narwana Road – Mother Dairy to Panch Mahal Awas; Ambedkar Nagar to Defence Colony (BRT corridor); Road number 43 – Britania Chowk to the Outer Ring Road West Enclave; Wazirpur depot crossing (NSP) to Rithala Metro; from Moti Nagar Ring Road T-point to Pusa Road roundabout and Vikas Marg – Laxmi Nagar to Karkari Mor.The PWD official said the project aims not only at making streets look more appealing, but also envisions to make them more pedestrian and cycle friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-ambitious-road-revamp-plan-hits-green-ministry-roadblock-101616791689028.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Non-bailable warrant against accused Fazan Khan after he misses court appearance||A Delhi court has issued a non-bailable warrant (NBW) against an accused, charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the main conspiracy case related to the north-east Delhi riots, after he failed to appear before it during proceedings on Thursday.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat issued the NBW against Faizan Khan after he did not appear before the court despite repeated calls.“Since accused Faizan Khan is absent despite repeated calls, hence, issue NBW against him with notice to his surety for the next date of hearing,” Rawat said in the order passed on March 25.Khan’s counsel said she will move an application for cancellation of NBW against him. On October 25 last year, the Delhi high court had granted him bail after observing that invocation of the UAPA is not valid against him as it is based on nothing but “bald statements”.The judge had said there is no proof on record such as CCTV footage, video or chats of the petitioner with any of the group except the allegation that he provided a SIM on a fake ID in December 2019 and taken a small amount, of ₹200, as payment.On Thursday, the court also directed the police to supply hard copies of the charge sheets filed in the matter to all the 18 accused and posted the matter for further hearing to April 8. It noted that the Delhi high court has vacated the stay on the trial in the case.Khan, then salesperson of a telecom service provider, had allegedly sold a SIM card on a fake ID to co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha. The police had alleged that the SIM card obtained on a fake ID was used to coordinate protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020, after clashes between the new citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control. It left at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-non-bailable-warrant-against-accused-fazan-khan-after-he-misses-court-appearance-101616791634020.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi cabinet gives nod for purchase of 300 e-buses||The Delhi Cabinet on Friday approved a proposal for purchase of 300 low-floor fully electric air-conditioned buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) under the Central government’s “faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles in India (FAME) phase-II” scheme.The government in a statement said the first tender called by DTC in October 2019 was “not found responsive” and, therefore, the process was cancelled. A fresh tender was later called in June 2020, but that too was cancelled as the rates were not found to be competitive. Finally, a third tender in December 2020 was found to be responsive and competitive.“The first prototype of the e-buses is likely to be received by DTC in June 2021. The first lot of 118 buses shall arrive in October 2021, with 100 more buses being added in November. Thereafter, 60 buses will arrive in December, while the remaining 20 buses are likely to be added by January 2022. The buses shall be parked at the Subhash Place Depot, Mayapuri Depot, Rohini-II Depot, Rajghat-II Depot, and Mundela Kalan Depot,” read the statement.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said: “Under the dynamic leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we have been taking a lot of measures to ensure sustainable and state-of-the-art transport facilities and a switch to electric non-polluting modes. In fact, electric buses are being introduced in Delhi for the first time and this is one of the largest engagements of electric buses by any state government or state transport undertaking.”The Delhi government said in its statement on Friday, said, “So far DTC has been operating only buses owned by it. The lowest bidder is M/s. JBM, which has quoted Rs.68.58 per km. The second-lowest bidder, M/s. Tata Motors, has agreed to match the rate quoted by M/s. JBM. Under the tender conditions, M/s. JBM shall operate 200 buses, while 100 buses shall be operated by M/s Tata Motors.”Meanwhile, the Dialogue and Development Commission in association with RMI India organised a webinar under the Switch Delhi campaign on “Accelerating Electrification of Fleets in Delhi” on Friday.“It’s a huge opportunity for logistics operators, last-mile connectivity service providers and cab aggregators to make a switch to EV due to low regulatory burden and progressive EV policy in place in Delhi. We are already seeing this shift. Out of 7700+ EVs registered in Delhi since the launch of Delhi EV policy in August 2020, 85% are commercial vehicles or operating fleets,” said Jasmine Shah, VC-DDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-gives-nod-for-purchase-of-300-ebuses-101616791623068.html

While the city had conducted a high number of tests during these past four days, the increase in cases was not merely a result of that as the positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested -- had also kept rising. It has shot up from 1.31% to 1.80% in these four days, Delhi government data showed.On average, 85,300 tests were conducted daily during the past four days in comparison to nearly 76,000 tests conducted daily in the seven days before that and over 69,200 the week before that.Delhi has reported a positivity rate of more than 1% for the past seven days. The positivity rate – which is indicative of the spread of the infection in an area – had remained below the 1% mark in Delhi for 82 days, according to data shared by the Delhi government. But Friday’s 1.80% positivity rate was the highest since December 16, when it had touched 1.96%.Along with the high number of cases, the city also saw an increase in the number of deaths from Covid-19. On Friday, nine Covid-19 deaths were recorded in the city, which was the highest since January 24, the last day when nine deaths were reported.So far, 10,987 city residents have succumbed to the infection, the state health bulletin said.“Once the number of cases start going up, the number of deaths also increase after around 10 days. This is because the severity of the infection in a patient reaches its peak in the eighth to the 12th day. We have been reporting an increase in the number of cases for over two weeks now. Also, there is a misconception among the people that the virus is causing milder disease this time around, which is not true. We are admitting several people with moderate and severe disease manifestation and they need to be put in the ICU,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care.Delhi has seen an increase in the number of hospitalisations as well, with over 1,000 being admitted over the past three days, according to the health bulletin. The number of active cases or those living with the infection crossed the 6,000-mark as well. This is the highest since December-end.“I am expecting the number of cases to go up further because people are not following Covid appropriate behaviour. And, that is mainly because the number of cases had come down, and people thought that it is like any other infection. There was also the vaccine euphoria. Now, the government needs to strictly enforce norms like wearing masks in public,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine, Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-over-1-000-covid-19-cases-for-fourth-day-on-the-trot-positivity-rate-also-up-101616791612156.html
27-03-2021||Bangalore||Congress picks Satish Jarkiholi for Lok Sabha bypoll||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday approved the candidature of Satish Jarkiholi, party’s sitting legislator from Yenkanmaradi, for the on April 17 Belagavi (Belgaum) Lok Sabha bypoll. Satish is a brother of Ramesh Jarkiholi, the former state minister who finds himself in the thick of an alleged sex scandal in Karnataka that has further pushed the chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led state government to a corner.“He (Satish) has had good control over the district and has been in touch with all sections over the last two months. The scandal may have some perception issues, but it might not impact the votes by much since we are talking about issues like price rise, farm laws and other issues which have aggravated voters in the district,” Vinaya Navalgatti, a Congress leader from the district, said.The announcement came a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared its list of candidates for the three bypolls in the state, including for Belagavi Lok Sabha seat and Basavakalyan and Maski assembly constituencies.Satish Jarkiholi will contest against BJP’s Mangala Suresh Angadi, the wife of late Union minister for railways, Suresh Angadi, who died due to Covid-19 related complications in September last year.Political analysts said the BJP does not often replace one family member with another while handing party tickets. The party has, however, gone with Angadi’s wife, showing some cracks in its confidence, analysts said. They added that by naming Satish Jarkiholi, the Congress has shown some “imagination” and “willingness to give a fight”.Belagavi has been a stronghold of the BJP since 2004, making it harder for the Congress. But the district is also home to powerful families like Jarkiholis and Kattis. Residents have in the past favoured local equations and loyalties to the families over political allegiances, observers said.In 2019, Suresh Angadi won 63.12 % of the vote share securing 761,991 votes against Congress’s Dr Sadhunavar, who polled 370,687 votes, according to data from the election commission of India (ECI).Angadi had won the seat consecutively since 2004 while the Congress’s Amarsinh Vasantrao Patil had won it in 1999, according to ECI data.Interestingly, despite Satish Jarkiholi being from the Congress while his two brothers (Balachandra and Ramesh) are with the BJP, they are a tight-knit family and have come together in the past to thwart off any outside interference into the district, said a political observer.Known for his tactical skills, Satish was instrumental in helping former chief minister Siddaramaiah win from Badami in Bagalkote district in 2018, local leaders said.However, the BJP sounded confident of retaining the seat. “There is really no contest, and the BJP will win. There is a sympathy factor for the wife of Suresh Angadi and the Congress does not stand a chance,” Prabhakar Kore, a former Rajya Sabha member and senior BJP leader from the district, said.Basavakalyan seat fell vacant after sitting Congress legislator B Narayanrao died last year due to Covid-19 related complications. The Congress has fielded the wife of the late leader against BJP’s Sharanu Salagar, a first time MLA contestant.The JD(S) has announced Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri as its candidate for the bypoll to the seta, which, analysts and political leaders said, might split the minority votes of the Congress.In Maski, where bypoll was necessitated after Pratapgouda Patil — who had won on a Congress ticket in 2018 against Basanagouda-Turvihal of the BJP — defected to the BJP along with 17 others in 2019 and helped bring Yediyurappa to power. The Congress has named Turvihal as its candidate for the April 17 bypoll.A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said the bypolls being the first elections in the state after Covid-19, economic distress and the impact of Covid-19 could have a bearing on the outcomes of the bypolls.“Normally the ruling party has an advantage in bypolls held in the first half of the term, but this may not necessarily be true in the second half. These polls are in the second half of the term and are a good indicator to gauge the mood of the people both toward the Union and state government,” Narayana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-picks-satish-jarkiholi-for-lok-sabha-bypoll-101616791588014.html

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Finally, Chandigarh admn releases ₹50 crore to MC for village development||With the UT administration finally releasing ₹75 crore to the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC), the development works in the 13 villages, which were recently added to the civic body, will see the light of the day.Of the ₹75 crore, ₹50 crore have been earmarked for village development funds that were pending for more than a year now.After financial restrictions were imposed by the Centre in the wake of the pandemic, the administration had even ruled out releasing the funds.But in January this year, after a meeting among UT adviser Manoj Parida, new mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and MC commissioner KK Yadav, the administration had assured ₹90 crore dedicated funds for village development. Initially, it had committed to release ₹30 crore of the ₹90 crore within this financial year.“We requested the administration to increase the fund share for village development in this fiscal, and it released an additional ₹20 crore. The rest of the ₹40 crore will be released in the coming fiscal,” said mayor Ravikant Sharma.The MC has been struggling with a paucity of funds, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. The civic body had to acutely depend on the administration’s aid for even paying the salaries of its employees as it failed to achieve its own revenue targets. Against a target of ₹402 crore for 2020-2021, the MC will garner only ₹317 crore in its own receipts.Funds to help MC tide over own liabilitiesThe release of ₹75 will also help the MC tide over its own liabilities like salaries: ₹25 crore of the ₹75 crore have been earmarked to meet MC’s committed liabilities under revenue expenditure for the current fiscal (2020-2021).For the coming fiscal, the administration has approved ₹502 crore grant-in-aid; ₹469 crore is estimated to be generated by the MC on its own receipts like property tax, water tariff, estate, etc. “We will bring additional funds for the city for the coming fiscal too in addition to approved aid,” said Sharma.Sewage, water projects top priorityThere are 22 villages under the jurisdiction of the MC out of which 13—Bahlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas—were transferred in 2019.The MC General House had approved the proposal of ₹102-crore development works in these villages, which have a combined population of more than 50,000.The plan prepared by the MC engineering department includes a new road network, laying of stormwater pipes and sewer lines, electrical and horticulture works, supply of water and installation of more than 1,000 tube-wells.“Our top priority will be upgrading the sewage system and improving drinking water supply systems in these villages. The tender process will be completed within April and we are aiming to start work by April-end,” said Sharma.With MC elections slated for November-December this year, village development is also politically crucial for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party that has come under severe criticism for the lack of development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-chandigarh-admn-releases-50-crore-to-mc-for-village-development-101616790092256.html
27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Dispute over fee: Notice to DPS, Srinagar, over barring girl from online classes||The J&K government issued a notice to Delhi Public School, Srinagar, for allegedly baring a Class-2 student from attending online classes after her parents did not pay for transportation fee and other annual utilities during the lockdown period. The Srinagar additional deputy commissioner has asked the school’s principal to appear before his court on Saturday to clarify his position and asked the school to restore online classes of the student. The parents of the student had filed a complaint with the education department. The student’s father, Wajahat Waseem, said, “For around 20 months since August 2019 when restrictions were imposed in Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370 and due to the Covid lockdown my daughter has not been to school. However, I still paid the monthly fee during the curfew and lockdown period amounting to ₹56,400,” Waseem said.The pending dues amount to of ₹24,000, which includes annual charges that the UT government has barred schools from charging during the lockdown period. “The pending sum includes transportation charges, a service that they did not provide and annual charges such as heating charges. When our child did not attend school, how are these charges justified? This is unscrupulous exploitation on part of the school,” he said.Waseem and his wife Nuzhat Wajahat had written to director school education, Kashmir, complaining that the school had violated provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which is applicable post abrogation of Article 370 and also different circulars of the UT administration.They requested the director to direct the school management to restore his daughter’s online classes and stop them from ‘exploiting’ parents.“The management should also be directed to refund our admission fee amounting to ₹1,10,000 so that we are able to admit our daughter in another educational institution,” the parents wrote in the complaint.Waseem claimed that he had not been paid for seven months. “Right to Education is a fundamental right. How can DPS Srinagar bar a child from attending online classes? The government is still undecided on transportation charges and charging annual charges has been totally banned,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dispute-over-fee-notice-to-dps-srinagar-over-barring-girl-from-online-classes-101616789972192.html

Roads and bazaars, which usually remain crowded during the day, wore a deserted look with farmers blocking highways and main chowks at different points, including Ludhiana Ferozepur highway, Jalandhar-Panipat Highway (NH-44), Bharat Nagar chowk, Samrala chowk, Dugri chowk, and Jalandhar bypass among others. Markets in Model Town, Dugri, Ghumar Mandi, BRS Nagar, and Pink Plaza among others stayed closed till 6pm with shopkeepers extending support to the farmers’ agitation. Various malls in the city also followed suit. President of Model Town Market association, Amarjit Singh, said, “We stand with the farmers in their fight against the three farm laws. They are struggling for their survival and our market association has decided to keep the shops shut till 6pm.”Shopkeepers said they were also facing a tough time due to the restrictions imposed by the government amid continuous spike being witnessed in Covid-19 cases, but the “economy of the state will be completely destroyed by these farm laws”.Similarly, President of Pink Plaza market association, Rubal, said, “We decided to keep the shops shut to show solidarity with the farmers, whom we are supporting in their fight against the injustice being meted out by the Union government.” Commuters, however, faced a harrowing time due to the roadblocks and even police had created diversions at different junctions. The commuters rued that the public should not be harassed by the protesters by blocking all the major roads of the city. Sukhpreet Singh, one of the residents of Dugri area, who was stuck at the canal bridge (southern bypass) on Ferozepur Road, said, “I have to reach civil hospital to meet my relatives, but the protesters have blocked the Ferozepur Road due to which cops are not allowing entry. The police asked me to take the diversion, but it will take much more time than usual to reach the hospital. The farmers should not harass the public during their protests.” Shopkeepers ‘forced’ to down shuttersIncidents were reported from few markets of the city, including Chaura Bazar, Mata Rani Chowk, Books market, and Mall Road, where the protesting farmers allegedly forced shopkeepers to close their shops to strengthen the agitation. The shopkeepers rued that the farmers had announced that they will not force them to shut the shops down. Sonu Nilibar from Ludhiana Cloth Merchants’ Association said, “We are supporting the farmers in their fight against the farm laws, but they should not harass shopkeepers by forcing them to shut down the shops. I had kept my shop closed to express support to farmers, but few other shop owners on Mall Road were forced to closed.”  ‘Industry suffers losses worth ₹500 crore’The Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) stated that the industry suffered losses to the tune of ₹500 crore due to the bandh on Friday. The members of the association had urged the Union government to resolve the matter at the earliest in the anticipation of huge losses. FICO president Gurmet Kular said, “Our economy depends on the farming sector and our economy will survive only by supporting the farmers and not by destroying the farming sector. The government should take note of the problem and resolve the issue at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/markets-shut-trade-suspended-bharat-bandh-evokes-good-response-in-ludhiana-101616789552326.html

Welcoming the Supreme Court judgment which has directed that Ansari be transferred to UP to answer for his crimes there, SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said the verdict had brought down Punjab’s image. “An impression has gone out that the Congress government in Punjab can stoop to any level to extend protection to a criminal. It must answer as to what was its motive to harbour a hardened criminal in its jail and why it went to the extent of spending a large amounts of money for hiring top lawyers to oppose Ansari’s transfer,” said the SAD leader. It’s a slap on Capt govt: BJP BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Friday said the SC order to shift Ansari is a “slap” on the face of the Amarinder Singh government. In a statement, Chugh said it is a moral victory for the law enforcement agencies in the face of blatant patronage granted by the Amarinder government to a criminal who is accused in the murder case. Chugh alleged it was because of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi that Amarinder was not allowing Ansari to be shifted to UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-demands-judicial-probe-into-political-shelter-to-ansari-101616788533509.html

Officials accompanied with representatives of Punjabi University Teachers Union (PUTA) held a meeting with vice-chancellor Ravneet Kaur for two hours on Thursday late evening after 28 officials, including second-in-command dean academic affairs and registrar resigned from their respective posts, citing alleged discrepancies in working of varsity V-C.

However, PUTA has written to Punjab governor and chancellor of the varsity VP Singh Badnore for his immediate intervention to resolve the issue. They also attached the list of officials who resigned from their administrative posts. “There is an atmosphere full of distress on the campus due to autocratic working of the vice-chancellor. The teachers, officials and employees of the university feel suffocated in such a kind of environment,” said PUTA president Nishan Singh Deol in a letter to the chancellor.“The teachers, officers and employees felt insulted in various meetings related to academic and administrative issues,” he stated.The letter further stated that the promotions and extensions of teachers, officials and employees have been delayed unnecessarily by imposing certain conditions even after the completion of the entire process as per the guidelines. “The chancellor’s intervention is not only necessary but also imperative for the future of the university,” Deol said.Meanwhile, V-C Ravneet Kaur, a senior IAS officer, said the issues were discussed in detail during meeting with officials resigned and PUTA representatives. “The meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere. The issues will be resolved the positively at the earliest,” she said, adding that the next meeting will be held soon.“They have been apprised that the promotion cases will be discussed and approved in a systematic manner,” the V-C said.

27-03-2021||Other||Bombay HC upholds life term for woman who got her ailing brother killed||The Bombay high court (HC), while expressing shock at the way in which a woman masterminded the elimination of her brother with the help of three other persons at Pune in 2013, rejected her appeal against the September 2014 conviction and sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life. After hearing the appeal, the court held that as the woman had been hatching a plan for three years to kill her brother, and had been in touch with one of the three co-convicts who carried out her plan by throttling the victim to death, she did not deserve any relief against the conviction and sentence. A division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing the appeals of the four persons against the 2014 conviction by additional sessions judge in Pune for their role in the murder of a software engineer at Bawdhan. The court was informed that the victim suffered from migraine and used to have regular bouts of vomiting and giddiness, and hence, was under treatment of Dr Hemant Manjrekar. The court was informed that on January 25, 2013, the software engineer, Paramjit Singh, was brought to Sahyadri Hospital, Kothrud, by his sister Jagjit, who was accompanied by three young men. The hospital informed the police that though Paramjit was brought in an unconscious state, he died before admission. An accidental death case was filed by the police. However, during the inquest panchnama, the police noticed abrasion marks on the body of the deceased, and hence, a post-mortem report was called for. The report indicated that Paramjit had died due to throttling. Thereafter, on February 20, 2013, a case of murder was registered against Jagjit. During the trial, though Jagjit had deposed as a defence witness and stated that on the day of the murder, she found her brother in an unconscious state on his bed. She called for an ambulance, and with the help of the building watchman and three other men rushed him to the hospital. The prosecution had examined 23 witnesses, including the doctor who was treating Paramjit, and the other doctors who had seen him on the day of his death. The doctors testified that Paramjit could not have throttled himself to death and it was done by someone else. The prosecution then checked the call records of Jagjit and found that she had been in regular touch with Golu Mustak Khan and Lalla Basheer Khan, accused number 2 and 3, who are Gwalior residents. They in Pune on the day Paramjit died. Based on the deposition by the accused, the trial court had arrived at the conclusion that Jagjit had planned to eliminate her brother with the help of the Khans and another person, and hence they were guilty of murder. On September 9, 2014, the court awarded them rigorous imprisonment for life. The court, however, did not dwell on the aspect of their motive. After hearing the submissions, the HC bench held, “The horrendous death of a brother at the hands of a sister is a stigma on the pure relationship between a brother and sister. It is believed that one does not choose a family and a bond between brother and sister is a gift of God. The present case destabilises this belief and shocks the conscience of the court.” The court further noted, “The conduct of accused no 1 [sister] during the prelude to the death of her brother, her association with accused 2 to 4 in the intervening night of 24th and 25th coupled with the false explanation offered by her before the court, leads to the logical inference that the accused no 1 had drawn a master plan to eliminate her brother for the best reasons known to her alone, and she was aided and assisted by accused no 2 and no 3 in executing the plan.” In light of the above observations, the court said that it was not inclined to interfere in the trial court judgment. However, as the prosecution had failed to establish the involvement of the fourth accused in the conspiracy, it extended him the benefit of doubt and acquitted him of all charges and punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-upholds-life-term-for-woman-who-got-her-ailing-brother-killed-101616788171949.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||916-ha of mangroves now a reserved forest||Mumbai: A total of 916 hectares (ha) of mangroves in Borivli taluka of Mumbai (suburban) district were declared a reserve forest under Section 20 the Indian Forest Act (IFA), via gazette notification on March 23.The mangroves are spread across Charkop, Borivli, Manori, Gorai, Goregaon Pahadi, Valnai, Malvani, Marve, Akse, Erangal and Darvali villages. Declaring areas as reserved forest grants them legal sanctity, and aims to conserve biodiversity by curtailing activities like harvesting of natural resources. This development comes three weeks after 409 ha of mangrove forests in Alibag taluka in Raigad district were similarly declared on March 5.This development is part of the state government’s broader campaign to bring all mangroves under the ambit of the IFA, which itself follows a directive of the Bombay high court that all mangrove areas on state land are to be handed over to the forest department for conservation.A little over 3,497 ha of mangroves in Kurla, Borivli and Andheri talukas have been proposed for notification under Section 20 of the IFA, which would indicate that all claims over the earmarked areas have been settled by an appointed forest settlement officer.Of the 3,497 ha, over 2,174 ha were notified in January and February, while 364.5 ha were removed due to claims over the land. Of the remaining 1,773 ha, 916 more hectares (across 11 villages in Borivli taluka) were declared as reserve forest this week. Notification of approximately 857 ha of mangroves remains in abeyance. This includes 21 ha of mangroves in Malvan, which have been kept in abeyance due to claims by the local fishing community, who use the area to store fishing equipment and nets. Officials confirmed that an enquiry in the matter is underway. Another 221 odd hectares are in abeyance for similar reasons across Mumbai suburbs, with the forest settlement inquiry yet to begin.In other cases, notification under Section 20 of the IFA has also been delayed as the ownership of the mangroves lies with organisations like the Navy, the salt department and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), officials claimed. The forest department has sought comments from the APCCF (mangrove cell) as well as the chief conservator of forests (CCF), Thane sub-division, in the matter.“It should be noted that not all remaining 857 hectares have been kept in abeyance. The work is under process to bring as much of it as possible under Section 20 of the IFA. Settlement inquiries, where required, will begin soon,” said Virendra Tiwari, APCCF, mangrove cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/916ha-of-mangroves-now-a-reserved-forest-101616788112519.html
27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Private hospitals reluctant to join vaccination drive in state||Though the Centre has allowed all private hospitals to conduct round the clock vaccination sessions, lukewarm participation of private hospitals in Punjab is hampering the state’s vaccination drive amid the second wave of pandemic.As per state health department, 1,291 private hospitals, both empanelled and non-empanelled with Ayushman Bharat Yojana, providing access to healthcare to the people, have been registered in the state to give Covid-19 vaccine. However, only 300 (24%) of the total hospitals are organising regular vaccination sessions while the remaining are showing reluctance in joining the state government in containing the Covid spread.The central government had capped the cost of inoculation in private hospitals at ₹250 a dose while vaccination for people visiting government facilities is free of cost.Besides private facilities, 524 primary health centres, 152 community health centres, 42 sub-divisional hospitals and 22 district hospitals are also administering vaccines to the people across the state.Experts believe that due to lack of private hospitals’ participation, the state’s vaccination drive may be slowed further when a huge rush of population between 45 to 60 age groups will look out for vaccination sites from April 1.“Covid vaccination centres should have effective crowd management protocols in place, along with adequate space and facilities for seating, water, proper signage, etc. Hospitals need also to ensure adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour among the beneficiaries to start the vaccination process on their premises. However, not all private hospitals in Punjab have sufficient space and facilities to conduct the vaccination. Many hospitals have inadequate staff and manpower to handle the crowd of beneficiaries,” said state nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added: “In Punjab, 588 private hospitals are empanelled with the central government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme and such hospitals have enough space to vaccinate people and to keep them under observation for 30 minutes. Even though these hospitals can easily start the vaccination process, not many are coming forward to buy the vaccine from the state health department. Since the state will start administering jabs to people above the age of 45 from April 1, we are expecting more private hospitals to join the vaccination drive as they will get more benefit.”“The district administrations have been asked to act strictly against such hospitals as private hospitals need to join the government battle against Covid,” he said, adding that government facilities are receiving better response from people than the private hospitals.“My hospital has five rooms and we cannot spare three rooms for the vaccination process. A hospital must have a separate room for registering beneficiaries and for their identification, another room for inoculation and a third room for keeping people under observation. Also, many hospitals do not have enough cold storage facilities for keeping vaccine”, said one Amritsar-based private hospital owner. Hussan Lal, principal secretary health, Punjab, said: “Of the ₹250 capped price per vaccine dose, the hospital gets a benefit of ₹100 while they pay ₹150 to the government for purchasing the vaccine. However, due to commercial considerations, many private hospitals are not willing to start the vaccination process at their centres.”Acting on state government’s directions, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of Amritsar, Himanshu Aggarwal said, “In Amritsar, 66 private hospitals are operating as vaccination centres. We are conducting regular meetings with the hospital owners and are convincing them to join the government’s efforts to control the second wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-hospitals-reluctant-to-join-vaccination-drive-in-state-101616788112055.html

A bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court also questioned as to why the exam process should not be stayed. The court acted on the plea of one Haridya Preet Kaur and one more woman candidate, who had submitted that in accordance with the Punjab Civil Services (Reservation of Posts for Women) Act, 2020, 33% quota for women had to be provided across the board. But the same was not followed in the Balmiki/Mazbhi Sikh category, they claimed. The applications were accepted under the category but when the result was declared, it came to light that no reservation was given to women under the same, the court was told. In June 2020, an advertisement was put out by PPSC for 77 posts and in December it was modified to 75 posts with provisions of the reservation for women as per the 2020 law. The prelims result was declared on March 12 but reservation was not given, says the plea. The high court has sought response by March 31 as it was told that mains exam is to take place anytime between April 1 and April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-issues-notice-to-punjab-govt-ppsc-on-plea-challenging-pcs-2020-prelim-exam-result-101616787994842.html

She allegedly shot herself with the service revolver at her government residence on Thursday.The Amravati police arrested Shivkumar from Nagpur railway station from where he was trying to board a train to Bengaluru. He has been booked under section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code).Initial investigations revealed that the deceased was disturbed by the harassment meted out by her seniors including Shivakumar. Before taking the extreme step, she left a suicide note, in which, she made serious allegations against Shivkumar.According to the sources, the RFO was alone in her quarters when she ended her life. Her mother had left for Satara and her husband Rajesh was in Chikhaldara, where he works on deputation with the treasury department.While levelling allegations against Shivkumar, she mentioned that he used to abuse her in front of juniors, villagers and labourers without any valid reason. Moreover, the DyCF often used to call her to meet late at night and made indecent proposals. She had even complained against the DyCF to the Melghat Tiger Reserve field director M Srinivas Reddy and sought his intervention.After her mother left, she called her husband and told him about her decision to end her life. But before her husband could act, she died by suicide.She was rushed to Harisal Primary Health Centre, from where she was shifted to Dharni but was declared dead on arrival.Amravati district superintendent of police Hari Balaji said that the deceased has blamed the DyCF for taking the extreme step.Her colleagues said that the 32-year-old RFO was known as ‘Melghat’s Singham’, and given her daredevilry, no one believed she could take such an extreme step. She performed her duties fearlessly especially when it came to nabbing wildlife criminals and poachers.Several villagers and forest employees, particularly activists of Maharashtra Forest Rangers Association, on Friday staged a day-long dharna before the office of Melghat Tiger Reserve and demanded stern action against DyCF.Meanwhile, the Dy CF, Shivkumar was suspended from the post while the Field Director of the Melghat Tiger Project was shunted out from the post for not initiating any action on the victim’s complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-senior-forest-officer-held-for-abetting-suicide-of-his-colleague-101616787993661.html

Hiran, whose body washed up ashore the creek on March 5, is linked to the Scorpio that was allegedly used by arrested Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze to plant explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25. The Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) on March 21 arrested two persons in connection with the murder, Vinayak Shinde (a convicted constable) and Naresh Gor (a bookie), named Vaze as the prime suspect in the case. The NIA took custody of the duo on March 24 after they were directed by the Union home ministry to take over the murder probe as it was it was linked to the explosives case. NIA officials cited above said they would interrogate Vaze together with Shinde and Gor on Friday to unearth the conspiracy. The federal agency was investigating the explosives case since March 9 and arrested Vaze on March 13. A special NIA court on Thursday extended Vaze’s custody to April 3. The agency also took custody of all documents pertaining to the murder probe on Thursday. Claiming that they had cracked the case, ATS chief Jaijeet Singh held a press conference earlier this week and said that Shinde had asked Hiran to meet him on the evening of March 4 by pretending to be a police officer named Tawde. The phone and SIM card that Shinde used to make this call were reportedly destroyed later. “It has come to light in the investigation that some of the 14 SIM cards obtained through accused Naresh Gor were activated and given to Shinde, who in turn had transferred the activated SIM cards to others involved in the crime and the SIM cards were used in commission of the said crime. Preliminary investigation has revealed that some of the SIM cards used in commission of the crime and some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used, were destroyed by the accused,” Singh said on Tuesday. A senior police officer clarified that of the 14 SIM cards procured from a person in Gujarat, five were allegedly used by Vaze in the commission of the crime. Two of these five SIM cards were allegedly destroyed, the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The officer added that four phones were also used by Vaze, Shinde and Gor, of which one was destroyed and three were recovered during searches. The person who destroyed the phone has been identified and their statement recorded, the officer said, but did not give any further details of the person’s identity. Hiran’s wife told the ATS in her statement that her husband left the house on March 4, at about 8.30 pm after receiving a call from an officer named Tawde, purportedly a crime branch officer from Kandivli, who spoke to him for 11 minutes. Hiran did not return home after that, and at 11.30 pm, when his wife tried his phone, she found it switched off. Hiran’s body was found the following morning without any of his personal belongings, including his phone, wallet, and jewellery. Meanwhile, the NIA is trying to trace two more high-end cars, including an Outlander, purportedly used by Vaze. It is as yet unclear how the vehicles are connected to the crimes.

In October 2019, the Bombay high court (HC) had found the man guilty of contempt of court and directed Pune Police to arrest him. However, as the police failed to comply, the wife had approached the court on March 12. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice VG Bisht, while hearing the contempt petition filed by the wife, was informed by advocate SN Biradar that even though she had reminded the police of the court order in November 2019, they failed to comply. Biradar further informed the court that in May 2020, when the Supreme Court had upheld the HC’s arrest order, the wife had written to the police in January 2021, but as they had failed to arrest the husband, she had to approach HC again. In 2018, the wife had approached HC, seeking maintenance for herself, her two sons and rent for the house the three lived in. The husband, who is a fitness instructor, was directed to pay a monthly amount of ₹15,000 to the wife, ₹10,000 to each of the sons and ₹8,000 for rent. However, as the husband failed to abide by the order, the wife had filed a contempt petition. In 2019, the court was convinced that the man intentionally failed to pay the amount and passed the arrest order. On March 25, the man moved an application in HC through his counsel, seeking suspension of the sentence as he had handed over a demand draft of ₹5.45 lakh in his wife’s name to her counsel in the court. The man’s counsel submitted that he has already paid ₹1 lakh in addition to this amount to the applicant. However, his wife’s counsel argued that the total arrears till March 2021 was ₹12.9 lakh and not ₹6.45 lakh. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “The judgment delivered by this court on 11/10/2019 thereby directing respondent no 1 [husband] be sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment in civil prison for six months and be taken into custody and be sent to Arthur Road Prison has attained finality.” In light of this, the court directed Dighi police to arrest the husband within a week. On Monday, the police submitted a compliance report to the court stating that they had arrested the husband on March 16 and sent him to jail. The man has filed an interim application seeking the suspension of the sentence awarded to him, which the court will hear on March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-sent-to-mumbai-jail-for-not-paying-maintenance-to-wife-and-sons-101616787876073.html
27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing: Faridkot court issues fresh summons against ex-DGP Saini||After former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini failed to appear before the court in connection with 2015 Kotkapura firing case, Faridkot judicial magistrate Ist class (JMIC) Ekta Uppal on Friday issued fresh summons against him for April 16.The court also disposed of Saini’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance, terming it ‘not maintainable’. On October 10, 2020, Saini was named as accused in Kotkapura police firing case. On January 18, the special investigation team (SIT), probing the 2015 police firing incidents, filed a supplementary chargesheet against Saini naming him as a conspirator in Kotkapura firing case.Saini’s counsel filed an application seeking the exemption from personal appearance of the accused on Friday in the court on medical grounds. The defence also attached Punjab and Haryana high court orders putting stay on arrest of Saini. However, the public prosecutor opposed the application.“The Punjab and Haryana high court stayed the arrest of the accused till March 22 in the present FIR. Then vide the latest order of the high court, the earlier order has been modified, according to which only the arrest of the accused has been stayed. However, the state prosecution has been made at liberty to proceed with the matter in accordance with the law,” said JMIC Uppal. The prosecution said that Saini’s security officer refused to allow the serving official to meet him. “The summon was pasted and affixed outside the house of the accused being served by affixation,” they added.“The prosecution’s basic contention is that the accused is intentionally evading the service of summons and is fully aware about the proceedings, and the counsel is also appearing on his behalf so he can not present want of knowledge. On the other hand, the defence has not presented want of knowledge of the proceedings by the accused but their contention is that due to medical reasons the accused could not put in appearance and the prosecution did not make the personal service of the summons at New Delhi, where accused has been for medical reasons. A copy of medical record is there, as per which advisory of five days rest with prescription,” she said.“But as per the criminal law procedure, once the accused did not appear in the court in person, he cannot be appear through his counsel or anyone else unlike in the civil suit. So, as the accused has not appeared in person to date, question of his exemption from personal appearance for today does not arise. Hence, the application of the defence stands disposed of being not maintainable,” said Uppal.“Now proceeding further, from the application itself it is inferred that accused is well aware about the proceedings, so question of proper service by summons does not sustain at this stage but nevertheless the defence contention regarding medical reasons of the accused is also on the record. Hence, in these circumstances, once again fresh summons be issued to the accused,” she added.The prosecution requested for service of summons through some higher official, allowing the request JMIC said “the summons to the accused be issued for April 16 and the investigating agency may get it effected as per the procedure, for effecting the service.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-faridkot-court-issues-fresh-summons-against-ex-dgp-saini-101616787871934.html

The PET exams are being conducted between March 25 and 27.While some students raised concern about facing internet trouble, a spokesperson for the university clarified that there were no network or technical problems reported by the service provider or the university on Friday. “This might be a result of poor internet connectivity at the candidate’s end,” said the spokesperson.As per figures shared by the varsity, 2,089 candidates out of 3,193 registered, assisted for the exam in the morning session for the humanities faculty for 29 subjects. Similarly, 1,391 candidates out of 1,995 registered, appeared for the exam in the afternoon session for commerce and management faculty for eight subjects. “We didn’t receive any complaints on Friday as both sessions were conducted very smoothly,” added the spokesperson.Students, however, complained that the university helpline didn’t function properly on Friday. “After trying for several minutes, I finally got through, but the official didn’t help much.

27-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Class 10 and 12 students protest offline exams||With the state education department being firm on conducting exams for SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12) offline this year, a large number of students have been protesting the move across the state.While students from Mumbai, Nashik and Nagpur protested the decision early this week, those from Pune assembled outside the state board office on Friday morning to express their disappointment with the move. “The government is playing with our lives by conducting offline exams. With the growing cases of Covid-19, it is a big risk for students to write their exams in the physical format. We hope that the decision is reconsidered, and online exams are allowed at least wherever possible,” said one of the protesting students from HSC.Anubha Sahai, president of Indiawide Parents Association, which has been writing to the department urging the cancellation of offline exams said, “Students are demanding 50% weightage to internal assessments at the school level and 50% to exams. Similarly, they hope for an increase in the number of objective questions and a syllabus reduction of 50%,” said Sahai.An official from the education department said that offline exams will not be cancelled. “Considering the issues of access to online exams, it is only logical to conduct exams offline. Students should not worry as all precautions concerning Covid protocols will be followed strictly,” said the official.While the HSC exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, SSC exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 33 lakh students appear for the exams every year. Students will get their schools and junior colleges as exam centres as per an announcement made by the board last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-class-10-and-12-students-protest-offline-exams-101616787692066.html

27-03-2021||Mumbai||For rise, improved health infra too may not be enough: Maharashtra CM||Maharashtra recorded its highest one-day spike since the onset of the pandemic with 36,902 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday. The state government announced the decision to impose a night curfew from March 28 across Maharashtra. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has directed the state administration to impose strict measures to curb the spread of the infection.Night curfew is generally in force between 11pm and 6am and means a prohibition on more than five people gathering at public places. It is intended to prevent crowding, which increases the chances of Covid-19 being transmitted. The operation of essential services will not be affected by the night curfew. At present, there are no restrictions upon commuting to work or returning to Maharashtra from outstation travel. The state has not clarified how long night curfew will be in place. When it was imposed last year, it continued for 15 days, from December 22, 2020, to January 5 to prevent crowds during new year celebrations.Night curfew is already in force in Pune and certain Covid hotspots like Beed and Nanded are in total lockdown. The Kalyan-Dombivli civic corporation on Friday announced all shops except those selling essential items, offices, hotel and restaurants will remain closed every Saturday and Sunday. However, parcel facility will be allowed. Only 50% of shops will remain open in vegetable markets.As part of its efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19, the state is likely to shorten operational hours of shops and establishments. The CM has directed that malls should be shut down between 8pm and 7am. At present, malls in Mumbai are allowed to remain open till 9.30pm while food courts are operational till 11pm. New rules and guidelines from the state relief and rehabilitation department are expected today.Thackeray has asked district collectors to impose lockdown in districts where cases are rising rapidly, but with sufficient notice and appropriate reasons.The CM gave these instructions in a meeting on Friday, called to review the Covid-19 situation in the state. It was attended by divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners, superintendent of police, civil surgeons of all government hospitals, members of the state and district task forces, deans of all medical colleges along with health minister Rajesh Tope, medical education minister Amit Deshmukh, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and senior officials from concerned departments.“If the people don’t follow Covid-appropriate rules, we will have to impose strict restrictions in coming days… I did not wish to impose a lockdown but seeing the surge in cases there is a possibility that the ramped-up health infrastructure is also going to fall short. Considering this, all district administrations should focus on improving them further,” Thackeray told officials, according to a press release from the CM’s office.Thackeray also said that the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the state government must be strictly implemented and action should be taken against establishments found violating the SOP. He also instructed officials to conduct audits to assess fire safety of temporary hospitals treating Covid patients, following the fire in the makeshift Covid hospital in Bhandup in which 11 people were killed.On Friday, the total number of Covid-19 cases rose to 2,82,451, with Pune leading the state’s tally with 52,340 cases. Nagpur is second with 38,348 cases. There were 112 deaths in the state, bringing the total number of deaths to 53,907.Speaking in Pune, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said harsh decisions such as lockdown may be necessary if the Covid situation does not improve. “I want to tell the people of the state and Pune that the situation is turning serious and the government will be compelled to take some harsh decisions if cases continue to surge in the coming days,” he said. He urged citizens to follow Covid protocol and said that this time, there was less fear of the infection among the public despite the rising numbers. He also said the state hopes to ramp up its vaccination drive, provided it gets the necessary support from the Central government. “If the Centre supports the move to double the vaccination capacity in states that are hit worst with the pandemic, then maximum citizens from those particular states can be immunised and it will help to control the situation,” said Pawar.Pawar also said Maharashtra needs more vaccines and he has asked the chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and health secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, to submit an official demand for vaccines to the Centre. He said he had spoken to Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar on the issue and Javadekar had promised full cooperation.Dr Satyendranath Mehra, medical director at Masina Hospital in Byculla said the spike in Covid cases was due to a lack of precautions among the general public. “Citizens need to understand that taking vaccines increases immunity but does not mean they will not get infected. Antibodies tend to develop only after 14 days after getting vaccinated. People need to take precautions like wearing masks and observe social distancing,” said Dr Mehra.The state covered 5,265,462 beneficiaries as part of its vaccination drive after 2,14,123 people were inoculated on Friday. Of these, 1,98,386 received the first shot and 15,737 were administered second shots. From the general public, 124,632 are citizens who are above 60 years old and 34,197 are aged 45 years and above with comorbidities.Since the vaccination drive began on January 16, 9,51,219 healthcare workers (HCWs) have received the first shot and 4,57,621 have got the second shot. Among frontline workers (FLWs), 7,43,238 have got their first shot 2,25,489 have got their second shot. The total number of beneficiaries who are above 45 years with comorbidities and have got their first shot is 5,34,227 beneficiaries while 2,353,668 beneficiaries aged 60 years and above have got their first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/for-rise-improved-health-infra-too-may-not-be-enough-maharashtra-cm-101616787152043.html

He warned that Congress would be left with nothing if another UPA is formed. However, the Sena parliamentarian refused to name the people involved in floating “UPA-2”. Currently, the alliance is being headed by interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “For several years now, there has been drama over third and fourth fronts, but they failed. Therefore, it needs to be looked at how to strengthen UPA. Some people in Delhi are attempting to create UPA-2, and therefore, out of concern, I am saying that UPA needs strengthening... If UPA-2 is formed, then your [Congress’s] importance will become less and you won’t have anything,” Raut said in Delhi.Raut, without naming Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, said that state-level leaders should not comment on national politics. Patole, irked over Raut’s remarks, had on Thursday questioned why Shiv Sena, which is not a constituent of UPA, is speaking about the Congress-led alliance.“If Sonia or Rahul Gandhi or any other leader speaks on this [Sena’s interference on the issue], then we will respond to them. But they haven’t spoken yet,” said Raut.The Sena parliamentarian said that Congress leaders in Maharashtra are not criticising him, but are criticising their party. He said that one does not need to be a part of UPA to speak about it. “One must understand that UPA is not a state-level issue, and therefore, leaders must not speak on it. This is an issue in the interest of the nation. If there has to be a strong Opposition coalition, then there has to be a discussion on what I have said. If leaders in Maharashtra don’t understand this, then they must study politics,” he said, adding, Raut reiterated that if the Opposition has to fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the national level, then UPA needs to be strengthened. “They [Maharashtra Congress leaders] are not criticising me, but their party. They should answer how they’ll defeat BJP unless there is a strong Opposition coalition? They should come to Delhi and answer this, not from Maharashtra,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/some-in-delhi-attempting-to-form-upa-2-shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut-101616786431558.html

Shelar said he has written to NIA, requesting it to carry out a thorough probe in the case.The former minister has alleged that the trader’s post-mortem report was fudged, and crucial information was not provided in the report. Shelar also alleged that a “big conspiracy” was hatched at the “behest of the state government, ministers and leaders.” “The state government’s ill-intention was to misdirect the probe by destroying evidence and fudging it… I’ve written to NIA demanding that doctors, lab experts, police, ministers and leaders be probed thoroughly,” he said, while holding a copy of the post-mortem report at a press conference.Pointing to some alleged lapses in the investigation and gathering of evidence, Shelar said that the fact that Hiran’s face was covered with handkerchiefs when his body was discovered from a Thane creek was not mentioned in the report.“The post-mortem report, which has to mention what was found on the person’s body, does not state the handkerchiefs. The handkerchiefs were not handed over [for post-mortem]. Who took them and why were they not mentioned in the report, and on whose orders? It is clear that it was an attempt by the police to destroy the evidence,” Shelar alleged, adding that the doctors who carried out Hiran’s post mortem on March 5 did not do complete the videography of the procedure, which he claims is a violation of the National Human Rights Commission guidelines.“The post-mortem report mentions the process took nearly two hours. It was expected of them to record the entire procedure, but only seven to eight [video] clips of a minute each were recorded. On whose order did the government hospital doctors manipulate the evidence? Who is that minister or leader?” he questioned.Alluding to a conspiracy that Hiran’s death had to be shown as suicide, Shelar said that doctors of forensic laboratories “tampered” with evidence by conducting the diatom test, which they are not authorised to carry out.Diatoms are single-celled algae, and this test is usually conducted to detect their presence in the body to indicate drowning. “A diatom test was done to suggest it was a suicide. Also, only authorised [forensic] laboratories can do the test. Kalina Forensic Lab said it was not authorised. The government sent the samples to Sir JJ Hospital, but they are not a designated lab to conduct the diatom test either. Then why did doctors there carry out a test? It is clear tampering of the sample, which was an important evidence,” Shelar said. Responding to the allegations, state housing minister from NCP, Jitendra Awhad said, “ATS has done its probe properly. Such allegations are baseless. It is wrong to just keep on alleging indiscriminately and in an unchecked manner. He added that are attempts to create a “doubt” and “point the needle of suspicion” on someone. A senior police officer attached to the state ATS said their investigation has revealed that the accused arrested in the Antilia security scare case and Hiran’s murder probe have destroyed some pieces of evidence such as CCTV footages of certain places. The officer, however, denied that any attempts have been made by any state authority to derail or affect the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-govt-destroyed-tampered-evidence-in-hiran-case-bjp-mla-101616786192392.html

27-03-2021||Lucknow||Covid review meet: Remain extra vigilant ahead of Holi, panchayat polls: Yogi||Amid rising cases of Covid-19 in different states, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said extra precaution should be taken and special vigil should be maintained in view of Holi and forthcoming panchayat elections. Reviewing Covid-19 situation at a high level meeting at his official residence here, the CM said effective arrangements should be maintained for protection and treatment of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh. “All necessary facilities should be provided in Covid hospitals and Covid helpdesk should be run effectively. Sufficient number of medical personnel should be posted in Covid hospitals and necessary medical equipment should also remain available and back up arrangements be made for oxygen at these hospitals,” he said. He said passengers should be tested for Covid-19 at bus stations, railway stations and airports and added that infrared thermometers and pulse oximeters should be used to identify suspected cases. Yogi directed officials to ensure that more than 1.50 lakh Covid tests were conducted every day and contact tracing be carried out effectively. The chief minister said information should be sought about those coming from other outside through monitoring committees both in urban and rural areas. “This would help in sending those found infected for quarantine and in their medical treatment as well,” the CM said. He said integrated command and control centre should remain active at district level and people should be consistently educated about measures for protection against Covid-19. He also asked for necessary steps to check assembly of crowd at public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-review-meet-remain-extra-vigilant-ahead-of-holi-panchayat-polls-yogi-101616786011024.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Indian aviation industry still at risk, has not learnt lessons from two airline fails: CAPA||While the Indian aviation industry is struggling to bounce back after running into heavy losses due to the pandemic, aviation consultancy Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) said that Indian aviation industry has always presented higher risks than other major markets even during the pre-Covid era. This is due to a failure to solve structural issues since 2004, and this coupled with Covid-19 has resulted in seismic shifts in the industry. It also said Indian operators and all stakeholders are responsible for the absence of risk management.According to the consultancy, risks remain high as the industry has not learnt key lessons from two major airline failures — Jet Airways and Kingfisher — in the last decade.“Systems have not been implemented in the aftermath of these events to prevent further airline failures. All stakeholders are responsible for the absence of preventive risk management,” CAPA said.Domestic air traffic fell to about 30 million passengers during April and December 2020, from 108 million passengers compared to the year earlier. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday informed the lower House that airlines incurred a loss of ₹16,000 crore during that period, while airports lost ₹3,000.Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer, CAPA Indian subcontinent and Middle East, said a three-step process is required to reset the sector. “We are currently having a status quo approach. We need to engage in a highly coordinated and collaborative manner with all stakeholders across the industry and government to develop and execute a robust risk mitigation strategy with a clear approach and responsibilities.”Talking about the issues in the webinar hosted by CAPA, former chief executive officer (CEO) of Adani airports Sidharth Kapur said, “Covid-19 has made aviation even more complex than it already was. There is a critical need for aviation operators to formalise a structured risk management framework starting with the appointment of chief risk officers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-aviation-industry-still-at-risk-has-not-learnt-lessons-from-two-airline-fails-capa-101616785951640.html
27-03-2021||Lucknow||Holi gift: CM Yogi to inaugurate Gorakhpur zoo today||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will dedicate Shaheed Ashfaqullah Khan Zoological Park (Gorakhpur zoo) to the locals on the eve of Holi on Saturday.“Gorakhpur zoo, the much-anticipated project of the Yogi-led government, is all set to open its gate for the people on March 27. It is a unique zoo in the country and will be the biggest in Eastern UP,” said a state government spokesperson.The project was conceived a decade ago in May 2011 but was abandoned by two previous governments of the state. It was revived soon after the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in 2017.Along with giving boost to tourism, the zoo will give thrust to employment in the Purvanchal region, said the spokesperson.Majority of animals in the Gorakhpur zoo have been brought from the zoos of Lucknow and Kanpur. Set of zebras from Israel will be a special attraction for tourists in the coming days.At present there are 153 wildlife enclosures here. The lions of Gujarat were brought in February from Etawah Lion Safari. Cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, deer, swamp deer (barasingha), chital, jackal, python, Russell viper, bonnet macaque (a species of monkey), sambar, fox (fox), kakar (barking deer), Pada (hog deer), crocodile, Wild cat, tortoise, porcupine, parrot, peacock etc. have been brought here, he said.Two cafeterias, bus safaris, battery-operated golf car for the elderly and toy trains on PPP model will also be available for tourists in the zoo area. The ODOP (One District One Product) product has also been given a platform at the zoo in Gorakhpur. This will also provide tourists the facility to view and buy ODOP products here, he said. The spokesperson said the zoo was just confined to the papers until Yogi Adityanath came into power. Since 2011, Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam, looking after the work of the project, only kept transferring the project managers in the name of progress. As of January 2018, seven project managers were replaced.Layout approval, construction and inflow of animals have been supervised regularly by the CM. The foundation of the zoo was laid on May 18, 2011 during the then BSP government. The SP government was formed in 2012 and till 2016 the zoo project was completely neglected. The work of approving the layout from the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), starting the construction work and completing the enclosure with wildlife was done by CM Yogi Adityanath himself.With an approval of ₹181.83 crore, the Yogi government launched the construction of the zoo in August 2018. To accelerate the work, the approval from the Expenditure Finance Committee was increased to ₹259.15 crore in January 2019. The work of finalizing the master layout of Gorakhpur Zoo in Central Zoo Authority (CZA) was also done in October 2017 under the direction of CM, he said.Serpentarium, Butterfly Park, 7D Theatre are the added attraction for tourists. “This is the first zoo with a huge 34 acre of wetland,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/holi-gift-cm-yogi-to-inaugurate-gorakhpur-zoo-today-101616785710894.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai dreams mall fire: Families of deceased in shock||A fire broke out on the first floor of Dreams Mall in Bhandup on Thursday night and spread to upper floors, killing nine patients in Sunrise Hospital which is housed on the third floor, Hindustan Times spoke to families of some of the deceased.Won battle against Covid-19, but lost life in fireGovind Lal Das, 70, was admitted at Sunrise Hospital for Covid-19 treatment on March 22. Within three days, he tested negative and was supposed to be released soon. However, even after winning the battle against Covid-19, he was not able to return home. His daughter, Archana, who met Das on Thursday night, alleged that while she was at the hospital between 6pm and 10pm, the fire alarm rang several times due to an apparent short circuit. But despite making repeated requests to check on it, hospital staffers did not pay any heed.“I would hear the fire alarm was ringing but the staffers said not to worry. I did not know that this would be the cause of the death of my father who was waiting to get discharged,” she said.After returning home, she had a video call with her father around 11pm. After a few hours, she was informed about the fire outbreak at the hospital and she immediately went to the hospital.“There was so much chaos...there was fire and smoke all around. No one knew where my father was. At the middle of the night, we rushed from one hospital to another, clueless. Then finally, we got to know that he was admitted at Agrawal Hospital,” she said.But after reaching there, she learnt that her father had succumbed. “We wanted to take him home, but a few of his medical parameters were still unstable. So, the doctors suggested we keep him at the hospital. If only I had taken him home, he would have been alive today,” she added.Transferred from jumbo Covid centre, man dies in fireShyam Bhaktani, 77, was admitted at Mulund jumbo centre on Monday after he tested positive for the virus. But considering he had cardiac ailments, he was referred to a private hospital as he needed treatment under a cardiologist. After hunting for a day, Bhaktani family found a bed at Sunrise Hospital on Thursday, but now they regret the decision. Within a few hours of admission, Bhaktani breathed his last on Friday morning due to the fire accident.“We got him discharged from Mulund jumbo centre and admitted him at Sunrise Hospital on Thursday afternoon. It took us almost 24 hours to find a bed in a hospital that had the facility to take care of cardiac patients with Covid-19. Finally, we left the hospital around 10.30pm,” said a family member.It was around past midnight when they got calls and found out about the fire. “We immediately started calling the hospital but no one responded. We were panicking. When we reached the hospital, we couldn’t track him,” said the relative.They ran from one hospital to another and finally identified his body in Agrawal Hospital.“Only if the jumbo facility had a cardiologist to look after him, we wouldn’t have to admit him at the hospital. We don’t know if he died because of the suffocation or on the way when he was being shifted to another hospital,” added the member.Found body after 10 hours After enquiring for 10 hours at different hospitals, family members of Ashok Waghmare finally found his body at a hospital morgue.Waghmare was admitted at BYL Nair Hospital earlier this week after he tested positive for Covid-19. The family alleged they were not satisfied with the treatment and care at the hospital. His son-in-law Pratik said, “Bedsheets were soiled, he wasn’t given food for 24 hours at the hospital. In fact, nurses did not pay any attention. No one would even provide water to the patients. So, we decided to shift him to a private hospital for better care.”On Thursday afternoon, the family found a vacant bed at Sunrise Hospital and admitted him there. It was around 6am in the morning when his daughter Priya got to know about the fire. They went to hospital but could not find Waghmare. “We didn’t know who was taken where. So, we went to Mulund jumbo centre, Rajawadi Hospital and the BKC centre but couldn’t find him. We reached Agrawal Hospital around 4pm when a hospital staff informed us about an unidentified body. Upon checking, we saw it was him,” he said.Waghmare’s body was taken to Rajawadi Hospital for post-mortem.Patient’s body found at hospital terraceHarish Sachdev, 60, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Thursday and was admitted at Sunrise Hospital as his family members wanted to keep him near their house in Bhandup. But his sudden death within 24 hours of admission has left his family traumatised. Around midnight, they heard about the fire and rushed to the hospital. When they enquired about Sachdev, they were told by firefighters that patients were being taken to four to five hospitals.“We rushed to Fortis Hospital, Mulund jumbo centre and Agrawal Hospital. But his name wasn’t there in any list,” said his wife Pooja.Finally in the afternoon, they were informed that a body, with features similar to Sachdev, was found at the terrace of the hospital. “I don’t know how this happened. We want the culprit to be punished,” said Pooja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dreams-mall-fire-families-of-deceased-in-shock-101616785651947.html
27-03-2021||Lucknow||UPSRLM helping SHGs prepare herbal gulal from flowers||The Uttar Pradesh State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM) is helping self- help groups (SHGs) to prepare herbal gulal from flowers collected from prominent temples of the state. The UPSRLM, a department of the state government, is providing flowers free of cost to these self-help groups. The Vindhyachal temple in Mirzapur, Devi Patan in Shravasti, Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi, Khatu Shyam in Lucknow, Gola Gokaran Nath in Lakhimpur Kheri and other prominent temples across the state are providing flowers to the self-help groups selected by the state government in these respective districts. The flowers collected from these temples are mainly rose and marigold. “The self-help groups are preparing one kg herbal gulal by investing ₹50. They are selling it to other self-help groups engaged in marketing for ₹100 per kg. In the open market and on various online platforms it is available for ₹130- ₹140 per kg,” said Sujeet Kumar, mission director, UPSRLM. “We are providing all assistance to these self-help groups across the state to collect flowers from temples. Marketing assistance is also being provided to them,” said Kumar. The department has set a target of selling herbal gulal of ₹5 lakh to ₹10 lakh in each district. Across the state this target is ₹one crore. The collective profit is expected to be around ₹50 lakh to ₹60 lakh for self-help groups. According to the UPSRLM, in around 25 districts across the state self-help groups are preparing herbal gulal, colours, chips/papad and snacks for the festive occasion of holi.

27-03-2021||Mumbai||9 killed in Dreams Mall fire in Mumbai||Nine Covid-19 patients, mostly senior citizens, were killed on Friday after a massive fire broke out at Sunrise Hospital, located inside the Dreams Mall in Bhandup, officials said. Six of the dead were on ventilators.The fire started on first floor of the mall on Thursday night and soon spread to the third floor, which houses the hospital. Officials from the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said the firefighting system, including sprinklers, were not functioning. A notice for non-compliance of fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, they added.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who visited the spot, ordered an enquiry into the incident, announced ₹5 lakh compensation to the family of the deceased, and asked for their forgiveness.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has ordered a fire audit of all the Covid-19 hospitals and health centres in the wake of the incident, and Mumbai’s mayor Kishori Pednekar has ordered an additional inquiry into how a Covid hospital was allowed to run inside a mall.“If there is any negligence or delay in it, it will be investigated and action will be taken against those who are responsible for it,” said chief minister Thackeray. “The hospital was functioning on a temporary permission that was due to end on March 31. Unfortunately, the fire started on the first floor [of the mall]. Many Covid patients were safely taken out of hospital.”Thackeray also pulled up the administration. “We wake up after such incidents and inquiries are ordered. I have already asked state authorities to carry out structural and fire audits of hospitals and Covid Care Centres and Jumbo facilities and ensure no such incidents happen. Some people who were on ventilators could not be saved. I ask for forgiveness for their families.”According to BMC, there were 78 patients in the hospital at the time of the incident. Two were already dead after failing to recover from Covid-related complications, and nine died due to the fire.The blaze was first reported at around 11.45pm on the first floor of the mall. MFB was yet to give details about the cause of the fire. Sunrise Hospital authorities contended in a statement that it responded responsibly to the incident, and called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread.“The fire was on the first floor of Dreams Mall, Bhandup, and not in the hospital. The smoke had reached up to Sunrise Hospital located at the top floor. All fire alarms beeped and hence all patients were safely evacuated due to the smoke to the fire refuge area .There were two dead bodies (due to Covid) which were also evacuated. There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilator and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals,” the hospital claimed.It further said that the hospital was started in “exceptional circumstances of Covid last year”, and was “functioning with all due compliances”.“The hospital staff did their best in safely evacuating patients on wheelchairs and beds to the refuge areas and by following the fire drills. The patients were then shifted with the help of local authorities... We have spoken to the authorities and request them to investigate and find the cause of the fire. The guilty need to be punished as the lives of people have been lost in the unfortunate incident,” the statement added.Hemant Parab, deputy chief fire officer, MFB, said the mall was in violation of safety norms. “In the backdrop of a fire last year in City Centre Mall, we had inspected this particular Dreams Mall. A notice was issued to them for non-compliance of fire safety violations due to certain concerns. During fire fighting also we observed that none of the fire safety mechanisms got activated inside the mall. We will conduct a detailed probe into the incident now.”Though the fire was brought under control by Friday afternoon, , firefighting was underway at the time of going to print. Till Friday evening, BMC had traced 46 patients who were evacuated from the hospital. Several of them shifted to nearby hospitals, whereas some opted to go back to their homes, the civic body said.A political slugfest also began after the incident, with the Bharatiya Janata Party blaming BMC of cutting corners to allow the hospital to function.“A case of homicide should be registered against the officials who allowed the operations of the hospital inside the mall. Despite repeated complaints by local BJP corporator Sakshi Dalvi, it was ignored due to political pressure. In reply to the complaint in writing, the Medical Officer Health Department of BMC said that they had issued a certificate of registration to Sunrise Hospital. The fire brigade also issued a no-objection certificate,” BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde said.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also visited the spot, said, “It seems that the authorities have not learnt from past incidents in Bhandara or even in Apex Hospital in Mulund last year. The government has not woken up even after similar incidents in the past. We cannot expect anything better from the BMC considering its system is filled with corruption.”The BMC, on its part, said it will probe if there were any other violations. “The hospital had occupation certificate and also the fire compliance to operate, but we are told there were fire violations inside the mall. However, that is under fire department’s purview, but I have asked my staff to investigate whether there were any other structural violations inside the mall,” assistant municipal commissioner V Acharekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-dreams-mall-a-firefighting-nightmare-101616785291830.html
27-03-2021||Other||Cong picks Satish Jarkiholi for LS bypoll||Bengaluru The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday approved the candidature of Satish Jarkiholi, party’s sitting legislator from Yenkanmaradi, for the on April 17 Belagavi (Belgaum) Lok Sabha bypoll. Satish is a brother of Ramesh Jarkiholi, the former state minister who finds himself in the thick of an alleged sex scandal in Karnataka that has further pushed the chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led state government to a corner. “He (Satish) has had good control over the district and has been in touch with all sections over the last two months. The scandal may have some perception issues, but it might not impact the votes by much since we are talking about issues like price rise, farm laws and other issues which have aggravated voters in the district,” Vinaya Navalgatti, a Congress leader from the district, said. The announcement came a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared its list of candidates for the three bypolls in the state, including for Belagavi Lok Sabha seat and Basavakalyan and Maski assembly constituencies. Satish Jarkiholi will contest against BJP’s Mangala Suresh Angadi, the wife of late Union minister for railways, Suresh Angadi, who died due to Covid-19 related complications in September last year. Political analysts said the BJP does not often replace one family member with another while handing party tickets. The party has, however, gone with Angadi’s wife, showing some cracks in its confidence, analysts said. They added that by naming Satish Jarkiholi, the Congress has shown some “imagination” and “willingness to give a fight”. Belagavi has been a stronghold of the BJP since 2004, making it harder for the Congress. But the district is also home to powerful families like Jarkiholis and Kattis. Residents have in the past favoured local equations and loyalties to the families over political allegiances, observers said. In 2019, Suresh Angadi won 63.12 % of the vote share securing 761,991 votes against Congress’s Dr Sadhunavar, who polled 370,687 votes, according to data from the election commission of India (ECI). Angadi had won the seat consecutively since 2004 while the Congress’s Amarsinh Vasantrao Patil had won it in 1999, according to ECI data. Interestingly, despite Satish Jarkiholi being from the Congress while his two brothers (Balachandra and Ramesh) are with the BJP, they are a tight-knit family and have come together in the past to thwart off any outside interference into the district, said a political observer. Known for his tactical skills, Satish was instrumental in helping former chief minister Siddaramaiah win from Badami in Bagalkote district in 2018, local leaders said. However, the BJP sounded confident of retaining the seat. “There is really no contest, and the BJP will win. There is a sympathy factor for the wife of Suresh Angadi and the Congress does not stand a chance,” Prabhakar Kore, a former Rajya Sabha member and senior BJP leader from the district, said. Basavakalyan seat fell vacant after sitting Congress legislator B Narayanrao died last year due to Covid-19 related complications. The Congress has fielded the wife of the late leader against BJP’s Sharanu Salagar, a first time MLA contestant. The JD(S) has announced Syed Yasrab Ali Quadri as its candidate for the bypoll to the seta, which, analysts and political leaders said, might split the minority votes of the Congress. In Maski, where bypoll was necessitated after Pratapgouda Patil — who had won on a Congress ticket in 2018 against Basanagouda-Turvihal of the BJP — defected to the BJP along with 17 others in 2019 and helped bring Yediyurappa to power. The Congress has named Turvihal as its candidate for the April 17 bypoll. A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said the bypolls being the first elections in the state after Covid-19, economic distress and the impact of Covid-19 could have a bearing on the outcomes of the bypolls. “Normally the ruling party has an advantage in bypolls held in the first half of the term, but this may not necessarily be true in the second half. These polls are in the second half of the term and are a good indicator to gauge the mood of the people both toward the Union and state government,” Narayana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-picks-satish-jarkiholi-for-ls-bypoll-101616784630731.html

27-03-2021||Gurugram||Nitika Tomar murder: Family to approach higher court for death penalty||Family of 21-year-old Nikita Tomar who was killed last October said they were disappointed with the life sentence awarded to her killers. They said they would move the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking the death penalty.On Friday, a Faridabad fast-track court said Touseef’s and Rehaan’s crime against the young woman could not be considered as a “rarest of the rare” case and could not be sentenced to death.When the judgment was delivered, anguished family members, activists and other raised slogans demanding capital punishment.Touseef and Rehaan had tried to abduct Nikita on October 26, 2020 from in front of her college in Ballabhgarh. When they failed, one of them shot her. The video of the incident went viral. Nikita’s father Moolchand Tomar on Friday said they were seeking the death penalty as the duo had brutally killed her in a planned and premeditated manner. “They roamed around my daughter’s college for four days with a plan to abduct her and killed her when she resisted,” he said.Nikita’s family were also disappointed that despite making a promise to name an educational institute after her, the state government had not yet done so. “Nikita fought for the honour of women and went down fighting. She must be honoured for her sacrifice,” said Navin Tomar, Nikita’s brother.The family said the government had also promised financial assistance or a job to one of them, which too had not been fulfilled.“I lost my job and spent ₹6-7 lakh in fighting this case. We had to hire a lawyer in Chandigarh to ensure justice for Nikita. My son’s career is also in the doldrums,” said Moolchand.Virender Gaur, a city-based social activist, who has been supporting the family said, “The authorities must come good on promises made by them.”A senior official of the Faridabad district administration said that all efforts were made to get justice for the victim due to which the accused were sentenced within five months of the crime. “The decision of naming of an institution can only be taken at state government level,” he said, on the condition of anonymity.“The first priority in this matter was to ensure justice was delivered to the victim. The police and the court have done their jobs meticulously. The remaining issues raised by family would also be resolved in due course of time,” said Amit Arya, media advisor to Haryana CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nitika-tomar-murder-family-to-approach-higher-court-for-death-penalty-101616784331340.html

Police once again thwarted the bid and kept the situation from spiralling.While members of Bharat Mata Vahini claimed the gathering was illegal, police said members of the Muslim community had already applied for permission to offer prayer.Bharat Mata Vahini chief Dinesh Thakur and 30 others reached the park at 12.30 pm where the Muslims had gathered to offer their prayers. They chanted slogans against the use of a public park for prayers. Police swung into action and escorted Thakur out.Last Friday too, Thakur was escorted out after a similar protest.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Sadar) Aman Yadav said, “Namaz is offered routinely under police watch. After last Friday’s incident, we had strengthened the deployment at the park. Our forces ensured peace.”He said Thakur’s supporters were made to leave the site and no one was detained. “We had taken preventive action earlier as well. We explained to them that the members who wished to offer prayers had already applied and gotten permission for it,” said Yadav. On Thursday, Thakur had sought support over social media to prevent offering of namaz in public spaces across the city. He instructed people who supported him to reach the sector 40 park. He said that like last Thursday, this time too he had submitted a memorandum to the Gurugram Police protesting the issue claiming it was illegal.“Namaz is being offered in public spaces at multiple places. This is illegal. We raised the concern that it inconvenienced the common people. Earlier, no prayers used to be offered in the parks here,” said Thakur.Those who offered prayers on Friday alleged that the protesters threw slurs and abuses at them. “There were many men who were going around on motorcycles and in gypsies around the area where prayers were being offered. They hurled abuses, but we chose to ignore them,” said Altaf Ahmed, a city resident. “By threatening people every week, at different places, they want us to scare us into giving up our constitutional right of offering prayers. And these prayers hardly take 30 minutes.”Mufti Abdul Haseeb, the imam who led the Friday prayers, said that there had been efforts to disrupt their prayers since February. “There had been attempts at parks in sector 38, Manesar, and DLF phase 3. But since the police were around, the matter did not escalate,” said Haseeb. Haseeb said they were forced to use the park since there were no mosques in the vicinity. “The nearest mosque is 5 km from here. Most people who offer namaz here are poor labourers. They cannot afford to commute to other places,” he said, adding the park hosted prayers since 2014 and that they had police protection since 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/for-second-friday-in-a-row-rightwing-group-attempts-to-prevent-namaz-at-gurugram-park-101616784330657.html

They suspended the move on Thursday following a police complaint against it.The villages that met on Friday surround this land.Jitendra Bhadana, a resident of Pali village and who complained to the Pali police against the dumping, said, “We will not let authorities build another Bandhwari (landfill) here. A case regarding the land is subjudice in the Punjab and Haryana High Court so this land cannot be used anyway by the municipal corporation.”On Friday, Hindustan Times went for a spot check at the site. Garbage, including plastic, was dumped on an approximately 500 metre stretch. Trees were cut and land levelled to make way for dumper garbage trucks too. But no dumping took place on Friday. At the mahapanchayat, the villagers said that the land was a common village land that the Faridabad municipality had forcibly taken from them. They said they had challenged the “takeover” in the high court and the case was pending.The mahapanchayat appointed lawyer Bhagendar Bhadana, also a resident in one of the villages that took part in the deliberations on Friday, to take the issue up in court. “It is not just the matter of the village common land being used,” he said. “It is also about how in the coming years, our underground water will be contaminated, the air will be even more polluted and the health of residents from all these villages will be affected. We will be submitting an application in the high court in this regard and also file a case in National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the cutting of trees and harm to the environment.”Karambeer Bhadana, resident of Pali village said, “For years now, we have anyway been breathing dust particles in polluted air from the crusher zone; we do not want to start drinking contaminated water at least.”Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) additional municipal commissioner Inderjit Kularia confirmed that no more waste was dumped after Thursday’s order. “As the matter is subjudice in the high court, the land won’t be used anymore and we are in the process of finding an alternative,” he said.At the mahapanchayat, over 100 villagers participated in the discussions. They came from Pali, Mohabatabad, Pakhal, Gotha Nayagaon, Bhankari, Sainik Colony and others surrounding the land. They alleged that around 200 truckloads had been dumped since Wednesday afternoon.Gurugram and Faridabad generate almost 2,000 tonnes of waste daily. With the Bhandwari landfill filled to capacity and the NGT ordering the MCG to find another space for the excess, the civic bodies had zeroed-in on this land in the Aravallis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/in-faridabad-12-villages-come-together-to-fight-civic-bodies-attempt-to-dump-waste-in-aravallis-101616784271026.html

27-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi records over 1,000 cases for fourth day on the trot, positivity rate also up||With 1,534 cases of Covid-19 reported on Friday, Delhi added over 1,000 infections to its overall tally for the fourth day on the trot. While the city had conducted a high number of tests during these past four days, the increase in cases was not merely a result of that as the positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested -- had also kept rising. It has shot up from 1.31% to 1.80% in these four days, Delhi goverment data showed.On average, 85,300 tests were conducted daily during the past four days in comparison to nearly 76,000 tests conducted daily in the seven days before that and over 69,200 the week before that. Delhi has reported a positivity rate of more than 1% for the past seven days. The positivity rate – which is indicative of the spread of the infection in an area – had remained below the 1% mark in Delhi for 82 days, according to data shared by the Delhi government. But Friday’s 1.80% positivity rate was the highest since December 16, when it had touched 1.96%. Along with the high number of cases, the city also saw an increase in the number of deaths from Covid-19. On Friday, nine Covid-19 deaths were recorded in the city, which was the highest since January 24, the last day when nine deaths were reported. So far, 10,987 city residents have succumbed to the infection, the state health bulletin said. “Once the number of cases start going up, the number of deaths also increase after around 10 days. This is because the severity of the infection in a patient reaches its peak in the eighth to the 12th day. We have been reporting an increase in the number of cases for over two weeks now. Also, there is a misconception among the people that the virus is causing milder disease this time around, which is not true. We are admitting several people with moderate and severe disease manifestation and they need to be put in the ICU,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care. Delhi has seen an increase in the number of hospitalisations as well, with over 1,000 being admitted over the past three days, according to the health bulletin. The number of active cases or those living with the infection crossed the 6,000-mark as well. This is the highest since December-end. “I am expecting the number of cases to go up further because people are not following Covid appropriate behaviour. And, that is mainly because the number of cases had come down, and people thought that it is like any other infection. There was also the vaccine euphoria. Now, the government needs to strictly enforce norms like wearing masks in public,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine, Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-over-1-000-cases-for-fourth-day-on-the-trot-positivity-rate-also-up-101616784211329.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Thallium murder: Poison, fish were bought online||A 37-year-old resident of Greater Kailash, who was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly poisoning his wife and her family members with thallium, a toxic chemical, bought the substance online from a pharmaceutical firm in Haryana’s Panchkula on the pretext that his father-in-law needed it for research on homeopathic medicines, said police officers involved in the investigation. The accused, Varun Arora, a realtor, got the consignment delivered to his relative’s house in Gurugram. The police said Arora hoped that since thallium is a slow poison, the murders would be passed off as being caused by food poisoning.Investigators said that it did not appear that the relative who received the consignment knew what it contained, and added that they are looking to ascertain the identity of the person who helped Arora get the thallium from the pharmaceutical firm. “We are, however, yet to verify it with the pharmaceutical company if it sold the thallium to Arora after due verification or not. Any possible negligence is being looked into,” said a senior police officer who asked not to be named. Interrogators said that Arora also bought the fish, which he cooked for them, online. They also said that the suspect ensured that neither he nor his twin children ate the fish that he had laced and served his wife and in-laws on January 31 this year.The police arrested Arora for lacing his in-laws’ dinner with thallium on January 31, killing his mother-in-law and sister-in-law, and leaving his wife comatose. The man’s father-in-law and the domestic help recovered after treatment.Police earlier said that Arora claimed to have planned the poisoning after his wife aborted her pregnancy last year, and to exact revenge for “being humiliated”, because his construction business was not doing well. However, this alleged motive has now come into question.Police officers told HT that they are analysing Arora’s social media accounts to probe if the murders were a result of an extramarital affair. Arora is also learnt to have told investigators that he had believed his father would be reincarnated with his child, but was allegedly upset on learning that his wife had aborted the pregnancy. Arora told police that since thallium is tasteless and odourless, he mixed it with water and poured it over the fish. “He gave his four-year-old twins milk to drink right before dinner, so that the family members did not serve them the fish. He did not eat the fish himself, citing religious reasons,” the officer said. Meanwhile, Arora’s wife’s family members have told the police that they suspect Arora may have been involved in an extramarital relationship.A member of his wife’s family, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Arora’s father passed away about two years ago, and his lifestyle changed overnight. We have now learnt that Varun ill-treated his wife and that they had serious fights on a few occasions. He is misleading police by claiming that he was depressed or under financial stress. The family suspects he was in an affair outside the marriage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/thallium-murder-poison-fish-were-bought-online-101616784210624.html

The teacher’s body said in this case, vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar had appointed the registrar and then sought “post-facto approval” during the EC meeting on Friday. Despite several attempts, Chakraborty did not respond to calls and texts sent for comment.On Friday, EC members approved Chakraborty’s appointment and the administration said he will “take care of the office of the registrar until a new registrar is appointed, for which an advertisement has already been issued.”The university said the appointment was done as per statute 8 (2) of the JNU Act which says, “When the office of the registrar is vacant or when the registrar is, by reason of illness or absence for any other cause, unable to perform the-duties of his office, the duties of the office shall be performed by such person as the vice-chancellor may appoint for the purpose.”“It is unfortunate that a few faculty members of JNU have tried to manufacture a controversy over an appointment which is otherwise a routine process,” read a statement issued by rector 1 Chintamani Mahapatra on Friday.Reacting to the development, JNUTA secretary Moushumi Basu said, “The EC agenda was changed twice in response to letters written by JNUTA and press reports. It was only Thursday evening that the registrar matter was brought up as part of the additional agenda. The university must explain their misdeed and misappropriation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-teachers-opposition-jnu-approves-appointment-of-new-registrar-101616784091038.html

The jeweller had called the woman on the pretext of an audition for a video album and then raped her, police said. The victim alleged in her FIR that she was approached through Instagram and called for the video audition. She said the accused also promised her work in renowned production houses. Police have arrested the accused Vasu Soni alias Reyanshi alias Shivam and registered an FIR against him in connection with the case.

Singh said Soni was arrested from his house and booked under Indian Penal Code sections 376 for rape, 323 for voluntarily causing hurt, 504 for insulting and 506 for criminal intimidation. As per the FIR, the woman said Soni offered her work in a video album and called her for the audition at the hotel. She alleged Soni held her captive in the room after interacting with her for some time and then raped her. She said the accused even beat her up and threatened her with dire consequences if she reported the matter. She said the accused disappeared from the scene when she called some of her friends after coming out of the hotel room.She said one of her female friends was also allegedly raped in a similar manner around a week ago but she did not complain to police for fear of social humiliation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aspiring-model-called-for-audition-and-raped-accused-jeweller-held-101616783970557.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Sunanda could not have killed herself, hence no question of abetment, Tharoor tells court||Congress member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor on Friday told a Delhi court that the family, friends and son of his late wife Sunanda Pushkar have maintained that she was a strong woman and could not have died by suicide.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, while arguing on the framing of charges in the death of Pushkar in 2014 at a hotel in the city, told special judge Geetanjali Goel that no case of abetment to suicide is made out against his client as she could not have died by suicide. “Her relatives and son say she was a strong woman and couldn’t have died by suicide. How can there be a question of abetment when she didn’t die by suicide,” Pahwa said adding that the police investigation has conclusively established by way of opinion from renowned doctors that she had not died by suicide.He also cited several judgments and sought the discharge of Tharoor from the case. The court put up the matter for further hearing to April 9.Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police had charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges.Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On May 14, 2018, Tharoor had tweeted: “ I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part...If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”On March 17, during arguments, Pahwa had told the court that doctors have not been able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the case of abetment to suicide against Tharoor was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.He had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports have allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He had also said during the course of the investigation, there have been a plethora of reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO) but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sunanda-could-not-have-killed-herself-hence-no-question-of-abetment-tharoor-tells-court-101616783910998.html
27-03-2021||Delhi||Two suffocate to death while cleaning septic tank in Ghazipur||Two men suffocated to death after they were allegedly made to clean a septic tank without any protective gear at a banquet hall in east Delhi’s Ghazipur late Thursday night. Police have detained the housekeeping manager, general manager and the owner of the banquet hall for questioning but have not made any arrest till Friday evening. The deceased were identified as Lokesh Kumar, 35, and Prem Chand, 40 — both worked as caterers in weddings and lived in Trilokpuri, east Delhi.They were promised a meagre ₹1,500 per man for cleaning the tank, the police later said.Delhi had banned manual scavenging— defined as manually cleaning, carrying, disposing or handling human excreta from dry latrines and sewers—on August 21, 2017.Senior police officers said a call was received around 10.23pm at Patparganj Industrial Area police station stating that two men had died after entering a septic tank at Pearl HlGrand Emperor banquet hall. . Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said a team rushed to the spot and learnt that the men had been called in for cleaning the tank around 7.30pm by one Rahul (single name only), the housekeeping manager. “Later, around 10pm, Rahul found the men lying unconscious in the tank and alerted the police and other staff members of the hall. As soon as we received information, a crime and forensics team, along with teams from Delhi Fire Service, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and MCD Boat Club, reached the spot, pulled the men out of the tank and rushed them to a hospital, where they were declared brought dead,” Yadav said.The DCP said the identities of the two men were established following local inquiries. “Their bodies were sent to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital for autopsy. Preliminary probe suggests that the duo died of asphyxiation but we are waiting for a detailed autopsy report. Following the initial inquiry, a case has been registered under the IPC section 304A for causing death due to negligence and under Section 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavenger and Their Rehabilitation Act against unknown people,” the officer said.Yadav said the general manager of the banquet hall, Amir Khan, housekeeping manager Rahul and banquet hall owner Jimmy Arora have been detained and are being questioned. “We are trying to establish the sequence of events that led to the fatalities. Adequate legal action will be taken,” the DCP said.Later on Friday, around 50 people from the two men’s families and those from Delhi sanitation workers unions gathered outside the banquet hall and staged a protest demanding the immediate arrest of the owner and the housekeeping manager.Chairman of the union, Sanjay Gehlot, said despite the government having provided machines to clean septic tanks and sewers, people use labourers as that is the cheaper option. “This is cruelty. The workers were not given any safety equipment or protective gear. We demand adequate compensation for families of the two men,” Gehlot said.Police said, while Lokesh is survived by his wife and two children, a 15-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. Prem Chand has a wife and two sons aged 15 and 9 years in his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-suffocate-to-death-while-cleaning-septic-tank-in-ghazipur-101616783790925.html
27-03-2021||Other||Doorstep delivery scheme face-off: Centre wrote to Delhi govt over ‘ration quality’ in city||New Delhi: A day before it red-flagged the Delhi government’s doorstep ration delivery scheme on March 19, the Union ministry of food and public distribution pulled up the state administration for “repeated delays” in submitting action-taken reports required to be filed on the use of electronic point of sale (e-POS) machines in ration shops and on improving the “quality” of subsidised foodgrains being disbursed in the Capital, according to government documents. The ministry wrote two letters to the government on March 18. While one was a reminder to submit a report on the quality of foodgrains being distributed and on steps taken to remove discrepancies in the city’s public distribution system, the other was about a delay in the trial of e-POS machines in Delhi’s 2,000-odd fair price shops (FPS). HT has seen the documents.A day later, on March 19, the Union ministry raised objections to the doorstep ration delivery scheme, saying its name, cost and method of delivery were not in accordance with the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The Delhi government said that the Centre was trying to block its flagship scheme, and altered the name of the programme on March 24 so that it could be implemented. However, the Union government later said that there were other problems related to distribution.One of the two letters sent by the Union ministry on March 18 read: “GNCTD (the government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi government) had informed this (the Union ministry of food and public distribution) department that the trial and testing of portability transactions under ‘one nation one ration card’ (ONORC) shall be done shortly. Further, during the meeting convened by the Union home secretary on February 23, 2021, GNCTD informed that the results of the trial and testing of portability transactions shall be shared within one week. The same are still awaited.”Another official said that Union food minister Piyush Goyal had written to the Delhi government, asking them to adopt the ONORCThe second letter sent to the Delhi government on March 18 was a reminder asking it to respond to an October 23, 2020, letter from Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey to chief secretary Vijay Dev, which said that routine inspections at 71 fair price shops showed that 30% of ration being distributed in Delhi was unfit for consumption. The letter said that 90 of the 138 samples were beyond the rejection limit (BRL) as mandated by the Centre’s uniform specifications of foodgrains (wheat and rice). The letter also contended that 42 other samples (18 wheat and 24 rice) were “unfit for human consumption.” Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said, “As far as the use of the e-POS machines in ration shops is concerned, the ONORC and door-to-door ration schemes in Delhi will be ensured in all ration shops. The state cabinet took this call, and it has been brought to the Centre’s notice,” he said. Hussain also said foodgrains being sent from the Centre’s godowns were of “poor quality.”“During last year’s lockdown, we had complained to the Centre about the rotten ration we received from them. I even wrote a letter to the concerned Union minister, demanding immediate action. We had returned the rotten ration,” Hussain said. Delhi chief secretary Dev and secretary-cum-commissioner (food and civil supplies) Padmini Singla did not respond to queries sent by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doorstep-delivery-scheme-face-off-centre-wrote-to-delhi-govt-over-ration-quality-in-city-101616783730495.html
27-03-2021||Other||Vaccination pace still sluggish, lack of motivation keeping people away, say doctors||New Delhi The pace of Covid-19 vaccinations is sluggish in the city despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal mandating that vaccination centres in Delhi will operate for 12 hours a day, from 9am and 9pm, in all Delhi government-run hospitals. The government had also directed its hospitals to run six vaccination centres each on their premises. Since the extended 12-hour vaccination drive began on Monday (March 22), on average, 34,027 jabs have been administered daily. On Friday, only 20,652 shots were administered across Delhi, of which 16,181 were first doses and the rest second doses. In comparison, around 46,769 jabs – both first and second doses — were administered last Saturday, two days before the extended vaccination timings kicked in, government data said. To scale up the capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 shots a day to 125,000 jabs daily, Kejriwal had announced that vaccination sites at Delhi government hospitals will run between 9am and 9pm from March 22. The government order from last Thursday read, “...all the Delhi Government hospitals will operate vaccination sites functioning in their premises up to at least 9pm.” Government analysis so far, however, has shown that there has been an uptick in immunisation in the government centres as compared to private ones. The turnout rate at government centres had increased March 16 onwards, with the centres seeing a 72% turnout (against capacity) on March 18, compared to 49% in private facilities, according to data seen by HT. Doctors from government hospitals, however, said the hospitals anyway had more capacity to vaccinate people. The challenge, they claim, lay in motivating people to come and get the shots. During a spot check earlier this week, HT found that the vaccination centre at two out of three hospitals that this reporter visited, had closed by 5pm. At trans-Yamuna region’s biggest Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, the tented waiting rooms outside its “walk-in” emergency department — it has now been converted into three vaccination centres — remained deserted on Tuesday. At 5:30pm, two staff nurses leaving the centre asked the reporter to return the following day between 9am and 5pm if she wanted to get the shot. “We have a capacity for vaccinating 600 people, but there were only 144 shots administered throughout the day. People are not coming even between 9am and 5pm, they need to be motivated,” said Dr RS Rautela, medical director, Guru Teg bahadur hospital. The “walk-in” emergency department had been set up in 2019 by the hospital to help triage patients outside its main emergency. Any patient who could walk by themselves and hence were thought to have a less severe problem could be treated at the one-hall structure. The structure now houses all three vaccination counters running at the hospital. According to a senior doctor at the hospital, the three sites itself have a capacity to inoculate 600 people. “However, we manage to vaccinate only about 300 to 350 people a day. The number hasn’t picked up despite increasing the capacity. The vaccination centres remain mostly vacant after around three in the afternoon. It is highly unlikely that people will come in at 7pm or 8pm to get their shots here,” said a doctor, on condition of anonymity. Elsewhere, at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, finding the vaccination centre itself was a challenge, with no proper signboard to guide beneficiaries to the vaccination centre behind the main hospital building. The tented waiting room outside was vacant and a lock hung on the door to the single-block vaccination centre at 6pm on Tuesday. A guard stationed at the neighbouring building asked the reporter to return before 5pm the next day. “Our vaccine doses haven’t been increased yet. The districts need to provide us with more manpower and furniture. We have only 200 doses allocated for the hospital and that usually runs out by afternoon. So, there is no point in running the centre till 9pm, just to have people come here and be turned away,” said Dr BL Sherwal, medical director, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, Tahirpur. At the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, although all major gates to the staircase leading to the upper floors -- where the vaccination centres are located -- had been locked, a sign pointed to the one that remained open for Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday at 7pm. Outside the site, there were nursing and police personnel who said anybody could get vaccinated 24x7 at the single operational site. Between 9am and 5pm, the hospital runs another vaccination centre at the same location, with a third centre at the super-speciality hospital in the same compound. The 24x7 vaccination centre at the hospital was not a new addition and has been functional for nearly a month now for administering shots to front-line workers who get off duty at odd hours. “We have one centre running at all times. Not many people come to the hospital at night time. Usually, only 10 or maybe 20 come after 5pm, and that too mostly police and CRPF (para military) personnel. Anyone who comes to the hospital at any time can get their shot at the centre,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. The hospital vaccinates around 200 to 300 people a day, although it has a capacity to immunise over 600 persons. “We need to increase the pace of vaccination – it will help in preventing deaths and controlling the surge in infections. The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait for it. And, we need to vaccinate our teachers and anciliary staff and open up schools and college,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.The Delhi government refused to comment on the issue, despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-pace-still-sluggish-lack-of-motivation-keeping-people-away-say-doctors-101616783731074.html
27-03-2021||Other||High end job scam that went for qualified people seeking managerial jobs with MNCs||New Delhi: Delhi Police has arrested five men who ran a “high-end job scam” in which they duped professionals looking for mid to senior managerial positions in multinational companies (MNCs), officers aware of the investigation said on Friday.The gang allegedly cheated about 500 jobseekers of nearly ₹7.5 crore. The gang’s kingpin, who was among those arrested, holds an MBA and a PhD in human resources (HR), police said.The group targeted people with an MBA or other postgraduate degrees, who had several years of experience, were earning six-figure monthly salaries, and looking to land senior posts such as senior manager or vice-president in leading private firms.The members of the group would gather the contact information of such jobseekers from their sources in recruitment agencies, police said.“An Uttam Nagar resident, who filed a complaint a few weeks ago, alerted us to the gang. He was duped of ₹20 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy. He further said the fraudsters first posed as representatives of a reputed recruitment agency, and later as senior managers of an MNC that the victim was hoping to join at some point in his career. The man was made to deposit the money into various bank accounts on the pretext of payments for the selection process, document verification, profile completion, aptitude test, references, and other such expenses.Investigators analysed the phone numbers from which the victim received calls, and examined the money trail, before zeroing in on an alleged fake call centre operating from Gurugram. The five men who were arrested include the alleged mastermind, 44-year-old Manoj Hota, and two of his associates, Ashish Ranjan and Abhishek Kumar, both of whom have engineering degrees. The other two men, Sonu Rawal and Shaik Pintu, did not hold degrees and primarily kicked off conversations with jobseekers.Roy said Hota was a visiting faculty in various universities and colleges -- he did not name them -- and at one point had tried to start his own college. He was deep in debt when he planned the job racket.His targets were well-placed individuals looking for high-paying private jobs so that he could make more money by targeting fewer people, police said. “He hired men with strong communication skills so that they could pass themselves off as senior managers of MNCs,” said the DCP. Ranjan served as the primary manager for the call centre, while Kumar was the “star caller” who lured job seekers.The DCP said the suspects have been booked for cheating, impersonation and forgery.The police have seized seven computers and 14 mobile phones from them, which they will examine to gather more evidence against the suspects. Officers involved in the investigation said police will also attempt to identify more victims and try to recover the money duped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-end-job-scam-that-went-for-qualified-people-seeking-managerial-jobs-with-mncs-101616783610447.html

27-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s anti-conversion Bill hits legal hurdle||The much-flaunted Freedom of Religion Bill piloted by the BJP-led Haryana government has hit a legal hurdle with the state government’s law and legislative secretary raising serious objections on the proposed legislation.The proposed legislation, which state home minister Anil Vij likes to term a law against ‘Love-Jihad’, is primarily aimed at stopping forced religious conversions.The Bill which was planned for being introduced during the recently-concluded assembly session could not be tabled due to concerns raised by the law and legislative secretary or legal remembrancer (LR).The law and legislative secretary, who is tasked with legally vetting the draft Bill, said that not only it was in violation of constitutional scheme of private liberty and privacy of an individual; against the constitutional scheme in terms of fundamental duties enshrined under Article 51-A of the Constitution and against the provisions of Special Marriage Act, it also contains contradictory and legally weak provisions.Vij said objections raised by the law secretary were clarified by the advocate general.Haryana advocate general BR Mahajan said he has answered issues raised by the law secretary and recommended that the Bill can be tabled in the Haryana assembly.The law secretary, however, does not seem convinced with the clarifications given by the advocate general. In a March 16 communication, the law secretary said that observations raised by the law and legislative department regarding the Bill have not been dealt properly with reasoning.“Some observations of the department were not dealt with in depth and only general passing observations were made by the office of advocate general,” the note reads.OBJECTIONS RAISED BY LAW DEPTThe law secretary, in the note, has said that the substance material in the proposed draft Bill is contrary to the constitutional scheme, which confers every individual the fundamental right to profess, practice and propagate his religion, as it provided for penal provision of professing, practising and propagating another religion without the permission of a district magistrate even in the non-eventuality of marriage.The law department said that since the fundamental duties enshrined in the Constitution provided for promotion of harmony and the spirit of brotherhood among people transcending all religious, linguistic and regional diversities, the proposed Bill was against this constitutional scheme as well as against provisions of the Special Marriage Act which was enacted to enable marriages of couples of different religions.‘VIOLATES LIBERTY, PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS’“The proposed Bill violates constitutional scheme of private liberty and privacy of an individual. The fundamental right to privacy as envisaged under Article 21 protects an individual’s ability to make choices and decisions that are intimate. A Supreme Court’s nine-judge landmark judgment upheld the fundamental right to privacy and clearly said that it is upon an individual how she wanted to exercise her freedom to make those personal choices. Whether one’s partner would be of the same faith or not, is a private decision,” the law secretary said.Objecting to a provision in the Bill which provided that return of any person to his ancestral religion shall not be deemed to be conversion, the law secretary said that this expresses bias and arbitrariness and this provision may not withstand legal scrutiny.The law secretary said that another provision providing for filing of complaint by the parents or siblings or with the leave of the court by any other person even if the conversion is that of an adult, conveyed bad legal sense.Another clause of the Bill, which shifts the burden of proof upon the accused to prove that conversion is not fraudulent, is against the spirit of fundamental premises of Indian Jurisprudence and Evidence Act, the note said.Also, the proposed Bill nowhere has a provision for appeal which is against the principles of natural justice, the law secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-anti-conversion-bill-hits-legal-hurdle-101616776710034.html

27-03-2021||Pune||HSC, SSC students protest at Shaniwarwada in Pune, taken in custody and released||In a demand to conduct the forthcoming examination of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) class 12 and State Secondary Certificate (SSC) class 10 exams online, around 100 students protested outside the Shaniwarwada main entrance gate. The protest was organised by students and not by any organisation or group. Since the protesting group did not have any prior police permission for the protest, the police stopped the demonstration. For a brief period, there was tension at the spot as some students were taken into custody but later released after counselling. “From the last one year, everything is online, our classes, studies, work from home for parents, webinars and everything. Our demand is that our exams also be held online. The number of Covid cases is again on the rise in our state and we don’t want to risk our lives as the examination is going to be offline,” said Vijendra Naidu, a protesting student.A total of 30 to 40 students gathered at the Shaniwarwada inside premises initially at 12 noon on Friday, however, the number rose to 100 slowly as the message of the protest spread through social media. “We simply want an answer from the state government, on one hand, they are imposing lockdown in some cities and then forcing us to come to give the examinations. This is playing with the lives of thousands of students, instead, they should conduct the exams online and for that, we are protesting today,” said another student Chinmay Hawaldar.As the numbers grew, local police came to the spot and started talking to students. They appealed to students to go away from the spot, but as students were not ready to move then some protesting students were taken into custody. Vijay Tikole, senior police inspector at Vishrambaug police station said, “Our policemen spoke to the protesting students, made them aware that they didn’t have police permission and as per the Covid restrictions, gathering of such large number of students won’t be allowed. After the appeal from police, the students went away from the spot and no complaint was lodged against anyone.”As per the Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, the SSC class 10 board exams will commence from April 29 and end on May 20 while that of HSC class 12 board exam will begin on April 23 and end on May 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hsc-ssc-students-protest-at-shaniwarwada-taken-in-custody-and-released-101616767408843.html
27-03-2021||Pune||CFR in Pune remains lower than previous Covid peak in 2020||As of March 24, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is 2.1 per cent, whereas in Pune district it stands 1.9 per cent, as per the district administration. The CFR in Pune remains lower than the previous Covid peak in 2020, despite a major spike in cases this time. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief of the health department at the PMC, said, “Last year, the number of deaths was the same, but overall cases were fewer. This time, number of cases is high, but the number of deaths is the same; so the rate is not affected.” He added that last year, for many doctors the protocol of treatment was still evolving. “Now the doctors are trained. There is more awareness among patients as well, so they are seeking treatment in time. Due to all of this, the CFR is low,” said Wavare. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra chapter, said that the virus has mutated and 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. “Maximum patients are aged 20-40 years. As the numbers increase, the spread is faster, especially among patients with co-morbidity. So, even though the CFR is less right now, it will gradually increase,” said Dr Bhondwe. The positivity rate in Pune district as on March 24 was 17.9 per cent, whereas in PMC it is reported at 17.8 per cent. For Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) it is at 16.7 per cent, and for Pune rural, the positivity rate is at 17.9 per cent, as per the district authorities. “After varied experience, doctors from India and across the globe, have refined the treatment protocol thus giving more effective treatment to critical patients. Hence, the CFR may increase slowly, but it will not be very high,” said Dr Bhondwe. Dr Mahesh M Lakhe, consultant - Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said that one year into the pandemic we also have a better understanding of treatment modalities and preventing complications. “The increase in cases has been very sharp and sudden, which means that only in the past two weeks we have started witnessing a significantly higher number of cases. Since in most cases fatality happens after 15 days, we might witness an increase in CFR in the coming weeks. Increasing testing numbers and ensuring that all diagnosed get medical attention immediately can keep fatality rates low,” said Dr Lakhe. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) *Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) -- 2.1% *Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) --1.5% *Pune, Dehu and Khadki Cantonments -- 2.4% *Pune Rural -- 2.1% *Pune District -- 1.9% *Source: District administration||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cfr-in-pune-remains-lower-than-previous-covid-peak-in-2020-101616767288769.html
27-03-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Spaces, Inner and Outer||“A city isn’t so unlike a person. They both have the marks to show they have many stories to tell.” -Rasmenia Massoud; Broken Abroad If you happened to be a sleepy child in the back seat of your parent’s car in the Sixties, being driven home to Juhu at night after a long day in ‘town’, chances are, you would not have to open your eyes to know where you’d reached at any part of the journey. After all, navigating Mumbai’s north-south trajectory was an olfactory skill acquired by many children at that time. Through closed eyes, you would pick up the peculiar gas balloon-like effluvium that assailed your nostrils while passing through Prabhadevi; Bandra would announce itself with a tangy bouquet of Bombay duck left out to dry along its shoreline; and at the stretch connecting Linking Road to Juhu, after the car had turned left, the air would be redolent with the fetid whiff of illicit alcohol, brewing in the marshlands that flanked both sides of the road. But it was only when you crossed Juhu Tara and you breathed in the untamed, squally-salty tang of the open sea that you’d know you were on the homestretch and it would be only five minutes before strong, loving arms would carry you to your warm and waiting bed. Juhu, once an island — a long, narrow sand bar just off the west coast of Salsette, accessed during low tides by walking across the tidal inlet; presented along with Bombay as part of a Portuguese princess’ dowry; the early home of toddy tappers, salt traders and sundry cultivators; the proposed site of Jamsetji Tata’s most ambitious plans for an Eastern Venice, the iconic aerodrome to which his descendant JRD Tata would later fly after his maiden flight from Karachi; the refuge of Mahatma Gandhi during the high point of the Freedom struggle. Juhu, inhabited by fisher folk and film stars, royalty and rough necks, writers and airline crew, would be your habitat and homing ground, your realm and universe for the first 17 years of your life. “Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears,” wrote Italo Calvino in his meticulously-charted Invisible Cities, in which he examined the warp and weft of the places we live in and the intersections between the personal and the public. Indeed, the places we inhabit have geography and can be located by GPS, but to locate their culpability in who we ultimately become, often takes a lifetime. For some of us, who did our growing up in Juhu, its every stone and cranny, crack and crevice, holds meaning and memory. For instance, would you believe that this unprepossessing upmarket mansion was once the thatched cottage repository of all that was bright and beautiful in someone’s life? Home to a high-spirited clan, said to be too gifted for its own good, it proved to be a child’s first lesson in the merciless slings and arrows of fate that assail the guileless and open-hearted. And look, it was beneath this ancient tree that a star-crossed couple had made its first pledges of ardour, confident that their love would surmount all challenges; it was that unassuming thoroughfare, running parallel to the beach, through which regularly passed fulsome funeral corteges, the men be-hatted and the women forbidding behind veils, to the accompaniment of a brass band, on their grim passage to St Joseph’s Church at the end of the road. And at least three times a week, from this low-rent, seen-better-days structure, would emerge an out tune, My Bonny Lies over the Ocean, the midnight culmination of a jolly brood’s evening of a rum and sorpotel-soaked repast ; it was from an apartment in that tower that the first cries of anguish were heard from the family of an airline crew member when the news of the ill-fated Air India Flight 101 in 1966 first reached; this humble stairwell had sheltered four families of frightened neighbours during the earthquake of 1967; it was into that deep and narrow well that an angry father had threatened to throw himself, when his headstrong daughter had refused to get married, on the eve of her wedding; and this neglected sea side cottage had served as the rendezvous for the ageing, reclusive cinema heartthrob, when she had conducted her lyrical affair with her much younger co-star. Juhu, once the address of high-born Parsi blue stockings and swarthy, permanently-tanned Alpha males; of visionary millionaires and idealistic poets; the scene of fierce turf wars between rival gangs, where a dagger might easily be drawn; and hippy-trippy love-ins, at the homes of the flower-power potted generation. Juhu, the sandy tract dotted with sleepy cottages and overgrown vegetation which gave way to multi-rises, housing complexes, swanky department stores, shady rent-by-night hotels, ersatz bars and watering holes, and then later, malls, mansions and multiplexes. A coconut grove transformed in to a five-star hotel; an elegant sea-facing bungalow belonging to a high-minded spinster, became a builder’s fantasy Xanadu, a swampy marshland into the abode of superstars. Will we ever realise the extent to which the places we live in mold us or how one man’s everyday, ordinary surroundings, might have been the crux or crucible of another’s life? Or why, wherever we travel in the city we must tread softly, because we tread on dreams? Because, in the end, beneath it all, what else are we, gentle reader, but sleepy children on a journey, waiting for strong, loving arms to carry us to warm and waiting beds?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-spaces-inner-and-outer-101616762669442.html

Bhutan received the first consignment of 1.5 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine Covishield as a gift from India in January. Earlier this week as it received a gift of additional 400,000 doses of Covishield from India.Bhutan is likely to be one of the first countries to protect its entire population against Covid-19, with assistance from India, according to a release.According to Johns Hopkins University data, Bhutan has reported 869 coronavirus cases and one death so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-rolls-out-nationwide-covid-19-vaccination-program-101616868524308.html
27-03-2021||World||'No accident': Georgia governor signs voting bill under slave plantation painting, sparks row||Amid criticism of Georgia’s new voting rules, some Twitter users have pointed to a problematic detail about a photograph of Brian Kemp, governor of the US state, in which he can be seen signing the bill into law while being surrounded by other white politicians. In a series of tweets, The Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch highlighted the details of a painting hanging behind Kemp in the photograph. Bunch said that the 98-page measure to “limit Black voting” was signed under the image of a “notorious slave plantation in Wilkes County” where more than 100 Black people had been enslaved.Sharing a link to the ExploreGeorgia website, Bunch said that the Callaway Plantation spread in 56-acre “only thrived because of the back-breaking labor of more than 100 slaves who were held in cruel human bondage”. He said the harsh reality of life for slaves in the era of the Callaway Plantation is captured in the oral-history of Mariah Callaway, a woman who was born into slavery on the Willis plantation.“There were some slaves who were unruly; so the master built a house off to itself and called it the Willis jail. Here he would keep those whom he had to punish. I have known some slaves to run away on other plantations and the hounds would bite plugs out of their legs,” Callaway has noted in the oral history “Slave Narrative of Mariah Callaway”.3. If you scroll about halfway down this PDF link, you can see that the painting is clearly "Brickhouse Road -- Callaway PLNT" (PLNT for "Plantation...subtle, right?) by artist Olessia Maximenko from Wilkes County, GA https://t.co/rnUGyhs9wR pic.twitter.com/mkd04jbXs5The columnist, who later published an op-ed in The Philadephia Inquiry on the same issue, said that the symbolism of the photograph is no accident. US President Joe Biden on Friday called the sweeping voting restrictions “Jim Crow in the 21st century”, comparing it with the 19th-century law that legalised racial segregation and disenfranchised Black citizens in America’s South.“Brian Kemp and his white henchmen have created an image for our times, in working to continue a tradition of inhumanity and white supremacy that now spans centuries, from the human bondage that took place behind the placid scenery of Brickhouse Road in Wilkes County, to the suppression now hidden behind a phony facade of ‘voter integrity,’” tweeted Bunch.The Election Integrity Act of 2021 empowers the state election board to interfere in the election offices of 159 counties in Georgia and imposes ID requirements for absentee ballots, replacing the earlier system that required only signatures. The law also restricts people from handing out anything, including food and water, to voters in the queue and shortens the time for runoffs in the state from nine weeks to four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-governor-signs-voting-bill-under-slave-plantation-painting-sparks-row-101616862914324.html
27-03-2021||World||Air France said to be near deal for state rescue plan||The French government is close to finalizing a recapitalization plan for Air France after addressing some antitrust concerns raised by the European Commission, according to people familiar with the matter.The multi-billion-euro package could be announced in coming days following final approval from Brussels and the board of parent Air France-KLM, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.A spokeswoman for Air France declined to comment, as did the government. The European Commission said it’s in discussion with French authorities and “won’t prejudge the timing or outcome of these contacts.”France and the Netherlands, which own a combined 28% stake in Air France-KLM, have been in talks for months on follow-on funding plan after granting the group 10.4 billion euros ($12.3 billion) in direct loans and state-backed guarantees last year. The carrier, which had net debt of 11 billion euros at the end of last year, has said it’s planning to raise equity and quasi-equity.France has said it plans to provide support to the French brand, while seeking to soften Commission demands for measures aimed at boosting competition, including the surrender of coveted landing rights at Paris-Orly and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. The Netherlands has also pledged aid.As part of its state-aid deal last year, Deutsche Lufthansa AG agreed to hand 24 slots a day in Munich and Frankfurt to rivals, according to an EU document. Les Echos reported Thursday that Air France will need to give up fewer positions at Orly, together with some at its main Paris Charles de Gaulle hub.Lufthansa’s deal also stipulates that it can’t acquire a stake of more than 10% in an operator in the same line of business until at least 75% of the aid is repaid. Dividends, share buybacks and executive pay are also curtailed.Air France-KLM last month reported an increase in cash burn in the last three months of 2020. Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said a recapitalization was due within days or weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-france-said-to-be-near-deal-for-state-rescue-plan-101616834449262.html
27-03-2021||World||As Covid-19 daily deaths near 4,000, worst may lie ahead for Brazil||Brazil currently accounts for one-quarter of the entire world’s daily Covid-19 deaths, far more than any other single nation, and health experts are warning that the nation is on the verge of even greater calamity.The nation’s seven-day average of 2,400 deaths stands to reach to 3,000 within weeks, six experts told the Associated Press. That’s nearly the worst level seen by the US, though Brazil has two-thirds its population. Spikes of daily deaths could soon hit 4,000; on Friday there were 3,650.Having glimpsed the abyss, there is growing recognition shutdowns are no longer avoidable -- not just among experts, but also many mayors and governors. Restrictions on activity they implemented last year were half-hearted and consistently sabotaged by President Jair Bolsonaro, who sought to stave off economic doom. He remains unconvinced of any need for clampdown, which leaves local leaders pursuing a patchwork of measures to prevent the death toll from spiraling further.It may be too late, with a more contagious variant rampaging across Brazil. For the first time, new daily cases topped 100,000 on March 25, with many more uncounted. Miguel Nicolelis, professor of Neurobiology at Duke University who advised several Brazilian governors and mayors on pandemic control, anticipates the total death toll reaching 500,000 by July and exceeding that of the U.S. by year-end.“We have surpassed levels never imagined for a country with a public health care system, a history of efficient immunization campaigns and health workers who are second to none in the world,” said Nicolelis, who is also an epidemiologist. “The next stage is the health system collapse.”The system is already buckling, with almost all states’ intensive care units near or at capacity. Dr. José Antônio Curiati, a supervisor at Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas, the biggest hospital complex in Latin America, said its beds are full, but patients keep arriving. The city's oxygen supply isn't guaranteed, and stocks of sedatives required for intubation in intensive care units will soon run out.“Four thousand deaths a day seems to be right around the corner," Curiati said.On March 17 in northeastern Piaui state, nurse Polyena Silveira wept beside a COVID-19 patient who died on the floor for lack of beds at her public hospital. A photo capturing the moment went viral and served as a national wake-up call.“When he was gone, I had two minutes to feel sorry before moving to the next patient,” Silveira, 33, told the AP. “In eight years as a nurse, I'd never felt as much pain as that night. I'm near my limit, physically and mentally.”Brazil's state-run science and technology institute, Fiocruz, on Tuesday called for a 14-day lockdown to reduce transmission by 40%. Natalia Pasternak, a microbiologist who presides over the Question of Science Institute, pointed to a local example of success: The mid-size city of Araraquara in Sao Paulo state last month implemented lockdown and has seen its cases and deaths recede.Pasternak declined to estimate Brazil’s looming daily death toll but said the trend is for continued growth if nothing is done.“We need coordinated action, and that’s probably not going to happen because the federal government has no real interest in pursuing preventative actions,” Pasternak said. “(Mayors and governors) are trying to implement preventative measures, but separately and in their own ways. This isn’t the best approach, but it’s better than nothing.”Minas Gerais, Brazil’s second most populous state, has closed nonessential shops. Espirito Santo state will enter lockdown Sunday. Brazil’s two biggest cities, Rio and Sao Paulo, have imposed extensive restrictions on nonessential activities. Their state authorities brought forward holidays to create a 10-day period of repose, which started Friday.Restrictive measures, however, are only as strong as citizens' compliance. And Bolsonaro continues to undermine their willingness by painting even partial shutdown as an assault on one's right to earn an honest day’s wages. He has lashed out at local leaders, particularly governors, who dare defy him.“We need to open our eyes and understand this is no joke,” Rio's Mayor Eduardo Paes said in a recorded message on the eve of the 10-day shutdown, stressing that no mayor wants to cause unemployment. “People are dying and, if everything continues as is, nothing is done, God only knows what could happen. No one knows this disease's limit. No one knows how many variants could emerge.”Hundreds of protesters marched along Rio’s Copacabana beach the next morning. Most sported green-and-yellow shirts that are a hallmark of pro-Bolsonaro rallies and many declined to wear masks. They chanted “We want to work!” and directed vitriol at Paes.The World Health Organization’s director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday called for everyone in Brazil to muster a serious response -- “whether it’s the government or the people.”“It’s a concerted effort of all actors that will really reverse this upward trend. It is actually very fast and accelerating really, really fast,” he said. “Especially we’re worried about the (weekly) death rate, which doubled in just one month from 7,000 to 15,000.”The virus's spread has been turbocharged by the more contagious P1 variant that has become cause for concern beyond Brazil’s borders, not just in South America. It has already been identified in the U.S., this week in New York. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said Wednesday that his team will be meeting with Brazilian authorities and are “quite concerned” about the situation in Brazil.The U.S. has seen its death toll plunge since late January amid a massive vaccine rollout, and its seven-day average has dipped below 1,000. By contrast, Brazil’s vaccine rollout has been strained, at best. The government bet big on a single vaccine provider, AstraZeneca, while for months rejecting offers to purchase others. Only after delivery delays from AstraZeneca jeopardized rollout did Brazil’s health ministry begin buying — but too late for most deliveries to arrive in the first half of this year.The nation has fully vaccinated less than 2% of its citizens, which experts widely consider an embarrassment for a country long regarded as a global model for vaccination programs.More than 500 of the nation’s most influential economists and executives this week wrote an open letter calling for mass vaccination and decrying the situation. They said that controversy regarding economic impacts of social distancing is a false dilemma and all levels of government should be prepared to implement emergency lockdown.While Brazil’s economy didn’t contract as much as regional peers last year, the worsening health crisis casts a shadow over the 2021, according to William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. GDP will return to pre-crisis levels late this year, at earliest, marking a rather weak recovery relative to other emerging markets.Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, is more pessimistic, and expects another recession in 2021. Exactly how bad things become in coming months hinges on whether the P1 variant is already dominant nationwide, and is proven to cause reinfections or be more severe.Either way, there’s no time left to delay decisive action, she said.“All in all, it’s a huge disaster,” said de Bolle, who has done postgraduate studies in immunology and genetics. “Could have been avoided; wasn’t. Very difficult to fix now. The only real fix is a very harsh lockdown with the population really abiding by it, which may be a hard sell.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-daily-deaths-near-4-000-worst-may-lie-ahead-for-brazil-101616852147851.html
27-03-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill over 90 in deadliest day since coup||Security forces killed more than 90 people, including some children, across Myanmar on Saturday in one of the bloodiest days of protests since a military coup last month, news reports and witnesses said.The lethal crackdown, which took place on Armed Forces Day, drew strong renewed criticism from Western countries. British Ambassador Dan Chugg said the security forces had "disgraced themselves" and the U.S. envoy called the violence horrifying.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy.Also Read: Concerned by loss of lives in Myanmar, India calls for restraintState television had said on Friday that protesters risked being shot "in the head and back". Despite this, demonstrators came out on the streets of Yangon, Mandalay and other towns, as they have done almost daily since the Feb. 1 coup that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The Myanmar Now news portal said 91 people were killed across the country by security forces.At least 29 people, including a 13-year-old girl, were killed in Mandalay, and at least 24 people were killed in Yangon, Myanmar Now said. A boy as young as five was earlier reported among the dead in Mandalay but there were conflicting reports later that he may have survived. Another 13-year-old was among the dead in the central Sagaing region."Today is a day of shame for the armed forces," Dr. Sasa, a spokesman for CRPH, an anti-junta group set up by deposed lawmakers, told an online forum.Meanwhile, one of Myanmar's two dozen ethnic armed groups, the Karen National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people - including a lieutenant colonel - and losing one of its own fighters.A military spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment on the killings by security forces or the insurgent attack on its post."They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes," said Thu Ya Zaw in the central town of Myingyan, where at least two protesters were killed. "We will keep protesting regardless... We must fight until the junta falls."The deaths on Saturday would take the number of civilians reported killed since the coup to well over 400.'TERROR AND DISHONOUR'U.S. Ambassador Thomas Vajda said on social media: "This bloodshed is horrifying," adding "Myanmar’s people have spoken clearly: they do not want to live under military rule."Also Read | Myanmar coup: UN rights expert 'terrified' as more military deployed in cities ahead of public demonstrationsBritish foreign minister Dominic Raab said the killing of unarmed civilians and children marked a new low, while the EU delegation to Myanmar said Saturday would "forever stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour."News reports said there were deaths in Sagaing, Lashio in the east, in the Bago region, near Yangon, and elsewhere. A one-year-old baby was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet.Min Aung Hlaing, speaking at the parade in the capital Naypyitaw, reiterated a promise to hold elections, without giving any time-frame."The army seeks to join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy," he said in a live broadcast on state television. "Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate."The military has said it took power because November elections won by Suu Kyi's party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country's election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also being held in custody.RUSSIA 'A TRUE FRIEND'New U.S. and European sanctions this week increased external pressure on the junta, but the condemnation is not universal.Russia's deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin attended the parade in Naypyitaw, having met senior junta leaders a day earlier."Russia is a true friend," Min Aung Hlaing said.Diplomats said eight countries - Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand - sent representatives, but Russia was the only one to send a minister to the parade on Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945.Support from Russia and China, which has also refrained from criticism, is important for the junta as those two countries are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and can block potential U.N. actions.In its warning on Friday evening, state television said protesters were "in danger of getting shot to the head and back". It did not specifically say security forces had been given shoot-to-kill orders and the junta has previously suggested some fatal shootings have come from within the crowds.Gunshots hit the U.S. cultural centre in Yangon on Saturday, but nobody was hurt and the incident was being investigated, U.S. Embassy spokesperson Aryani Manring said.Author and historian Thant Myint-U wrote on Twitter: "Even after weeks of appalling violence, today's killing of civilians is shocking both in nature and scale, with again children amongst the dead, and deserves the world's concerted attention and help."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-over-90-in-horrifying-day-of-bloodshed-101616859275959.html

It reported 7,586 new cases, bringing Spain's overall tally to 3.26 million. The death toll rose by 590 to 75,010.The Health Ministry said risk areas were those classified by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

27-03-2021||World||Indonesia sees vaccination slowdown as India delays shipments||Indonesia expects a slowdown in Covid-19 inoculations next month as India delays shipments of AstraZeneca vaccines, its health minister said on Saturday.India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca coronavirus shot made by Serum Institute of India (SII), prioritising domestic demand as infections rise, Reuters reported earlier this week.India's move will affect supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, through which 64 lower-income countries including Indonesia are supposed to get doses from SII.Indonesia, which is suffering one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia, was scheduled to receive 2.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through the COVAX programme on March 22 and 7.8 million doses next month, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told a media briefing."This definitely will affect (the vaccination process) because in April we only have around 7 million doses from Sinovac," Budi said, referring to the Chinese maker of rival vaccines which has also been supplying Indonesia.As Indonesia is injecting around 500,000 doses per day, the supply for April will be used within around two weeks, he added.Indonesia had received 1.1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine at the start of the month and had started their rollout this week.Southeast Asia's biggest country launched its immunisation programme in January and aims to reach 181.5 million people within a year.As of Saturday, roughly 3.2 million people had been fully vaccinated, official data showed. Some 1.49 million people have been infected in Indonesia since the start of the pandemic and more than 40,000 killed."We are still lobbying GAVI in the hope of securing even a small number of doses from AstraZeneca in April," Budi said.He said GAVI, an alliance of countries, companies and charities that promotes vaccination, had indicated to the government that shipments may resume in May but this was not yet certain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-sees-vaccination-slowdown-as-india-delays-shipments-101616856104748.html
27-03-2021||World||China sanctions US, Canada individuals as Xinjiang spat deepens||China announced retaliatory sanctions on individuals in the US and Canada in a widening spat over allegations of human-rights abuses in Xinjiang province.The sanctions targeting the chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom and a Canadian lawmaker were made in response to penalties announced a week ago by the US and China, measures that were “based on rumors and disinformation,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website Saturday.The Chinese government is “firmly determined” to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and urges the relevant parties “to clearly understand the situation and redress their mistakes,” the ministry said.The measures ratchet up tension with the West after several countries levied sanctions on China over allegations of abuse of minority ethnic Uyghurs in the western province of Xinjiang. Beijing denies such allegations, routinely dismissing them as lies.“They must stop political manipulation on Xinjiang-related issues, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs in any form and re rain from going further down the wrong path,” the statement said. “Otherwise, they will get their fingers burnt.”The sanctions target USCIRF Chair Gayle Manchin, who is the wife of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin; USCIRF Vice Chair Tony Perkins; Canadian MP Michael Chong, and the Subcommittee on International Human Rights of the Canadian Parliament’s Foreign Affairs committee.Those concerned are prohibited from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, while Chinese citizens and institutions are prohibited from doing business with the individuals and having exchanges with the committee. China’s previous sanctions on US individuals “who have seriously undermined China’s sovereignty and interests on Xinjiang-related issues remain effective,” the ministry said.China sanctioned European politicians and a think tank earlier this week, including a German and a French member of the European Parliament and a former leader of Britain’s ruling Conservative Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-us-canada-individuals-as-xinjiang-spat-deepens-101616853822279.html
27-03-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccines haven't cured loneliness in New York nursing homes||Vaccines have begun saving lives in New York's nursing homes, but they haven't yet cured another crisis caused by the pandemic: loneliness.Persistently high rates of Covid-19 have left the majority of the state's nursing homes off limits to visitors, despite relaxed guidance meant to help reopen them.Until this week, under state and federal rules, they could admit visitors only if they had no new infections among either patients or staff for 14 days.That mark proved too hard for most to reach. A little more than half of the state’s 616 nursing homes were ineligible for indoor visits in mid-March, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the US Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. That’s the highest percentage of any state.New York updated its visitation rules Thursday in a way that will now allow visits to resume under certain conditions, even if a resident or staffer has recently tested positive. But that relaxed standard might not clear the way for visitation in many homes having trouble keeping the virus out.The lack of visits has frustrated people like Debbie Barbano, who has been able to see her 69-year-old mother at a central New York nursing home only through a window.“When this hit last year, it was like a bullet to your chest,” Barbano said. “She didn’t understand why I wasn’t coming. It was like I was abandoning her.”Under New York’s new guidelines, homes would still have to halt visits after any resident or staffer tested positive, but they could potentially resume for some patients if a thorough round of further testing revealed the outbreak was confined to just one part of the facility.It’s unclear, though, exactly how that guidance will be applied and whether the change would mostly affect large homes with multiple buildings, floors or units with little mingling of staff or residents between units.State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker has justified restrictions on visits by pointing to a winter surge that infected 15,000 nursing home residents, killing at least 3,000.The federal program to vaccinate nursing home residents has helped drive down Covid-19 outbreaks and deaths in nursing homes nationwide. In New York, 41 nursing home residents died of Covid-19 in the second week in March, down from 382 for the week ending Jan. 17.Decreased infections nationwide have allowed 80% of nursing homes nationally eligible to open doors by mid-March, including the vast majority of nearly 1,200 facilities in California.Infections in New York are dropping more quickly among nursing home residents than among staffers. Some workers have been hesitant to take the vaccine. And as New York City and its suburbs see an uptick in cases, the state’s data shows just 68% of nursing home residents and 51% of staffers in New York City have been vaccinated.“Nursing homes have finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, whose group is seeking clarify on the new rules from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “But we’re not out of the tunnel. We’re seeing the end of it.”Meanwhile, some relatives are fighting to see loved ones.Family members in New York and nationwide who have organized on Facebook groups say their loved ones are losing weight, falling, declining cognitively, dying alone and suffering from lack of attention. Federal and state guidance allows compassionate care visits, but families in New York and elsewhere say nursing homes don’t always allow them.Laura Corridi, a 56-year-old senior programmer analyst in Hamlin, New York, has driven an hour and a half on the weekends to stand outside her 93-year-old mother’s nursing home and shout to her through a window throughout the past year.“She gets very upset sometimes,” Corridi said. “She’ll say: ‘It’s cold out. You can’t be out there.’ She starts to cry, ‘Why don’t they let you in?’ She doesn’t want me standing out in the cold.”State lawmakers passed a bill this year that would allow nursing home residents to designate as many as two caregivers who can visit them even if general visitation isn’t allowed, as long as they get tested and follow other infection protocols.Gov. Andrew Cuomo hasn’t yet signed the legislation, however, and his office didn’t respond to a request for comment on whether he intended to do so. Cuomo has taken political heat over recent revelations that his administration did not disclose the full number of nursing home residents who died during the pandemic's peak.New York is one of at least 17 states where lawmakers are considering similar legislation, according to the AP review.But many New Yorkers with relatives in nursing homes say their loved ones can’t wait for companionship.“They’re dying now,” Karen Costner, of Greece, New York, said. “My mother’s losing her will to live every week. And I need to get in there now.”Zucker told lawmakers last month he’s “very empathetic” to family members, but claimed the state's hands are “tied” by federal guidance.“Too many elderly have been isolated, lonely, frightened,” said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. “Many people with cognitive disabilities have been frightened with seeing everybody in masks and not seeing familiar people.”But Caplan, whose mother died at a Massachusetts nursing home last year, said he still worries not enough is being done to protect vulnerable residents. Staffers should be required to be vaccinated, and visitors must be tested, he urged.“If the staff isn’t vaccinated I think people who have family members in there should be screaming for them to get vaccinated,” Caplan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccines-haven-t-cured-loneliness-in-new-york-nursing-homes-101616852538032.html
27-03-2021||World||Prosecutors struggle with consistent story on US Capitol riots||There’s little doubt the Oath Keepers were planning for something on Jan. 6. The question at the heart of the criminal case against its members and associates in the attack on the US Capitol is: What, exactly, did they intend to do?Authorities suggested for weeks in court hearings and papers that members of the far-right militia group plotted their attack in advance in an effort to block the peaceful transition of power. But prosecutors have since said it is not clear whether the group was targeting the Capitol before Jan. 6.“The plan was to unlawfully stop the certification of the Electoral College vote ... and the plan was to be prepared to use violence if necessary,” Assistant US Attorney Kathryn Rakoczy said during a hearing this month. But the Oath Keepers “did not know precisely the way in which force and violence might be needed to support this plan,” she said.Authorities are still combing through a sea of evidence in what they say is likely the most complex investigation ever prosecuted by the Justice Department. More than 300 people are facing federal charges and more are expected. The most serious charges have been brought against 10 people described as members and associates of the Oath Keepers and several members of another far-right extremist group, the Proud Boys.But as the sprawling investigation has unfolded, prosecutors have sometimes struggled to maintain a consistent narrative and had to walk back statements made in court hearings or in papers. It has created an opening for defense attorneys to try to sow doubt in the case.“The government presented a theory (without evidence) that there was a weeks long plan to invade the Capitol,” an attorney for one of the Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, wrote in a recent court filing. “There was no such plan.”In one case, prosecutors declared in court documents in January there was “strong evidence” the pro-Trump mob aimed to “capture and assassinate elected officials." The Justice Department quickly clarified it had no such evidence, blaming it on a miscommunication between prosecutors.After she was pressed by a judge in a recent hearing, Rakoczy conceded authorities “do not have at this point someone explicitly saying, ‘our plan is to force entry into the Capitol in order to stop the certification,’” but cautioned that the investigation is ongoing.“Part of the reason that there wasn’t necessarily as concrete a plan that one might expect is that they were waiting and watching to see what leadership did,” she said.Just a month earlier, Rakoczy told the same judge there’s no other way to read the group’s messages about stationing a “quick reaction force” outside the city other than that they needed weapons available “in the event the activities at the Capitol went badly.”“And those activities at the Capitol were a planned and very well-coordinated attack on the United States Capitol,” she said.Defense attorneys argue any discussions their clients had before Jan. 6 were in reference to providing security at the rally before the riot or protecting themselves against possible attacks from antifa activists.The defendants can still be convicted of conspiring to obstruct Congress even if the plan was formulated only moments before they stormed the Capitol, said Jimmy Gurule, a former federal prosecutor who’s now a professor at the University of Notre Dame law school. And prosecutors have some “pretty compelling circumstantial evidence,” he said.Communications detailed in court documents show the group discussing things like gear and training in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. One man suggested getting a boat to ferry weapons across the Potomac River into their “waiting arms," authorities say.In December, Kelly Meggs, who officials say was the leader of the Oath Keepers' Florida chapter, wrote in a message that he had “organized an alliance” with the Proud Boys. Days before Jan. 6, Meggs instructed someone to tell their friend “this isn't a rally," authorities say.Many came dressed for battle on Jan. 6 in tactical vests and helmets. The leader of the Oath Keepers, who has not been charged, communicated with some of the defendants over a Signal chat called “DC OP: Jan 6 21," which prosecutors say shows the group was “activating a plan to use force on Jan. 6.”Authorities wrote in court papers that the group not only conspired to “forcibly storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 — they planned their attack in advance.” The evidence is “irrefutable,” prosecutors wrote in another document, that Watkins “recruited others to join, trained for, planned, and participated in a coordinated effort to, as she put it, ‘forc(e) entry into the Capitol Building.’”US District Judge Amit Mehta agreed in February to keep Thomas Caldwell, who authorities have portrayed as a leader of the conspiracy, locked up while he awaits trial, saying the evidence showed he “engaged in planning and communications with others ... to plan a potential military-like incursion on the Capitol on January the 6th.”But after Caldwell's lawyer challenged that assessment, the judge reversed his decision and released Caldwell to home confinement. Mehta said there's no evidence he entered the Capitol on Jan. 6 or had been plotting to do so.“Last time we were here 30 days ago, I was convinced that it was a plan to execute an incursion on the Capitol building," the judge told Caldwell's attorney. “You’ve raised some evidence that, I think, rebuts that notion.”The judge has since released other defendants, noting there's no evidence they assaulted anyone at the Capitol or, in some cases, don't appear to be as involved in the planning before Jan. 6.But Mehta on Friday ordered Meggs to remain locked up, calling him a danger to the community. The judge said his communications in the weeks leading up to the attack show he was planning for violence in the streets of Washington even if none specifically mention a plot to storm the Capitol.Prosecutors have also apparently been unable to get on the same page about what to say to the press.A judge recently scolded the Justice Department over a “60 Minutes” interview during which the prosecutor who was leading the investigation suggested some of the rioters could face sedition charges. Former acting District of Columbia US Attorney Michael Sherwin’s interview appeared to violate Justice Department rules and Sherwin is now under internal investigation, a prosecutor told the judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutors-struggle-with-consistent-story-on-us-capitol-riots-101616849788372.html

Our officers should not have to face having bricks, bottles and fireworks being thrown at them by a mob intent on violence and causing damage to property. The police and the city have my full support,” Johnson tweeted.Ten people were arrested by the Bristol City Police, said the Avon and Somerset Police in an official press release. Demonstrators had gathered in front of a police station in Bristol for a sit-down protest against the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which is currently going through the British parliament. This was the third such ‘Kill the Bill’ protest in the UK, two other similar protests in Bristol also witnessed clashes between demonstrators and the police.Avon and Somerset Police said on Saturday that police officers were attacked with glass bottles and bricks, fireworks were launched against the mounted police, and one police horse was covered in paint. “Officers repeatedly encouraged people to disperse but once the atmosphere changed and people became physical it was necessary to take action,” said the police in an official statement.Johnson’s home secretary Priti Patel joined him in condemning the attacks. “I am disgusted by the disorder in Bristol and the violence being directed towards the police,” tweeted Patel.The Associated Press reported that police have been accused of a “heavy-handed response and of exaggerating the scale of injuries to officers” after it went back on an initial report of injuries. The UK police have come under the scanner in recent months, starting with the Metropolitan Police breaking up a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard, who was murdered by a police officer, for violating coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-criticises-violence-at-kill-the-bill-protests-as-disgraceful-101616847073778.html
27-03-2021||World||UK protesters scuffle with police during rally over new law||Police in the English city of Bristol say they arrested 10 people during a third night of protest against a new policing law.Hundreds of demonstrators against the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill staged a sit-down protest outside a police station in the southwest England city on Friday night, and some scuffled with officers in helmets and shields who tried to break up the gathering.The Avon and Somerset Police force said Saturday that eggs, bottles and bricks were thrown at officers and a police horse was daubed with paint.Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned what he called “disgraceful attacks against police officers in Bristol.”“Our officers should not have to face having bricks, bottles and fireworks being thrown at them by a mob intent on violence and causing damage to property," he said on Twitter. "The police and the city have my full support.”The contentious bill, which is currently going through Parliament, gives police stronger powers to restrict protests. Two other “Kill the Bill” demonstrations against the legislation in Bristol this week also saw clashes. Police blamed a minority of troublemakers among the largely peaceful demonstrators.But some have accused the force of a heavy-handed response and of exaggerating the scale of injuries to officers. Police initially claimed that two had suffered broken bones during a protest that turned into a riot on Sunday. The force later said no officer had fractures but 40 were lightly injured.Police Superintendent Mark Runacres said officers “showed exceptional patience in the face of a significant disorder” and had used “reasonable force.”Police conduct and priorities in Britain have come under intense scrutiny following the death of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old London woman who disappeared while walking home from a friend’s house on March 3. A serving police officer has been charged with murdering her.Tensions rose when police broke up a vigil in Everard’s memory because it violated coronavirus restrictions barring mass gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-protesters-scuffle-with-police-during-rally-over-new-law-101616844298214.html
27-03-2021||World||Covid vaccine: Social media urged to remove these 12 anti-vaxxers dubbed as ‘Disinformation Dozen’||US House lawmakers on Thursday grilled top executives of Facebook, Twitter, and Google for allowing disinformation and harmful content on their social media platforms. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat, challenged Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai to remove the accounts of 12 leading influential creators of digital anti-vaccine content.The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a not-for-profit NGO that seeks to disrupt the architecture of online hate and misinformation, recently published a report on 12 anti-vaxxers “who play leading roles in spreading digital misinformation” about vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). According to the report, the majority of them remain on major social media platforms despite repeated violations of their terms of service.After analysing a sample of anti-vaccine content that was shared on Facebook and Twitter, the study found that 65% of the content could be traced to those 12 individuals, dubbed as “the Disinformation Dozen”. The report called on social media firms to follow their repeated promises with concrete action, adding that “updated policies and statements hold little value unless they are strongly and consistently enforced.”Here’s the list of 12 anti-vaxxers identified in the report:Joseph Mercola: The report claims that Mercola peddles dietary supplements and false cures as alternatives to vaccines. Mercola’s social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram remain active and his combined personal social media accounts have around 3.6 million followers.Robert F Kennedy Jr: The long-standing anti-vaxxer and his Children’s Health Defense (CHD) hosts a range of anti-vaccine articles. Kennedy’s personal Instagram account was banned on February 8, but his Facebook page remains active, as does the CHD’s Instagram page.Ty and Charlene Bollinger: The anti-vax entrepreneur duo has a network of accounts that market books and DVDs about vaccines, cancer and Covid-19. The Bollingers have promoted the conspiracy theory that Bill Gates plans to inject everyone with microchips as part of a vaccination program.Sherri Tenpenny: The osteopath physician is accused of spreading anti-vaccine sentiment and false claims about the safety and efficacy of masks. While Facebook has removed her account, Twitter and Instagram have not de-platformed her yet.Rizza Islam: He promoted the false conspiracy theory that Covid-19 vaccines make women infertile in a tweet last June. Rizza Islam’s anti-vaccine posts aim to spread vaccine hesitancy amongst African Americans, the report said. Facebook removed Rizza Islam’s Facebook Page in February, but he continues to post anti-vaccine messages from his Instagram and Twitter accounts.Rashid Buttar: The osteopath physician and conspiracy theorist is known for videos posted on his YouTube channel. In a Facebook post, Buttar claimed that Covid vaccines cause infertility. His Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts are active.Erin Elizabeth: Mercola’s partner runs a prominent ‘alternative health’ website with affiliated newsletter and social media accounts. In an Instagram post, she claimed that vaccines are part of a medical industry plan to create “a chronically-ill population”.Sayer Ji: He runs a popular alternative health website, GreenMedInfo.com, and affiliated social media accounts that promote pseudoscience and anti-vaccine misinformation. Recently, he shared claims on his Facebook account that the Pfizer vaccine has killed more people than Covid. GreenMedInfo accounts on Twitter and Instagram have been removed but is still available on Facebook.Kelly Brogan: Brogan, Sayer Ji’s partner, claims to practice “holistic psychiatry” and sells a range of books and courses from her website. Last year, she posted messages on Instagram encouraging users not to wear masks.Christiane Northrup: Northrup is an obstetrics and gynaecology physician who has embraced alternative medicine and anti-vaccine conspiracies. Northrup shared a link to Google Doc on Facebook that recommends HCQ and Ivermectin among several substances as cures for Covid-19. She also claimed that vaccines cause an 800% increase in chronic illness. Her Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts are active.Ben Tapper: A chiropractor with a growing following on social media, Tapper has routinely posted disinformation on coronavirus and spoken out against wearing a mask.Kevin Jenkins: The anti-vaccine activist has appeared at public events with Robert F Kennedy where has called vaccines a “conspiracy” to “wipe out” black people. Jenkins is a co-founder of the Freedom Airway & Freedom Travel Alliance, a company founded in late 2020 to help its members travel around the world without observing any masking, quarantining, vaccination, or other pandemic control measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disinformation-dozen-social-media-urged-to-remove-these-12-antivaxxers-101616843774586.html
27-03-2021||World||UK police probe school sexual assault claims flooding website||British police are looking into cases of sexual assault reported by girls amid a deluge of witness testimonies collated online that is embroiling some of the country's top private schools.Nearly 6,000 incidents have been described anonymously on the website "Everyone's Invited". Its founder Soma Sara said they exposed a "rape culture" in schools and beyond.The harrowing accounts by schoolgirls come after a London police officer was remanded in custody on March 16, charged with the kidnap and murder of a woman who vanished as she walked home.The disappearance of Sarah Everard sparked outrage and a national debate on women's safety, and raised pressure on London's Metropolitan Police force after officers broke up a vigil for Everard, forcibly dragging away some female protesters.The Met said officers were determining whether any potential victims at schools could be encouraged to report crimes, and "a number of reports of specific offences" were being examined.Incidents involving boys from more than 100 schools have been collated, including some attending elite fee-paying ones such as Sherborne, Westminster and Eton -- where Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince William studied.Pupils demanding change at the private Highgate School in London walked out of classes this week after a dossier with more than 200 testimonies by former and current students was published online. The school said it was launching an independent review."I think it's more widespread than private schools," Detective Superintendent Mel Laremore, the Met's lead officer for rape and sexual offences, stressed on BBC radio Saturday."I think we're still looking into the exact scope of how wide this is spread. But certainly I know there's already over 100 schools cited on the website, which do reach out to national parameters," she said.However, private schools are not obliged to adhere to the government's "safer schools" guidance followed by state schools, Laremore noted.University student Sara, who started sharing witness testimonies in June 2020 after suffering an assault herself, said the focus should go beyond a handful of elite schools."When we narrow our focus on a school, a demographic, or as an individual, we risk making these cases seem like anomalies. But this isn't rare, it happens all the time," she wrote in Friday's i newspaper."When we direct the blame onto a person or place we are undermining the most important message: rape culture is everywhere. And because it's everywhere it affects everyone."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-probe-school-sexual-assault-claims-flooding-website-101616844306320.html

27-03-2021||World||Hong Kong looks at easing travel for vaccinated residents: Carrie Lam||Hong Kong is looking into making it easier for vaccinated residents to travel to encourage more people to get inoculated, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a statement on Saturday.“We have been actively studying whether social distancing measures can be further adjusted if a certain number of people are vaccinated, and we will discuss with other regions whether we can mutually provide travel convenience to vaccinated tourists,” Lam said in an emailed release.About 430,000 people in Hong Kong have received at least the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine since the city began inoculating on Feb. 26, according to Lam. This accounts for 6.6% of people in Hong Kong aged 16 or older who are eligible for inoculation, she said.The city’s vaccination campaign suffered a setback this week when it and Macau temporarily suspended shots manufactured by BioNTech SE because of packaging defects. The suspension risks eroding public confidence in the inoculation, which gave Hong Kong residents an alternative to the one made by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd.BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co., which has the rights to market the mRNA vaccine across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, have initiated an investigation into the issue, according to statements from the Hong Kong and Macau governments.The former British colony’s vaccine roll-out has been beset by challenges including a number of post-vaccine deaths, public distrust in the Beijing-backed government and widespread hesitation.Hong Kong has imposed a stringent tracing and testing program and conducted 100,000 nucleic acid tests a day on average in March, according to Lam. After an outbreak in a gym near the city center this month, an average of 10 close contacts were identified for each confirmed case. About 1,500 people from the cluster were sent to quarantine centers and some 3,300 people underwent virus testing, the chief executive said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-looks-at-easing-travel-for-vaccinated-residents-carrie-lam-101616836915404.html
27-03-2021||World||Explained: Georgia's new voting law that Biden called 'Jim Crow in 21st century'||US President Joe Biden criticised the new voting law in the state of Georgia, in a statement on Friday, and compared it to Jim Crow laws, put in place in the 19th century to legalise racial segregation and disenfranchise Black citizens in America’s South. "This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end," Biden said. Biden said that the law was an attack on the US constitution and the justice department was “taking a look” at it.The 98-page measure, which was signed into law on Thursday by Republican governor Brian Kemp, intends to make several changes in the way elections are conducted in the state. The Democrat party has said that the law will restrict voting access, especially for people of colour. The Republican party claims that the new law will help to restore the confidence which people have lost in Georgia’s elections after the 2020 elections.Why is the law being imposed in Georgia?The state of Georgia was at the centre of the US presidential election last year as it was termed as one of the battleground states. The state had continued to vote for the Republican party but this changed in the 2020 election as Biden became the first Democrat candidate to win Georgia since 1992. Analysts believed that the state turned blue as a large number of people of colour voted for the Democrat party.After the elections, the state became the centre of claims of voter fraud that were made by former president Donald Trump and the Republican party, so much so, that Trump pressured elected officials in the state, repeatedly, to investigate the claims. In the two Senate run-off races in January, Democrats took control of the US Senate as Georgia Republicans lost. Despite the gains made by the Democrats, the government in Georgia is still controlled by the Republicans which brought the Election Integrity Act of 2021.What does the new law say?The law gives the state election board powers to interfere in the election offices of 159 counties of the state and imposes ID requirements for absentee ballots, replacing the current system that required only signatures. The law also limits the use of ballot drop boxes which are said to make voting easier. The law also makes handing out anything, including food and water to people queuing to vote, a misdemeanour. The new law also shortens the time for runoffs in the state from nine weeks to four weeks, thus reducing the span of runoffs in Georgia which is the only state in the US that mandates runoff elections between the top two candidates in case no candidate achieves a majority.What will happen next?Three groups, the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc, have already filed lawsuits against the law saying the law violates the First and 14th amendments of the US Constitution and some parts of the federal Voting Rights Act. “These unjustified measures will individually and cumulatively operate to impose unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote, to deny or abridge the voting rights of Black Georgians, and to deny Black voters in Georgia an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process and elect candidates of their choice,” the groups said in the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-georgia-s-new-voting-law-that-biden-called-jim-crow-in-21st-century-101616839811457.html
27-03-2021||World||Explainer: What does Georgia's new GOP election law do?||The sweeping rewrite of Georgia's election rules represents the first big set of changes since former President Donald Trump's repeated, baseless claims of fraud following his presidential loss to Joe Biden.Georgia has been at the center of that storm. Trump zeroed in on his loss in the state, even as two Democrats won election to the US Senate in January, flipping control of the chamber to their party. The 98-page measure that was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp makes numerous changes to how elections will be administered, including a new photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail.Republican supporters say the law is needed to restore confidence in Georgia’s elections. Democrats say it will restrict voting access, especially for voters of color. Here's a look at some of the top issues:Can the state take over local election offices?Much of the work administering elections in Georgia is handled by the state’s 159 counties. The law gives the State Election Board new powers to intervene in county election offices and to remove and replace local election officials. That has led to concerns that the Republican-controlled state board could exert more influence over the administration of elections, including the certification of county results.One target for intervention could be Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that contains most of Atlanta. The heavily populated county has been plagued by problems, including long lines, and it is often singled out by Republican officials. Under the law, the board could intervene in up to four counties at a time and install a temporary superintendent with the ability to hire and fire personnel including elections directors and poll officers.Are people banned from handing out snacks or water to voters in line?The new law makes it a misdemeanor to hand out “any money or gifts, including, but not limited to, food and drink” to anyone standing in line to vote. The prohibition extends 150 feet from a polling place and 25 feet from any person standing in line.Advocates of the law say they are attempting to crack down on political organizations or advocacy groups trying to influence voters just before they cast a ballot. Critics say it’s cruel and would penalize even nonpartisan groups or individuals for something as simple as giving water to someone waiting in a long line. Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler slammed the proposal Thursday before the bill was signed into law, saying: “They want to make it a crime to bring Grandma some water while she’s waiting in line.”Polling places would be able to, but not required to, set up self-serve water dispensers for voters.Does the bill eliminate Sunday voting?Republicans had proposed at one time to limit early voting on weekends, a time when many Black churches conduct “souls to the polls” efforts to take congregants to vote. But Republicans reversed themselves, and the measure now expands weekend early voting. Previously, one day of weekend voting was required, with counties given the option of offering more. Now two Saturdays will be required, and counties can offer two Sunday voting days as well. Republicans point to this provision to argue they are actually expanding, rather than restricting, voting access.“Contrary to the hyper-partisan rhetoric you may have heard inside and outside this gold dome, the facts are that this new law will expand voting access in the Peach State," Kemp said Thursday.How will runoffs change?Georgia is the only state in the nation that mandates runoff elections between the top two finishers following general elections in which no candidate achieves a majority. Like some other states, Georgia also mandates runoffs for candidates who do not win a majority in a party primary.The system came under scrutiny from Republicans after Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff won twin runoffs in January.The new law shortens the time for runoffs from nine weeks to four, with lawmakers saying the current span is “exhausting” and needs to be shortened to a “more manageable period."Military and overseas voters will use ranked-choice absentee ballots to rank all possible candidates before a primary or general election, allowing their preferences to be determined in any possible runoff. Georgia only had three weeks before runoffs until 2013, when a federal judge ordered a longer gap to give military and overseas voters more time to return ballots.The shorter period means less time for early and mail voting. Early voting had lasted three weeks before runoffs. Now early voting would begin “as soon as possible” but no later than the second Monday before the election, possibly leaving as little as five weekdays and no weekend days of early voting. Voters would also have less time to apply for a mail ballot.No new voters could be registered in the period before a runoff because the registration deadline would be the day before the earlier election.What's nextThree groups filed a lawsuit late Thursday to try to block the law. The New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc. say the law violates the First and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as parts of the federal Voting Rights Act that say states cannot restrict Black voter participation.“These unjustified measures will individually and cumulatively operate to impose unconstitutional burdens on the right to vote, to deny or abridge the voting rights of Black Georgians, and to deny Black voters in Georgia an equal opportunity to participate in the electoral process and elect candidates of their choice,” says the lawsuit, which is filed against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia's State Elections Board.Opponents are also looking to Congress, which is considering nationwide voting standards. A Democratic-backed measure passed the House earlier this month, but faces opposition from Senate Republicans wary of a federal takeover of state elections.The federal proposal would create automatic voter registration nationwide, allow former felons to vote, and limit the ways states can remove registered voters from their rolls. It would expand voting by mail, promote early voting and give states money to track absentee ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-does-georgia-s-new-gop-election-law-do-101616837072383.html

What we know so far||The large container ship with all Indian crew remains stuck for the fifth day in Suez Canal on Saturday, while efforts are on to unblock one of the world’s busiest trade routes. Yukito Higaki, the president of Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK that owns the wedged vessel Ever Given, has already apologised for the incident and said 10 tug boats were deployed and workers were dredging the bank and sea floors near the ship’s bow to free it.Here’s what we know so far about the Suez blockage:It is estimated that more than 200 vessels are stuck in the traffic jam created by the blockage of the narrow canal by the over 220,000-tonne container ship. If the clearance of the blockage now takes more than two days, then it will take a week to clear the backlog as more ships are adding to the chock-a-block.Also Read | Serum Institute's Adar Poonawalla hopes to launch 2nd Covid vaccine by SeptemberThe US has also offered to help clear the blockage as the Suez Canal Authority welcomed international assistance in the matter. “We have equipment and capacity that most countries don’t have and we’re seeing what we can do and what help we can be,” Reuters quoted President Biden as saying. Additionally, the White House press secretary said the US sees the impact on the energy market from the challenge at the canal and it will continue to monitor the market situation and will respond appropriately if needed, as the key route for oil transit remains blocked.India has also chalked out a four-point plan regarding the issue. The plan includes identifying perishable cargo for its priority movement. Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA) has said that the freight rates will be maintained as per the existing contracts. The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways has assured to issue an advisory to the ports of JNPT, Mundra and Hazira to boost arrangements and ensure efficient handling during the upcoming busy period as the clearance of the blockage anticipates some clustering at these ports, news agency ANI reported.The Suez Canal Authority said at least two efforts were planned to be made on Saturday to free the canal, depending on the time of the tide. The attempt to free Ever Given failed on Friday and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday to join others in the effort, said the technical manager of the ship Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement.Also Read | Stuck in Suez: Thousands of animals packed tight in ship hullsNatural gas prices have increased and the food supply chain has been disrupted as the canal blockage wreaked havoc on the sea trade, reported Bloomberg. Moody’s investor has estimated an impact on 10-15 per cent of world container throughout and said that the timing could not be worse.The closure of the canal could also impact the oil and gas shipment to Europe from the Middle East as 10 per cent of the world trade flows through the canal. Reuters quoted an analyst as saying that while there is no loss of oil supply, it can tie up tankers for longer if they have to navigate through the Cape of Good Hope, the southern tip of Africa that takes an extra two weeks to reach the destination.Multiple ships in the Indian Ocean that were intended to pass through the canal have detoured to avoid the blockage. One of them is Panama-flagged Ever Greet.The 400 meter long container is stuck in the single-lane stretch of the canal about 6km north of the southern entrance near the city of Suez. The 193km canal connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and is the shortest route between Asia and Europe.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-blockage-stalemate-going-on-for-5th-day-what-we-know-so-far-101616831653862.html
27-03-2021||World||Stuck in Suez: Thousands of animals packed tight in ship hulls||Of all the millions of tons of cargo that’s piled up in the Suez Canal, none is more delicate than the animals crammed into the hulls of several of the ships.Little information is available, with neither canal officials nor shipping executives willing to talk, but data compiled by Bloomberg indicate as many as 10 vessels stuck in and around the canal could be carrying livestock. Given the Europe-to-Saudi Arabia itinerary, they are most likely carrying sheep.While much of the waylaid cargo is commodity products such as oil that can be stored on ships for long periods, livestock need food and water, and such deliveries usually carry only enough for a few extra days. That could create a critical situation for ships to find feed supplies at a local port, or force them to turn around. Dislodging the vessel blocking the canal may take at least a week, longer than initially feared, people familiar with the matter said.“I wouldn’t expect just after a two-day delay for a problem to have built up,” said Peter Stevenson, chief policy officer at animal-welfare group Compassion in World Farming, which has called for an end to the live-animal shipments. “It’s as time goes by that the problems get worse. Occasionally, there are real scandals when things go wrong, but it’s a day-to-day horror.”Cattle can also be transported by sea, and ships would generally have at least two or three days’ worth of extra hay or feed on board, said Bob Bishop, president of the Livestock Exporters Association of the USA. If the feed runs out, they could get more from a port while refueling. A ship that can’t get to dock could get feed from a barge in what’s known as “midstream loading,” he said.Weighing Options“If you’re getting low on feed, I would look at coming into port and putting on extra feed,” Bishop said by phone from New York. “If I was the owner of the sheep, I would try to find a country that needed sheep,” he added. “The shorter route would be back to Romania.”At least 10 vessels designed to ship animals are parked near the shuttered canal, and several appear to be en route between Romania and Saudi Arabia, according to ship data compiled by Bloomberg. The ones departing the European country are likely carrying sheep, which Saudi Arabia purchases so that the animals can be slaughtered according to religious preferences. Those traveling the other direction could be empty vessels.The Middle Eastern nation is the world’s largest sheep importer by a wide margin, United Nations data shows. But the trade route has faced disaster at times. About 14,000 sheep being shipped from Romania to Saudi Arabia were killed when a vessel partly capsized in 2019, according to media reports at the time. Rescuers were only able to save a a little over 200 animals.Risks En RouteVessels that crowd thousands of sheep and longer journeys raise the risk of disease and stress, said Stevenson of the animal welfare group. Some ships used to transport animals also have been converted from other purposes and aren’t ideally suited, he said. It can be difficult to reverse course after departure due to health rules.Bishop said mortality rates for livestock generally are no higher at sea than on land, with most ships having a veterinarian.A U.S. shipment of dairy cattle left the Texas port of Galveston late last year en route to Pakistan via the Suez, according to Bishop. Another recent shipment of U.S. cattle sailed from the West Coast to Pakistan, avoiding the Suez due to tolls, he said.“After this container ship, you might see more and more of that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stuck-in-suez-thousands-of-animals-packed-tight-in-ship-hulls-101616836988286.html

27-03-2021||World||UN expresses gratitude as India gifts 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for peacekeepers||Top United Nations officials, including the UN peacekeeping chief, have expressed gratitude to India for its gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for peacekeepers, saying the donation will enable the Blue Helmets to continue their life-saving work in a safe manner.The 200,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines, announced as a gift by India for UN peacekeepers, left Mumbai in the early hours of Saturday and will arrive at Copenhagen, Denmark. They will then be distributed to all UN peacekeeping missions.Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix and Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support Atul Khare on Friday hailed India’s contribution of the vaccine doses for the UN peacekeepers.“An effective roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine to all peacekeepers is a key priority for the United Nations in order to protect our personnel and their capacity to continue their crucial work, help protect vulnerable communities and deliver on their mandates,” Lacroix said.“India is a longstanding and steadfast supporter of Peacekeeping and I want to thank the Government and people of India, who have generously donated Covid-19 vaccines to benefit our peacekeeping personnel and enable them to continue their life-saving work in a safe manner.”Khare thanked India for donating the 200,000 vaccines to UN peacekeeping missions."This important donation will allow us to ensure that UN peacekeepers are able to remain healthy and deliver in some of the most difficult environments in the world without relying on already stretched national health systems or ongoing COVAX efforts.”He added that “we also remain engaged with our troop and police-contributing countries to ensure that wherever possible, uniformed personnel are vaccinated through their national systems prior to deployment. At the same time, my Department is leading UN system-wide arrangements to support national efforts in vaccinating UN civilian personnel and family members.”External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had announced in February that India will gift 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers.“Keeping in mind the UN Peacekeepers who operate in such difficult circumstances, we would like to announce today a gift of 200,000 doses for them,” Jaishankar had said while addressing the UN Security Council open debate on the implementation of resolution 2532 (2020) on the cessation of hostilities in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.Quoting the Bhagavad Gita, Jaishankar had said “Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”The 200,000 doses essentially mean that it will be possible to administer the required double doses of Covid vaccines to all UN peacekeepers across missions.According to UN Peacekeeping, as of January 31, 2021 a total of 85,782 personnel are serving in 12 peacekeeping operations across the world led by the Department of Peace Operations.A total of 121 nations are contributing uniformed personnel to the UN peacekeeping missions.India is one of the largest contributors of troops and police to UN peacekeeping missions, with more than 5,000 men and women deployed in nine missions, including in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Lebanon.The 200,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine left Mumbai via Qatar Airways on March 27 at 04:10 am.The shipment will go to Copenhagen, where it will be safely stored in a facility, re-packaged and quickly distributed to peacekeeping missions for the peacekeepers.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.The Department of Peace Operations said that over the past year, UN peacekeepers around the world have undertaken “remarkable efforts” as they adjusted and responded to the unprecedented global health crisis.Nearly 100,000 peacekeepers, already operating within complex and challenging environments, managed to keep themselves and others safe while supporting national and local authorities in their response to the pandemic. It added that despite the unexpected challenges posed by Covid-19, peacekeepers demonstrated adaptability and flexibility to continue implementing their core mandates, which is to protect people and build sustainable peace.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had said that he is “extremely grateful” for the gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers announced by India.Under India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’ initiative, which translates into Vaccine Friendship, the country has been providing vaccines to nations across the world - from India’s immediate neighbours to countries in Latin America and Africa - and is a significant source of supply to the COVAX facility.More than 58 million Made in India coronavirus vaccine doses have reached about 70 countries in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expresses-gratitude-as-india-gifts-200-000-vaccine-doses-for-peacekeepers-101616835612676.html
27-03-2021||World||Vaccinated Britain is about to face its biggest Covid-19 test yet||The UK looks to be in an enviable place as a third wave of coronavirus infections sweeps across Europe. A rapid vaccine rollout and weeks of lockdown to suppress what the continent refers to as the “English strain” has seen deaths and hospitalizations plummet.Yet concerns are growing inside the government in London that progress could be undermined by any vaccine-resistant variants and a toxic political row with the European Union over exports that could result in a shortfall of doses. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The jump in infections on Britain’s doorstep could now be the first real global test of whether a pace-setting inoculation program is enough to keep a country protected. It will also give an indication of whether it’s enough to ensure there’s no setback to reopening the economy.After a steady fall, Covid-19 infections across the UK are plateauing nationwide and starting to rise among the under-19s after schools reopened this month. There’s also the prospect of having to prioritize dwindling vaccine supplies on giving people second doses after the UK decided to lengthen the gap between shots. That would mean the younger end of the population will remain unvaccinated for longer.The UK has given 43% of the country at least one dose—or more than half the adult population—compared with 9.6% in the European Union, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker. That’s made Britain stand out for positive reasons after recording Europe’s highest death toll from Covid-19 and a series of government missteps.But the UK still finds itself in an “incredibly risky situation,” said Susan Michie, a behavioral scientist who sits on the government’s scientific advisory committee SAGE. “We’ve got a partially vaccinated population with high transmission levels still—which means lots of mutations, variants,” she said. “The more variants, the more likely there are to be variants that undermine the vaccination program.”The third wave in Europe is driven mainly by the more contagious U.K. strain of the virus, but the South African and Brazilian versions account for up to 40% of all new cases in some regions of France, according to data presented to the U.K. government seen by The Times newspaper.Any rise in these new strains is highly worrying because it’s not yet clear how resistant they are to vaccines. “When a wave hits our friends,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on March 22. “I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well.”Politically, it’s also a mess. Officials in the UK and the EU are in talks over how best to resolve a dispute over sharing vaccines after the bloc toughened restrictions on exports. That followed a temporary suspension of the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine in some countries over concerns about side effects, which has undermined public confidence.The UK government has—in the main—attempted to stay above the fray in public. Johnson has repeatedly said that all countries are “fighting the same pandemic.” The government doesn’t want to lose the “moral high ground,” according to one minister, speaking on condition of anonymity.But behind closed doors, there are fears in government about what a blockade of vaccines from Europe would mean for Britain—especially because the U.K. is facing a significant reduction in supply in April due to a delayed delivery from India and the re-testing of a separate batch.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that the tensions over AstraZeneca supply was partially due to British vaccination strategy and suggested the U.K. was blackmailing Europe. “One has wanted to massively vaccinate with a first dose and then one finds oneself slightly handicapped for the second dose,” he said. “Europe doesn’t have to pay the price for this policy.”One senior EU official said the U.K. was “over-committed” because it had rolled out so many first doses without securing supplies for second doses. That means Johnson’s government now badly needs the EU’s help, the official claimed. The UK government says that vaccine supplies remain secure and there is no threat to people getting their second dose within 12 weeks. There are also new shots in the pipeline. The Moderna Inc. vaccine, made in the US, has been approved by the UK regulator and is due to be rolled out within weeks. The Novavax Inc. shot, to be made in the UK, is awaiting approval. Having a broad supply of vaccines is vital to getting people under 50 immunized, keeping cases down and preventing new variants from South Africa and Brazil taking hold in the UK., said Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School. He pointed to a surge in the number of younger people being hospitalized in Brazil. “That’s a worry and that’s why I don't think there’s any room for complacency.”The government, though, is under pressure to reopen the economy and give people some semblance of normality this summer. “If pubs, restaurants, and the wedding industry don’t get back up and running then people are going to lose their jobs and people will lose what brings them joy,” said Steve Baker, a senior parliamentarian in the governing Conservative Party.Johnson already conceded this week that vacations abroad “look difficult for the time being,” another blow to the travel industry. He will set out plans on travel in early April, but privately those inside government are pessimistic.One UK official warned that if Britons were allowed to go overseas this summer, it would be “madness.” “It’s like: ‘Hello new variants, come on in’,” the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-britain-is-about-to-face-its-biggest-covid-19-test-yet-101616835966377.html
27-03-2021||World||Indonesia's Merapi volcano spews ash, debris in new eruption||Indonesia’s most volatile volcano was erupting again Saturday, releasing plumes of ash high into the air and sending streams of lava and debris down its slopes. No casualties were reported.An avalanche of rocks spilled down Mount Merapi's slopes before dawn and clouds of hot ash shot 200 meters (656 feet) into the air as the mountain groaned and rumbled, said Hanik Humaida, the head of Yogyakarta’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center.The volcano unleashed hot clouds of ash at least eight times since the morning as well as a series of pyroclastic flows — a mixture of rock, debris, lava and gasses — that had reached nearly 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) down its slopes, Humaida said.The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) high volcano is on densely populated Java island near the ancient city of Yogyakarta. It is the most active of dozens of Indonesian volcanoes and has repeatedly erupted recently.Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center has advised villagers living on Merapi’s slopes to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from its crater and be aware of the peril of lava.Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people.Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, sits along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped area along the edge of the ocean that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-merapi-volcano-spews-ash-debris-in-new-eruption-101616835499235.html

27-03-2021||World||Suez Canal remains blocked amid efforts to free stuck vessel||A giant container ship remained stuck sideways in Egypt's Suez Canal for a fifth day Saturday, as authorities prepared to make new attempts to free the vessel and reopen a crucial east-west waterway for global shipping.The Ever Given, a Panama-flagged ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, ran aground Tuesday in the narrow canal that runs between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula.The massive vessel got stuck in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about six kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez.Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the technical manager of the Ever Given, said an attempt Friday to free it failed.Plans were in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday to join others already trying to move the massive ship, it said.An official at the Suez Canal Authority said they planned to make at least two attempts Saturday to free the vessel when the high tide goes down. He said the timing depends on the tide.The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief journalists.Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site. The canal authority said its head, Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei, would hold a news conference Saturday in the city of Suez, a few kilometers (miles) from the site of the vessel.Shoei Kisen President Yukito Higaki told a news conference at company headquarters in Imabari in western Japan that 10 tugboats were deployed and workers were dredging the banks and sea floor near the vessel's bow to try to get it afloat again as the high tide starts to go out.Shoei Kisen said in a statement Saturday the company was considering removing containers to lighten the vessel if refloating efforts fail, but that would be a difficult operation.The White House said it has offered to help Egypt reopen the canal. “We have equipment and capacity that most countries don't have and we're seeing what we can do and what help we can be,” President Joe Biden told reporters Friday.An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure, the company and the canal authority said.GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.A maritime traffic jam grew to around 280 vessels Saturday outside the Suez Canal, according to canal service provider Leth Agencies.Some vessels began changing course and dozens of ships were still en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv.A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures.About 10 per cent of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for transporting oil. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East.It remained unclear how long the blockage would last. Even after reopening the canal that links factories in Asia to consumers in Europe, the waiting containers are likely to arrive at busy ports, forcing them to face additional delays before offloading.Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, on a course around Africa instead, according to satellite data.Others also are being diverted. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-remains-blocked-amid-efforts-to-free-stuck-vessel-101616834556650.html
27-03-2021||World||At least 50 protesters killed in Myanmar on 'day of shame for armed forces'||Myanmar's security forces shot and killed at least 50 protesters on Saturday, news reports and witnesses said, a brutal crackdown on dissent that came as the leader of the ruling junta said the military will protect the people and strive for democracy.Protesters against the Feb. 1 military coup came out on the streets of Yangon, Mandalay and other towns, defying a warning that they could be shot "in the head and back", while the country's generals celebrated Armed Forces Day."Today is a day of shame for the armed forces," Dr. Sasa, a spokesman for CRPH, an anti-junta group set up by deposed lawmakers, told an online forum."The military generals are celebrating Armed Forces Day after they just killed more than 300 innocent civilians," he said, giving a rough estimate of the toll since protests first erupted weeks ago.At least four people were killed when security forces opened fire at a crowd protesting outside a police station in Yangon's Dala suburb in the early hours of Saturday, Myanmar Now reported. At least 10 people were wounded, the news portal said.Three people, including a young man who plays in a local under-21 football team, were shot and killed in a protest in the Insein district of the city, a neighbour told Reuters.Thirteen people were killed in various incidents in Mandalay, Myanmar Now said. Deaths were also reported from the Sagaing region near Mandalay, Lashio town in the east, in the Bago region, near Yangon, and elsewhere, it said.Myanmar Now said a total of at least 50 people were killed on Saturday. Reuters could not independently verify the numbers killed.A military spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment.After presiding over a military parade in the capital Naypyitaw to mark Armed Forces Day, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing reiterated a promise to hold elections, without giving any time-frame."The army seeks to join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy," the general said in a live broadcast on state television, adding that authorities also sought to protect the people and restore peace across the country."Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate."The number of people killed in the turmoil since the coup against Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government is now nearly 380, based on Thursday's toll and a tally kept by an activist group.SHOTS TO HEADIn an ominous warning on Friday evening, state television said protesters were "in danger of getting shot to the head and back". The warning did not specifically say that security forces had been given shoot-to-kill orders but the junta has previously tried to suggest that some fatal shootings have come from within the crowds.But it showed the military's determination to prevent any disruptions around Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945 that was orchestrated by Suu Kyi's father, the founder of the military.Suu Kyi, Myanmar's most popular civilian politician, remains in detention at an undisclosed location. Many other figures in her party are also being held in custody.In a week that saw international pressure on the junta ramped up with new U.S. and European sanctions, Russia's deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin attended the parade in Naypyitaw, having meet senior junta leaders a day earlier."Russia is a true friend," Min Aung Hlaing said. There were no signs of other diplomats at an event that is usually attended by scores of officials from foreign nations.Support from Russia and China, which has also refrained from criticism, is important for the junta as they are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and can block potential U.N. actions.Protesters have taken to the streets almost daily since the coup that derailed Myanmar's slow transition to democracy.Until Friday evening, activist group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) counted at least 328 protesters who have been killed in the weeks of unrest. Its data shows that around a quarter of them died from shots to the head, raising suspicions they were targeted for killing.Myanmar's ethnic armed factions will not stand by and do nothing if the junta's forces continue to kill protesters, the leader of one of the main armed groups said."The Myanmar Armed Forces Day isn’t an armed forces day, it’s more like the day they killed people," General Yawd Serk, chair of the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army - South, told Reuters."It isn’t for the protection of democracy as well, it’s how they harm democracy...If they continue to shoot at protesters and bully the people, I think all the ethnic groups would not just stand by and do nothing."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-50-protesters-killed-in-myanmar-on-day-of-shame-for-armed-forces-101616834121357.html

All eight were taken to local hospitals, with some of their conditions ranging from serious to life-threatening.One woman died of a gunshot wound on the scene, the release said. At an earlier news conference, police Chief Paul Neudigate said the death possibly stemmed from an unrelated shooting.The release also said one officer suffered minor injuries. Neudigate had said the officer was struck by a vehicle during the investigation.A different officer fatally shot a man at the shooting scene. While officers were investigating the original shooting, shots were fired nearby, Neudigate said. The officer confronted the man, leading to the deadly gunfire.The officer has been placed on administrative leave. He has been with the department for five years and is assigned to its special operations division.The original shooting and the officer shooting were being investigated concurrently, the release said.“We have a very chaotic incident, a very chaotic night,” Neudigate said during the news conference.No suspect information was immediately available. Neudigate said several people were in police custody but their possible involvement in the shooting was still under investigation.Multiple roads were blocked off throughout the night while police worked in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-dead-8-injured-in-virginia-beach-oceanfront-shootings-101616834130237.html
27-03-2021||World||Ex-Trump adviser takes central role in Republican effort to tighten voting laws||A GOP lawyer who advised former President Donald Trump on his campaign to overturn the 2020 election results is now playing a central role coordinating the Republican effort to tighten voting laws around the country.Cleta Mitchell, a longtime Republican lawyer and advocate for conservative causes, was among the Trump advisers on a January phone call in which Trump asked Georgia election officials to “find” enough votes to declare him, and not Democrat Joe Biden, the winner of the battleground state.Now Mitchell has taken the helm of two separate efforts to push for tighter state voting laws and to fight Democratic efforts to expand access to the ballot at the federal level. She is also advising state lawmakers crafting the voting restriction proposals. And, she said Friday, she is in regular contact with Trump.“People are actually interested in getting involved and we have to harness all this energy,” Mitchell said in an interview. “There are a lot of groups that have projects on election integrity that never did before.”Mitchell's new prominence tightens the ties between the former president, who has falsely insisted he lost the election due to fraud, and the GOP-led state voting overhaul that has helped turn a foundational principle of democracy into a partisan battleground.Trump's false claims of fraud have fueled a wave of new voting restrictions. More than 250 proposed voting restrictions have been proposed this year by mostly Republican lawmakers, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. On Thursday, Georgia's GOP governor signed into law a measure requiring voters to present ID to vote by mail, gives the GOP-controlled state legislature new powers over local elections boards and outlaws providing food or water to people waiting in line to vote. Biden on Friday condemned it as “Jim Crow in the 21st Century.”In response, Democrats have stepped up the push for a massive federal election overhaul bill. That proposal, known as H.R. 1, would effectively neuter state-level voter ID laws, allow anyone to vote by mail if they wanted to and automatically register citizens to vote. Republicans view that as an encroachment on state control over elections and say it is designed to give Democrats an advantage.“The left is trying to dismantle 100 years of advancement in election administration,” Mitchell said, expressing bafflement at Democrats' charges that Republicans are trying to suppress votes. “We’re watching two different movies right now.”Mitchell's most public involvement in the voting wars came in participation on Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger Jan. 2. During that call, Mitchell insisted she had evidence of voting fraud, but officials with the Secretary of State's office told her that her data was incorrect.The call is part of an investigation by the Fulton County District Attorney's office into whether Trump or others improperly tried to influence election officials. Mitchell would not discuss the call or the investigation.Mitchell's involvement caused an outcry in the legal community and led to her departure from her longtime job at the law firm Foley & Lardner. But Mitchell says that has been a blessing.“One of the great advantages of resigning from my law firm is that I can devote all my time to something I love,” she said.Mitchell has two new roles in an emerging conservative voting operation. She's running a $10 million initiative at the limited government group FreedomWorks to both push for new restrictions in voting and help train conservatives to get involved in the nuts and bolts of local elections. She's also a senior legal fellow at the Conservative Partnership Institute, an organization run by former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. She says she'll use that role to “coordinate” conservative voting positions, particularly in opposition to H.R. 1.A onetime Oklahoma state legislator, Mitchell, 70, has links to other influential players in the conservative movement. She also serves as outside counsel to the American Legislative Exchange Committee, a conservative group that provides model legislation to state lawmakers and organized a call with state lawmakers and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on opposing H.R. 1.And Mitchell said she's been talking regularly with Republican state lawmakers about the need for new election laws. She would not identify whom she speaks with but said it's been a longtime passion."I’ve been working with state legislatures for several years to get them to pay attention to what I call the political process,” Mitchell said. “I love legislatures and working with legislators.”She similarly would not detail her conversations with Trump or say whether they involved the new voting fights. “I’m in touch with the president fairly frequently,” she said of Trump.Repeated audits have shown no significant problems with the 2020 election. Trump and his supporters lost more than 50 court cases challenging its results.Mitchell says she believes the courts used legal trickery to avoid ever truly addressing Trump’s allegations of voter fraud.That evidence had made some conservative groups careful not to echo Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud, even as they argue for tighter restrictions on who Americans vote.Mitchell’s role could complicate that effort to keep a distance.“I have concerns with the election but I do not think the election was stolen," said Noah Wall, executive vice president of FreedomWorks. However, Wall said he saw no conflict in working with Mitchell. “When we talk about what we’re going to be focused on, I don’t see any daylight between her issues and ours,” Wall said.Mitchell has a long history in the conservative movement, with positions on the boards of the National Rifle Association and the Bradley Foundation. She represented Trump's Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, and has been the campaign attorney for several Republican senators. She also is chair of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, a conservative election law project that she said may get involved in litigation against H.R. 1, should it pass, or in support of new laws like the one in Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extrump-adviser-takes-central-role-in-republican-effort-to-tighten-voting-laws-101616822518650.html

He gave no date for elections."The army seeks to join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy," the general said in a live broadcast on state television, adding that authorities also sought to protect the people and restore peace across the country."Violent acts that affects stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate".Troops killed four more people in demonstrations on Friday, taking the number of deaths to 328 in the crackdown that has followed the coup against Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1.A broadcast on the state television on Friday evening said: "You should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back".The warning did not specifically say that security forces had been given shoot-to-kill orders, and the junta has previously tried to suggest that some fatal shootings have come from within the crowds of protesters.But it indicated that the military was determined to prevent any disruptions around Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the military's resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945.Min Aung Hlaing said the army had to seize power because of "unlawful acts" by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, adding that some party leaders had been found guilty of corruption and legal action was being taken against them.In a week that saw international pressure on the junta ramped up with new U.S. and European sanctions, Russia's deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin attended the parade. On Friday, he met senior junta leaders and offered support for the military."Russia in a true friend," Min Aung Hlaing said. There were no signs of other diplomats at an event that is usually attended by scores of officials from other nations.SHOTS TO THE HEADProtesters have taken to the streets almost daily since the coup that derailed Myanmar's slow transition to democracy.At least 328 protesters have been killed in the weeks of unrest as of Friday night, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Its data shows that at least 25% of them died from shots to the head, raising suspicions they were deliberately targeted for killing.Reuters could not independently verify the numbers killed.A military spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment.The United Nations' special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said the military had turned against its own citizens."Women, youth and children have been among those killed," she said in a statement.Defence ties between Russia and Myanmar have grown in recent years with Moscow providing training to thousands of soldiers as well as selling arms to the military.Russia's support for the junta is also important as it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and along with China, which has also refrained from criticism, can block potential U.N. actions.Fomin's visit took place after the United States, Britain and the European Union imposed new sanctions on groups and individuals linked to the coup.The World Bank on Friday slashed its forecast for Myanmar's economy to a 10% contraction in 2021 from the growth expected previously.Suu Kyi, Myanmar's most popular civilian politician, remains in detention at an undisclosed location.

The two leaders agreed to work closely on shared foreign policy priorities, including China and Iran, according to a statement by the White House.While the White House did not reveal details of the issues discussed, Downing Street issued an elaborate statement.According to the UK government, the two leaders discussed the fight against coronavirus and updated each other on their countries' vaccine rollouts. Prime Minister Johnson stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic.They talked about shared international challenges. The leaders agreed on the need for Iran to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal. On Northern Ireland, the two leaders reiterated their shared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement."On China, the Prime Minister and President reflected on the significant action taken by the UK, the US and other international partners earlier this week to impose sanctions on human rights violators in Xinjiang and expressed their concern about retaliatory action taken by China," the Downing Street's statement read.On Friday, China introduced sanctions on nine UK citizens and four entities in response to London's sanctions on Beijing over the issue of human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.The United States, Canada and the United Kingdom joined the European Union (EU) on Monday to take what they described as "coordinated action" against China to send "a clear message about the human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang".The sanctions blacklisted former and current officials in the Xinjiang region--Zhu Hailun, Wang Junzheng, Wang Mingshan and Chen Mingguo--for alleged abuses, which have sparked international outrage.The coordinated move also targeted the state-run Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. The sanctions agreed on Monday mark the EU's first punitive measures on Beijing since it imposed an arms embargo after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.In retaliation to the bloc's sanctions, China has decided to introduce sanctions against 10 European Union officials and four European organisations after accusing them of spreading lies and false information about the Xinjiang region."China decided to sanction 10 people and four organisations who seriously harmed the country's sovereignty and interests by spreading lies and false information with evil intent," the ministry said in a statement as quoted by Sputnik.The dispute has seen a flurry of activity in diplomatic circles, with China and European nations summoning each other's ambassadors to answer for the move and responses to it, according to the South China Morning Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-johnson-concerned-about-china-s-response-to-xinjiang-related-sanctions-101616806706493.html
27-03-2021||World||North Korea missile test: UNSC renews mandate of experts, asks for probe||The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday to renew the mandate of U.N. experts monitoring sanctions against North Korea hours after members met to discuss Pyongyang’s latest test firings of banned ballistic missiles.The ballistic missile launches were the first since President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20 and appeared aimed at increasing pressure on his administration while nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang remain stalled. Negotiations faltered after the second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then-President Donald Trump collapsed in February 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.The Security Council has been meeting virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic and email voting began after the North's missile launches on Thursday morning. The U.S. holds the council presidency this month and the unanimous result of the vote was announced Friday afternoon by acting U.S. deputy ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis.The U.S.-drafted resolution extends the panel of experts’ mandate until April 30, 2022, and emphasizes “the importance of credible, fact-based, independent assessments, analysis and recommendations.”In their latest report to the council in early February, the experts said North Korea has modernized its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by flaunting United Nations sanctions, using cyberattacks to help finance its programs and continuing to seek material and technology overseas for its arsenal including in Iran.The panel said North Korea’s “total theft of virtual assets from 2019 to November 2020 is valued at approximately $316.4 million,” according to one unidentified country. And the experts said their investigations found that North Korean-linked cyber actors continued to conduct operations in 2020 against financial institutions and virtual currency exchange houses to generate money to support its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.At Friday morning’s virtual meeting of the committee monitoring sanctions and North Korea, where all 15 Security Council members are represented, U.N. diplomats said a significant majority expressed concern at Pyongyang’s latest violations of council resolutions banning ballistic missile launches.All council members agreed that the panel of experts should investigate the two latest ballistic missile launches on Thursday morning, they said.The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussion was private, said the Security Council is likely to hold a closed discussion on the missile launches next week.The council has imposed increasingly tough sanctions on North Korea since its first test explosion of a nuclear device in 2006. It has banned most of the country’s exports and severely limited its imports, trying to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.But the report’s summary and some key findings and recommendations, obtained by The Associated Press, made clear that North Korea remains able to evade sanctions and develop its weapons and to illicitly import refined petroleum, access international banking channels and carry out “malicious cyber activities.”In North Korea’s weapons development, the experts said, Kim Jong Un’s government has produced fissile material — an essential ingredient for producing nuclear weapons — and maintained its nuclear facilities.“It displayed new short-range, medium-range, submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile systems at military parades,” they said. “It announced preparation for testing and production of new ballistic missile warheads and, development of tactical nuclear weapons ... and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-test-unsc-renews-mandate-of-experts-asks-for-probe-101616806322295.html
27-03-2021||World||Chinese apps join backlash against Western fashion brands over Xinjiang||China's top ride-hailing app dropped Swedish fashion retailer H&M from its listings as Chinese celebrities stopped endorsing foreign labels in a growing uproar over Western accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang.H&M faced a public backlash in China when social media users in the country circulated a statement the company made last year announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of the use of forced labour by Uighur Muslims.Western governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the farwestern region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.Beijing denies the accusations and describes the camps in question as vocational training centres which help combat religious extremism.Search results for H&M in the Didi Chuxing ride-hailing app for all of China's major cities yielded no results on Friday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The backlash against H&M caused Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, shopping app Meituan and the maps app for search engine Baidu Inc to each remove the Swedish retailer from their listings.Other overseas brands, including Burberry Group PLC, Nike Inc, and Adidas AG have also faced an online blowback for making similar statements regarding their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang.The Human Rights section of H&M's website hmgroup.com on Friday no longer carried the link to the 2020 statement on Xinjiang. The statement could still be accessed through the page's direct address.Statements expressing concern about or intolerance of forced labour in Xinjiang previously seen on the websites of Inditex, VF Corp, PVH and Abercrombie & Fitch were no longer available on Thursday.Following enquiries by Reuters, VF Corp pointed to a statement on a separate section of its website that said it did not source from Xinjiang. A Google cache showed the statement had been added in the last four days. VF did not respond to a question asking why the statement had been moved.PVH, Inditex and Abercrombie & Fitch did not respond to a request for comment."We have to stand by the brands keeping statements condemning slavery and shame those who are taking them down. This is a defining moment for these brands," said French MEP Raphael Glucksmann, one of 10 EU individuals sanctioned by China who has run social media campaigns calling on retailers to stand against forced labour in Xinjiang."Consumers in Europe need to place counter pressure on companies retracting their statements."CHINA CELEBS DROP BRANDSA message on the Chinese Weibo account of the German fashion house Hugo Boss said on Thursday that it would "continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton." Hugo Boss said on Friday that it was not an authorized post, and had been deleted accordingly.In an email to Reuters on Friday, company spokeswoman Carolin Westermann said that an undated English-language statement on its website stating that "so far, HUGO BOSS has not procured any goods originating in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers" was its official position. The cotton row has spilled over into the entertainment world, with Chinese celebrities dropping several foreign retail labels, including six U.S. brands such as Nike.New Balance, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger and Converse, owned by Nike, have come under fire in China for statements saying they would not use Xinjiang cotton.Other brands affected include Adidas, Puma and Fast Retailing's Uniqlo."I can confirm that Uniqlo's Chinese brand ambassadors have terminated their contracts," said a Fast Retailing spokesperson."Regarding cotton, we only source sustainable cotton and this has not changed."At least 27 Chinese movie stars and singers have declared in the past two days that they would stop cooperating with foreign brands.Their decision was widely praised by Chinese internet users for being patriotic and trended high on the popular Twitter-like microblog Weibo."I have bought these kinds of products in the past and this situation doesn't mean that I will now throw them away, destroy them or something like that," said graduate Lucy Liu outside a Beijing shopping mall."What I'll do is just avoid buying them for the moment."Beyond the fashion and retail industry, China sanctioned British organisations and individuals on Friday over what it called "lies and disinformation" about Xinjiang, days after Britain imposed sanctions of its own."China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not to go further down the wrong path," the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. "Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions."The sanctions are the latest sign of deteriorating relations between London and Beijing, including China's crackdown on dissent in the former British colony of Hong Kong, which had been guaranteed its freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.(Reporting by Ryan Woo and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing, Josh Horwitz in Shanghai, Victoria Waldersee in Lisbon, Anna Ringstrom in Stockholm and William James, Sarah Young and Paul Sandle in London; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Daniel Wallis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-apps-join-backlash-against-western-fashion-brands-over-xinjiang-101616798740241.html
27-03-2021||World||Popular children's book author Beverly Cleary dies at 104||American children's book author Beverly Cleary, who responded to a young reader's plea for realistic characters by bringing rare insight and humor to the lives of Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins and the other children who populated her more than 40 books, has died at age 104, publisher HarperCollins said.Cleary died on Thursday at her home in Carmel, California, where she had lived since the 1960s, a statement from HarperCollins said. No cause of death was given.The author said she had aspirations of writing as a sixth grader, but first became a librarian. At a library in Yakima, Washington, a young boy provided the impetus for her writing career when he asked Cleary where he could find books about "kids like us."Cleary decided she wanted to write about ordinary "grubby kids," she told the Los Angeles Times, rather than the English schoolboys and girls who seemed to dominate the plots of children's literature at the time.That led to "Henry Huggins," her 1950 book about a boy growing up on Klickitat Street in Portland, Oregon, not far from the street where Cleary herself had lived. There would be six books about Henry and his dog, Ribsy, but he would be overshadowed by Ramona Quimby, who started as a supporting character in the Henry books and eventually was celebrated in her own series of eight books.Ramona was precocious, excitable and brimming with imagination in "Ramona the Pest," "Beezus and Ramona," "Ramona the Brave" and other books.Cleary's works did not offer heroic tales, lessons in life or grand adventures. Instead, they focused on kids' everyday lives, telling the story with enough humor to keep young readers engaged and ample understanding of how children see the world. She knew what made her readers happy, scared, angry and confused.Cleary told the New York Times she was fortunate to have strong memories of her own childhood to draw on and that she also used the experiences of her twins - a boy and a girl born in 1955 - for fodder."Beverly just beautifully captures the essence of childhood," best-selling children's writer Judy Blume told the Times. "We might not all have childhoods like that but there's still something so universal about it. I think kids will always love those books."Cleary's other works included "Ellen Tebbits," "Otis Spofford," "Lucky Chuck," "The Mouse and the Motorcycle" and two memoirs - "My Own Two Feet" and "A Girl From Yamhill." Her books sold more than 85 million copies worldwide, HarperCollins said."Her timeless books are an affirmation of her everlasting connection to the pleasures, challenges, and triumphs that are part of every childhood," said Suzanne Murphy, president and publisher of HarperCollins Children's Books.In 1995 the city of Portland created the Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children, with statues of Ramona, Henry and Ribsy. A school in the city also is named for Cleary.Cleary spent her early years on a farm in Yamhill, Oregon, before her family moved to Portland when she was 6. She was not much of a reader until she hit the third grade, she said.The Library of Congress declared Cleary a "living legend" and in 1984 she won the Newbery Medal, given annually for the most distinguished contribution to U.S. children's literature, for "Dear Mr. Henshaw," a novel about a boy who struggles with his parents' divorce as he corresponds with his favorite author.Cleary, who wrote her last book in 1999, met her future husband, Clarence Cleary, when she was a student at the University of California. He died in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/popular-children-s-book-author-beverly-cleary-dies-at-104-101616798735293.html

It will be open to the public through a webstream, the White House said.“By the time of the summit, the United States will announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target as its new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement,” the White House said. “In his invitation, the president urged leaders to use the summit as an opportunity to outline how their countries also will contribute to stronger climate ambition.”Biden’s April 22-23 summit is intended to accelerate global efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the use of fossil fuels. It helps fulfill a campaign pledge, after Biden put climate change at the center of his pitch to voters in 2020.One of his first actions after his inauguration was to re-enter the Paris Agreement on climate that his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, sought to abandon.Should Xi and Putin participate, it would be Biden’s first meeting as president with both leaders. He spoke to the Chinese and Russian heads of state on the phone in the weeks after he took office.The summit is seen as a key opportunity for Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry to illustrate the US commitment to fighting climate change after Trump’s withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-invites-to-virtual-climate-summit-include-putin-xi-101616790195795.html

27-03-2021||India||PM Modi wraps up Bangladesh visit, calls for greater bilateral cooperation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina on Saturday reviewed progress in development and connectivity initiatives even as the two countries signed five agreements in areas ranging from trade to disaster management.On the second and final day of his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, Modi held one-on-one talks with Hasina in Dhaka. This was followed by delegation-level talks that lasted more than an hour. The two leaders discussed progress in areas such as trade, connectivity, health, energy and developmental cooperation, according to external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.The two sides signed five memorandums of understanding (MoUs) covering disaster management and mitigation, establishment of a framework for cooperation in trade remedial measures, establishment of sports facilities at Rajshahi College, cooperation between Bangladesh National Cadet Corps and India’s National Cadet Corps, and the supply of ICT equipment, reference books and training for the Bangladesh-Bharat Digital Service and Employment Training Centre.“Had a productive meeting with PM Sheikh Hasina. We reviewed the full range of India-Bangladesh relations and discussed ways to deepen economic and cultural linkages in the times to come,” Modi tweeted. The new MoUs will add strength to the development partnership and benefit the people of the two sides, especially the youth, he said.Modi handed over a symbolic key to Hasina for 109 ambulances gifted by India, and also donated 1.2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as a grant.The two leaders virtually inaugurated several projects, including three border “haats” or markets and the extended development of Rabindra Bhawan at Shilaidaha Kuthibari, a country house in Kushtia where Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore spent a part of his life. They virtually laid the foundation stone for the development of infrastructure at the Rooppur nuclear power plant being jointly built by Russia and India.Also read: Foreign secretary gives overview of PM Modi, Sheikh Hasina meeting - 7 pointsHasina presented gold and silver coins released to mark the birth centenary of her father, “Bongobandhu” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, to Modi. The two leaders released postage stamps marking 50 years of diplomatic relations.Modi’s visit coincided with celebrations marking the birth centenary of Rahman and 50 years of Bangladesh’s liberation war. On Friday, Modi was the only foreign leader invited to attend celebrations marking the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s independence, and he called for greater bilateral cooperation to confront shared challenges such as terrorism and to boost trade and connectivity.Earlier on Saturday, Modi became the first foreign head of government to visit Bongobandhu’s mausoleum at Tungipara. He also visited two historic Hindu temples at Satkhira and Orakandi, a move with symbolic significance for elections in the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam, which share borders with Bangladesh.Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana took Modi around the mausoleum complex in Tungipara. He paid tribute at the grave of Bongobandhu and planted a “bakul” tree sapling to commemorate the historic event. Modi also signed the visitors’ book at the mausoleum and wrote that the life of Bongobandhu “epitomised the freedom struggle of the people of Bangladesh for their rights, for the preservation of their inclusive culture and their identity”.Modi began the day by performing puja at the centuries-old Jeshoreshwari Kali Shaktipeeth in Satkhira, a temple dedicated to Goddess Kali and one of 51 shaktipeeths of the Puranic tradition. He placed a handmade “mukut” of silver with gold plating, which was crafted by a local artisan in three weeks, on the idol.He also announced a grant for building a community hall-cum-cyclone shelter at the temple complex. This structure will be used during the temple’s annual Kali puja and mela and also serve as a storm shelter and community facility.At Orakandi, Modi sought blessings at the Hari Mandir and interacted with descendants of Harichand Thakur, a Hindu mystic and spiritual guru. He addressed members of the Matua community and said India and Bangladesh want to see the progress of the whole world through their development and progress. Both countries want stability, love and peace instead of instability, terror and unrest, and these were the same values preached by Harichand Thakur, he said.Modi said India is moving forward with the slogan of “Sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas”, and Bangladesh is a “shoho jatri” (fellow traveller) in these efforts. At the same time, Bangladesh is a strong example of development and change for the world and India is Bangladesh’s “shoho jatri” in these efforts, he said.Watch | What did PM Modi pray for at Bangladesh's Kaali temple? Watch his answerHe announced several initiatives, including upgrading the middle school for girls at Orakandi and the setting up of a primary school. He said steps will be taken to ease the travel of a large number of people who come from India to Orakandi every year to participate in “Baruni Snan” on the birth anniversary of Harichand Thakur.Orakandi is home to the Hindu Matua community, a large number of whom also live in West Bengal. Modi was accompanied by Shantanu Thakur, a BJP MP from West Bengal, for the visit to Orakandi, and observers said the trip had political significance against the backdrop of the elections in West Bengal.The Matua community’s vote is expected to determine the winners in some seats in the West Bengal assembly.“My visit to the Orakandi Thakurbari is an experience I will remember for life. This is a very sacred place, which is closely associated with the Matua community,” Modi tweeted.Modi has described Bangladesh as a key pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy, while Hasina has referred to India as a “true friend” and said both sides can play a significant role in global and regional value chains by further integrating their economies and boosting connectivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-wraps-up-bangladesh-visit-calls-for-greater-bilateral-cooperation-101616868159163.html

Agitating farmers have been opposing the programmes of the saffron party leaders in the state over the farm laws issue.When Abohar legislator Arun Narang reached Malout on Saturday along with local leaders to address a press conference, they were surrounded by a group of protesting farmers and black ink was thrown at them and at their vehicles, officials said.Some police personnel took the MLA and local leaders to a shop. But later when they came out of it, the protesters allegedly thrashed Narang and tore his clothes, police said.Policemen escorting Narang faced a tough time in protecting him from the protesters. The legislator was later escorted to a safe place by the police, officials said.Deputy Superintendent of Police (Malout) Jaspal Singh said the protesters were adamant that they would not allow the BJP legislators to hold the press conference.A video has surfaced on social media, purportedly showing the MLA in torn clothes being shifted to a safer place by the police.Later, Narang told PTI that he was "punched" by some people."I was punched a lot and my clothes were also torn off," he alleged.The BJP legislator said he had gone to Malout to address a press conference but the protesters did not allow it. They got violent and surrounded him, the MLA claimed.Asked whether he has lodged a complaint in this matter, Narang said he will talk to the party leadership over this issue.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh strongly condemned the alleged attack on Narang and also warned of strict action against anyone trying to disturb peace in the state.He urged the farmers not to indulge in such acts of violence, and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to urgently resolve the crisis triggered by the passage of farm laws in parliament last year to prevent the situation from escalating.The chief minister directed the police chief to take strict action against the perpetrators of the incident, who also clashed with the police personnel trying to rescue the legislator.Superintendent of Police (Headquarters), Faridkot, was injured while trying to save and evacuate the MLA. He suffered a cane blow on his head, causing his turban to fall off. He was admitted in Civil Hospital, Malout, the CM said in a statement.The DGP said a criminal case will be registered against the suspects and statements of local BJP leaders were being recorded.Amarinder Singh said while protesting is the democratic right of the farmers, violence of any sorts would not be tolerated.Reacting to the demand for his resignation by Punjab BJP leaders, he said instead of trying to take political mileage from Saturday's incident, they should put pressure on their central leadership to withdraw the contentious farm laws.Punjab Assembly Speaker Rana KP Singh also strongly condemned the alleged attack on Narang at Malout."It is not only unacceptable, but highly condemnable that an elected representative of the people was mercilessly thrashed in full public view," he said.Darshan Pal, the leader of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' union spearheading the agitation against the central agri laws, said, "Today, farmers protested against BJP MLA from Abohar. Under adverse circumstances, it turned violent and the MLA was physically assaulted."It is a matter of regret that an elected representative was treated this way. We do not encourage such behaviour. We strongly condemn this act," he said in a statement.Pal also said the Samyukta Kisan Morcha appeals to all protesters to remain peaceful and disciplined.The ruling Congress in Punjab, the BJP, as well as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) condemned the incident.Such "unlawful behaviour" has no place in a democracy and the farmers' protest will be weakened by these incidents, State Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the Amarinder Singh-led government over the incident and claimed that it has "exposed the complete collapse of law and order in the state".Describing the incident as a "murderous attack" on Narang, he accused the ruling Congress of engineering it. Amarinder Singh was "instigating such attacks in order to stifle the voice of the BJP", Chugh alleged and demanded that the chief minister resign.SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal termed the "violent attack" on Narang "deplorable" and demanded an impartial inquiry to fix the responsibility for the "failure" of the police in protecting the dignity of an elected representative.He appealed to everyone to exercise restraint to ensure that peace and communal harmony in the state was not disturbed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the farm laws.

27-03-2021||India||Foreign secretary gives overview of PM Modi, Sheikh Hasina meeting: 7 points||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina on Saturday, the last day of his two-day visit to the neighbouring country, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said both the leaders discussed ways to strengthen the 50-year-old diplomatic ties between their countries. India and Bangladesh signed five agreements in areas ranging from trade to disaster management, Shringla added.PM Modi was in Bangladesh to take part in the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of its independence.Here are 7 things Shringla said on PM Modi's visit to the neighbouring country:1. Sheikh Hasina lauded India’s neighbourhood first policy and PM Modi thanked her for erecting a war memorial in her country in recognition of contribution of the Indian soldiers killed during the liberation war of Bangladesh. Both leaders laid the foundation stone for the memorial, said Shringla.2. PM Modi and Hasina inaugurated the Bangladesh leg of the Bangbandhu-Bapu digital exhibition, which showcases a rare photo of the neighbouring country first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi. "We plan to take this exhibition to many countries and this idea was discussed in the last meeting of both PMs," Shringla said.3. It was decided that December 6, the day on which India formally recognised Bangladesh, will be celebrated as 'Maitri Diwas'.4. Both the countries are willing to expand cooperation in the space sector, the foreign secretary said.5. Shringla said it was decided that Indian companies will develop Bangladesh's Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant. "A significant part of our third line of credit will go to civil nuclear cooperation. Transmission lines of Bangladesh's Ruppur Nuclear Power Plant will be developed by Indian companies under the line of credit. Value of these transmission lines will be worth over $1 billion," he said.6. Commenting on the agreement Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (the BBIN group of countries) signed in 2015 for facilitating easy cargo movement across their borders, he said, "There is a very active collaboration and cooperation among India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. We spoke about the Motor Vehicle Agreement. It is in a fairly advanced stage. We want to take it further. We are facilitating Bangladesi exports to both these countries via India," he said.7. The Teesta water-sharing issue was also discussed during the leaders' meeting.

27-03-2021||India||Registration for Amarnath Yatra to start from April 1: Official||Registration for the upcoming annual pilgrimage to the Himalayan cave shrine of Amarnath in south Kashmir is going to start from April 1, an official said on Saturday.The 56-day yatra to the 3,880-metre-high shrine is scheduled to start from the twin routes of Pahalgam and Baltal on June 28 and culminate on August 22.In a meeting earlier this month, officials had said that all Covid-19 protocols are in place and standard operating procedures issued by the government will be followed."The registration will start from April 1 for both the routes through 446 designated bank branches of the Punjab National Bank (316), the Jammu and Kashmir Bank (90) and the YES Bank (40), all over the country," Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Sri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) Nitishwar Kumar said.He said that details about the procedure for registration, application form and state-wise list of bank branches with complete addresses are available on the board's website.The CEO said that only health certificates that are issued by doctors or medical institutes authorised by state governments or union territory administrations will be accepted at the registered bank branches.The certificates are mandatory as the shrine is at a very high-altitude and the journey is arduous."For the Yatra-2021, only those health certificates which have been issued after March 15 shall be valid. The steps which yatris (pilgrims) need to follow in order to register for the yatra (pilgrimage), have been put on the board's website www.shriamarnathjishrine.com," Kumar said.He added that it also contains relevant information on how to reach the base camps, fee for registration, tariff for ponies, palanquin and porters.Kumar said people under the age of 13 years or above the age of 75 years and women who are more than six weeks pregnant would not be registered for this year's yatra as per COVID-19 norms.He said permits for the yatra would be different for each day of the week and routes.Different colour code for each day will be used to facilitate police personnel deployed at the access control gates at Baltal in Ganderbal district and Chandanwari-Pahalgam in Anantnag district to regulate the yatra for the relevant date and route, the CEO said.In this context, he cautioned pilgrims against undertaking this arduous yatra without securing a permit and the required compulsory health certificate.Kumar stressed that, for ensuring effective security arrangements along the difficult tracks, only those yatris who are in possession of a permit which is valid for a specified date and route, will be allowed to proceed beyond the base camps, and cross the entry gates.He appealed to pilgrims to complete necessary formalities for registration in advance and obtain a permit so that they do not face any inconvenience.Pilgrims who propose to travel by helicopter do not require advance registration as their tickets will suffice for this purpose, Kumar said.However, Kumar said they would be required to produce the compulsory health certificate issued by an authorised doctor in the prescribed format before they are allowed to travel by helicopter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/registration-for-amarnath-yatra-to-start-from-april-1-official-101616856029995.html

The e-filing and data which can be contained is going to take away the need for many storage rooms and many rooms which are necessary for storing papers. The SC has done its bit on issues of court infrastructure. It has devised benchmarks and frameworks for minimum standards," he said in his speech.The CJI said that the discussion on infrastructure has largely been on the quantitative part, that is on building more courtrooms."Though building more courtrooms is necessary and important, there was very little emphasis on modernising the existing courtrooms. Though the pandemic has posed a lot of problems to access to justice, it has paved the way for modernising the courtroom," he said.The CJI also stressed the need to have a new building for the Bombay High Court in Mumbai."Bombay (High Court) also needs a new building.

Electoral malpractices, horse trading of elected MLAs, and when failing in both, it resorts to passing such a dictatorial bill on the strength of its majority in Parliament. This is how the Modi govt rules,” Gehlot said in a series of tweets.He said the BJP could abolish the powers of any government by bringing such laws if it loses elections in a state.“This dictatorial decision of the Modi govt should be opposed at the national level by rising above the party line,” he said.Accusing the BJP of doing a volte-face, the chief minister said the party had earlier advocated full statehood status to Delhi.“But now they have brought such law. Prime Minister advocates cooperative federalism but in reality, NDA govt is imposing decisions on state governments by enacting such laws,” he added.Speaking at a virtual programme of the state medical education department at his residence, Gehlot said those criticising the government are often branded as “anti-nationals”.“It is a matter of grave concern for us. Look at the chief election commission, income tax department, ED or the CBI. The agencies are being misused. The country has a challenge and we will have to make people understand,” he said.PTI SDA SRY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-calls-gnctd-bill-murder-of-democracy-move-to-target-aap-101616840760924.html

This has prompted the civic body to announce closure of shops on weekends except for those selling essential goods. Hotels and restaurants also have to stick to parcel services during the weekends. In the last two weekends, shops were allowed to remain open on an odd even basis.The latest closure order has infuriated the shopkeepers and traders. “We understand the growing number of cases is a concern for the civic authorities. However we have already faced losses during the lockdown. Weekends are the time when we get to earn. If we remain shut we will face a difficult situation in paying salaries for staff, rent, bills and taxes,” said Ratan Singh, member of shopkeepers association in Dombivli.Meanwhile, the KDMC is planning stricter action if Covid-19 cases do not reduce. “We had given restricted timings for shops but many did not follow forcing us to fine them. These are reasons the numbers are increasing and we have to announce stricter curbs,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopkeepers-in-klayan-protest-after-weekend-closure-orders-as-covid-cases-rise-101616840980739.html

The trials of this second vaccine, Covovax, made by Serum and US vaccine development company Novavax have already begun in India this week.Covovax has been tested against the African and the UK variants of Covid-19 and has an overall efficacy of 89%, Poonawalla tweeted.Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by the number of doses it produces, is supplying its first vaccine Covishield, developed in collaboration with Oxford University and Astrazeneca, to India and several other countries. With the vaccination drive going on at full throttle amid no threat of scarcity of vaccines in India, the company is moving to its second vaccine project. The trials have commenced at a Pune hospital on Thursday. 'Supplied more vaccines globally than vaccinated our own people': India tells UNDelhi's Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research will also be a part of the trial, which will take place at 19 sites across the country, covering 1,140 participants.What might keep Covovax ahead in building adequate immunity against Covid-19 is the factor that it has been tested against the variant strains of the virus.According to reports, in the phase 3 trial conducted in the UK, Covovax showed an efficacy of 96 per cent against the original strain. But against the UK variant, its efficacy percentage is 86.3 while in a phase two trial conducted in South Africa, its overall efficacy dropped to 48.6 per cent.In January, Adar Poonawalla's company sought permission from the Drugs Controller General of India to start clinical trials of the second vaccine.India has so far administered 5.8 crore vaccine doses, which include both Covishield and Covaxin. From April 1, anyone above the age of 45 years will be considered eligible for vaccines. The Centre has said both the vaccines are safe after many European countries suspended the administration of the Oxford vaccine citing risks of blood clotting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-s-adar-poonawalla-hopes-to-launch-2nd-covid-vaccine-by-september-101616833097368.html

The firefighting system, including sprinklers, was not functioning.Patients died due to suffocation, the police said. Six of those killed were on ventilators.A notice for non-compliance with fire safety norms was issued to the mall in November 2020, an official said.“It is not a case of negligence. There were serious lapses in terms of safety compliance. The biggest lapse is that the mall did not have fire permission. They have also violated the terms and conditions on the basis of which the BMC had given them a part NOC (no objection certificate). That is why we have booked the owners of the mall, hospital management, and the administrator, on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and are further investigating the case,” said deputy police commissioner Prashant Kadam, who is supervising the investigation.The hospital was functioning on temporary permission due to end on March 31.There were 78 patients admitted to the hospital at the time of the incident.“The hospital had obtained permission to run a nursing home on October 1, 2020. Since January 2021, the facility has been functioning as a Covid centre. The hospital is owned by Nikita Trehan and one George Putting Shery is the chief executive officer of the hospital,” a police officer said.Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang are in jail in connection with the ₹6,670 crore Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scam.Earlier, Sunrise Hospital authorities said they responded responsibly and called for an investigation to determine how the fire spread.“There was no casualty due to fire. All patients were promptly shifted to Jumbo Covid centre (and some to other private hospitals). The patients were shifted alive, but there were few patients on ventilators and extremely critical. We believe that the casualties have not occurred due to fire, but either in transit or at other hospitals. The hospital was started in exceptional circumstances of Covid last year, and was functioning with all due compliances,” the hospital said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-cops-book-owners-of-dreams-mall-sunrise-hospital-for-culpable-homicide-101616832576438.html

But now as the week ends, the situation in several other states worsens as Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have now surpassed Kerala, the state which was considered as one of the hotspots of the infection, and the one which reported the first Covid-19 case in the country in January 2020.According to the Union health ministry's Saturday data, Kerala is not even among the top six states contributing the highest number of new infections. Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh are the six states responsible for 80 per cent of the new infections. In the last 24 hours, 62,258 new infections have been reported, and all these six states have contributed over 2,000 cases each, while Maharashtra's daily caseload on Friday was 36,902.Kerala on Friday recorded a dip and recorded 1,825 new infections.The situation turned around for Kerala in the last two days. According to the ministry's Thursday (March 26) and Friday (March 26) data, Kerala was still one of the top contributors. But with 2,091 fresh cases recorded in the last 24 hours, Madhya Pradesh emerged as a new hotspot.Here is the list of six states which reported the highest number of new infections in the last 24 hours and the restrictions they have imposed.MaharashtraIn the last 24 hours, Maharashtra recorded 36,902 new infections, a record that was not reached last year since the beginning of the pandemic. While several districts have already imposed restrictions, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday instructed all districts to impose a night curfew between 8pm and 7am starting from March 28.

27-03-2021||India||Former Bihar police officer held for liquor smuggling||Sacked sub-inspector Awani Bhushan was among five people arrested from Bihar’s Katra on Friday night while allegedly striking a deal with liquor mafias.Bushan was sacked from the police department in 2019 after he was found to have ties with liquor mafias. He was earlier arrested in 2017.Deputy police superintendent Manoj Pandey said Bhushan was arrested after they were tipped off about a meeting of smugglers and production of India made foreign liquor (IMFL). “A team raided a house belonging to one of the liquor smugglers, Anil Pandey. It arrested the five including Bhushan and Anil Pandey. Some of their associates managed to dodge the team,” he said. He added raids were on to arrest the rest of them.Manoj Pandey said Bhushan allegedly used his clout to smuggle IMFL with the help of some of his batch mates. “We have maintained a close watch on them.” He added Bhushan has told them IMFL smugglers have changed their strategies in communicating with each other. “They are now using platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook...instead of traditional voice calling... communication through social media is encrypted and cannot be traced easily.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bihar-police-officer-held-for-liquor-smuggling-101616827296767.html
27-03-2021||India||Quad top security officials meet on cards to deepen defence cooperation||The four-nation Quad grouping may add a new layer of interactions at the level of top security officials to coordinate their posture and specific roles in the Indo-Pacific, a senior government official said on plans to scale up cooperation among its members.Leaders of the United States, India, Japan and Australia held their first summit-level meeting earlier this month, signalling that the four countries would continue efforts to build their four-way alliance that is often seen as an emerging bulwark against China. The March 12 summit reviewed common challenges across the Indo-Pacific - especially China’s assertive actions - but didn’t get into the details of these threats since the meeting was being held online.The challenges posed by China will be taken up by the four leaders when they hold their in-person meeting on the sidelines of the G-7 summit in the United Kingdom or at the invitation of US President Joe Biden later. An in-person meeting of the Quad foreign ministers is also expected this year.People familiar with discussions among the four countries said there were suggestions for a Quad dialogue among their top security officials who could decide on the road map for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. This could be the umbrella group at the official level to share information and decide on the response to common challenges.So far, the four countries have mostly focused on quadrilateral dialogue led by their top diplomats and foreign ministers. News reports from Japan also indicate that the next step is going to be multi-layered cooperation among the Quad partners.“It is inevitable,” a government official said. Already, the navies of Quad plus France are exercising under the “La Perouse” banner in the Bay of Bengal from April 4 to 7 with the Indian Navy sending an attack submarine and a destroyer for the war games.Although some strategic experts underline that the Quad partners differ in their perception of threats from China and have different policies to deal with Beijing, the evolving Quad architecture is not only aimed at China and provides a democratic alternative to ASEAN, Gulf and African countries in the Indo-Pacific. Already, France and the UK have shown keen interest in the Indo-Pacific and have expressed interest in tying up with India and Australia.The 2021 East Asia Review by the Japanese defence ministry’s strategic think tank, National Institute for Defense Studies, notes that all the four countries view the Quad grouping as a hedge to prepare for an uncertain future as US-China tensions rise and Beijing takes increasingly aggressive action in the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula.With China tightening control over Hong Kong, eyeing Taiwan and threatening both Japan and the US over Senkaku Islands, India has decided to work closely with other countries at bilateral and multilateral levels as the next focus of China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy is the Indian Ocean where it is expected to deploy its warship deployments as early as 2023. Besides, India also has a land boundary dispute with China that Beijing does not appear inclined to settle and prefers to use it as a lever to unsettle and pressurise India.Discussions on steps to ensure a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region are also expected to top the agenda when the Defence Policy Group of the two countries meet next. “The decision is still to be taken but scheduling a DPG at the defence secretary official level is being considered,” said a senior government official about the bilateral mechanism that was revived in 2019 after a four-year gap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-top-security-officials-meet-on-cards-to-deepen-defence-cooperation-101616826756827.html

The police had roped in a film studio to execute their operation.Police procured fake currencies used in movies from a studio to “purchase” 500 kg of marijuana. Stating they were initially anxious, an officer, who took part in the operation, said although the studio currencies in ₹2,000 denominations looked real, they all had the same serial number.Elaborating on the operation, Bengaluru Police Commissioner Kamal Pant told HT that officers of the Whitefield division were asked to conduct a detailed investigation as the drug supply in the area was high. “Our officers identified some peddlers, but they wanted to get to the source. So, they convinced some peddlers to introduce some undercover cops to the suppliers,” said Pant.Soon, a peddler introduced cops disguised as peddlers who could be potential “big customers”. In the first meeting, the suppliers asked the cops about the quantity of marijuana they wanted to buy. “Since our officers wanted to seize as much contraband as possible, they asked them how much they can provide. They also told them that money was not a problem, and they were ready to buy even one tonne of drugs. But the suppliers asked to show the money before going ahead with the purchase,” Pant added.The undercover cops promised to show the cash in the next meeting. Since the police department could not spare ₹1 crore and there were security concerns, they came up with a plan to approach a film studio. “We approached a film studio in Bengaluru and asked them to provide fake currency worth ₹1 crore. The currency notes looked real, but they didn’t have the legal requirements of a real note,” said an officer part of the operation.A dark brown suitcase filled with fake currency was then taken to the second meeting with the suppliers. “One of our biggest concerns was whether the suppliers would take a closer look at the notes as they all had the same serial number. But the meeting went smoothly, and they agreed to bring 500 kg of ganja (marijuana),” said the officer.Following the meetings, on Thursday, the consignment arrived in a truck in the city. A meeting was arranged on Friday morning in KR Puram in Bengaluru to hand over the drugs. “How they transported the drugs also was a revelation for us. They had created a secret compartment behind the driver’s seat and the rest of the truck was filled with other goods,” said Pant.The police convinced the suppliers to ensure that the transaction took place in a closed environment and asked the suppliers to come to a warehouse in KR Puram. Once they arrived and showed the hidden stash, police took the men and material into custody.Police arrested three men, identified as Dayal Ram, 38, Poona Ram, 24, and Budha Ram, 23 -- all residents of Rajasthan. The commissioner added that they are on the lookout for other associates of these men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-police-buy-rs-500-kgs-of-drugs-using-fake-currency-from-film-studio-101616825437102.html

PM Modi, who is on a two-day visit to the neighbouring country, was seen wearing a mark as he was welcomed in the temple, which was renovated on the occasion of PM Modi's visit. He also offered a hand-made, gold-plated silver crown to the goddess.Watch: PM Modi prays at Bangladesh temples, visits Bangabandhu mausoleumIshwaripur village in Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira border West Bengal. PM said during fairs, many people visit the temple from across the border too. That's why a community centre is needed, which can double as a shelter home during an emergency, like a cyclone. "A number of devotees come here during Kaali Puja. So a multi-purpose community hall is needed here, which can become a shelter house during any disaster, especially cyclone. The Indian government will construct a community hall here. I express my gratitude to the Bangladesh government that it has also wished us well for this work," PM Modi said.He said he prayed for a coronavirus-free world as India believes that the world is a family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam)."Ahead of Chaitra Navratri, I got the opportunity to visit one of the 51 shakipeeths. When I came to Bangladesh in 2015, I offered my prayers to Maa Dhakeshwari. Today, I was fortunate enough to bow my head before Maa Kali," PM Modi said, adding that he wished to visit all the shaktipeeths if he gets the chance. According to Hindu mythology, the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple is one of the 51 Shakti Peeths — the 51 sacred sites where goddess Sati's 51 body parts were believed to have fallen. The shaktipeeths are spread across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka.On Saturday, PM Modi is also scheduled to visit Gopalganj's Orakandi temple."I am particularly looking forward to my interaction with representatives of the Matua community at Orakandi, from where Sri Sri Harichandra Thakur ji disseminated his pious message," Prime Minister Modi had said in a statement on Thursday.Then, he will also visit the 'Mausoleum of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman' in Tungipara of Gopalganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wish-to-visit-all-51-shaktipeeths-pm-modi-at-bangladesh-s-jeshoreshwari-kali-temple-101616822278229.html
27-03-2021||India||Odisha bans congregations amid a surge in Covid-19 cases||Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Odisha government on Friday banned congregations including for the celebration of upcoming festivals like Good Friday, Easter, Pana Sankranti, Jhamu Jatra, Danda Jatra and Ram Navami.“Religious rituals in churches, temples, places of worship will continue as usual with a limited number of persons with strict adherence to Covid protocols,” said a government notification.The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) has separately made it mandatory for travellers from states with higher Covid-19 cases to undergo mandatory testing or produce Covid-19 negative reports. The state health department has also cautioned against the possible congregation of lawyers during elections to Bar associations on Saturday. Additional chief secretary Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra has written to all the district collectors, police chiefs and municipal commissioners and asked them to enforce the Covid-19 norms and prevent congregations during campaign and polls. The health department is also all set to roll out a plan of vaccinating a minimum of 10 million people, or around 25% of the total population. The state would also vaccinate all utility service providers.Mohapatra said over two million vaccinations have been carried out till Thursday. He added they plan to vaccinate 15,00,00 people daily. He added Odisha has informed the Centre that the “insufficient and erratic” supply of the Covid-19 vaccines was hampering the vaccination programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bans-congregations-amid-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101616822616408.html
27-03-2021||India||'Supplied more vaccines globally than vaccinated our own people': India tells UN||India has supplied more Covid-19 vaccines globally than vaccinated its own people, the country has told the UN General Assembly and cautioned that vaccine inequity will defeat the collective global resolve to contain the coronavirus as the disparity in the accessibility of vaccines will affect the poorest nations the most.India was one of the initiators of the ‘Political Declaration on Equitable Global Access to COVID-19 Vaccines’ that garnered the support of more than 180 UN member states.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here India’s deputy rermanent representative to the UN Ambassador K. Nagaraj Naidu said at the General Assembly informal meeting on Friday that while the Covid-19 pandemic continues to persist, the year 2021 began on a positive note with the global scientific community coming up with multiple vaccines to contain the pandemic.“While the vaccine challenge has been resolved, we are now confronted with ensuring the availability, accessibility, affordability, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Lack of global cooperation and disparity in the accessibility of vaccines will affect the poorest nations the most,” Naidu said.India has been at the forefront of the global fight against Covid-19. Naidu told the General Assembly that India will not only be vaccinating 300 million of its own frontline workers over the next six months but in the process has also supplied vaccines to over 70 nations."In fact, as of today we have supplied more vaccines globally than have vaccinated our own people,” Naidu said.Two of India’s vaccines, including the indigenously developed Covaxin, have already been granted emergency authorization, Naidu said, adding that 30 more vaccine candidates are at various phases of clinical trials.The vaccine Covishield is the version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenously developed vaccine by pharma company Bharat Biotech.The Political Declaration states that equitable and affordable access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines must be ensured to have a speedy recovery and contribute to putting an end to the pandemic.The declaration also expresses deep concern that despite international agreements and initiatives, the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines is still uneven worldwide, both among and within countries.“Therefore, we express our deep concern that a considerable number of countries have not yet had access to COVID-19 vaccines, and stress the need for global solidarity and multilateral cooperation to increase vaccine production and distribution, on regional and global levels.”Naidu said that as highlighted by the declaration equity in access to the vaccine is important for mitigating the impact of the pandemic.“Vaccine inequity will defeat our collective resolve to contain the virus. The current disparity calls for solidarity and cooperation within the international frameworks such as COVAX,” he said.India, a significant source of supply to Gavi’s COVAX facility, has contributed 20 million doses to the facility last month. India had also announced a gift of 200,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses for UN peacekeepers.The shipment of vaccines for peacekeepers left Mumbai in the early hours of Saturday and will land in Denmark soon, Naidu said.India also underlined the need to collaborate on genomic surveillance to track virus mutations and variants and exchange information in a timely fashion.“Vaccine hesitancy should also be countered with science and public health infrastructure and capacities of health workers in vaccine delivery needs to be strengthened globally,” he said.Naidu highlighted the need for the international community to collectively work towards supporting initiatives that ensure speedy and equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the most disadvantaged populations.“Affordability, access, and logistical issues should in no way become a hindrance in our fight against one of the biggest challenges facing humanity,” he said.Naidu added that India is working actively with GAVI, the World Health Organisation and ACT Accelerator.“India and South-Africa have also called for WTO (World Trade Organisation) to suspend intellectual property rights related to COVID-19 for a limited period of time, to ensure rapid scaling-up of manufacturing of vaccines and ensuring accessibility and affordability of vaccines for all,” he said.He also stressed the importance of ensuring that ongoing global immunisation programmes pertaining to polio, diphtheria and other diseases do not get impacted as that will lead to the resurgence of other deadly diseases.World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for countries to work together so that all States could begin vaccinating within the first 100 days of 2021. He said 177 countries and economies have started vaccination and added that with just 15 days left before the 100 days are up, 36 countries are still waiting for vaccines so they can start inoculating health workers and older people.President of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said at the meeting that the world, which went into the Covid-19 pandemic together, can emerge from it together as well.“But that depends on fair and equitable access to vaccines. From the health worker in a small island developing state, to a teacher in a refugee camp, to the elderly in care facilities across our countries, we must all be covered,” Bozkir said.He stressed that the most vulnerable groups – people on the move, in conflict zones, and those already marginalised – must be prioritised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supplied-more-vaccines-globally-than-vaccinated-our-own-people-india-tells-un-101616820647628.html
27-03-2021||India||Across borders, the turbulent journey of South Asia’s Matua community||A small hamlet in Bangladesh’s Gopalganj district is an unlikely destination for a sitting Indian Prime Minister. But the town of Orakandi is not just the birthplace of 19th century anti-caste reformist Harichand Thakur; it is the nerve centre of the nearly 10 million Matuas in the Muslim-majority nation, and roughly 35 million in India.The Orakandi thakurbari is maintained by the Bangladesh Matua Mahasangha. Its counterpart in India is housed in Thakurnagar in the North 24 parganas district of West Bengal – the twin bodies mirroring the pangs of Partition that devastated the anti-caste sect and forced millions of followers to flee to India over two decades.“After Partition, we faced many ignominies. Our ashrams were taken our and hostels closed. For almost 20 years, the movement went underground because of fundamentalists, and could revive itself only by 1970s,” said Sagar Sadhu Thakur, the secretary general of the Mahasangha.The visit comes in the backdrop of the West Bengal assembly elections where the Matuas – most of whose members hail from the scheduled caste Namashudra community – control the fate of around 30 seats. But it is also a big moment for the Bangladesh Mahasangha, which now has expanded to 50 of the country’s districts, and are one of the largest minority communities in Bangladesh.“We are grateful and happy that the Indian prime minister has accorded us the respect of a visit. We hope that he will accord the same support to our Indian brethren,” said Sagar Thakur. Subrata Thakur, the president of the body, said the organisation had put a fresh coat of paint on the temple and welcomed the PM.Born in a peasant family in 1812, Harichand Thakur quickly gained a following in erstwhile-undivided Bengal among the lower-castes as he formed edicts for salvation of the community.His couplets in Bengali stressed on education and strong organisation as the primary modes of community empowerment. Every second couplet spoke about the importance of brotherhood and ending discrimination – similar to the teachings of other anti-caste icons such as Dr BR Ambedkar a century later. Key to the Matua sect’s working are his 12 edicts, primary among which is an order to abstain from discriminating against anyone, even animals.“Harichand Thakur’s main aim was to unite the untouchables and the oppressed for a common cause of collective thought, and that is where the key to the liberation of spirituality lies. He wanted to establish a classless, casteless society,” said Biplab Biswas and Bipul Mandal, researchers from north Bengal. The sect has its own rituals, worshipped the Thakurs, and built a spiritual life that revolved around the 12 teachings.Harichand’s son, Guruchand Thakur, consolidated the organisation, built groups of disciples who spread the message of anti-discrimination in villages, and established the first school for the Namashudra community in 1881 with the help of Australian clergyman CS Mead. He also lobbied the British government to provide quotas for the Namashudra community.These gains were undone by Partition and the death of Guruchand in 1937. With communalism rising and unprecedented rioting across Bengal, the Matuas were split. One section, led by Guruchand’s grandson PR Thakur, aligned with the Congress party, moved to India and established Thakurnagar.The other was led by Jogendranath Mandal, a key ally of Ambedkar and among the first alumni of the Namashudra school. Mandal saw that a majority of Matuas were in erstwhile east Pakistan and urged Dalit-Muslim to unite — people both faiths were peasants in the region — against the upper-caste elite. He became Pakistan’s first law minister, but a spate of riots against Matuas and other religious minorities in 1950 forced him to resign. He died in exile in India in 1968.This was a period of intense difficulty for the Matuas. “Islamic nationalism gained in strength after the death of Jinnah and there was concerted pressure on Dalit peasants to migrate. The Indian government, too, didn’t treat them well,” said Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, professor of history at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.In Bangladesh, too, the movement went underground as its buildings were looted and taken over, including their most important ashram in Khulna.In 1972, Himangshupati Thakur, a descendant of Harichand Thakur, started to revive the movement. Nine years later, the sect organised their mahasammelan, or mega congregation. Today, the body organizes four major celebrations across the country that is attended by millions of people. But problems with fundamentalism remain. “Our buildings were burnt down. We have still not been able to get back possession of many spots, despite legal proceedings,” said Sagar Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/across-borders-the-turbulent-journey-of-south-asia-s-matua-community-101616821296516.html

27-03-2021||India||Massive blaze guts 500 shops in Pune, fireman dies in road accident||Over 500 shops were completely gutted after a major fire broke out at the famous Fashion Street market in the Camp area of Pune late on Friday night, officials said.While there was no casualty in the blaze, the head of Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) fire department was killed in a road accident while returning home after dousing the fire.Prakash Hasabe died after his two wheeler came under the wheels of a bus on Saturday morning around 6.30 am. He was on his way home to Viman Nagar after finishing the fire fighting work at Fashion Street which was completely gutted.PCB CEO Amit Kumar said “He called me around 2 am and briefed me that the fire was under control. He left the spot very late towards Viman Nagar.After that there was no information. His son became anxious and called saying that Hasabe did not return. He then received a call from some people who told him that his father had an accident and they were taking him to Sahyadri hospital . It’s a tragic incident which took place early morning.”Fashion Street adjacent to MG Road is a famous destination that houses small outlets selling garments, shoes, goggles and other accessories. Local traders said there were 448 registered shops and over 200 unauthorised outlets located in the market.It took the fire brigade six hours and 45 fire engines to douse the blaze completely. The cause of the fire was being ascertained, officials said.Even though the market was shut when the blaze started, the fire brigade had a tough time negotiating the narrow lanes, which were encroached and had vehicles haphazardly parked. Precious time was lost in all this, said officials.Fire brigade chief Prashant Ranpise said, “The reason behind the fire could not be ascertained. A large crowd at spot and water shortage also led to delay in fighting the blaze. The fire raged as there was a huge stock of clothes and footwear. “The fire department received a call at 11 pm and rushed a few fire engines to the spot. But as the fire spread rapidly as the small shops were stacked with clothes, more fire engines had to be sent.According to Pune Cantonment Board, a report was submitted in 2018 highlighting the “risk” of similar incidents and possible difficulty to deal with it at Fashion Street due to congested nature of the area.The joint fire audit report submitted by the Chief Fire Officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Fire Brigade Superintendent of PCB was discussed at the special board meeting held in 2018 under the chairmanship of the then PCB President Brigadier Rajiv Sethi. The audit report says the market does not have sufficient exit points in case there is a fire and people have to be evacuated.“It is a very serious matter in respect to the Fashion Street report submitted by the fire department of PMC. Fashion Street has become a risky place for fire incidents. We will be collecting information about owners of all the stalls and take action against any illegal stalls,” Brigadier Rajiv Sethi had stated on record.In 1997, unauthorised vendors were evicted from MG Road and the administration provided these hawkers stalls of five feet by four feet in Fashion Street. A total of 565 shops came under the agreement.The report pointed out that many shopkeepers used plastic curtains as partitions which are hazardous in the event of a fire and the narrow streets inside make it difficult to move. There are stalls outside the market serving as cafeterias or hotels and use fuels like LPG and kerosene, the report stated.During a verification drive, the revenue staff of PCB found out that the place is not safe in the event of a fire. It was also pointed out that it would be difficult for a fire engine or ambulance to reach due to narrow and congested streets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-blaze-guts-500-shops-in-pune-fireman-dies-in-road-accident-101616819916621.html

In his police complaint, the man’s father said his son was returning from a temple when four men tortured him. Police superintendent Anand Sharma said the attackers abducted the man, took him to a secluded place, tied his hands and feet, and thrashed him with batons. “The accused allegedly forced the victim to drink urine. After this, the accused robbed him of ₹5,000, mobile phone, silver chains, and other valuables,” Sharma said.Police said the attackers threatened to kill him if he reported the incident before abandoning him outside his house. The man was later hospitalised.Sharma cited preliminary investigation and added it suggests the man’s relationship with the woman was the reason for the assault. “Unhappy over the relationship, the accused decided to teach the victim a lesson.” He added they have arrested an accused and were looking for the rest. He added the woman’s family has also registered a rape case against the man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barmer-man-thrashed-forced-to-drink-urine-for-relationship-with-woman-101616816856159.html

27-03-2021||India||Maharashtra adds over 1.8 lakh new Covid cases in 6 days, night curfew from tomorrow | 10 points||In the last six days, Maharashtra, the state worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, added over 1.8 lakh fresh infections to the caseload of the state, while 608 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 from all across the state. This week has been significant in Maharashtra's battle against the pandemic as a year after it started, the state recorded the highest-ever daily spike, necessitating statewide night curfew which will be imposed from March 28.Here are 10 developments of the Maharashtra Covid-19 situation that took place between March 21 and March 26> On March 24, the state reported a record high in the number of cases with 31,855 fresh infections. The new record was then left behind and in the next two days, the state reported new highs.> In the last six days, Mumbai reported 26,765 new infections and 57 deaths. For Mumbai too, this week was the most crucial as after a year of its continuous battle against the pandemic, it reported a record high of 5,190 daily cases on March 24.> Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has instructed district administrations to impose night curfew from 8pm to 7am across the state. This makes Maharashtra as the first state to announce any state-wide restriction a year after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, 2020. Several districts of the state were under restrictions. Other states too have imposed district-specific restrictions.> At present, Maharashtra has 2,82,451 active Covid-19 cases.> Nine out of 10 districts with the highest number of active cases in the country are in Maharashtra. Pune has the highest number of active cases — 50,240, according to Union health ministry data on Friday.> Almost all districts in the last six days reported their highest single-day addition.

Nagpur, which is under lockdown, reported its highest single-day spike of 4,095 cases on Friday.> No celebrations on the occasion of Holi, Good Friday, Easter is allowed in the state.> Nagpur, Nanded, Beed, Parbhani districts are already under lockdown. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar warned on Friday that if the Covid-19 situation in Pune remains the same, then lockdown is possible. On Friday, the district of Pune reported 7,090 Covid-19 cases. Out of these, Pune city accounted for 3,594 cases.> The Union health ministry has said the situation in Maharashtra is of grave concern. The state has also reported a double mutant strain of the virus in Nagpur, but this has not been correlated with the spike. Availability of a pool of susceptible population, meaning a large number of people who lowered their guard in the past few months in the state, is being seen as the reason behind the spike.> The government is ramping up the vaccination and testing numbers as imposing lockdown is not a solution.

27-03-2021||India||In Mumbai, an explosive scare, a murder, and now – a political crisis||Why did suspended police officer Sachin Vaze place 20 loose gelatin sticks in a duffle bag with a Mumbai Indian logo, inside a green-coloured Scorpio and park it outside Antilia, home to one of the richest Indians, on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai?According to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which took over the probe on March 9 after the Union home ministry took suo moto cognizance of the explosives case, Vaze did this to regain his lost glory. A top NIA official told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity that Vaze, who was at the time of the discovery heading the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Crime Branch, “wanted to prove to Mumbai Police brass that he is still as good, by solving a bomb conspiracy.”The official said that Vaze planned the whole episode to plant explosives outside Antilia. “He wanted the limelight again,” he said.Vaze has a chequered history, no doubt. He was arrested and suspended in 2004, in connection with the alleged custodial killing of a terror suspect named Khwaja Yunus. In 2007, he left the force, and joined the Shiv Sena shortly afterwards. In the meantime, he started dealerships in partnership and security services. Vaze was only reinstated in 2020, after an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party, and the Congress (the MVA or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) came to power. And he tripped up, NIA officials contended, because of his overconfidence.Vaze was the lead investigator in the explosives case when it first came to light. It was later transferred to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS), before the NIA took over.Vaze however has refuted this theory and maintains his innocence. On March 25, Vaze told the special NIA court which was hearing a plea to extend his custody, “I was Investigating Officer for one and a half days and I did what was required to investigate the case. Not only I but all Crime Branch and Mumbai police officers did so.”“But suddenly something changed and when I went to NIA on March 13, I was put under the arrest by NIA officials,” he said.The previous day, the central agency invoked sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law, against the suspended cop. NIA used sections 16 and 18 of the anti-terror law claiming that an individual/or group of persons planning such a conspiracy can be booked under terror charges. The two sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act.The court granted custody to NIA, but for 15 days instead of 30 as permitted under the UAPA.Which brings us back to the question posed at the beginning: why did Vaze plant the explosives, as the NIA contends? That’s one part of this saga, and much of it depends on what the NIA investigation and the ensuing court case will no doubt reveal.But there are two more parts to this story which are inextricably linked to the green-coloured Scorpio that turned up outside Antilia, on Carmichael Road on February 25. It involves the likely murder of an auto parts dealer, and a fast-developing political crisis that the coalition government at the helm in Maharashtra finds itself in.To use a popular millennial phrase, that escalated quickly.First, the murder… A Thane-based auto parts dealer named Mansukh Hiran who had been driving the Scorpio for three years, having taken it from its owner, a certain Peter Newton in lieu of a defaulted payment, turned up dead 10 days after the his body washed up ashore a creek in Mumbra; it turned out that Vaze not only knew Hiran well, he had also borrowed the car from him for four months, and returned it on February 5. On February 17, at around 6.30pm, Hiran took the vehicle heading towards south Mumbai, the statement read. However, its steering was not smooth which prompted Hiran to park the car on the side of the road, and continue his journey in a taxi.At around 8.25pm, at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSTM), close to the CIU office, Hiran met Vaze. A CCTV grab from the area showed Hiran sit in Vaze’s car – a black Mercedes – and get out of it after 10 minutes. NIA officials believe that Hiran handed over the keys of the Scorpio to Vaze during this time.The following day, Hiran filed a stolen car report in Vikhroli. His wife told the ATS, that Hiran had taken a mechanic on February 18 to bring the vehicle back to his shop. However, finding the car “stolen”, he lodged a complaint with Vikhroli police station.NIA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after interrogating Vaze — it began on March 13 itself, when NIA officials in Mumbai called him in for questioning in the morning, and arrested him 10 minutes before midnight — and speaking to several Mumbai Police officers and witnesses, as well as on analysing technical evidence, they have managed to piece together the sequence of events behind the case that has caught the nation’s attention.Sharing details, one NIA officer said, “As part of his plan to produce a sensational case in Mumbai and then solve it in record time, the arrested assistant police inspector, who was in charge of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), asked businessman Mansukh Hiran to leave his Scorpio on the highway on February 17.”“Hiran, after leaving the car on Mulund-Airoli Road, met Vaze near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus the same day, and handed over the keys as asked by the officer. Vaze then asked Hiran to lodge a complaint (of a missing car) with the police, which Hiran filed on February 18,” the first officer said.From February 17 till February 25, the Scorpio was with Vaze and his associates in CIU, investigations revealed.On February 25, a second NIA investigator said, Vaze and a constable of CIU went in a convoy of two cars — the Scorpio and an Innova — to Carmichael Road around 2:20am to drop the Scorpio, laden with gelatin sticks, near Ambani’s residence, Antilia. A threat letter, addressed to Ambani and his wife, had already been placed beforehand in the vehicle. “Vaze and the constable took turns to drive Scorpio and then they returned in the Innova,” the officer said.“But, around 4.30am, Vaze returned to the spot to check the Scorpio as he thought he had left his identity card in it by mistake,” the second officer added. This visit, NIA officials said, has been established by CCTV footage from Mulund toll naka, where the Innova can be seen re-entering Mumbai from Thane around 4 am after leaving the city about half-an-hour earlier.A CCTV grab showing a man in a white kurta walking to the Scorpio prompted the NIA officials to take Vaze to the site, and make him walk to analyse his gait, and compare it to the person in the grab. They also raided his office in CIU, after his arrest, and seized a laptop, an iPad, a phone, and documents among other material. They also seized the black Mercedes that Vaze and Hiran sat in. In all, six vehicles have been seized by the NIA, including the Innova, which was a police vehicle.NIA officials said the agency will likely make the constable, whom they did not name, a witness rather than charge him in conspiracy. They added that the constable has confirmed the role of Vaze in the conspiracy.Once he was made the investigating officer of the case, Vaze asked Hiran to take the rap, but the latter demurred, said a third NIA officer.NIA officials believe that Vaze’s plan was to create some link between Hiran (once he confessed) and some Pakistani terror group or suspect, to make it look like a conspiracy planned by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. The officials admitted that this remains a theory that is yet to be proved.On March 5, Hiran’s body was found by fishermen at the Reti Bunder creek in Thane district, around 10.30am. The Mumbra Police handed over the body to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa and filed an Accidental Death report. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran had died by suicide. But Vimla, Hiran’s wife contested that claim. In a statement to the ATS, which took charge of the murder probe, she said that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned. Besides, the body had no identifying markers on it: his wallet, gold chain, gold ring studded with a pukhraj stone and wrist watch were not found on him when his body was recovered. What’s more, his body was found in a creek at Mumbra with handkerchiefs stuffed into his mouth, which was also covered by a scarf.On March 4, Vimala said that her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road.Vimala told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, her son spoke to Hiran’s brother, Vinod to inform him that Hiran had not returned home. Vinod called Vaze, who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde.The following morning, Hiran’s family lodged a missing person’s report at Naupada police station. The report filed helped identify the body.On March 7, an ATS team questioned the family for over three hours and filed an FIR against unknown persons for the murder of Mansukh Hiran.“Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of Vimla’s statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Further investigation by the ATS revealed that two people were involved in Hiran’s murder: an ex cop called Vinayak Shinde, and a bookie named Naresh Gor.Preliminary investigation found that some SIM cards used in commission of the crime were obtained by an employee of Gor, who runs a card club and also accepts betting on Cricket matches in Mumbai. The SIM cards were obtained from a Gujrat based person known to him and were found to be obtained in the name of a company from Gujrat. Preliminary investigation also revealed that the SIM cards were handed over by the bookie, Naresh Ramaniklal Gor, to Vinayak Shinde.It was Shinde who called Hiran on March 4, pretending to be a cop called Tawde, the ATS investigators found. At least 14 SIM cards procured by Gor from a contact in Gujarat were activated and used in the commission of this crime, the ATS said. Some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used were destroyed by the accused. A Volvo, belonging to Vaze’s former business associate, Abhishek Agarwal, was seized from Daman; the ATS believe it may have been the vehicle in which Hiran spent his last few hours.It is as yet unclear whether Hiran was made unconscious and then pushed into the creek, where he drowned. A Diatoms test – which checks for the presence of a single-celled algae called diatoms, to indicate whether a person has drowned – was performed on the body. Its results have been sent to a forensic science laboratory in Haryana for confirmation.However, Vaze was the mastermind of this murder the ATS said in a press conference that the chief held a day before the case was transferred to the NIA.The Union home ministry passed an order transferring the case to the federal agency, since the cases were linked; the NIA now has custody of the two accused of murdering Hiran, and have begun actively investigating the death.… And then, a political crisis… The second related part to this story is a study on the snowball effect: within days of Vimla’s statement to the ATS, the leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, demanded a probe by the NIA into the explosives as well as into Vaze’s role in the murder.Vaze was first transferred. He was also questioned by the ATS. Then, on March 13, as stated above, he was called in to the NIA team’s Mumbai office. He wasn’t the only CIU officer called in that day. Others who had also actively investigated the crime in its initial days were asked to come in too. But after 12 hours of questioning, he was the only one arrested.The home minister, who was under attack from Opposition for the shoddy handling of the case, transferred the Mumbai police commissioner, Param Bir Singh, the following week. In a media event the following day, he said that Singh’s transfer wasn’t routine, but due to grievous errors committed by his colleagues.A few days later, Param Bir Singh, who had taken charge of Home Guards, Maharashtra, wrote a letter to the CM, and marked other senior politicians and bureaucrats. He accused the home minister, Anil Deshmukh, of running an extortion ring. Deshmukh had set Vaze, and a few other cops, a target of collecting ₹100 crore, most of it from establishments like hookah bars and restaurants, the unsigned letter stated.Singh said that he was “made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers”.Deshmukh, however, refuted the allegations raised by Singh. “Sachin Vaze’s direct links in Antilia Case and Mansukh Hiren case are coming forward. Param Bir Singh is afraid that its connections will reach up to him. He has made these false allegations to save and protect himself from legal action,” the home minister tweeted immediately. Later, he issued a statement expanding on his innocence.The letter led to fresh demands by the Opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), calling for Deshmukh’s sacking. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government rallied around Deshmukh, and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar held press conferences on two consecutive days poking holes in allegations made by BJP leaders, including Fadnavis, based on the letter’s contents.NCP Maharashtra president Jayant Patil said there was no question of replacing home minister Anil Deshmukh and asserted, “The letter is a reaction after Maharashtra chief minister and home minister decided to take a tough stand,” the state minister said. “If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want,” he told HT.The Congress, which is part of the MVA coalition, along with NCP and Shiv Sena, also said that Deshmukh mustn’t resign, but demanded that a probe be ordered into the so-called extortion ring.A few days later, Singh moved the Bombay HC through a Public Interest Litigation, seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Deshmukh’s alleged dealings.…Which just keeps growing… Singh’s letter also made a reference to another report, this one submitted last August to the additional chief secretary (Home), a post that was held by current Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte at the time. The report was put together by former Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla and pertained to an alleged money for transfer scam in the police department. Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal, who in turn forwarded it to Kunte on August 26, 2020. In the covering letter Jaiswal wrote: “It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action.”The report, which is based on intercepted phone calls of six people, states that they were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up the names of politicians like NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their conversations.The report does not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly but to politicians’ aides and policemen. The report states that one the middlemen is an assistant in the home minister’s office. The report also does not talk about any direct transfer of money to these politicians. It does however refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.HT has seen a copy of the report, and Shukla, who is currently on deputation with the Central Reserve Police Force, has not responded to repeated calls and text messages.Kunte submitted a five-page brief to Thackeray on March 25, detailing out what exactly happened regarding these phone interceptions.Kunte’s report – HT has seen a copy of it – stated that Shukla intercepted the calls under the guise of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It further stated that no transfers of police officials took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020 – the period in which the calls were intercepted, and thus no scam had occurred.As things stand, the MVA government is mulling over taking action against Shukla, if it is discovered that she leaked the official report. Fadnavis claimed that he had the call record details of what Shukla intercepted, and he has asked Union home secretary to advise on whether a CBI probe in this matter can be instituted. However, in his note, Kunte said that no such pen drive of intercepted calls was submitted along with the report.The state has also decided to institute a judicial commission, led by a retired judge, to probe the allegations against Deshmukh made in Singh’s letter.Meanwhile, Vaze remains in custody of the NIA, which has started probing Hiran’s murder. On Thursday night, they took Vaze to a spot about a kilometer ahead of where Hiran’s body was found. Then, they drove him to another spot in Thane, where Hiran had reportedly been lured to by Shinde. On Friday, the NIA also put all three accused in the Hiran murder case in the same room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mumbai-an-explosive-scare-a-murder-and-now-a-political-crisis-101616812356080.html
27-03-2021||India||The CR Park state of mind||The men look carefree, playing cards by the pavement. The vegetable seller is napping by his cart. A balloon hawker is slowly dragging his bicycle and the helium balloons, tied to the handle bar, are bobbing in the air. A woman walks past purposefully, wearing her sari in the Bengali style.Strolling in south Delhi’s CR Park’s main avenue instantly transports you to an upscale Kolkata neighbourhood. More intense is the neighbourhood’s gentle rhythm. Everything feels unhurried, like ripples spreading slowly through a pond, whose water surface patiently absorbs all minor disturbances.A part of the road is lined with bungalows, each with its distinct individuality, as if harbouring its own Netflix series. Some of these houses are dated enough to exhibit an old-fashioned architecture—simple balconies and windows, with a small porch. These were a common sight in many Delhi neighbourhoods, but most such houses have been replaced by swish apartment complexes, or modern bungalows with designs so universal that they belong to every place and to no place in particular. CR Park still has a few of these well-maintained relics.No walk here will be fulfilling without a diversion into the so-called Market no. 1. Apart from its famous fish stalls, it has a carrom board club, a chai shop with a little temple fixed to the wall, and an establishment with a name that pulsates with history—East Bengal Halal & Mutton Chicken shop, with the Indian flag painted on the banner. Also check out Apsara Blouse, a shop decked with dozens of sari blouses of all shades.The road ahead passes by a public park and lunch stalls, with the tables set on the footpath, like in a European city. This afternoon though the biggest crowd is in front of the Kolkata Special Jhalmuri Stall (yummy!).Across the road, in one of the houses, a woman is standing in her balcony; her hair, white and long, is flowing picturesquely in the breeze.The walk ends at Kali Mandir. A masked woman is sitting by a banner printed with the temple’s Covid-era instructions of “no prasad, no shanti jal, no vermillion, no bhog, no offering and no meditation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-cr-park-state-of-mind-101616810141213.html

27-03-2021||India||On historic visit, PM recalls his struggle for Bangladesh||India and Bangladesh must be prepared to confront shared threats such as terrorism even as they boost trade and connectivity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday while participating in celebrations marking the golden jubilee of the neighbouring country’s independence, towards which he recalled his own contribution.On his first foreign visit since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, the PM said he had joined a movement for the liberation of Bangladesh when he was young and got arrested for it. “Joining that struggle for Bangladesh’s independence was one of the first times I joined such a movement in my life. I must have been 20-22 years old when many of my colleagues and I joined a satyagraha for the freedom of the people of Bangladesh,” he said.“I was arrested and had to go to jail. The yearning for Bangladesh’s independence was as great on this side as it was on the other side,” he said, speaking as a guest of honour at the main National Day celebration in Dhaka while sharing the stage with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.In a speech in Hindi peppered with Bengali words, Modi – clad in a black sleeveless jacket in a style made popular by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Father of the Nation of Bangladesh – made several references to the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers and Bangladeshi freedom fighters in the 1971 war that led to the emergence of a new country from the erstwhile East Pakistan.Recalling the words of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had said the blood of Bangladeshi freedom fighters and Indian soldiers would build relations that won’t break under any pressure, Modi said the next 25 years will be crucial for India and Bangladesh. “Just as our heritage, development and goals are shared, our challenges too are shared. We have to remember that while there are opportunities for us in trade and industry, there are shared threats like terrorism. The ideology and powers that carry out such inhuman acts are still active,” he said.“We must be careful and be organised to fight them. We both have the power of democracy and a clear vision to move forward,” he added.Modi also recalled the role played by the Pakistani military in triggering the uprising that led to the creation of Bangladesh. “The images of the heinous crimes and atrocities committed by the Pakistan Army did not allow people to sleep for many days,” he said.He quoted Bengali poet Gobinda Halder to say that those who liberated Bangladesh with an ocean of blood will never be forgotten, especially against the backdrop of the Pakistan Army’s efforts to crush the language, voice and identity of the people.Amidst all this, Rahman, or “Bongobandhu” as he is popularly known, was a ray of hope for Bangladeshis and Indians alike, Modi said. He also paid tribute to others such as former prime minister Indira Gandhi, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Lt Gen JS Aurora and Lt Gen JFR Jacob for their role in the liberation of Bangladesh.He said the current governments of the two countries have shown that mutual trust and cooperation can lead to the solution of complex problems, such as the land boundary agreement, and close collaboration to cope with contingencies such as the pandemic.Bangladesh rolled out the red carpet for Modi as he began a two-day visit on Friday, with Hasina and members of her cabinet welcoming the Prime Minister at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Modi was accorded a 19-gun salute and a guard of honour.Soon after his arrival, Modi visited Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho or National Martyrs’ Memorial, which honours those who died in Bangladesh’s liberation war.Later, Modi met community leaders, including representatives of Bangladesh’s minorities, freedom fighters and youth icons. He also met leaders from the 14-party ruling alliance led by its convener. Discussions centred on different aspects of bilateral relations were held during the meeting, officials said.Modi subsequently held another meeting with leaders of Bangladesh’s opposition parties.Besides holding talks with Hasina, Modi will also offer prayers to Goddess Kali at Jashoreshwari Kali temple, one of 51 Shaktipeeths in the Puranic tradition, and interact with representatives of the Matua community at Orakandi, from where Sri Sri Harichandra Thakur disseminated his message.In her speech, an emotional Hasina recalled India’s contributions to the liberation war and the support she and her family received from former prime minister Indira Gandhi both during the 1971 war and after her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most members of her family were assassinated during a military coup in August 1975.“In our independence war, we always remember the contribution of India,” she said, thanking Modi and the Indian government for conferring the Gandhi Peace Prize for 2020 on Rahman. She also thanked the Indian government for providing Covid-19 vaccines and 109 ambulances as a gift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-historic-visit-pm-recalls-his-struggle-for-bangladesh-101616809933412.html
27-03-2021||India||Ahead of Mahakumbh, Covid-19 cases jump in Haridwar||The number of new Covid-19 cases in Haridwar, where millions are gathering for the Mahakumbh pilgrimage, has grown by over 250% in the last week compared to the first week of the month, and the test positivity rate on Friday was nearly three times of what it was on March 1, reinforcing fears that the gathering is fuelling a bigger outbreak.Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh. The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 was attended by over 3.3 million people. The next is on April 1.In the first week of the month, 78 new cases were recorded in Haridwar. In the past seven days, this number has grown to 278. But the number of daily tests has not logged any significant increase – there were 4,715 tests on Friday and a little under 4,000 on March 1.On the first day of the month, only 16 cases were recorded, compared to 58 on Friday –a sharp increase in the positivity rate that is reflected over the week as well.As on Friday, Haridwar accounts for 385 active cases of total 1,162 in the state.Officials in other states are now beginning to record infections in pilgrims who went to Haridwar. On Friday, eight people from one family tested positive for Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna district, according to Guna district magistrate Kumar Purshotam.Chief medical officer Haridwar, Dr SK Jha said on Friday that given the expectation that up to 10 million pilgrims can arrive for the Shahi Snan on April 1, testing capacity is being increased and capacity to isolate pilgrims found positive is being strengthened.“Those with no negative Covid-19 reports would be returned. And those found positive through random testing would be isolated. We have capacity to isolate over 10,000 people, with the help of private hospitals. The testing on normal days will be increased as per the pilgrim rush and on Shahi Snan days, it can go even beyond 50,000. For last four days, we have been conducting tests of 3,000 to 5,000 people,” Jha said.The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the state government to ensure that pilgrims coming for Mahakumbh show a negative RT-PCR test taken not more than 72 hours earlier, after members of the court-appointed committee to check situation and arrangements in Mahakumbh submitted their reports to the court.On Sunday, Centre wrote to the state, stressing that the positivity rate in Haridwar has the potential to rapidly turning to an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh.On Friday, the administration announced some curbs on celebrations for Holi (which falls on Monday), allowing venues to host only 50% of their capacity and no single event can exceed an attendance of over 100 people.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities, who has been analysing Covid-19 data for the last year, said the testing numbers in Haridwar need to be scaled up over ten times in accordance with the expectations of the pilgrim influx.“On Thursday, they tested over 3,900 people. With such low testing at present, what can be the situation when one crore people will turn up. It won’t serve the purpose because even if Covid-19 infection is brought by few people into Kumbh area, it has potential to spread in millions”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-mahakumbh-covid-19-cases-jump-in-haridwar-101616796956160.html
27-03-2021||India||States asked to regulate crowds before festivals amid covid spike||The Centre on Friday directed all states and Union territories (UTs) to regulate the crowd and ensure strict enforcement of protocols ahead of various festivals in view of rising coronavirus cases in the country.With 62,267 cases within a span of 24 hours, the overall Covid-19 tally rose to 11,908,357, according the HT dashboard. The active caseload breached the 450,000-mark after four months. The death toll hit to 161,295 with 292 new fatalities.In a letter to chief secretaries of all states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla called for necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus and directed states and UTs to issue instructions to district administrations and police authorities to “scrupulously enforce Covid appropriate behaviour and SOPs in all public gatherings during the upcoming festivals.”“In view of the upcoming festivals such as Holi, Shab-e-Barat, harvesting festivals, Easter, Eid-ul-Fitr etc, state governments and UT administrations should take necessary measures to regulate crowds during these festivals by ensuring strict observance of Covid appropriate behavior such as wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing as mandated in aforesaid guidelines and in National Directives for Covid-19 management,” Bhalla said in his letter.The official’s letter further mentioned that strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behavior in public places and gatherings will help break the chain of transmission and reduce the virus caseload in the country.“As has been emphasised time and again by health experts, strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour in public places and gatherings will help in breaking the chain of transmission and reduce the incidence of Covid cases in the country,” he said.In a fresh set of guidelines on March 23, the Centre had directed the states and UTs to enhance RT-PCR tests, ensure strict enforcement of test-track-treat protocol and increase the pace of vaccination to cover all priority groups.The Centre announced that all fresh cases will require to be isolated or quarantined at the earliest and provided timely treatment. All contacts of the infected cases will also have to be traced quickly and isolated, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-asked-to-regulate-crowds-before-festivals-amid-covid-spike-101616796950181.html
27-03-2021||India||PDP’s Para gave ₹5cr to Hurriyat tokeep Valley on boil: NIA charge sheet||Peoples Democratic Party leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Para gave ₹5 crore to Hurriyat Conference to keep Kashmir on the boil after the encounter of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani, the National Investigation Agency has said in a charge sheet filed on Monday.This amount was given by Para “possibly on behalf of PDP to Hurriyat Conference for keeping the secessionist activities alive”, NIA added in the charge sheet. HT has reviewed excerpts of the charge sheet.Para was arrested on November 25 last year by the central agency after multiple rounds of questioning.In a statement issued later in the day, PDP additional spokesperson Najmu Saqib said the charges against Para were an attempt to muzzle the voices of Kashmir.“A through and through democrat who dedicated his life to strengthening the cause of the mainstream in Jammu And Kashmir, Waheed by putting his life and limb in harm’s way, is being punished for what he should’ve been appreciated for,” Saqib said.“We strongly believe that none of these frivolous charges would stand judicial scrutiny and Waheed would eventually get justice,” Saqib added.The charge sheet, which focuses on Para’s role in supporting terror and secessionist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, said “Para gave ₹5 crore in 2016 to Altaf Ahmad Shah alias Fantoosh to keep the situation boiling in Kashmir valley after the killing of HM terrorist Burhan Wani.”Funtoosh is separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son-in-law and a member of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference. He was arrested in July 2017 in a J&K terror funding case.According to the investigation agency, Funtoosh was a close associate of Para and the two maintained contact during the turmoil in the wake of Wani’s killing.Wani, 21-year-old Hizbul commander and the poster boy of militancy in Kashmir, was killed in an encounter with security forces on July 8, 2016. The encounter led to large scale stone pelting and public unrest in the Kashmir valley which went on for months.The encounter took place during the tenure of PDP president Mehbooba Mufti as the erstwhile state’s chief minister.Para has been named as accused in the supplementary charge sheet filed in NIA’s probe against suspended J&K police officer Davinder Singh, who was arrested in January 2020 for assisting HM terrorists.Elaborating on the PDP youth leader’s role in the case, NIA charge sheet said Para also gave ₹10 lakh to advocate Irfan Shafi Mir to hand over to HM terrorists, Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu. Mir and Naveed were arrested with Singh last year.In February-March 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, “Irfan Mir called Para on secure social chat platform, Signal, and made him talk to Syed Naveed Mushtaq when he was staying in the rented house of Irfan Mir in Jammu. Para talked to Syed Naveed and asked him to take care of his party workers campaigning for parliament election in Pulwama”, the NIA charge sheet said.The charge sheet also said that Para gave another ₹10 lakh to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Abu Dujana, apart from providing logistical support to LeT commander Naved Jatt. The agency, however, did not mention the year of this exchange.Jatt, who was involved in the killing of journalist Shujaat Bukhari, was gunned down by security forces in November 2018.Subsequently, the agency added “Para was also involved in gun running racket in Kupwara area in 2016”. “He used to bring weapons in his vehicle accompanied by an escort vehicle as none of the security agencies used to check it [him being a politician],” NIA said.According to NIA, Para played a crucial role in sustaining the “political-separatist-terrorist” nexus in Jammu and Kashmir apart from financing the activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pdps-para-gave-5cr-to-hurriyat-tokeep-valley-on-boil-nia-charge-sheet-101616796932107.html
27-03-2021||India||India chalks out 4-point plan to deal with Suez Canal blockage||The Centre has chalked out a four-point plan to deal with the situation arising from the blockage of the Suez Canal including advising ships to re-route via Cape of Good Hope.This plan was chalked out in a meeting convened by the logistics division, department of commerce, government of India Friday. It includes prioritisation of cargo, freight rates, advisory to ports and re-routing of ships.A 193-km canal, which is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt, connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. The 224,000-tonne container ship was grounded in the Suez Canal on Tuesday morning, completely blocking the traffic along the waterway and delaying a number of ships carrying cargo ranging from oil to consumer goods.Blockage of the Suez Canal is seriously hitting the global trade, the ministry of commerce and industry said in a statement.This route is used for Indian exports/imports worth USD 200 billion to/from North America, South America and Europe. It includes petroleum goods, organic chemicals, iron and steel, automobile, machinery, textiles and carpets, handicrafts including furniture, leather goods, etc.The meeting was chaired by Pawan Agarwal, Special Secretary (Logistics) and attended by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, ADG Shipping, Container Shipping Lines Association (CSLA) and Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).It was noted in the meeting that over 200 vessels are waiting on the North and South sides of the Suez Canal and about 60 vessels are getting added to the queue on a daily basis, according to the statement."If two more days are taken before the efforts result in clearance of the canal (digging on both sides, extra barges being added on every high tide, tugboats, etc. to straighten the stuck vessel), the total backlog created would be about 350 vessels. It is estimated that this backlog should take about a week time to clear out. It was decided in the meeting to closely monitor the situation," the statement read.Under the prioritisation of cargo, it was decided that FIEO, MPEDA and APEDA will jointly identify cargo particularly perishable cargo for priority movement and work with the shipping lines for the same.The CSLA assured that the freight rates as per existing contracts will be honoured."A request has been made to the shipping lines to maintain stability in freight rates during the period of this crisis. It was noted that the situation is temporary and is unlikely to have a long-lasting impact," the statement read.Once the blockage is over, it is expected that some bunching may take place, especially at the ports of JNPT, Mundra and Hazira, it said."Ministry of ports, shipping and waterways assured to issue an advisory to these ports so as to gear up arrangements and ensure efficient handling during the forthcoming busy period," the statement said.Besides, shipping lines were advised through CSLA to explore the option of re-routing of ships via the Cape of Good Hope. It was pointed that such re-routing usually takes 15 additional days' time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-chalks-out-4-point-plan-to-deal-with-suez-canal-blockage-101616805429223.html
27-03-2021||India||Vaccination pace sluggish, lack of motivation keeping people away, say doctors||The pace of Covid-19 vaccinations is sluggish in the city despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal mandating that vaccination centres in Delhi will operate for 12 hours a day, from 9am and 9pm, in all Delhi government-run hospitals. The government had also directed its hospitals to run six vaccination centres each on their premises.Since the extended 12-hour vaccination drive began on Monday (March 22), on average, 34,027 jabs have been administered daily. On Friday, only 20,652 shots were administered across Delhi, of which 16,181 were first doses and the rest second doses.In comparison, around 46,769 jabs – both first and second doses — were administered last Saturday, two days before the extended vaccination timings kicked in, government data said.To scale up the capacity from 30,000 to 40,000 shots a day to 125,000 jabs daily, Kejriwal had announced that vaccination sites at Delhi government hospitals will run between 9am and 9pm from March 22. The government order from last Thursday read, “...all the Delhi Government hospitals will operate vaccination sites functioning in their premises up to at least 9pm.”Government analysis so far, however, has shown that there has been an uptick in immunisation in the government centres as compared to private ones. The turnout rate at government centres had increased March 16 onwards, with the centres seeing a 72% turnout (against capacity) on March 18, compared to 49% in private facilities, according to data seen by HT.Doctors from government hospitals, however, said the hospitals anyway had more capacity to vaccinate people. The challenge, they claim, lay in motivating people to come and get the shots.During a spot check earlier this week, HT found that the vaccination centre at two out of three hospitals that this reporter visited, had closed by 5pm.At trans-Yamuna region’s biggest Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, the tented waiting rooms outside its “walk-in” emergency department — it has now been converted into three vaccination centres — remained deserted on Tuesday. At 5:30pm, two staff nurses leaving the centre asked the reporter to return the following day between 9am and 5pm if she wanted to get the shot.“We have a capacity for vaccinating 600 people, but there were only 144 shots administered throughout the day. People are not coming even between 9am and 5pm, they need to be motivated,” said Dr RS Rautela, medical director, Guru Teg bahadur hospital.The “walk-in” emergency department had been set up in 2019 by the hospital to help triage patients outside its main emergency. Any patient who could walk by themselves and hence were thought to have a less severe problem could be treated at the one-hall structure.The structure now houses all three vaccination counters running at the hospital.According to a senior doctor at the hospital, the three sites itself have a capacity to inoculate 600 people. “However, we manage to vaccinate only about 300 to 350 people a day. The number hasn’t picked up despite increasing the capacity. The vaccination centres remain mostly vacant after around three in the afternoon. It is highly unlikely that people will come in at 7pm or 8pm to get their shots here,” said a doctor, on condition of anonymity.Elsewhere, at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, finding the vaccination centre itself was a challenge, with no proper signboard to guide beneficiaries to the vaccination centre behind the main hospital building. The tented waiting room outside was vacant and a lock hung on the door to the single-block vaccination centre at 6pm on Tuesday.A guard stationed at the neighbouring building asked the reporter to return before 5pm the next day.“Our vaccine doses haven’t been increased yet. The districts need to provide us with more manpower and furniture. We have only 200 doses allocated for the hospital and that usually runs out by afternoon. So, there is no point in running the centre till 9pm, just to have people come here and be turned away,” said Dr BL Sherwal, medical director, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, Tahirpur.At the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, although all major gates to the staircase leading to the upper floors -- where the vaccination centres are located -- had been locked, a sign pointed to the one that remained open for Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday at 7pm. Outside the site, there were nursing and police personnel who said anybody could get vaccinated 24x7 at the single operational site.Between 9am and 5pm, the hospital runs another vaccination centre at the same location, with a third centre at the super-speciality hospital in the same compound.The 24x7 vaccination centre at the hospital was not a new addition and has been functional for nearly a month now for administering shots to front-line workers who get off duty at odd hours.“We have one centre running at all times. Not many people come to the hospital at night time. Usually, only 10 or maybe 20 come after 5pm, and that too mostly police and CRPF (para military) personnel. Anyone who comes to the hospital at any time can get their shot at the centre,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.The hospital vaccinates around 200 to 300 people a day, although it has a capacity to immunise over 600 persons.“We need to increase the pace of vaccination – it will help in preventing deaths and controlling the surge in infections. The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait for it. And, we need to vaccinate our teachers and anciliary staff and open up schools and college,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.The Delhi government refused to comment on the issue, despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-pace-sluggish-lack-of-motivation-keeping-people-away-say-doctors-101616796899145.html
27-03-2021||India||Indian, Pak armies hold flag meet on ceasefire agreement||The Indian and Pakistani armies on Friday held a flag meeting in the Poonch sector to ensure that both sides uphold the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in line with the understanding reached by the two director generals of military operations last month.The two militaries last month announced that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir from the midnight of February 24. Friday’s flag meet was held at the brigade commander level.“Post the DGMOs Understanding 2021, a Brigade Commander Level Flag Meeting was held between Indian and Pakistan Army at Poonch Rawalkot Crossing Point on 26 Mar 2021 to discuss implementation mechanism as per the understanding,” the Indian Army said on Twitter.“The ceasefire is holding good and the brigade-commander level flag meet was planned to ensure that both sides adhere to the understanding reached between the two DGMOs,” said a senior official.It is for the first time in about five to six years that the LoC has been silent which bodes well for the future, army chief General MM Naravane said at an event on Friday. He said three reasons behind Pakistan’s move for peace were Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sanctions, domestic compulsions and the situation on its Western border with Afghanistan.The 12 months preceding the announcement by the Indian and Pakistan militaries that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC saw the highest number of border violations by the neigbouring army since the original ceasefire agreement in November 2003.Official figures obtained by HT show that the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire at least a dozen times daily on an average between February 2020 and February 2021 when both sides agreed to strict observance of all agreements and understandings to observe a ceasefire along the LoC.The year 2020 witnessed 4,645 violations by Pakistan on the LoC, with August and September – the first anniversary of the Centre revoking the special status of the state on August 5, 2019 – accounting for the highest number of violations for any two consecutive months in 17 years. This figure for last year stood at more than 5,100 if the violations along the international border are also counted.Data shows August and September alone accounted for 835 ceasefire violations last year. Ceasefire violations by the Pakistani Army sharply increased over the last five years – recording a 10-fold jump since 2016 when the Indian Army carried out surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Pakistan-backed suicide attack on an army camp in Uri. The year 2016 accounted for 449 violations, with the numbers only rocketing in the following years – 881 (2017), 1,629 (2018) and 3,168 (2019).The unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army on the LoC in recent years was to help terrorist infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir to feed the terror machinery in the state and destabilise the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-pak-armies-hold-flag-meet-on-ceasefire-agreement-101616796922138.html
27-03-2021||India||Supreme Court dismisses plea against sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the sale of the electoral bonds ahead of elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry finding no justification to block their sale over concerns of anonymity in political party funding or apprehensions of their misuse. The 10-day sale window will open, as scheduled, on April 1.Dismissing two stay applications moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms, filed in 2019 and earlier this month, a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the sale of these bonds, which began in January 2018, have continued “without any impediment” in 2018, 2019 and 2020.In April 2019, the Court introduced an interim “safeguard” by directing all political parties to submit details of receipts of the electoral bonds to the Election Commission in a sealed cover. This was done as an interim measure till the pending petitions challenging the validity of these electoral bonds were decided. With this order still in vogue, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “certain safeguards have already been provided by this Court in its interim order of April 12, 2019, (and) we do not see any justification for the grant of stay at this stage.”The Election Commission which supported the electoral bond policy in the top court said it has received sealed covers from various political parties (national, state, registered and unregistered) as per the April 12, 2019 order. The list of parties that submitted the covers were also furnished to the Court.Further, the court held that this interim arrangement will now remain and no applications for stay will be entertained every time the window for sale of electoral bonds is opened.ADR, in its application claimed that electoral bonds could be a channel for corporate bribes to be paid to political parties as a quid pro quo since the scheme envisaged anonymity for donors. The Centre, represented by Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted that the idea of introducing these bonds was to prevent black money holding sway over elections.In support of his concerns, ADR’s counsel Prashant Bhushan relied on a letter written by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) way back in September 2017 (before introduction of the scheme) expressing serious reservations over it. The bench, after examining a series of letters written by RBI concluded that much of the banking regulator’s concerns were addressed in the final version of the scheme.The judges noted that in one letter, RBI went to the extent of calling electoral bonds “an enduring reform consistent with the Government’s digitization push.” RBI’s only objection was to the issue of bonds in scrip form rather than in dematerialised (electronic) form. The bench held, “It is not correct to say that RBI and EC opposed the electoral bond scheme itself….RBI wanted to achieve the twin advantage of providing anonymity to the contributor and ensuring that consideration for transfers is through banking channels and not cash or other means. The concerns expressed by RBI to the form and not to the substance, cannot really advance the case of the petitioners.”Bhushan further alleged that the bond could be purchased by a person using white money and later transferred to somebody in black. The Court ruled out the scope of such a transaction as purchasers of bonds will have to comply with KYC norms and their identities are anyway known to the State Bank of India, which issues the bonds. If a company makes a donation through electoral bonds, the Companies Act requires financial statements of registered companies to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. Further, the scheme also mandates political parties to file audited statements of accounts each year with the Election Commission.“Therefore, it is not as though the operations under the scheme are behind iron curtains incapable of being pierced…All that is required is a little more effort to cull out such information from both side (purchaser of bond and political party) and do some `match the following’,” added the bench. Clause 14 of the Electoral Bond Scheme introduced by way of amendments to the Finance Act and Representation of Peoples Act in January 2018 specifically prohibits trading of bonds. The Court cited this clause to allay Bhushan’s fears of subsequent transfer of bonds.Welcoming the order, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nalin Kohli said: “Now that the honourable Supreme Court has decided in favour of the electoral bonds one hopes there will be closure to what was an unnecessary controversy on a good decision with regard to electoral funding.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, termed the bonds a “dubious money laundering operation”. “SC must expose #ElectoralBonds for what they have become-: 1. A dubious money laundering operation to help one party. 2. A veiled mechanism to legitimize quid-pro-quo deals. 3. An untraceable funnel for black money payments. If not now, then when?,” he tweeted.ADR Founder Jagdeep Chhokar said, “The judgment is disappointing. The interim arrangement on which the Court has relied is unworkable. The EC cannot know the donors of these bonds received by political parties. Further, the Court has said that information about the donors can be known by making a little effort. if this information can be found then why can’t it be made available in public domain. We hope this order does not impact our petition pending on the larger questions of law challenging these bonds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101616796889222.html
27-03-2021||India||Hand over Mukhtar Ansari to UP in 14 days: Supreme Court to Punjab||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in Rupnagar jail, to Uttar Pradesh Police within 14 days.Ansari, a BSP MLA from Mau constituency, is facing trial in 10 cases involving heinous crimes ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud under the Gangster Act, in UP. In 2019, he was brought to Rupnagar jail in connection with an alleged extortion case in Mohali.The court’s directive came on a plea by the UP government seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of the legislator.The court, however, rejected the UP government’s plea, seeking transfer of the extortion case from Punjab to it. It also dismissed Ansari’s petition seeking transfer of cases filed in UP against him to some other place outside the state.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to Banda jail authorities in UP. It further told Banda prison authorities to extend all medical facilities to the accused.“In our opinion, a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another… Courts are not to be a helpless bystander, when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. In such situations, this court can exercise power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to order transfer of prisoner from one prison to another,” the bench observed.“Custody is denied to the Police of Uttar Pradesh at every time on trivial grounds under guise of medical grounds by mentioning ordinary diseases,” the bench added.The UP government had earlier contended that Ansari had been “dodging” the judicial system and was continuing with his alleged illegal activities from Rupnagar district. The Yogi Adityanath-led government also alleged in the apex court that there is a “collusion” between Ansari and Punjab Police.Refuting the claims, the Amarinder Singh government raised questions over the maintainability of the plea filed by his UP counterpart. On March 4, it informed the top court that the UP government did not have the fundamental right to seek Ansari’s transfer.Since 2019, Ansari has not applied for a bail nor has Punjab Police filed a charge sheet in the case.Due to his stay in the Punjab prison, multiple trials pending against him before the Special MP/MLA court in Allahabad were adjourned on various occasions. The warrants issued by the UP courts were also not entertained by Punjab jail authorities citing the “ill health” of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hand-over-mukhtar-ansari-to-up-in-14-days-sc-to-punjab-101616791705163.html
27-03-2021||India||Sunanda could not have killed herself, no question of abetment: Tharoor to court||Congress member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor on Friday told a Delhi court that the family, friends and son of his late wife Sunanda Pushkar have maintained that she was a strong woman and could not have died by suicide.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Tharoor, while arguing on the framing of charges in the death of Pushkar in 2014 at a hotel in the city, told special judge Geetanjali Goel that no case of abetment to suicide is made out against his client as she could not have died by suicide.“Her relatives and son say she was a strong woman and couldn’t have died by suicide. How can there be a question of abetment when she didn’t die by suicide,” Pahwa said adding that the police investigation has conclusively established by way of opinion from renowned doctors that she had not died by suicide.He also cited several judgments and sought the discharge of Tharoor from the case. The court put up the matter for further hearing to April 9.Pushkar was found dead in the suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014, following which the police had charged Tharoor with abetment to suicide, among other charges.Tharoor has consistently denied all charges, calling them “preposterous and motivated”.On May 14, 2018, Tharoor had tweeted: “ I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet & intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part...If this is conclusion arrived at after 4+ yrs of investigation it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”On March 17, during arguments, Pahwa had told the court that doctors have not been able to ascertain the cause of death or establish whether Pushkar had indeed died by suicide and, hence, the case of abetment to suicide against Tharoor was nothing but “a figment of imagination of the police”.He had earlier said the post-mortem examination and other medical reports have allegedly established that it was neither a suicide nor homicide. He had also said during the course of the investigation, there have been a plethora of reports by experts before the investigating officer (IO) but there was “no definite opinion on the cause of death”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sunanda-could-not-have-killed-herself-no-question-of-abetment-tharoor-to-court-101616791694105.html
27-03-2021||India||NGT panel finds damage to 30% mangroves in Andhra’s Kakinada||A joint committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to look into the cutting of mangrove forests in the coastal area of Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh’s East Godavari district for a housing project, has confirmed destruction of nearly 30% of the mangrove area at the site. The committee also directed the district administration not to proceed with the township project and to take “remedial measures” for “rejuvenation of mangroves”.In its report submitted to the southern bench of the NGT on March 17, the committee observed that out of the total extent of mangroves spread over 116 acres, work has been taken up on 58 acres for “Navaratnaalu-Pedalanadirki Illu” (nine jewels-house sites for the poor) programme, thereby affecting mangroves in an extent of 30% of the filled-up area. The house sites’ distribution programme was launched on December 25, but the preparatory work like identification of sites and levelling of sites began in March 2020.“The mangrove area also falls under Coastal Regulatory Zone-I area (CRZ-I), which is ecologically sensitive and the geomorphologic features of this zone play a role in the maintaining the integrity of the coast. As per CRZ notification 2011, no new construction shall be permitted in CRZ-I,” the committee noted.District collector D Muralidhar Reddy, who was also one of the members of the committee, said the government had initiated the process of change in the CRZ category of the said land from CRZ-I to CRZ II, as the land is not a notified forest land, but a waste land as per the revenue records.The NGT, in its order dated March 18, directed that the district administration should not proceed with further development of the township in the said area till the necessary permissions from the competent authorities are obtained. The tribunal directed that the government take remedial measures for rejuvenation of mangroves and other trees in that area considering the eco-sensitiveness of that area.“Besides, considering the nature of damage alleged to have committed, the government must quantify the damage caused to the environment taking into account the amount required for re-rejuvenation of the mangroves and loss of green cover and restoration of the same in that area to protect the environment,” the tribunal said and posted the case to April 26.The committee, however, felt that there is no threat to the existing Coringa Wild Life Sanctuary due to the housing project, which is located at about 3 km away.The committee was constituted on April 30, 2020, following a petition filed by environmentalist Satyanarayana Bolishetty in the NGT, challenging the state government’s decision to fell and remove mangroves and fill up the land to develop house sites for the poor.The six-member committee comprises C Palpandi, scientist from ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), K Prijilal, research officer in MoEF, district collector D Muralidhar Reddy, conservator of forests, Rajahmundry, N Nageshwara Rao; District Forest Officer, East Godavari, B Sunil Kumar Reddy and environmental engineer of Andhra Pradesh Coastal Zone Management Authority A Rama Rao Naidu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-panel-finds-damage-to-30-mangroves-in-andhra-s-kakinada-101616791582113.html
27-03-2021||India||Bharat Bandh: Roads blocked, rail services hit in Punjab and Haryana||A 12-hour Bharat Bandh called by farmer groups affected large parts of Punjab, Haryana, Bihar and western Uttar Pradesh with road and rail transport severely hampered, although the impact of the nationwide demonstration was largely limited in other regions of the country.The bandh, called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to protest against the three contentious farm laws, was in force from 6am to 6pm. Dozens of farm leaders and activists were detained and the northern railways said 41 passenger trains and 40 freight trains had to be cancelled, diverted or delayed.The nationwide bandh was called to mark the day the agitation on the outskirts of the national capital completed four months. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders since November 26, seeking a repeal of the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year – Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.The farmers fear the new laws will dismantle the Minimum Support Price (MSP)-system and corporatise farming. Talks between unions and the central government failed to resolve the stalemate despite 12 rounds of meetings.Friday’s protests led to the blockage of railway tracks in at least 44 locations under the Delhi, Ambala and Ferozepur divisions of the railways, leading to cancellation of four high-speed Shatabdi trains, and the delay of 35 other passenger trains and 40 goods trains, according to a northern railway spokesperson DJ Narain.“Barring some limited number of trains in Punjab and Haryana, the bandh has had almost zero impact across the nation. Other than in these two states, around five to six trains were delayed for some time. Less than 0.5% of trains impacted nationally. Trains are running smoothly,” he said.On Friday, security was increased across toll plazas and railway stations in Punjab and Haryana as farmers blocked traffic on highways. Several shops remained shut and both public and private vehicles stayed off roads for the day.“There are reports of successful ‘Bharat Bandh’ from almost every district in Haryana. Markets and other services in cities like Kurukshetra, Karnal, Sonipat, Yamunanagar, Ambala etc remained suspended. In Punjab, ‘Bharat Bandh’ programs were held in more than 200 places, including Mansa, Amritsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Jalandhar,” a statement said, adding that there was “impressive” impact in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.The Eastern Peripheral Expressway near the national capital, too, was blocked while a sit-in was staged on a road connecting Delhi’s Nizamuddin to neighbouring Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region, news agency PTI reported.Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said there was no impact of the shutdown on markets and industrial areas of the national capital.In Haryana, farmers blocked the Delhi-Ambala and Rohtak-Delhi highways with their tractors, and only allowed movement of school buses and ambulances in the area.Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha secretary Dayanand Punia said the demonstrators laid siege to railway platforms in the state till 6pm. “The labourers also joined our protest and rural areas also remained shut on Friday,” he said.In Uttar Pradesh, the impact of the bandh was largely seen in western districts, with farmers blocking roads and highways in areas such as Bulandshahr, Meerut, Agra and Muzaffarnagar, BKU leaders said.Twenty CPI (Marxist-Leninist) activists, protesting in Sikandarpur township of Ballia district, were taken into custody, news agency PTI reported.In Gujarat, farmer leader Yudhvir Singh was detained for allegedly holding a press conference in a hotel in Ahmedabad without police permission and in violation of Covid-19 norms. “Gujarat has truly become a police state,” Jignesh Mevani, an independent legislator, said.Barring areas such as Thane, Palghar, Nashik and Ahmednagar, the protest was overall scaled down in Maharashtra in the wake of surge of Covid-19 infections. “Due to the coronavirus outbreak, no large scale rallies have been planned in the state. However, we are submitting our petitions to 400 taluka centres and 30 collector officers in support of the farmers protest,” Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella organisation of 110 farmers, said in a statement.Stray incidents of forceful closure of businesses were reported but the strike remained largely peaceful in Bihar. There were little to no signs of a shutdown in poll-bound Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-bandh-roads-blocked-rail-services-hit-in-punjab-and-haryana-101616791578081.html
27-03-2021||India||Delhi temperature summer woes Mercury likely to touch 38° Celsius by Monday: IMD||Temperatures in the national capital, which has seen a consistently warmer-than-usual March, are set to rise over the weekend and mercury is likely to touch 38 degrees Celsius by Monday, according to weather forecast by scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The spike in temperature is expected as the Capital has seen clear skies in recent days, allowing direct sunlight to hit the land surface, officials added.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said on Friday, “The mercury levels will be on a rising trend till March 29. It is likely to be one of the warmest Holi that the city has ever seen, but the comparison would be a little difficult because the festival falls on different dates.”However, there will be partial relief from the heat soon after, with temperatures expected to fall from March 30. “There is a forecast of strong winds on March 30 and March 31; this will help bring down the temperature again. From Tuesday, the maximum temperature is expected to be around 31-32 degrees Celsius again,” said Srivastava.On Friday, the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the Capital city, recorded a maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 16 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.March had largely recorded above normal temperatures, before the city’s residents heaved a sigh of relief this week as light rain coupled with strong winds brought down mercury.IMD officials said on Friday that temperatures for this month are likely to be at least 3-4 degrees higher than normal. The mean maximum temperature (MMT), which is the mean of the average maximum temperatures recorded in a particular month over the years, for March is normally 29.6 degrees Celsius. This time, it may touch 32°C.The highest single-day temperature to ever be recorded in March was in 1945, when the mercury levels crossed the 40°C mark.Meanwhile, the city’s air quality continued to remain in the “moderate” zone for the second consecutive day on Friday, likely driven by strong winds that allow for dispersal of pollutants.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Friday was 150. On Thursday, the average AQI was 148, also in the “moderate” zone. The IMD has forecast that AQI levels are likely to remain this in the category through the weekend before a minor deterioration on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-temperature-summer-woes-mercury-likely-to-touch-38-celsius-by-mondayimd-101616791568010.html
27-03-2021||India||Day after Srinagar terror attack, 2 LeT associates held||Two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) overground workers, who were allegedly involved in the attack on a CRPF convoy in Lawaypora that claimed two lives, were arrested on Friday. The two arrested have been identified as Muzaffar Mir and Javaid Sheikh. They had provided logistic support for carrying out the attack. A local Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Nadeem Abrar Bhat and two other foreign terrorists who executed the attack are on the run.Inspector general of police Vijay Kumar said the case had been solved: “It was due to the joint efforts of the Bandipore and Srinagar police that the case was solved.” Kumar said that Nadeem of Narbal, Budgam, who is a known Lashkar commander, had visited his relative Muzaffar three days ago and sought assistance in carrying out the attack with the help of two overground workers. “Muzaffar sought help from his timber business partner, Javaid. The three carried a reconnaissance of the area and planned the attack that took place in Lawaypora (on the outskirts of Srinagar), in which two CRPF men were killed and two others injured,” he said. The IG said soon after the attack, the area was cordoned and sources activated. “In the meantime, the Bandipore police arrested Javaid. A few empty cartridges were found in his vehicle. After interrogation, he revealed all details of the attack,” he said, adding that Muzaffar’s car had been seized and both arrested persons had confessed their crime.“An operation has been launched at two places to arrest Nadeem and two other foreign terrorists who were involved in the attack. They will be neutralised soon.” Meanwhile, a wreath laying ceremony was held in Srinagar and bodies of CRPF personnel were airlifted to their native places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-srinagar-terror-attack-2-let-associates-held-101616790812991.html

27-03-2021||India||62k new cases in country, Maha clamps night curfew||New Delhi/Mumbai: A total of 62,267 new infections of Covid-19 were reported across India on Friday, the highest single-day increase in cases since October 16, as the country’s second wave of the continued to push case numbers up forcing local governments to reintroduce curbs on social gatherings just ahead of Holi and the festive season. Active cases in India, meanwhile, soared near the half million mark.Maharashtra on Friday announced the imposition of a night curfew across the state from March 28 in an attempt to curb the outbreak. The state, which is the worst-hit by the virus, reported 36,902 new cases – highest single-day increase ever. This is the sixth time in nine days that the state has set a new all-time record for daily cases, a statistic that highlights how the recent outbreak there is much worse than anything seen in the state in the first wave.As several states grappled with resurgence of infections, Centre on Friday rushed two high-level multidisciplinary teams to Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh, areas that have both seen recent surge, to assist the local governments in managing the outbreak. After Friday’s 62,267 cases, India’s seven-day average of infections, which denotes the country’s case curve, soared to 50,485, also the worst since mid-October. More than a quarter million new cases have been reported across the country in just the last five days. An analysis by HT reported on Thursday showed that Covid cases in the second wave are rising at a rate faster than they were even during the worst of the first wave (July to September).This surge has pushed the number of active cases in the country close to the 500,000-mark for the first time since November. As of Friday night, there are 454,178 active cases across the country. The number of active cases in India crossed the million-mark in September, when the first wave peaked, but it was dropping rapidly since. This receding trend, however, reversed a month ago with the start of the new wave of infections.In Maharashtra, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray the ordered night curfew from Sunday after holding a meeting with senior officials to review the preparedness against the disease. He warned of stricter restrictions if the people did not observe Covid-19 safety protocol. “I do not wish to impose lockdown. But there seems a possibility of health care facilities falling short given the rise in number of coronavirus patients,” Thackeray said in a statement.Maharashtra is the latest among a string of states that have been forced to reintroduce curbs on social gatherings ahead of Holi and other festivals. Last week, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh clamped restrictions on public assembly and gatherings. In Delhi, celebrations and gatherings at public places and religious sites were banned for Holi, Navaratri and Shab-e-Barat on Tuesday.Other than Maharashtra, two other states – Punjab and Gujarat – also set new records of single-day new cases. Punjab reported 3,122 new cases while 2,190 new infections were reported in Gujarat. Several other states and UTs –Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh – are displaying strong upward trajectories in the past month.Centre on Friday rushed two high-level multidisciplinary teams to Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh in light of rising cases. “These teams shall work with the respective State/UT government to ascertain the reason/s for surge, assist in undertaking gap analysis and recommend requisite Covid-19 control and containment measures,” said Union ministry of health and family welfare in a statement.Chhattisgarh recorded 2,665 new cases, highest in five months, while Chandigarh reported 248 new infections on Friday.The team to Chhattisgarh is headed by Dr SK Singh, director, National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), and has experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, and All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health. The team to Chandigarh is led by Vijoy Kumar Singh, additional secretary and financial advisor, ministry of textiles, with experts drawn from New Delhi’s Dr RML Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62k-new-cases-in-country-maha-clamps-night-curfew-101616784930748.html
27-03-2021||India||Jarkiholi booked after woman files sexual assault complaint||The Bengaluru police on Friday registered an FIR against Karnataka BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi on several charges, including “sexual intercourse by a person in authority” and “sexual assault”, based on a handwritten complaint filed by the woman who featured in the video linked to the sexual harassment case. The complaint comes a day after the woman released a video raising doubts over the credibility of the Special Investigation Team probing the case and sought protection for her family. The woman, who is absconding, sent the two-page complaint to Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant  through her lawyer.  In the letter, the woman has alleged that the former minister sexually exploited her on the pretext of a job. According to the FIR, Jarkiholi has been booked under sections 376C (Sexual intercourse by a person in authority), 354A (Sexual harassment), 506 (Criminal intimidation), 504 (Insult to provoke breach of peace) and 417 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 A (transmitting obscene material) of the Information Technology Act. As per the complaint filed by the woman, she met then minister Jarkiholi during the shooting of a short film in Bengaluru. “Since then, he used to call me often and ask about me, my family... Then he offered to give me a government job using his influence and said that I should cooperate with him,” the letter read.“Once he called me and said that he is staying in the Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi. He later called me through video and asked me to show my private parts... I did as he said because he was an influential man,” she added. Once Jarkiholi returned to Bengaluru, he asked the woman to visit him at his house to discuss the job offer, where they had sexual intercourse, the woman wrote in her complaint. “This happened twice. I obliged out of fear. When asked about the job he offered, he told me to ask for some money if I needed it and the job can be looked at later,” read the letter, adding that the leader has also verbally abused her on several occasions.The woman has also alleged that Jarkiholi has threatened him of dire consequences and sought protection for her family. “Protection should be provided to my family and I. Action should be taken against Ramesh Jarkiholi for sexually exploiting me, cheating, offering a job, verbally abusing and trying to kill me,” she has alleged. On Thursday, in a video statement, the woman sought protection for her family saying: “I will appear before the SIT only after the safety of my parents is ensured. I will take care of all further procedures and also provide statements (once their safety is ensured).” Dismissing the allegations, Jarkiholi told reporters that “his game begins” on Saturday. “I knew this would happen. This was her final move. My game will start tomorrow (Saturday)… I also have lawyers with me,” he said. “I dislodged one government and installed another one. What’s this? I will face more such complaints,” he told reporters in Bengaluru. He further added that his complaint should be investigated first. “I filed a complaint first, so my FIR should be looked into first,” he said.A senior BJP leader said the party’s stand is to keep its distance from the case, as it is under investigation. “Law will take its course,” said the leader. There was no immediate response from the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jarkiholi-booked-after-woman-files-sexual-assault-complaint-101616784271471.html
27-03-2021||India||Hand over Mukhtar Ansari to UP in 14 days: SC to Punjab||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, currently lodged in Rupnagar jail, to Uttar Pradesh Police within 14 days. Ansari, a BSP MLA from Mau constituency, is facing trial in 10 cases involving heinous crimes ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud under the Gangster Act, in UP. In 2019, he was brought to Rupnagar jail in connection with an alleged extortion case in Mohali.The court’s directive came on a plea by the UP government seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of the legislator. The court, however, rejected the UP government’s plea, seeking transfer of the extortion case from Punjab to it. It also dismissed Ansari’s petition seeking transfer of cases filed in UP against him to some other place outside the state.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to Banda jail authorities in UP. It further told Banda prison authorities to extend all medical facilities to the accused. “In our opinion, a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another… Courts are not to be a helpless bystander, when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity. In such situations, this court can exercise power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to order transfer of prisoner from one prison to another,” the bench observed.“Custody is denied to the Police of Uttar Pradesh at every time on trivial grounds under guise of medical grounds by mentioning ordinary diseases,” the bench added. The UP government had earlier contended that Ansari had been “dodging” the judicial system and was continuing with his alleged illegal activities from Rupnagar district. The Yogi Adityanath-led government also alleged in the apex court that there is a “collusion” between Ansari and Punjab Police.Refuting the claims, the Amarinder Singh government raised questions over the maintainability of the plea filed by his UP counterpart. On March 4, it informed the top court that the UP government did not have the fundamental right to seek Ansari’s transfer.Since 2019, Ansari has not applied for a bail nor has Punjab Police filed a charge sheet in the case. Due to his stay in the Punjab prison, multiple trials pending against him before the Special MP/MLA court in Allahabad were adjourned on various occasions. The warrants issued by the UP courts were also not entertained by Punjab jail authorities citing the “ill health” of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hand-over-mukhtar-ansari-to-up-in-14-days-sc-to-punjab-101616783850570.html
27-03-2021||India||SC dismisses plea against sale of electoral bonds||The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the sale of the electoral bonds ahead of elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry finding no justification to block their sale over concerns of anonymity in political party funding or apprehensions of their misuse. The 10-day sale window will open, as scheduled, on April 1. Dismissing two stay applications moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms, filed in 2019 and earlier this month, a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde noted that the sale of these bonds, which began in January 2018, have continued “without any impediment” in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In April 2019, the Court introduced an interim “safeguard” by directing all political parties to submit details of receipts of the electoral bonds to the Election Commission in a sealed cover. This was done as an interim measure till the pending petitions challenging the validity of these electoral bonds were decided. With this order still in vogue, the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “certain safeguards have already been provided by this Court in its interim order of April 12, 2019, (and) we do not see any justification for the grant of stay at this stage.” The Election Commission which supported the electoral bond policy in the top court said it has received sealed covers from various political parties (national, state, registered and unregistered) as per the April 12, 2019 order. The list of parties that submitted the covers were also furnished to the Court. Further, the court held that this interim arrangement will now remain and no applications for stay will be entertained every time the window for sale of electoral bonds is opened. ADR, in its application claimed that electoral bonds could be a channel for corporate bribes to be paid to political parties as a quid pro quo since the scheme envisaged anonymity for donors. The Centre, represented by Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted that the idea of introducing these bonds was to prevent black money holding sway over elections. In support of his concerns, ADR’s counsel Prashant Bhushan relied on a letter written by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) way back in September 2017 (before introduction of the scheme) expressing serious reservations over it. The bench, after examining a series of letters written by RBI concluded that much of the banking regulator’s concerns were addressed in the final version of the scheme. The judges noted that in one letter, RBI went to the extent of calling electoral bonds “an enduring reform consistent with the Government’s digitization push.” RBI’s only objection was to the issue of bonds in scrip form rather than in dematerialised (electronic) form. The bench held, “It is not correct to say that RBI and EC opposed the electoral bond scheme itself….RBI wanted to achieve the twin advantage of providing anonymity to the contributor and ensuring that consideration for transfers is through banking channels and not cash or other means. The concerns expressed by RBI to the form and not to the substance, cannot really advance the case of the petitioners.” Bhushan further alleged that the bond could be purchased by a person using white money and later transferred to somebody in black. The Court ruled out the scope of such a transaction as purchasers of bonds will have to comply with KYC norms and their identities are anyway known to the State Bank of India, which issues the bonds. If a company makes a donation through electoral bonds, the Companies Act requires financial statements of registered companies to be filed with the Registrar of Companies. Further, the scheme also mandates political parties to file audited statements of accounts each year with the Election Commission. “Therefore, it is not as though the operations under the scheme are behind iron curtains incapable of being pierced…All that is required is a little more effort to cull out such information from both side (purchaser of bond and political party) and do some `match the following’,” added the bench. Clause 14 of the Electoral Bond Scheme introduced by way of amendments to the Finance Act and Representation of Peoples Act in January 2018 specifically prohibits trading of bonds. The Court cited this clause to allay Bhushan’s fears of subsequent transfer of bonds. Welcoming the order, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Nalin Kohli said: “Now that the honourable Supreme Court has decided in favour of the electoral bonds one hopes there will be closure to what was an unnecessary controversy on a good decision with regard to electoral funding.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, however, termed the bonds a “dubious money laundering operation”. “SC must expose #ElectoralBonds for what they have become-: 1. A dubious money laundering operation to help one party. 2. A veiled mechanism to legitimize quid-pro-quo deals. 3. An untraceable funnel for black money payments. If not now, then when?,” he tweeted.ADR Founder Jagdeep Chhokar said, “The judgment is disappointing. The interim arrangement on which the Court has relied is unworkable. The EC cannot know the donors of these bonds received by political parties. Further, the Court has said that information about the donors can be known by making a little effort. if this information can be found then why can’t it be made available in public domain. We hope this order does not impact our petition pending on the larger questions of law challenging these bonds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-plea-against-sale-of-electoral-bonds-101616783791539.html
27-03-2021||India||Battle for the east kicks off in 1st phase of voting today||Kolkata/Guwahati: Kicking off this season of assembly elections, voters in two of India’s largest eastern states, West Bengal and Assam, in substantially tribal-dominated districts, will begin the process of electing their local representatives on Saturday, with major national and regional parties — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress, and Trinamool Congress (TMC) — engaged in an intense battle to win or retain power. The polls in Bengal will see Mamata Banerjee’s TMC attempt to defend its turf against a resurgent BJP, which won 18 of the 42 seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and has emerged as the primary challenger. In Assam, it is the BJP which is seeking to win retain power, as a coalition of the Congress and Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front challenge the Sarbananda Sonowal-led government. Political observers believe that the outcome in the elections in the east will determine if the BJP’s hegemony remains intact despite governance challenges in recent months, including due to the pandemic, or whether non-BJP forces are able to ensure a wider distribution of political power. It is also expected to shape the future of Centre-state relations, with the BJP campaigning on the idea of a “double engine growth” — of having the same party in power at both the Centre and in the two states — and non-BJP forces claiming that their victory is essential to check what they see as the BJP’s centralising and undemocratic alliances. Commenting on the significance of the polls, political scientist Neelanjan Sircar of Ashoka University and the Centre for Policy Research said, “The results of the Assam and West Bengal election will have major reverberations across India. The BJP has had a rough few months, with the farmers protests and publicity around a democratic breakdown. It is seeking a strong electoral performance in these states to change the narrative. This is why we have seen so many visits from senior BJP leaders to the region, particularly West Bengal, along with a very aggressive campaign. If on the other hand, the Congress can give a fight in Assam and the TMC wins against all odds, it will signal a new era of opposition with Mamata Banerjee as the most important opposition leader.” In Bengal, where polls are spread out over eight phases, voting will take place in 30 of the state’s 294 assembly seats in parts of five western districts — East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Purulia, Bankura and Jhargram, of which the last four are part of the Jangalmahal region. A hotbed of Communist Party of India (Maoist) activities in the final years of the Left Front regime, which lost power in 2011, Jangalmahal is home to the biggest chunk of the state’s tribal population. Bengal’s scheduled tribe (ST) population stood at 5.29 million during the 2011 census, accounting for about 5.8% of the total population. Banerjee is banking on her decision to create welfare boards for all major tribal communities such as the Santhals, Lodhas and Kurmis, and development projects, including new roads, hospitals, schools and polytechnic colleges. But the BJP, which did well in this region in the 2019 polls by winning five Lok Sabha seats, is banking on acute deprivation as well as tribal discontent against the TMC. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and Banerjee have held back-to-back rallies over the past few weeks, promising jobs and development. To ensure peaceful polling on Saturday, the Election Commission has deployed 684 companies of central armed police forces. This region is also the political home of key BJP heavyweights, including state president Dilip Ghosh, who is an MP from West Midnapore, and Sisir Adhikari, father of Suvendu Adhikari — both father and son are new entrants to the BJP, with Adhikari senior winning from the Contai constituency of East Midnapore district in 2019.Both parties have, as is usual before polls, projected confidence. “We will sweep in the first phase. People will cast their votes in peace. They are with us,” Ghosh said on Friday. “I visited the region. We are ahead of others on the ground. The ruling party will do extremely well,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy. Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “The BJP performed very well in the Jangalmahal districts in 2019. The TMC’s fortune will depend on the amount of lost ground it has managed to recover since then.” Political scientist Sajjan Kumar, who has travelled to all the 294 constituencies of Bengal during his pre-election field research, said, “In the first phase, there is substantial SC, ST and OBC population with communities such as Bauri, Bagdi, Santhal and Mahto-Kurmis. This phase will show which way the Bengali Hindu subaltern vote will go, to the development-Hindutva pitch of the BJP or the welfare outreach of the Trinamool.” In Assam, 47 of the state’s 126 seats will go to polls on Saturday. Most of these seats are in the tea-rich districts of Upper Assam. The tea-tribe community, which comprises tea garden workers and former workers and their families, accounts for 17% of Assam’s population and its vote plays a decisive role in 35-40 seats. Because of the high number of seats and usually en masse voting by the tea-tribe community, the outcome of the first phase is crucial in determining which party or alliance will form the next government in the state. Considered a traditional Congress bastion in the past, in recent years, the BJP has been able to make inroads in the tea-tribe community with promise of scheduled tribe (ST) status, many welfare schemes for women, students, young people, and development projects such as the construction of roads, hospitals and schools in tea gardens. The BJP has also given representation to leaders of the community, and, currently , two Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP from Assam are from the community. One of them, Rameshwar Teli, is a minister in the Modi Cabinet. But despite its promise in 2016, the BJP hasn’t been able to give ST status to the community and increase daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹351. The Congress is trying to win back support of the community by promising to increase daily wages of tea garden workers to ₹365 if it comes to power. While the BJP is contesting 39 of the 47 seats in the first phase, its ally Asom Gana Parishad will contest in 10 seats (there is what is being called a “friendly contest” between the allies in two seats). The Congress will contest in 43 seats and newly formed Assam Jatiya Parishad in 41 seats. In 2016, the BJP-AGP combine won 35 of the 47 seats, and the BJP alone won 27 seats — close to half of its total strength of 60 seats in 2016. The Congress won just seven seats.“The BJP-AGP combine will win 42 of the 47 seats in the first phase,” predicted senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday. BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass earlier said that the party will also win several of the seven seats won by the Congress in 2016. The Congress expressed confidence that it will be able to drub the BJP-AGP combine in the first phase this time. “In 2016, the BJP and AGP dominated these seats. But in this election, the results will get reversed. The Congress will win around 30 plus seats in the first phase and will come to power with our allies,” Congress state president Ripun Bora said. Commenting on the significance of the first phase, Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University said: “The BJP promised to grant ST status to six communities in 2016. Five of them, Tai-Ahom, tea-tribes, Maran, Muttock and Chutia, have a sizeable presence in the seats that are in the first phase. The party wasn’t able to fulfil that promise. The BJP is now focussed on [issues such as ] a clash of civilisation and a cultural threat of Assamese identity with the idea of polarising voters. The party has been able to penetrate the tea-tribe vote bank, but during this campaign, the Congress has been to regain some trust of this community. The poll outcome in the first phase could spring some surprises.” Political scientist Sajjan Kumar said: “In Assam, the electoral significance of the issue of NRC-CAA will be tested as the poll-bound districts have been the hotbed of the Khilonjia (son of the soil) sentiment until recently. It will be a crucial test whether the BJP can override the Khilonjia factor by their successful coalescing of non-Ahom communities, the general Assamese, the tea tribes, the Gorkhas, the Indigenous tribes (Kacharis, Bodos, Mising, Doley etc.) against the anti-CAA pitch of the Ahom leadership, of the Congress, Raijor Dal (Akhil Gogoi) and Assam Jantiya Parishad (AGP), a breakaway group from the AGP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-for-the-east-kicks-off-in-1st-phase-of-voting-today-101616783670380.html

27-03-2021||India||Five charts that explain the upcoming elections||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on February 26 announced the schedule of assembly elections in four states – Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal – and the union territory of Puducherry. These polls will be held from March 27 to April 29 in eight phases. The results of the elections will be declared on May 2. Here are five charts which explain the forthcoming contest.The electorate’s profileThree out of the four states going to polls; Assam, West Bengal and Kerala are also the top three states by share of Muslims in the population. With 26.7% Muslims and 16.6% Christians, Kerala has the lowest share of Hindus -- to be sure, they are still a majority – among India’s important states. In terms of social composition, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) have a much bigger share in the southern states than West Bengal and Assam. While more than a third of West Bengal’s population is made up of Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) have at least a 15% share in Assam’s population.Can the BJP finally make inroads on the east coast?The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has gained a foothold, even captured power in many new regions after its 2014 success. India’s north-eastern states and Haryana are the biggest examples of this. However, one region where the BJP has still not been able to achieve success at the level of assemblies is India’s eastern coast. From West Bengal to Tamil Nadu, the BJP’s seat share in assemblies is among the lowest in India. After having won more than 40% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal and stitched an alliance with the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu, the BJP is hoping to capture power on the eastern coast for the first time.Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam are very crucial for the CongressThe states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam account for 13% out of the 543 seats in Lok Sabha. However, these three states accounted for 50% in the 52 Lok Sabha seats the Congress won in the 2019 elections. This one statistic captures the importance of this election cycle for the Congress. While the Congress is a junior partner of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in Tamil Nadu, it is the leader of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala and is allying for the first time with the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), a party with mostly Muslim supporters, in Assam. The Assam alliance is a calculated risk as it could alienate the non-Muslim supporters of the Congress. A simple addition of Congress and AIUDF vote shares since 2014 Lok Sabha elections shows that its reach has anyway been coming down.Can the DMK and AITC retain their dominant regional party positions?One of the defining features of post-2014 politics in India has been the decline of Congress, Left parties and Mandal based formation in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu have emerged as an important source of anti-BJP MPs in the Lok Sabha. DMK and the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) are the biggest parties after the Congress which consistently oppose the BJP in the parliament. Their combined strength of 45 is just seven less than that of the Congress. While the AITC suffered serious reverses in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections – its seat tally came down from 34 to 22 – the DMK led alliance swept Tamil Nadu winning 38 out of the 39 seats. Their performance in these elections will have important implications for their status not just in the states but also in national politics.It is do or die for the CPI (M) in KeralaIf the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or the CPI(M) led Left Democratic Front (LDF) fails to retain the state of Kerala, it will mark a new low in the Left’s declining fortunes in Indian politics. Ever since it captured power in West Bengal in 1977, the CPI(M) has always led a state government in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura since then. With the CPI(M) staring at irrelevance in West Bengal and marginalisation in Tripura, Kerala is the only bastion left. To be sure, Kerala has alternated between the LDF and UDF since 1980. The LDF’s rout in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections -- it won just one of the 20 Lok Sabha seats -- suggested an imminent defeat for the CPI (M) in 2021. However, a bounce-back in the local body polls held in December 2020 have raised the CPI (M)’s hopes about its chances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-charts-that-explain-the-upcoming-elections-101614368604993.html
27-03-2021||Today's||The Taste by Vir Sanghvi: Seven things we forget about the Bangladesh crisis||I was at school when the Bangladesh crisis erupted. But I remember it as though it was yesterday. Sadly, the generations after ours seem to have forgotten what it was like and look at it from the prism of today’s polarised politics.This was driven home to me when a controversy broke out over the Prime Minister’s claims, made in Dhaka, that he had participated in a satyagraha in favour of the creation of Bangladesh. His supporters took the statement to mean that he had played some role in the creation of Bangladesh. And his critics pounced on his remark to point out that he had no role to play during the crisis and that he was trying to appropriate the credit that was due to Indira Gandhi.This is such a 2021 controversy that it ignores what India was really like in 1971. In fact, it was a very, very, different India.Here are some things I remember about that period.1) In an age when everything is seen in India-Pakistan terms, it is important to remember that the Bangladesh crisis was not used by the government of the day to mobilise jingoistic anti-Pakistan sentiment.Yes, the Pakistani army were the murderers of women and children --- there was no getting around that. But Indians were more concerned with the victims than we were with their oppressors.In 1971, most of India saw the East Pakistan/Bangladesh crisis for what it was: a massive human tragedy, a genocide even. The Bengalis of what was then East Pakistan were raped, murdered, tortured and thrown out of their homes. Entire villages were destroyed. Students had the blood drained out of them to meet the needs of the Pakistani army.This is what we focussed on. Not on India-Pakistan jingoism.2) Contrary to how both the BJP and Congress often portray that period, war was not India’s preferred option.Indira Gandhi spent several months contacting world leaders (often travelling to their countries to meet them) to ask them to get Pakistan to end the oppression of its Bengali population. She got vaguely sympathetic responses. But nobody did anything. Basically, the world was content to stand by and let the massacres continue.3) We had an additional problem. At least 9 million refugees from the terror in East Pakistan crossed the border into India. We gave them food and shelter. The government raised additional taxes and levies to cope with the refugee influx. The Indian people paid them uncomplainingly, not because we were concerned with the politics. But because we knew it was about being human and decent.4) We know now that a large population of the refugees were Hindus who had been driven out. Apparently, all top politicians (across parties) and civil servants knew this. But a decision was taken not to make this fact public.You can understand Indira Gandhi’s interest in not creating a communally volatile situation in India. But the opposition (even the Jan Sangh of AB Vajpayee) went along with this.Everyone recognised that when a human tragedy of this magnitude was unfolding on our doorstep, it would be madness to provoke communal tensions in India. Would that happen today? I wonder.At a time when the Bengal election campaign has become so communally polarised, we tend to forget how all Bengalis --- Hindus and Muslim – reacted as one during the massacres in Bangladesh.The Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden, New York which brought global attention to the situation was organised by George Harrison at the urging of his friend Ravi Shankar.Harrison wrote a song about Shankar’s feelings. “My friend came to me/with sadness in his eyes/he told me that he wanted help/before his country dies”.His country? Shankar was Indian. But he was also a Bengali. For Bengalis on both sides of the border the terror was an assault on Bengali identity (and Bengali lives). Nobody said that Muslim Bengalis were different from Hindu Bengalis. Nobody called them ‘termites’!That notion of Bengali identity is worth pondering. In 1971 there were many people with memories of the horrors of Partition. But they still identified with Bengalis across the border. Would that happen, say, with Punjabis?It may be a coincidence of timing but the Prime Minister’s visit to Bangladesh to celebrate its creation when elections are being held in Bengal may help the BJP.5) In that era, the Opposition and the government usually united on matters of foreign policy and defence. When Narendra Modi says he participated in a satyagraha, he is probably telling the truth. There were peaceful demonstrations all over India, organised by all political parties (including the Jan Sangh) to protest the terror in Bangladesh and to encourage India to formally recognise the new country. These were not anti-government demonstrations. Mrs. Gandhi even encouraged the protests to draw attention to the genocide the world was ignoring and to the depth of feeling in India.6) It was not easy for India to go to war. The United States (which had a Republican President, by the way, for those who claim that Republicans administrations are always good for India!) was bitterly opposed to India. Mrs. Gandhi was snubbed by President Nixon and according to recently released tapes, abused by him behind her back.The White House ignored the desperate messages sent by the US Ambassador to India and backed Pakistani’s military dictatorship. India was told to desist from any military action.When Mrs. Gandhi went ahead anyway, the US sent the Seventh Fleet to the region to intimidate her. Nixon continued in office till August 1974 and his hatred for India cast a shadow over the Simla summit and all the other events that followed the Indian victory.7) By breaking Pakistan into two, Mrs. Gandhi achieved the most important strategic victory in the history of independent India. But two things are worth remembering. That was a very different India. It was completely united. Not just all communities but also the entire political establishment.And second, though Mrs. Gandhi swept the assembly elections that followed in 1972, just a year after that, her mandate had begun to wither and by 1975 she could only survive by declaring the Emergency.You need peace, unity and harmony within the country to win a war. And even then, war is not enough to make people forget their domestic difficulties.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-by-vir-sanghvi-seven-things-we-forget-about-the-bangladesh-crisis-101616839678618.html
27-03-2021||Today's||2021: A rupture in Tamil Nadu politics||Every election is different but the coming assembly elections in Tamil Nadu — the state goes to polls in a single phase on April 6, and the results will be declared on May 2 — are especially different.They are different because incumbent chief minister (CM) Edapaddi K Palaniswami, 66, of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), and Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin, 68, of the Dravida Munnetra Kazgaham (DMK) are both debutants in a way. This is surprising not just because of their age, but also experience — Edapaddi, or EPS as the CM is popularly known, was first elected to the assembly in 1989, having entered politics as a member of the AIADMK in 1974, and Stalin, was first elected to the assembly in 1989, having been elected to the general committee of the DMK in 1973. In the six assembly elections since, EPS didn’t contest one, won thrice and lost twice; Stalin lost once, and won five times (in a row). They are both debutants because their parties have never fought an assembly election under their leadership. In 2016, J Jayalalithaa led the AIADMK to a second successive win (she died in December that year); the DMK was led by party patriarch and Stalin’s father, Muthuvel Karunanidhi, who, at 92, was the party’s unambiguous leader and chief ministerial candidate (he died in 2018).Sure, Stalin led the party to a sweep in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019 — the DMK-led United Progressive Alliance in the state won 38 of the 39 seats on offer — but this will be the first assembly election in which he is heading the party, although his position as Karunanidhi’s heir was settled within the party as far back as 1994 (with the exit of Vaiyapuri Gopalsamy or Vaiko), and within the family in 2014 with the expulsion of his elder brother MK Alagiri from the party. And sure, EPS, a surprise choice as CM — he was picked by Jayalalithaa’s friend and companion VK Sasikala in the scrum that followed the former’s death — quickly established himself; struck a powerful alliance with his one-time rival O Paneerselvam; expelled his mentor, Sasikala, from the party; convinced her, perhaps with some help from ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to stay away from the election; and over the past few years, has acquired the reputation of a good administrator, but will be leading his party into an assembly election for the first time.Stalin is counting on the party’s organisational strength, his dynastic advantage (yes it is real; just as it is for his son, who is making his debut this election), anti-incumbency against the AIADMK, and the latter’s significant internal issues which may have been far-too-recently resolved to make a difference in this election.EPS is hoping that his stint as CM (he has managed to come across as a bit of a people’s CM), Stalin’s lack of experience running the state, the resolution of internal differences within the party, and the blessings of India’s political hegemon, the BJP, will be enough to bring him back to power. If that doesn’t happen, Sasikala is waiting in the wings to take over. The elections are also different because for the first time since 1967, when the DMK, then headed by C N Annadurai or Anna (Karunanidhi was his deputy) came to power in the state, the elections are happening in the absence of iconic larger-than-life leaders who pretty much defined Dravidian politics for five decades. Anna died in 1969 and Karunanidhi, who had already made his name as a scriptwriter for Tamil movies, succeeded him. In 1972, matinee idol and Karunanidhi’s friend, M G Ramachandran, broke away from the DMK to form the AIADMK, which came to power in the state in 1977. From 1977 to his death in 1989, MGR and his party were invincible. After his death, the party was headed by his protégé and co-star in Tamil movies Jayalalithaa. Between 1989 and 2011, the two parties (starting with the DMK), alternated in power, till Jayalalithaa broke the cycle by leading the AIADMK to a win in 2016. But none of them is around in this election. Karunanidhi was 45 when he first became CM; MGR, 60; and Jayalalithaa, 43. EPS was already the oldest first-time CM of the state when he took over in 2017. Now, if opinion polls are accurate, this distinction will fall on Stalin. It will be a generational change in the state, but 66 and 68 are not usually the ages one would associate with that term.The polls are also different because the BJP is contesting as a partner of the AIADMK in the state elections for the first time. In 2016, the party, which has always had an insignificant presence in the state, contested all 234 seats and won none (it received 2.86% of the vote share). This time, it is contesting 20 seats. The BJP has been hamstrung by its image in the state — as a North Indian party of Hindi speakers and Brahmins. It has consciously tried to move away from that image in recent times, adopting in Tamil Nadu the same strategy that worked for it in Uttar Pradesh, and which helped it get a start in West Bengal. This involves appealing to Hindus belonging to the most-backward classes and scheduled tribes, those that haven’t necessarily benefited from the politics of affirmative action (and Tamil Nadu is a case study in that), although, thanks to the state’s social development metrics, this section is still better off in Tamil Nadu than in most other states. Still, it will be interesting to see if this makes any difference.PS: Chanakya would be amiss if he didn’t mention the Congress, which is contesting 25 seats as an ally of the DMK. It ruled the state till 1967, but has since become weaker with every passing election. In 2016 too, it was an ally of the DMK, but won only eight seats, a fifth of the 41 it contested, dooming the larger partner (which won half the 178 seats it contested) to another stint in opposition. That may have been a factor in the DMK playing hardball with seats this election.letters@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/2021-the-rupture-in-tamil-nadu-politics-101616835097498.html
27-03-2021||Today's||The unusual tale of a Pakistani diplomat in India||To William Congreve is attributed the aphorism “Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned”. That’s also true of a spurned ambassador. Abdul Basit’s account of his three years as Pakistan’s high commissioner (HC) in India, aptly called Hostility, is suffused with hurt and smacks of revenge. No doubt, teeth are gnashing in Islamabad. They’ll soon be drowned by chortling in Delhi. The book starts with an account of how Nawaz Sharif told Basit he would be Pakistan’s next foreign secretary. But he never got the job. Nor any explanation. Delhi was the consolation prize. So, a wounded and humiliated man became Pakistan’s HC in March 2014. This sad story explains everything that followed.It’s hard to tell on whom the greater share of Basit’s wrath falls. Of Sharif, prime minister (PM) right through Basit’s tenure, he writes: “Sharif was overly inclined to pander to India unilaterally and unconditionally”. He even suggests the PM’s emotions were conflicted: “I could see that Sharif had an emotional attachment to India and Indians which, at times … went beyond his stature as the Prime Minister”. Of Sartaz Aziz and Tariq Fatemi, Sharif’s special assistants, he’s not even polite. He calls them “brazenly apologetic and improvident”. “One thing that particularly struck me was their accepting (Narendra) Modi’s contentions readily and working quickly to assuage his concerns,” he writes. “They wanted to deliver no matter what”.He doesn’t state it but the conclusion is obvious. Basit believes Sharif, Aziz, Fatemi and then foreign secretary, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, were willing to compromise Pakistan’s interests. I can’t think of any diplomat who has targeted his government and colleagues so directly and brutally.However, it’s the details that I find riveting if, at times, unbelievable. It seems Sharif and the foreign office either didn’t like or trust Basit. “I was considered to be an outsider … my own Ministry would prefer to conduct relations with India through its High Commissioner in Islamabad and would not even keep me posted”. When Sharif replied to a letter from Modi, it was given to the Indian HC, not Basit, thus denying him a chance to meet Modi. When Sharif and Modi agreed to meet in Paris, Aizaz was instructed not to inform Basit. Pakistan’s PM didn’t want his HC in the loop. That happened again when Modi visited Lahore. Basit was in the country but wasn’t included in the meeting. His presence wasn’t necessary.Things came to such a sorry pass that a junior officer in Islamabad told him that “the Foreign Secretary had instructed them not to send any communication to the High Commissioner in Delhi without his permission”. Basit reveals Pakistan frequently preferred the good offices of the industrialist Sajjan Jindal. He, not Basit, arranged phone calls between the PMs, advised on prisoner releases, conveyed Modi’s messages not to meet Hurriyat, facilitated their meeting in Paris and was involved in the Kulbhushan Jadhav matter. At such times, Basit was unaware of what was happening.So, on top of the humiliation of the foreign secretaryship, Basit was repeatedly insulted by his own government and his service colleagues. Yet the amazing thing is he took it on the chin. He refused to resign. He comes across as a sucker for punishment who swallowed his honour to continue in Delhi. Why?My guess is Basit wanted to stand up to Modi at a time he felt no one else was willing to do so. He hints at this when he writes: “I … was not willing to pander to Modi at the cost of Kashmir”. He seems to confirm it when he adds he tried to convince his government “we should dispense with our delusional unilateral approach in the hope that Modi was some sort of a saint who would reciprocate and accommodate our concerns”.Basit was the least liked Pakistan HC and the most disrespected by his own government. But he wasn’t deterred by that. His book is written with “hostility” to both.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-unusual-tale-of-a-pakistani-diplomat-in-india-101616834557386.html
27-03-2021||Today's||For migrant workers, a year of suffering||March 25th marked the first anniversary if the national lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic. The nation was only given a notice of four hours, and panic ensued. Because incomes turned uncertain and transport services were suspended, hundreds pf thousands of migrant workers started to walk home over the following weeks. The great exodus from the cities showed the insecurity of the lives of migrant workers. Migrant workers, often, get no security from the State. Among them are brick-kiln workers who live amid the forest of tall chimneys belching smoke between Badri and Jhajjar in Haryana. The state recently announced a measure protecting jobs for citizens of Haryana but provided no protection for the migrants. I reported on the plight of the brick-kiln workers some three years ago, and went back very recently to see how they had survived the lockdown. The brick kilns are antiquated, and their business model is dependent on a plentiful supply of cheap labour. As soon as I got out of my car, a group of men, women and children who mould bricks by hand and lay them out to dry before baking gathered. They were from Bihar’s Gaya district. One small boy had no trousers, and a girl was playing with a dead mouse. The workers were housed in hovels with barely room to stand up. The walls, made of loose bricks, bulged dangerously. The tin roofs trapped the heat. Workers told me there was one hand-pump for one hundred families, no drinking water and no lavatories. Yet, they continued to live in these miserable conditions because there is no work in Gaya.There was no work between March 2020 and February 2021 in the brick-kiln; the workers earned no wages in those months because they are paid on a piece-work basis. The government’s minimum wage provides little protection. During the lockdown, employers gave each family ₹1000 every 15 days to buy food, but that money was to be deducted from their earnings when they were paid. A thousand rupees didn’t go as far as it should have, because their ration cards were registered in Bihar and they were not aware of the new provision on portability of ration cards.When I asked whether government officials came to ask about their welfare, a worker replied, “Official come but they only speak to the manager they don’t meet us.” The manager was present throughout my inteview but he never contradicted the workers. The only encouraging development I saw was a young woman teaching a large group of children, sitting on the ground under a tree. She was not a government teacher, but belonged to a civil society organisation.Why is manufacturing so heavily dependent on exploited labourers, who are effectively bonded workers? There have been campaigns against child labour and bonded labour ever since I can remember. Kailash Satyarthi won the Nobel Peace Prize for his campaigns against the exploitation of children, but children still work alongside their parents in brick-kilns. There are laws regulating the employment of migrant workers but they are not enforced. Do the bric-kilns survive because of the corruption of India’s bloated Inspector Raj ? Are brick-kiln workers perhaps ignored because they are not voters in Haryana? Then again maybe the renowned linguist, philosopher, and social activist Noam Chomsky was right when he said, ”What is striking in India is the indifference of the privileged.”The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/for-migrant-workers-a-year-of-suffering-101616834442149.html
27-03-2021||Today's||How India can meet the China challenge||China’s military aggression in Ladakh, which continues to date, led many of us to ask: How does India respond to and meet the China challenge? Based on our discussions at the Pune International Centre (with Raghunath Mashelkar, Vijay Kelkar, Ganesh Natarajan and Ajit Ranade), we have offered Indian policymakers our ideas in a paper titled Strategic Patience and Flexible Policies: How India Can Rise to the China Challenge.Our armed forces have responded magnificently in the immediate and near term. However, the India-China relationship is a long-term game, which is not merely about military affairs but also about economics, science, technology and innovation. One of the reasons for Chinese aggression toward India is the huge discrepancy in economic, military and national power, which has emerged between the two over the past decade. In the short-run, India will have to build balancing coalitions with like-minded countries. Quad is one example. There are three groups of countries we can contemplate for such coalitions: Major democracies of the world; countries bordering China; and India’s neighbours. The United States (US), Japan, France, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Russia spring to mind. There are roughly 20 such countries. India needs to build deep partnerships with these coalitions of nation-States, going beyond treaties and agreements to forge linkages between peoples and institutions. Education, travel and tourism, cooperation among scientists and innovators need to be nurtured. Good partnerships are grounded in give-and-take, where each country reshapes its domestic policy in ways that are favourable to the other. India will have to rise to this challenge, and go beyond being wedded to a narrow vision of strategic autonomy. There is a debate about protectionist measures that will harm Chinese exports or investments in India. A significant proportion of those moves are self-defeating. There is a case for three groups of restrictions: Limit companies controlled by the Chinese State from a controlling stake in a hotlist of sensitive infrastructure assets; steer clear of Chinese-controlled technological standards; and block surveillance of Indian persons. India must aim not for a “China less” economy, but for one in which we have “less China”.Strategic planners in Indian firms need to rethink business plans in the light of these complexities. In some areas, where China-centric sourcing and technological dependence can elevate business risk, a selective retreat from economic engagement with China, and increased emphasis upon the global market, is optimal. In other areas, India can become the dominant alternative to the China-centric supply chains of the past, addressing the desire of global firms to reduce their exposure to China.We visualise the distinct possibility that India can roughly match China’s strength in about 20 years. This is not wishful thinking, and it is not predicated upon China stumbling in its current growth path. It requires reversing the Indian growth malaise of the post-2011 period and foundational change in public policy frameworks around three main ideas: Decreasing the scale of government micro-management of the economy, slowing and reversing what is currently an expanding administrative State; and countering the growing erosion of the rule of law.A critical element of the journey lies in innovation policy. India needs to match and improve upon China’s achievements in fostering research institutions and intellectuals that inhabit them. By 2047, if we can maintain 8% GDP growth per annum, then India will be a $64-trillion-dollar economy in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms. In the same period, if China grows at 5% per annum, it will be a $86-trillion economy in PPP terms. In other words, the current mismatch will reduce significantly.Becoming an advanced economy has always been India’s objective. What has changed in recent years is Chinese hostility, which has given fresh urgency to solving our growth malaise, learning how to be a mature market economy located in a liberal democracy. The judicious use of self-reliance (atmanirbhar), grounded in self-confidence (atmavishwas), where a confident India engages with the world without insecurity, forms alliances with like-minded countries, and leverages democracy and a skilled workforce to good effect, is the path through which the China challenge can be addressed.Gautam Bambawale is a retired diplomat and served as ambassador to China.
