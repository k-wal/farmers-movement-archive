This direction came after the judges were informed by advocate Manu Chaturvedi, standing counsel for the EDMC, that unions have sent a notice for resuming their strike, demanding salaries despite all salaries being cleared till January.The EDMC also sought action against “miscreants” who were “illegally waylaying garbage removal trucks, threatening drivers and dumping garbage openly on the roads and streets”.The court issued bailable warrants of ₹20,000 each against the president and secretary of MCD Swacchta Karamchari Union while noting that they have not joined the proceedings despite several communications to do so.“Even on the last date (of hearing), attempts were made to contact them, but they did not join the proceedings. It appears to us that they are seeking to evade these proceedings and that cannot be countenanced. Issue bailable warrants against the president and the secretaryof ₹20,000 each to be executed through the SHO,” the court said in its oral order.The bench, during the proceedings, told Mukesh Kumar, representing All Municipal Corporations Staff Union, that while the court is cognizant of the issues and has been passing orders to ensure timely disbursal of salaries to the workers of the municipal corporations, it cannot allow them to take law into their owns hands and spread “anarchy”.Questioning the actions of the striking union to hold under siege the civic body office and dump garbage on the streets, the court said this is not a solution and workers should behave responsibly as they are doing an important job. “We are cognizant about your problems and have been passing directions to release your salaries. But it is a very wrong thing to spread anarchy, gherao the office, dump garbage on the streets and obstruct the employees who are wanting to perform their official duties. We will not tolerate this,” the court said.“We have also made it clear to him (Kumar) that under no circumstances will this court tolerate any action which tantamounts to taking law into their hands like spreading garbage and preventing those people who are wanting to attend duty despite a strike,” the bench noted in its order.Kumar told the court that he has not received his salary for the past three months, even as the EDMC counsel claimed that the enumerations have been given till January. Advocate Suman Chauhan, appearing for the unions, told the court that even if the sanitation workers have been paid, the supervisor and some others have not been paid their salaries and pension. The strike by sanitation workers of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which began on January 15 demanding the payments of salaries pending since December 2020, was called off on February 5, after the EDMC cleared all dues.However, the EDMC on Thursday told the court that they have again received a notice for resumption of the strike. The matter would be now heard on April 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-issues-warrants-against-sanitation-union-office-bearers-after-they-miss-hearings-101614882407304.html
04-03-2021||Pune||Students demand improvements in exam process after 2020 experience||Students affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts are once again worried about the forthcoming first semester examination. After the fiasco in last year’s exam and results through the agency, students are now demanding to appoint an agency that is efficient enough to carry out the exam process smoothly. “The SPPU administration is not taking the right decisions at the right time due to which careers of thousands of students are affected. Every time during the examination period, students are facing problems and technical issues, right from the online application, fee payments, then while appearing for the exams and finally with the results. Thousands of students have suffered mentally and in academics as well in the last year’s exams. So, while giving the contract to any outside agency, the SPPU administration should check their ability and efficiency to conduct the exams in online and offline modes. If students face the problems once again in this exam, then we are going to do an aggressive protest against the SPPU administration,” said Kamlakar Shete, Pune city vice-president of the Yuvak Kranti Dal. Last year, from October 12, 2020, SPPU conducted its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day onwards, both online and offline students faced a lot of issues while appearing for the exam and it even continued in the results. For the offline exams, 113 centres were identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik, and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a one-hour duration. Whereas now after the admissions for graduate and post-graduate courses, several students have reported facing technical issues, difficulties in filling up the application form and even during the online payment for first semester exams. Students have repeatedly complained about these issues to their concerned colleges and even the university examination department, however, no solution has been given. “Last year I faced several issues while appearing for the exams in online mode, in some of the subjects I was directly failed despite appearing for it. Then while getting the result also I had to fight to get revised results from the SPPU examination department. So now SPPU administration should be extra careful while conducting the first semester exams,” said Shantanu Bhosale, a final year commerce student. SPPU vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “We are working on appointing the agency for the first-semester examination and soon an appointment will be made which will efficiently work on conducting the online exams smoothly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-demand-improvements-in-exam-process-after-2020-experience-101614882285336.html

Like several other curious onlookers, the boy too was watching the earthmover in action when the mishap took place, the police said. Rajeev Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (outer north), said the earthmover driver fled the spot immediately after the mishap. “We have identified the driver and are making all efforts to arrest him,” said Ranjan. On Thursday, the family of the dead boy placed his body on the road outside Ambedkar Hospital and staged a protest. The boy, Vikram Das, lived with his parents and siblings in Shahbad Dairy. His father has been ill and out of work for the past many months. According to the police, the crane was hired by a private contractor to whom the drain construction work near the boy’s house was outsourced by a civic agency. It is learnt that the crane, during its operation, hit the boy, causing him to fall into the drain. According to the police, the crane then went on to dump the dug-up mud on him, completely burying him. Vikram’s father, Madhusudan Das, told a news outlet that the crane operator fled the scene immediately after the accident. “It took us 15 minutes to dig my son out. Had the crane operator been around to help, my son could have been quickly rescued and he would be alive right now,” he said. After being pulled out of the mud, Vikram was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. The police have registered a case of causing death due to negligence at the Shahbad Dairy police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/boy-watching-earth-mover-at-work-dies-after-dug-up-soil-is-accidentally-dumped-on-him-101614882286084.html

After the vaccination drive began for citizens, there has been a rush at centres but due to a lack of registration, some return back without taking a dose. Now, corporators have installed helping desks in their wards in different areas as well as in their own office to assist citizens. The PMC has begun vaccination in their 38 hospitals. there was a technical glitch on the CoWIN portal. Now, it has been cleared and it is working smoothly. As per the government order, citizens above 60 and those with co-morbidities above the age of 45 are eligible for Covid-19. However, citizens have to register on the CoWIN app. However, people are rushing to PMC’s vaccine centres without registration. Therefore, the PMC has made a provision for onsite registration. Now, corporators have come forward and installed help centres to assist people to register on the CoWIN app. Party workers have set up a laptop, printer to provide registration print receipt to citizens Prasanna Jagtap, local corporator of Sinhagad road areas of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said, “We are helping the PMC in assisting citizens to register on the CoWIN app. We are getting a good response. People are coming to our centre to register.” Manjusha Nagpure, BJP corporator said, “We have set up help centres. We clear their doubts and help them to register.

They can do that; it will help us.” Shewta Galande, local corporator of BJP in Wadgaonsheri area said, “In Vimannagar, there is no PMC primary health centre. Residents have to go to Wadgaonsheri and Shastrinagar area for vaccination. We have demanded to start a temporary vaccine centre in the Vimannagar area as there are a large number of senior citizens residing there.” “At present, we have set up a help line centre in our office to help people register and clear their doubts about vaccination,’’ she added. Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer of PMC said, “Each centre should have to vaccinate at least 100 people. We have decided to increase centres as per the public demand. But the vaccination should be given in the hospital only. There will be no temporary vaccination centre set up as per public demand. The Central government has given guidelines about the vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/corporators-set-up-helpline-centres-for-vaccination-registration-101614882226472.html
04-03-2021||Pune||Political leaders back weekly markets by vendors in run-up to polls||In an effort to gain political mileage in the upcoming civic polls, local corporators and various political party leaders are organising unauthorised weekly markets in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits.The state government ordered in 2017 to start a weekly market in the local self-government jurisdiction, however, instead of the farmers the local vendors have taken over the system.The Maharashtra agriculture marketing board promoted weekly markets so that farmers could directly sell their produce to consumers and avoid exploitation by middlemen. But it has not worked out as per the government’s intention. Local vendors are exploiting consumers with help of local political party workers and sitting corporators in the name of the weekly market. The PMC allotted open land to start markets and the first market began in Model colony in 2017; Corporators took the initiative and started weekly markets. As per the government order, the state agriculture marketing board, the Agriculture Products Marketing Committee (APMC) and the PMC are required to provide permission to start the markets. However, very few corporators and organizers (farmers’ groups) took permission from both agencies. Unauthorized weekly markets were flourishing in the city areas before the Covid-19 pandemic but were stopped due to strict restrictions and lockdown. In the unlock process, unauthorized markets once again started rising in different parts of city areas and it has gone to more than 100 places as per PMC officials. According to PMC statistics, there are more than 100 such markets operating across the city with the help of local corporators and political party workers. All corporators put up banners and flexes in chowks and prominent places to catch the attention of residents. Madhav Jagtap, head of PMC anti-encroachment department said, “All weekly markets are unauthorised, I have given instructions to all ward level officials and concerned anti-encroachment officials to take action on such markets. The concept was unique, but it has been corrupted. We have received complaints from residents as well as some corporators that most of the weekly markets are unauthorized and organised at the footpath. Local vegetable vendors are sitting in the weekly market.” He further said, “On this issue, there is a meeting scheduled at the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar’s office to discuss the issue.” Complaints of unauthorised markets As per PMC officials, farmers are no longer taking part in the weekly market. Local vegetable vendors sell agricultural produce and local political party workers and leaders charge a certain amount of fee from these vendors. They are using PMC open spaces and footpaths to organise these markets and make money. Amol Balwadkar, BJP corporator of Baner-Balewadi said, “In our area, there are only four official weekly markets that have taken permission from the APMC. However, there are around 20 markets operating in Baner, Balewadi and Bavdhan areas. Different political party workers and leaders have organised markets on footpaths and other open spaces without any permission. We have registered complaints to PMC officials about these unauthorised markets which are creating a nuisance to the public, pedestrians and spreading waste on the roadside.” Corporators claim PMC approval Arjun Jagtap, husband of BJP corporator Mukta Jagtap of Viman Nagar area said, “We organise weekly markets in Viman Nagar area. Farmers are selling their produce in the market and it is organised every Saturday. We have taken permission from PMC and it is organized near Symbiosis college premises.” Jyoti Gosavi, BJP local corporator of Hingne Khurd, Sun city Sinhagad road said, “We have started a weekly market in the Sun city area. We are getting a good response and PMC has given permission to conduct it.” New government order creates chaos As per 2017, the government had mentioned in the order that APMC should have to give permission to farmers’ group who approached them for permission. After verification, the APMC sent a letter mentioning the name of the group and areas to PMC to provide space to organise the weekly market. After the Covid-19 pandemic situation (November 2020), the state issued a new order and gave rights to the agriculture department to give permission to farmers’ groups. The letter of permission will be submitted to APMC which will give a recommendation letter to PMC to provide space to the weekly market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/political-leaders-back-weekly-markets-by-vendors-in-run-up-to-polls-101614882225853.html

04-03-2021||Pune||Private hospitals account for 303 vaccines in four days||Since March 1st, private hospitals in Pune have vaccinated only 303 beneficiaries at 10 sites across the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Whereas the government facilities inoculated 3,897 beneficiaries at 36 sites on Thursday across the city on the fourth day of vaccination. From March 5, the vaccination sites in the city will also be increased to 60. Three hospitals which are run by PMC will now have vaccination drives until 10 pm. In the last four days of vaccination for the third phase, the percentage of beneficiaries has seen a rise. On March 1, the total beneficiaries inoculated were 72 per cent in Pune district, whereas on Thursday it was 99 per cent in Pune district for the first as well as second doses. Speaking about the less turnout at private hospitals, Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC health chief said that the private hospital sites were introduced on Thursday. “That is why the turnout was less. Gradually with more publicity, the number will rise at private hospitals,” said Dr Bharti. There has been a gradual increase in beneficiaries. Speaking about the necessity of getting vaccinated, Dr Kalapana Baliwant, assistant chief at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department said that getting vaccinated is important to break the chain of transmission. “Most of the beneficiaries are getting the Covishield vaccine but many front-line workers still seem hesitant to take a jab as the numbers are low. However, getting vaccinated is important as it will break the chain of transmission and contain the pandemic,” said Dr Baliwant. She further added that for the third phase of vaccination, the vaccination centres have increased to 60 in the city. “At three PMC-run hospitals, we have extended the time for inoculation to 10 pm. So that high-risk patients can come take a jab at their convenience,” said Baliwant. There have been several issues with CoWin applications where mandatory registration must be done. Private hospitals have better infrastructure to inoculate the beneficiaries, noted Dr Baliwant. Dr Murlidhar Tambe, dean at BJGMC and Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) said that many senior citizens are getting jabs at the hospital. “Many citizens come to Sassoon to take a jab. There are many who want to inoculate here, we welcome them. We have full facilities to ensure the vaccination goes smoothly. Initially, vaccination should be given at government establishments to ensure that there is no misuse of the vaccinations,” said Tambe. However, due to technical glitches, the process of taking jabs is taking time. “There are several issues with the application. But we are working as much as we can to make the process easy and quick. However, for the server issues we are unable to inoculate more people. As there are several centres who try to feed the data at the same, there are technical issues that cannot be avoided at this moment,” said Tambe. Box Glitches continue on day 4 of vaccination. 73-year-old Kamala Thiruvengadam and her husband, 78-year-old NM Thiruvengadam came to Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) for their first dose of vaccination on Thursday at 9:30 am. However, they had to wait until 4:30 pm to get the jab. “We had come to the centre at 9:30 am and we had registered on our own. But after coming here, we had to take another slip and then wait in our line. Moreover, the server was down for three hours so the whole process took time,” said Kamala Thiruvengadam. 65-year-old Jayshree Panjikar visited SGH on Thursday for inoculation. She came to the hospital in the afternoon. “We had lunch and then came for the vaccination and we were inoculated exactly at 4:38 pm. We had to make a case paper at SGH which took time. But the whole system was very well maintained, and we are happy to take the jab,” said Panjikar. Panjikar visited SGH for the vaccine with one of her friends, 70-year-old Hair Nair. Both were happy to receive the jabs on Thursday. The Aundh district hospital also faced a similar problem with the inoculation drive. The vaccination drive was on the second floor of the building and senior citizens faced issues while reaching the centre. Box-- Total vaccination at sites.

04-03-2021||Other||Escape for survival, but no easy return to livelihoods||PUNE A daily gathering of workers under the flyover in Warje in the early months of 2021, is a sign that the construction industry is making an effort to revive itself. The lack of jobs coming their way was a sign of a struggle the industry faced during one of the most stringent lockdowns in the summer of 2020. Hundreds arrive at the “majdoor adda” (place to hire daily wage labourers), and live the story that started differently for most, but ended similarly for all labourers - with unemployment. If the lockdown prompted over 0.2 million migrant workers to leave the city, many returned within months, as the unlocking process began and various sectors including real estate and manufacturing started to return to normal. In October 2020, the estimate of the work force in the real estate sector in Pune was 75,500 workers, based on a number provided by Credai, a body representing real estate developers. Credai now estimates that 60% of the workforce has returned to construction sites with a count of 45,000 workers. According to a monthly survey for February released by MCCIA, number of employees working in micro, small, medium and large scale organisations in 100 firms in Pune district has moved up to 86%, while their production level has increased to 85%. Construction labourers formed a major portion of the lakhs of migrant labourers who were sent in special trains and privately organised buses from Pune with the help of the district administration and police. The families who lived in shanties of Gurunanak nagar atop a hill in Katraj were among those who experienced the turmoil of it all. They tried to leave in the dark of the day on foot, but were caught and sent back, forced to survive on rice plates amid a scarcity of water. There was no way of knowing when work would begin, the coffers of daily wage labourers were empty, and children cried constantly due to hunger. Almost a year later, in February 2021, the sight of cheer in the same locality filled the air, even as it has a shade of anxiety about another possible lockdown, after administration imposed restrictions in city. A visit to the labour camp in Katraj was a different experience in 2020 compared to February 2021. One-year-old Priyanka was oblivious to the financial and social stress her mother endured during the lockdown as their colony was situationally denied access to basic necessities like food, milk, and water. Malan Manik Jadhav (20), the baby’s mother, was happy to report in February that they were finally getting water to clean utensils and drink, but were struggling with food grains. “The situation has improved so much since the last time we met. So I feel afraid to even complain, but the food grains are running out. There is work now, but it is not as much as it used to be,” said Jadhav. The lockdown put multiple people out of employment - some were forced out of their chosen professions. A bouncer, a student of Science, a factory worker - all gathered in a space where they were left at the mercy of a labour contractor who failed to show up on more days than he did arrive. While all their life stories were wildly different from each other, essentially the problem remains the same: work has begun, but it is nearly not as much as it used to be. The Warje workers naka is a melting pot of hundreds of life stories. “I used to work as a bouncer after my graduation. I worked there for almost one year and then the lockdown happened. Work came to a complete standstill. A few months later when it began, the company started paying a laughable amount of salary or no salary at all. So I quit that job and now I come here looking for work,” said the bouncer, requesting anonymity. While the bouncer got the opportunity to complete his graduation with the funds that his road-side vegetable vendor parents could gather, there were others in the crowd who are not that fortunate. “My family is in Osmanabad and I come here for work which pursuing my second year in BSc from Latur University. I do not know what this past year would even mean academically. I know I cannot stop coming to work,” said Sachin Rathod (20), standing with his friends. After being asked questions about his education, the early morning furor was replaced by contemplation about his exam that is scheduled to commence on March 8, according to him. At a slight distance away from the young crowd stands Virappan Hanmant Manjulkar (53), a native of Bengaluru, who appeared distraught and cynical at the same time. He claims to have graduated from Raichur University with a BA in the 1980s. “My wife has been in the mental hospital for the past 14 years. We have daughter who is married. I do not know how the graduation helped me. I came here from Raichur looking for work and have been doing random jobs ever since,” said Manjulkar. According to Shailendra Pol, additional labour commissioner of Pune region, the department had taken every precaution to facilitate the return of workers during the last year. “We immediately started centres and released these phone numbers in the known labour circles and then the labourers started contacting us with their location and requirements. We collected the problems and connected them with local BDOs or the district collector’s office and tried to take care of their food and accommodation. The labour did not have any fund for such a huge operation. Therefore, NGOs were roped in and their help sustained the process. But at some point, most of them started moving on foot,” said Pol. “When the lockdown happened, Credai Pune collected ₹80 lakh and distributed food . When the government action started, the workers started leaving. I can guess that 40,000-45,000 workers have come back to the sites although this cannot be stated officially. We started a training course for workers from Solpaur, Kolhapur, Parbhani, for shuttering, carpentry, and mason work and promised a ₹10,000 payment, but surprisingly, not many came. We organised a competition among Credai Pune members to come up with ways to improve lives of these workers - major changes were made,” said Suhas Merchant, president of Credai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/escape-for-survival-but-no-easy-return-to-livelihoods-101614882165307.html
04-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad improves ‘ease of living’ ranking by 16 notches||Ghaziabad: Among 49 Indian cities with a population of more than a million, Ghaziabad has improved its ranking by 16 spots and emerged as the 30th best city in the Ease of Living Index 2020 (EoLI). The rankings were announced by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Thursday. Ghaziabad scored 54.31 EoLI points out of 100, while it scored 48.28 and secured 20th rank in ‘Municipal Performance Index’ (MPI) among the million-plus cities. The city ranked fourth in Uttar Pradesh after Lucknow, Varanasi and Kanpur, as per the EoLI. Officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said that the city had stood at 46th spot in EoLI 2019 and 33rd in terms of MPI. “Our performance has improved this year. We have been able to do a lot of work in terms of solid waste management, cleanliness and improving the overall outlook of the city. We intend to improve on higher scale in the next competition. Our ranking was marginally below the three other cities of the state,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The MPI was launched as accompaniment to EoLI and it seeks to examine local government practice in municipalities across areas of services, finance, policy, technology and governance, the officials said. In the EoLI, Ghaziabad lagged behind in parameters related to ‘health’ in which the city scored 47.11 below the national average of 50.32 and ranked 39, ‘recreation’ with score of 0.39 below the national average of 11.68 and ranked 47 and ‘environment’ with score of 32.86 below the national average of 45.41 and ranked at 44. “The health-care facilities were scaled up in past one year during the pandemic. We got our first government testing laboratory and other equipment like ventilators and high flow nasal cannula. As a result, we were able to tackle Covid issues successfully,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Officials of the Ghaziabad development authority said that more facilities and even new road projects will open up more vistas for recreational facilities. “The proposal of an international cricket stadium is still pending, and it will open up more facilities once the project goes through. We have lesser facilities in areas like Raj Nagar Extension and Loni. We will scale them up. We already have 100-acre city forest and another 10-acre city forest and two parks on theme of botanical garden are proposed at Madhuban Bapudham. A recreational facility at Bunkar Mart, spread over an area of 50,000 square metres, will also get complete this year,” said Asheesh Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner. He said that with commencement of proposed Regional Rapid Transit System project, besides opening up of Delhi-Meerut Expressway and Northern Peripheral Road, the city will see all-round development and more facilities in the next three years. The officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the municipal corporation recently received Rs60 crore funds under the Fifteenth Finance Commission. “This entire fund is for air pollution abatement measures. The corporation is chalking out a plan to deal with the air pollution. This will be implemented before winter season this year and will bring a lot of improvement,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist, said, “The rising pollution is a major concern for the city as levels have remained high across the country on many days in winter for past couple of years. More groundwork and effective enforcement is needed to tackle pollution.” According to the Union urban development ministry, a total of 111 cities (62 cities with less than million population) participated in the exercise. The EoLI is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of various initiatives for urban development. It provides a comprehensive understanding of city based on quality of life, economic ability of a city, and its sustainability and resilience.

Shubham, who tested positive for the virus on February 25, died at his hometown Begusarai on March 1.“We have so far tested 541 samples for SARS CoV-2 between March 1 and 3 of which nine were positive. We tested 441 new samples on Wednesday, and all were found to be negative,” said Dr Kumar.The state health authorities have sent samples of those who tested positive to a virology laboratory in Bhubaneswar.“We are trying to ascertain if this is a new strain of the virus or similar to the one in Mumbai and Kerala. The samples, which tested positive, have been sent to Bhubaneswar for strain mapping,” said associate professor of medicine Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, also the nodal officer for Covid-19 at NMCH.Doctors also suspect the medico who died may have contracted the virus from the nearby crowded market areas, where he, his batch mates said, had gone without wearing a mask.“All our classes and internal exams have been suspended till further notice. However, the first professional university examination of the Aryabhatta Knowledge University began on Thursday,” one of his batch mates said.NMCH principal Dr Hiralal Mahto said that as per order of principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit, all postgraduate and undergraduate classes had been suspended for a week. “We will have the exams after Holi festival when the students return from their hometown,” said Dr Mahto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-new-covid-19-cases-at-bihar-s-nmch-classes-stalled-exams-put-on-hold-101614880835584.html

The air quality of Noida had been oscillating between ‘poor’ and ‘severe’ category since February 07 and had improved to the “moderate” category on March 1. “Wind speed dropped in the region from over 15 kmph on Wednesday to eight-10 kmph on Thursday. The reason for the fall in wind speed is that the effect of the previous western disturbance is over now. A fresh western disturbance is expected over the weekend, which will likely lead to a rise in wind speed and light rains over the national Capital region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve by Friday afternoon. “Surface winds are low and forecasted to stay low for Thursday, and likely to pick up by Friday noon. The AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate; it may touch the ‘very poor’ category for the shorter period till Friday afternoon and sharply improve thereafter. ‘Poor’ to ‘moderate’ category AQI is forecasted for March 6 and 7,” said the SAFAR statement on Thursday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI of Noida on Thursday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 302 against 168 a day earlier.The AQI of Greater Noida was 298 against 189 a day earlier. The air quality index of Ghaziabad was 332 against 198 a day earlier. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature soared by two degrees in Noida while the minimum dropped. The higher maximum temperature resulted in a warm day. According to the IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida on Thursday were recorded at 32.9 degrees Celsius and 13.8 degrees Celsius, respectively, against 17.9 degrees Celsius and 30.8 degrees Celsius a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-slips-as-wind-speed-drops-in-noida-ghaziabad-101614881325260.html
04-03-2021||Noida||No plan to visit West Bengal before April 3, says Rakesh Tikait||Ghaziabad: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Naresh Tikait on Thursday said that he will not be going to poll-bound West Bengal anytime soon as he has programs lined up till April 3 in states like Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttarakhand and Odisha. “There are programs and rallies lined up till April 3 and thereafter we will go to West Bengal. Ours is an issue of farmers and we have no issues with elections. But we will go there and tell people about the performance of the government,” he said adding that the ongoing farmers’ agitation has turned into a jan andolan.Tikait had said that some people will go to West Bengal on March 15-16.On Thursday, he termed the Parliament “nayi mandi” (new market), telling farmers that this is so because prices and laws for crops are decided at the Parliament. During his earlier rallies in Haryana and Rajasthan, he had urged farmers to go to Parliament along with their tractors. Farmers’ protest at different borders of Delhi will complete 100 days on March 6 but no talks have been held between the farm union leaders and the government since late January. Tikait has been trying to garner support from farmers in different neighbouring states like Haryana and Rajasthan, telling them that they should be ready with their tractors to go to Delhi. “It is so because farmers do not get a good price for their crops and their situation will be subdued till the government brings in a law on minimum support price (MSP). I told them that they should learn agitation at home and should learn how to break barricades. We said that a new mandi has been opened at the Parliament as it is the place where the rate of crops and laws for them are decided. Even the Prime Minister says that farmers can sell their crops anywhere in the country,” Tikait said.“So, farmers should keep five quintals of ration in their tractor-trolleys and proceed to Delhi. If anyone tries to stop them midway, they should purchase that person’s crop on MSP. Otherwise, the crop will surely be purchased on MSP at the nayi mandi. If anyone stops them midway, they should put up tents and stage protest. This agitation will continue, and farmers will win before they go away from here,” he added. Over the issue of stalemate in talks with the government, Tikait said that it could be possible that the government was trying to see the results of the assembly elections in five poll-bound states and probably the results of panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh. “It may be possible that they are trying to gauge the effect of agitation on election or not. Thereafter they may talk to us, but we don’t know much as the government is a big entity,” he added. Detailing jan andolan, he said that people are facing issues of rise in prices, hike in fuel and even prices of LPG cylinders.“People are getting affected, and this agitation has turned into a jan andolan. The day is not far when women will also step out due to price rise,” he added.The farmers at UP Gate have been camping at the site since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of the three new farm laws and demanding a new law on MSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-plan-to-visit-west-bengal-before-april-3-says-rakesh-tikait-101614881265228.html

Earlier, a group of industrialists led by Tarun Jain Bawa, president of Bahadurke Road Textile and Knitwear Association, said that the project will not bear any fruit as it is based on a report that 735 mld waste is being discharged into the nullah everyday. However, the actual figure is over 2,000 mld as per a study conducted by experts from Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), he alleged.However, executive engineer of PSWWB, GP Singh, said, “The study has not been initiated due to the allegations levelled by the industry, but it is a routine process.” The team commenced the exercise from Jainpur village in Hambran Road and the process will continue for two days. As per information, the team will study both inflow and outflow of waste from the nullah at different points. Bawa demanded that the state government should conduct another study to check the flow of waste, otherwise a huge amount of funds will be wasted. He had also written to Prime MInister Narendra Modi’s office regarding the same. On January 12, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal had laid the foundation stone for the ₹650-crore project, to clean the Buddha Nullah. Authorities said that apart from upgrading the three existing STPs in Jamalpur, Bhattian and Balloke area, two new STPs at Jamalpur and Bhattiyan; two new effluent treatment plants for Tajpur Road and Haibowal dairy complex and interceptor line alongside the nullah will also come up under the project.Currently, the MC’s STPs are overburdened due to which the sewage is not being treated properly and untreated waste is polluting the buddha nullah, which further pollutes Sutlej river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iit-roorkee-team-starts-study-on-flow-of-waste-in-buddha-nullah-101614881205917.html

The rest of the sectors and villages will be connected with sewage systems soon,” he said.The authority in a press note said that there are around 10 lakh residents in different societies and villages in Greater Noida. “Besides residential, the city has also come up as an ideal business and industrial destination. In the next ten years, the population here will reach 25 lakh. GNIDA has been providing modern robotic services for cleaning sewage in urban and rural areas,” it said. The authority said it recently developed sewage networks in sectors Ecotech 6, Xu 2, Zu 3, Omicron 3, Mu 2 and Knowledge Park 2, while in rural areas, villages such as Ghodi Bacheda, Dabra, Emliya, Suthiyana Kulesra, among others, have been connected with the main sewage line.“Some manholes were dysfunctional. We got them repaired and connected them to the main sewage line to ensure there is no blockage or overflow,” Bhooshan said.The Authority also has an integrated control room where residents can call and file complaints regarding manhole blockage, overflow of water, etc. The control room can be reached on 8595810523 and 8595814470. Bhooshan said the complaints will be addressed within four hours. “If some major repair work is needed, the complainant will be informed accordingly,” he said.Local residents, meanwhile, claimed that manholes are still lying open in various areas, which they said leads to incidents such as animals falling in.Harinder Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta 1, said: “On February 23, a bovine fell into a manhole in Sector Gamma – 1. A few days ago, a dog fell into an open manhole. The authority needs to systematically fix the issue to avoid such incidents,” he said.Responding to this, authority officials, asking not to be named, said that at times manhole covers get stolen, which might lead to such incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/around-60-of-greater-noida-connected-with-sewage-system-say-officials-101614881025200.html

The 14 government hospitals administered the shots at no cost to 1,826 people. The rest got their shots in 20 private facilities after paying ₹250 each.”He attributed the better turnout to walk-in registration facilities at several government and private centres. Among those who got the vaccination were also people who got their first shot. The second shot will be administered after 28 days, as per government guidelines.Dr Rakesh Gupta, the director of the government institute of medical sciences (GIMS), said that 329 people were inoculated there. “Out of it, 312 got their first dose. Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) was reported among two of these beneficiaries,” he said. The AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation and reflects consequences for immunisation coverage and disease incidence.Among private hospitals, 170 people were vaccinated at Sharda hospital. Ajit Kumar, the joint registrar of Sharda institute of medical sciences, said that the walk-in registration resulted in better vaccination figures. “Except for five or six persons, the other beneficiaries got their registration done on the spot. Over half were senior citizens. The remaining were either 45-plus people with co-morbidities or doctors and paramedics who were not registered in the first list of health care workers, due to some technical reasons,” he said. In Kailash hospital, the vaccination was suspended over a technical glitch.GhaziabadIn Ghaziabad, 4,264 of 7,900 listed beneficiaries were vaccinated on Thursday. “Of them, 1838 were health care workers (HCWs) who received their second dose while the rest 2426 were phase-3 beneficiaries, 2,359 senior citizens and 67 with co-morbidities above 45 years of age,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.

Having access to a clean, hygienic washroom is one of the most basic requirements for them,” said Dr CB Jha, president of the Atta Market Traders Welfare Association.The requirement is also for a number of female shop owners in the area, he said. “The amenity is missing in Atta as well as in Sector 18. The Noida authority should soon take some action,” said Jha.The association has written a letter to the authority for the same. SC Mishra, senior project engineer (public health) of Noida authority, has forwarded the request to top officials of the authority. “They (traders) have been requesting for this for a while and it will greatly benefit women in the area,” wrote Mishra in his letter, a copy of which is with HT. In the letter, the senior project engineer has also said that a tentative space to build the toilet has also been identified.

04-03-2021||Noida||Stretch of Raj Nagar Extension to Indirapuram on Hindon elevated road opens||The Ghaziabad traffic police on Wednesday opened the 6-km stretch of the Raj Nagar Extension to Indirapuram carriageway on the Hindon elevated road. Another 5-km stretch of the road from Indirapuram to UP Gate remains shut.It was shut since November last year on the back of the farmers’ protest at UP Gate.The 10.3 km Hindon elevated road is a major link between Raj Nagar Extension and UP Gate with an estimated 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles using it every day on ordinary days. It linked Ghaziabad to Noida and offered a route to Delhi.After the route was shut, commuters were forced to use and congest routes via Mohan Nagar to reach CISF Road in Indirapuram from where they can travel to Noida below the Delhi Meerut Expressway. But, the opening did little to satisfy commuters.“It is certainly a relief, but then there is the 2-km stretch of the CISF Road to Delhi Meerut Expressway that remains dug up due to a pipeline project that had been going on for the last year,” said B K Pandey, a resident of Vaishali sector-5 who works in Ahimsa Khand, Indirapuram. “That road too needs to be fixed if we are to reduce the traffic problem.”As a result, moving to Delhi is still fraught with traffic snarls. The pipeline is a UP Jal Nigam project under a central government urban mission and is to carry treated water from three sewage treatment plants at Indirapuram to the Hindon river. The project was supposed to finish in July last year but was delayed due to the coronavirus induced lockdown. “The road relaying will go up to June or end of May. This is because the road was dug up to a depth of about 3.5 to 4 metres for laying big pipelines. At the base we have filled concrete and sand and a layer will come up soon which will at least make road motorable. However, the bitumen and blacktopping will take more time as we want to ensure that the filling settles down otherwise it may lead to breakage of the road,” said Amit Kumar, executive engineer from the UP Jal Nigam. “We have deployed our personnel to ensure smooth traffic on the road,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). Kushwaha said that the inner lanes of the Delhi Meerut Expressway stretch will remain shut from Vijay Nagar to UP-Gate. The traffic moving from Vijay Nagar to UP-Gate is presently diverted to sector-62 in Noida while there is an underpass a couple of hundred metres ahead which can take commuters to Indirapuram. “We thought of this option but the highway lanes of the DME have been barricaded at sector-62, Noida. If we open the barricades, commuters travelling to Indirapuram and even those travelling to Delhi will get mixed up and will finally reach Indirapuram. So, barricading at sector-62 will remain as it will be difficult to differentiate commuters moving to Indirapuram and those trying to go to Delhi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/stretch-of-raj-nagar-extension-to-indirapuram-on-hindon-elevated-road-opens-101614880845131.html
04-03-2021||Noida||Noida: 81 autos colour coded on first day of drive||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar traffic police on Thursday started registration of auto-rickshaws for colour codes aimed at easy tracking of their movement across the district. Officials said that they provided colour codes to 79 autos during the drive conducted at Noida Sector 37 and Pari Chowk. The drive will continue for the next 15 days, the officials said.Ashutosh Singh, Noida traffic inspector, said that 48 autos were registered and given codes in Sector 37 while 33 autos were registered at Pari Chowk on Thursday. There are three zones for autos in GB Nagar – Noida, Kasna and Dadri. An auto-rickshaw registered in Noida, for example, is permitted to ply only within a 16-km radius there, but this rule is frequently breached, the officials said. There are about 18,000 auto-rickshaws registered in the district. Besides, there are also nearly 2,000 autos permitted to ply in the national capital region (NCR).“The NCR autos are being colour coded with red, Noida autos blue, Kasna autos black and Dadri autos yellow. These colours are circular in shape while the codes are painted with white ink over them for better visibility,” Singh said. On Thursday, the traffic police made makeshift desks at the two locations for the drive. “The auto owner/driver is required to produce registration papers, fitness certificate, permit, driving licence, Aadhar card and vehicle owner’s photo,” Singh said. The traffic inspector said that the auto coding drive will continue for 15 days, after that they will launch an enforcement drive against uncoded autos. The traffic police will also digitalise the data for easy access.Manoj Pal, an auto driver residing in Noida Sector 45, said that he has been driving auto for seven years. “I came to know that the registration is mandatory to drive an auto in Noida. I produced relevant documents and was granted a code. I paid ₹40 to the painter as his remuneration. The entire process took almost an hour,” he said.Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (enforcement), who also attended the drive, said that the exercise will play an important role in regulation of traffic. “It will regulate the traffic and will also ensure that only verified and genuine vehicles ply in Noida and Greater Noida. The data will also be used in case a crime takes place in a vehicle,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-81-autos-colour-coded-on-first-day-of-drive-101614880785119.html

In the second incident, a minor from Bihar who had been brought to Noida a few months ago with promise of a job and marriage, was rescued from a guest house-turned-brothel in Sector 12 on February 27 while seven persons were arrested. Separate cases of human trafficking were registered for the incidents.“For now they seem to be isolated incidents; Noida doesn’t seem to have organised gangs involved in human trafficking. However, we are monitoring the situation carefully and teams have been formed at the police station-level to look into these cases,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Rannvijay Singh.He said that most of their input is coming through tip-offs from informants which helped bust these operations.Gautam Budh Nagar has a specialised anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) that receives less than ten inputs per month on average, said officials.“The Bihar incident in February-end seems to be a bit organised in nature. In light of this, our team has been instructed to remain on the lookout for such crimes through cyber platforms and social media. Our aim is to ensure that human trafficking doesn’t turn into an organised nexus in the district,” said DCP (women and child safety) Vrinda Shukla, who also heads the AHTU.She said that plans are underway to expand the team both in terms of infrastructure and manpower.“We are planning to start a separate, new office for the team and to include more women police personnel in it. Decoy customers will be used to infiltrate groups operating through the cyberspace,” said Shukla.Police officers also said that information is being gathered from suspects nabbed in the past to identify people who could be associated with human trafficking in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/police-turn-attention-to-eradicate-human-trafficking-in-gb-nagar-101614880725715.html

Kant, in town to inaugurate a robot manufacturing unit of Addverb Technologies in Sector 156, said that the country has reserved a berth for itself in the “sunrise sector” – sectors where innovation plays the most important role, like electronics, software and hardware technological solution.“It is really the best manifestation of the Make in India push that the country has an almost 75% share in export in the sunrise sector. Being a blend of software and hardware technologies, the field of robotics has a lot of potential to streamline processes across industries, right from retail to healthcare, from warehouse to supply chain. Having immense entrepreneurial potential and being adjacent to the national Capital, Noida may become the robotics’ capital of India,” he said.The 2.5-acre bot-valley inaugurated has a capacity to manufacture more than 50,000 robots per year of varied types and is equipped with the best-in-class machines. The company will use robots to manufacture robots, it said.Kant further said that technical advance is the need of an evolving world. “As technology is ever-evolving, there is always room for existing mechanics being replaced by newer tech. Time has come to focus on sectors such as robotics, drones, 5G, battery storage, solar manufacturing, satellites and genome sequencing, and to explore the huge latent potential in it,” Kant said.Emphasizing on the need to ensure quality Make in India products for the world, the Niti Aayog CEO said that quality control is the most important factor to compete with global commercial giants. “Indian entrepreneurs must never forget that Make in India is a ‘zero effect, zero defect’ product for the world.

04-03-2021||Gurugram||Nuh farmers to block Rewasan toll plaza on Saturday||Protesting farmers from Nuh on Thursday said that they would block the Rewasan toll plaza on Saturday along with farmers’ groups protesting at various borders of Delhi, who will occupy the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway, to mark Day 100 of protests at Delhi borders. Ramzan Chaudhary, head of Jai Kisan Andolan’s Nuh unit, said that farmers from various protest sites are set to gather across stretches of the KMP Expressway and block it for five hours between 11am and 4pm.“The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has given a call for blocking the KMP for five hours on Saturday. Farmers protesting at various points will reach the part of KMP that is closest to their protest site. We plan to block the Rewasan toll plaza in Nuh. Through this peaceful demonstration, we want to send out the message that the resolve of farmers is unshaken, and we will not give up till the three laws are rolled back,” said Chaudhary. Following the blockade of KMP on Saturday, a number of other programmes have been planned for the next week by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha as it attempts to scale up the agitation that has been ongoing since last year. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha —the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that the ongoing agitation had taken a national flavour over the past few months and that people from diverse groups are identifying with the farmers’ cause. “To further engage different groups in the ongoing agitation, a new cycle of events for the month had been planned by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha. Besides blocking the KMP, we will be observing Mahila Kisan Diwas on March 8. On March 15, a campaign against privatisation will be launched in support of trade unions and a countrywide campaign seeking minimum support price for crops will be initiated this month,” said Madhav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nuh-farmers-to-block-rewasan-toll-plaza-on-saturday-101614879226000.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Women leaders to lead farmers’ protests on March 8||Farmers protesting at the Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera and Sunehra-Jurehra interstate Haryana-Rajasthan borders plan on marking International Women’s Day on March 8 by observing the day as Mahila Kisan Diwas. As part of the celebrations, women will lead the protest at both sites, farmer leaders said on Thursday.Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that besides women who were already camping at the protest site, women farmers from different states and organisations will be joining and leading the agitation on Women’s Day. “The agitation will be completing 100 days soon. This could not have been possible without the support of women farmers, who are a pillar of the farmers’ protests. On Women’s Day, we will see greater participation from women who will spearhead the protests for the day. Women will address the gatherings and mobilise support for the agitation,” said Madhav. He said that the farmers union have extended invitations to various women’s organisations to hold programmes to highlight the contributions of women farmers.Farmers across the country have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year, for the past few months. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Ramzan Chaudhary, the head of Jai Kisan Andolan’s Nuh unit, said that women farmers from Mewat would take the centre stage at the Sunehra-Jurehra protest site on Women’s Day. “We will observe March 8 as Mahila Kisan Diwas under the leadership of women from Rajasthan, Haryana and other states. Women are an equal participant in the ongoing agitation, but their role often gets overlooked. When women lead the protests, other women too will get motivated to join the agitation in bigger numbers,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/women-leaders-to-lead-farmers-protests-on-march-8-101614879225450.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Turnout for Covid vaccination sees a spike; residents face issues during online registration||At least 2,780 people above the age of 60 years, and 223 aged between 45 and 59 received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Gurugram on Thursday.According to the district health department data, 56.1 per cent of the total 3,003 were vaccinated free of cost at government health facilities on Thursday.The footfall at 54 vaccination sites on Thursday was 45 per cent higher than Tuesday, when 1,641 people were vaccinated. The government vaccination centres saw a spike of almost 55 per cent turnout on Thursday, compared to 753 people vaccinated at 23 public facilities on Tuesday. “People can easily register themselves on CoWIN to get the vaccine dose at government facilities. People from high-rise buildings or condominiums are not hesitant to approach their nearby government facilities. Some sites have at least two vaccinators to inoculate people to reduce the waiting time,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav. Many people, however, faced challenges to register themselves online, and claimed there was “no point in an advanced booking”.Ram Ratan Gautam, 82, reached the Civil Hospital around 11 am on Thursday and was inoculated and kept under observation till 12:30 pm. “On reaching the spot, verification details were noted. I waited for almost 30 minutes for my turn and took the shot,” said the Gurugram Sector 10 resident.Ashish Kumar and his father, residents of Gurugram Sector 28, went to the Civil Hospital following an advanced booking. “Only one time slot was available for the Civil Hospital on Wednesday evening. We booked the afternoon slot... However, we waited in a queue along with those who opted for on-spot registration. It seems there was no point in an advanced booking,” said Kumar. Vijay Arora, 75, and his wife Geeta Arora, residents of Uniworld Garden, tried booking an online appointment around 2 pm after a private hospital refused to inoculate them on Thursday. Arora demonstrated the entire process to show “how names were registered on CoWIN, but the link to schedule an appointment remained non-functional”.On this, Yadav said, “We are trying to organise and set up a system to facilitate both the categories — walk-in and advance self-registration — to avoid unnecessary inconvenience.” A person can book a time slot 24 hours before the vaccination. The option — “schedule an appointment” — is functional till 12, and it is again available in the evening, according to health officials and beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/turnout-for-covid-vaccination-sees-a-spike-residents-face-issues-during-online-registration-101614879224936.html

The duo was on the way to a private company, where the 20-year-old was supposed to attend a job interview.The police registered a case against the dumper driver, who fled the spot leaving the vehicle behind, on Wednesday night.The injured man was identified as Karan Singh, a resident of Hathin in Palwal, who was visiting his sister in Chopanki village in Rajasthan’s Alwar on Tuesday night. He decided to accompany his nephew to Tauru, where he had a job interview.Around 10am, when the duo reached Pathredi-Tauru road in Bilaspur, a speeding dumper rammed them. “Both of them fell on the road and the truck ran over the pillion rider leaving him dead on the spot. The driver stopped the dumper a few metres ahead and ran from the spot,” said Naveen Kumar, station house officer, Badshahpur police station.The police said that passersby took both of them to a private hospital in Manesar, where doctors declared the 20-year-old, identified as Naveen Kumar, brought dead and admitted Singh, who was severely injured.Singh said that Naveen was excited to apply for his first job. “He was planning to buy clothes before joining and had requested me to come along for shopping. We were driving slow as he had to take a turn, but the dumper driver was speeding and lost control over the wheels. It seems he forgot to apply brakes and rammed us,” he said from the hospital, adding that Naveen’s death has traumatised the family.A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 304A (death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the unidentified driver on Wednesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/speeding-truck-rams-motorbike-kills-20-year-old-pillion-rider-101614879167910.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Gadkari sets August 2022 deadline for Dwarka Expressway, shifting toll plaza||Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari during a visit to the city on Thursday set a deadline of August 15, 2022, for shifting the Kherki Daula toll plaza on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and making the Dwarka Expressway project operational. Gadkari made the announcement after completing an inspection of the Dwarka Expressway project, from Kherki Daula to Dwarka, along with Gurugram member of Parliament (MP) Rao Inderjit Singh and senior officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).“There have been a number of legal issues and complications related to land acquisition because of which shifting of Kherki Daula toll did not happen. But I announce it today that this toll plaza will be shifted by August 15 next year and it will be on same day when Dwarka Expressway becomes operational,” said Gadkari.The union transport minister said that he has also revised the deadline for entire Dwarka Expressway project to next year. “The two phases in Haryana will be completed by this year-end and phases one and two in Delhi would be completed by August 15,” he said, adding that the NHAI had earlier anticipated to finish the project by December 2022.Gadkari also said that the Dwarka Expressway will play an important role in reducing pollution in Delhi and NCR as well as decongest the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. “The biggest positive would be the decongestion of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway which has daily traffic of 3 lakh (300,000) PCUs (passenger car units). When this road is completed, this area will get developed like Singapore and Dubai,” he said. Shifting of the toll plaza has been a longstanding demand of daily commuters to Manesar, who work in the industrial sector, and residents of the developing sectors.Earlier on February 13, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar promised to shift the toll within six months as land required for the same was set to be transferred to NHAI. The proposal to shift the toll was mooted in late 2018, when the government and NHAI agreed to shift it to Sehrawan near Manesar but was hindered by legal issues. The plan to shift the toll to Panchgaon at present has also remained stuck due to land acquisition issues. The 29-kilometre-long Dwarka Expressway is designed as an eight-lane grade-separated road, with a provision for three-lane service roads on both sides. Dwarka Expressway will have four multi-level interchanges and crossroad underpasses at major junctions.Prakhar Sahay, who owns a flat along the Dwarka Expressway, said that once the Gurugram portion of the Dwarka Expressway becomes functional, the toll plaza will lose relevance. “This is going to happen by December 2021, although the toll may officially shift next year,” said Sahay. Gurgaon MP and union minister of state, Rao Inderjit Singh, said that early completion of Dwarka Expressway and shifting of Kherki Daula toll would give a great impetus to economic growth of the city. “We have been pursuing the shifting of the toll plaza and early completion of several road projects, particularly the Dwarka Expressway. We are thankful to the union minister for bringing forward the deadlines,” said Singh.Earlier in the morning, Gadkari, Singh and senior NHAI officials, along with mediapersons, boarded a bus at Central Peripheral Road near Kherki Daula toll plaza and took stock of the progress of the expressway. Officials apprised him that 50% construction work of the expressway has been completed. Of the 29 kilometres of the expressway, 18.9 kilometres is in Haryana while the remaining 10.1 kilometres are in Delhi. Also, 23 kilometres of the entire project would be elevated.Dwelling on the key technical features of the Dwarka expressway, Manoj Kumar, member (project), NHAI, said that once completed, the road project will facilitate safe and seamless travel to travellers moving between Jaipur, Gurugram, Delhi and adjoining areas. “This road will reduce the load on NH8 and reduce both congestion and pollution,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gadkari-sets-august-2022-deadline-for-dwarka-expressway-shifting-toll-plaza-101614879167349.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram secures 8th rank in easy living index among cities with less than 1mn population||Buoyed by better-than-average performances in the main survey parameters (see box), the city ranked eighth among cities with less than a million population in the Ease of Living Index report 2020, released by the ministry of housing and urban affairs on Thursday.In the National Capital Region, Gurugram, with a score of 56 out of 100, was second only to Delhi, which scored 57.56, while other NCR cities of Ghaziabad and Faridabad scored 54.31 and 51.26, respectively. The report also pegged the overall quality of life in Gurugram (53.3) slightly better than the Capital (51.22), which was assessed in a separate category of cities with more than one million population. At 51.38, the national average for quality of life was lower than both cities.The cities were ranked on the basis of scores on four pillars with different weights: Quality of Life (35%), Economic Ability (15%), Sustainability (20%), and Citizen Perception (30%). The last, which has a weight of almost one-third in the rankings, is a completely subjective parameter.The four pillars were divided into a total of 14 categories, such as education, health, housing, etc. under the quality of life pillar. Scores on these categories were themselves generated on the basis of a total of 49 indicators, such as household expenditure on education, literacy rate, etc. for the education category.According to the report, Gurugram also scored well on parameters such as housing and shelter (75.69) and education (74.06) under the Quality of Life pillar. Although the report assigned a high score of 82.61 to the city for safety and security, not too far behind the national average of 86.74, the report stated “...top-performers in the Quality of Life pillar such as Indore, Delhi, and Gurugram have recorded a high incidence of crimes against women.”Apart from these, the city registered a perfect score of 100 in the city resilience category under the Sustainability pillar, which had a national average score of 91.59. Mapping the housing and shelter category scores, the report states, “Twelve Less than Million cities have emerged as positive outliers in terms of slum population, with no section of the population residing in slums. This includes cities such as Gurugram, Varanasi, Meerut, Patna, Dhanbad, Shimla, Indore, and Jammu.”The ground situation is, however, different for Gurugram where slum clusters continue to be a part of the urban landscape.On the downside, mobility remains a challenge in the city. Gurugram scored a measly 25.54, lower than the national average of 28.05.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “Even though Metro connectivity is available in the city and Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus also has regular services, but considering the number of migrants and people who go to work, we need to work upon mobility issues here. We also have to work on green spaces in the city and ensure that all our services are energy efficient and sustainable.”In 2018, Gurugram had ranked 88 out of 111 cities surveyed across Indian as part of the Ease of Living index, indicating generally poor quality of living for city residents. But this year, a reformed framework was built based on previous learnings.“The scope and parameters of the index were expanded based on the feedback received from key stakeholders and urban experts. A significant revision is in the form of separation of the outcome and input parameters that determine the ease of living of citizens… Apart from the segregation of the indicators into input and outcome indicators, there have been significant revisions in the framework of Ease of Living itself. The index carries a 30 percent weightage on the Citizen Perception Survey,” the report stated, making both the rankings incomparable.Recreation was another category where Gurugram, with a score of 11.65, “scored considerably lower than the national average (11.68)”.“Given that we are a Millennium City, we are working with the municipal corporation and we hope to see a jump in that sector within a year. Recreation is important for a city like ours as it brings a cultural vibrancy, which can be through different avenues like concerts, street art, food festivals, so that the general public has different options,” said Garg, on the scope of improving recreational avenues.Under the municipal performance index, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) ranked at 15 with a score of 45.84 in the category of below one million population, whereas Delhi ranked 1 with a score of 52.92 in the same category.Speaking on the performance, Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner of MCG said, “We are still analysing where the MCG’s performance has gone down and needs improvement. We will be working on all issues and improve the ranking in future. However, if we compare scores of MCG with municipal bodies of South Delhi (46), then we are not far behind. Both East (40.79) and North Delhi (37.66) have scored less than us.”City residents, however, said that improvements are needed in the areas of mobility, safety and security and recreational facilities.Neela Kaushik, the founder of Gurgaon Moms, a parent body, said, “When I talk to members in my community, I still get the feedback that mothers do not feel confident in sending children out after a certain time. Another safety issue in the city is drunken and underage driving, which lead to on-the-spot deaths in many cases.”Manas Fuloria, a resident of the city and co-founder of Nagarro, said that mobility has been an issue in the city for years now. “Gurugram came up as a city with middle-class to upper-middle-class car-focused population, with roads frequently widened and public transport taking a back seat until recently, when municipal bodies started the services of minibuses and developing footpaths. It is the style of development which is incorrect and authorities have now recognised and started working on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-secures-8th-rank-in-easy-living-index-among-cities-with-less-than-1mn-population-101614879166669.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||51.1% of total vaccination reported from public facilities||In Gurugram, 51.1 per cent of the total turnout for vaccination this week was recorded at government hospitals and primary health centres, the health department said on Thursday.Around 26 private hospitals vaccinated the rest of the beneficiaries — senior citizens and those aged above 45 with comorbidities. Total of 5,583 common people have been inoculated in Gurugram since March 1, officials said.Following a meeting with the health department on Wednesday, several private hospitals introduced measures to streamline the vaccination process ahead of an expected increase in turnout in the coming days. After an initial lack of planning, private hospitals introduced a token system on Thursday so that people can book slots through phone calls or mobile apps.The move will ease the chaos and long waiting hours at the vaccination centres, according to officials.“A contact number has been issued to organise the walk-in procedure for vaccination. Based on the calls received for on-spot registration on a given number, people are listed for the day,” said Pankaj Mishra, marketing manager, Narayana Hospital in DLF Phase III.“As many people are unaware of the process and directly coming to the site, we asked them to make a phone call and send their details on the number so they can be put in the vaccination list for Friday,” Mishra added.Almost 200 vaccine beneficiaries, whose names were displayed on the notice board at the vaccination centre, were confirmed for the shot on Thursday. Many people at the site were, however, in a dilemma regarding the vaccination process.Sanjay Kalia, who brought his parents to the centre for vaccination, said, “Until now, we had no clarity about the walk-in registration. Now, they have asked us to send us the details on the given number. Hopefully, our names will be in the list tomorrow, for which we will have to visit the hospital again.”The vaccination for the prioritised group started at 20 vaccination centres on March 1. On Day 1, senior citizens, including people who came to make an inquiry about the process after they were unable to register themselves on CoWIN portal, turned up in large numbers. The footfall for the walk-in vaccination has been high since then. People say they have been “facing problems in online booking”.Other centres, like the Park Hospital, issue tokens almost 30 minutes ahead of the vaccination, which starts at 9 am. “Over 100 tokens for on-spot registration are issued every day. All tokens get distributed within 10 minutes. No tokens are issued thereafter. People are asked to either register themselves on the portal in advance or collect the tokens,” said vaccination site manager Surjit Singh, adding that the tokens are issued based on vaccine doses available for the day.Geeta Singh, a resident of Uniworld Garden, collected the token early Thursday morning and received the shot at 2 pm. “The entire verification and payment process is extremely slow. After collecting the token, I reached the hospital again at 10:30 pm and have been waiting since then,” she said.As the vaccination is free in government facilities, the payment process is excluded, expediting the process. The Civil Hospital in Sector 10A issued tokens throughout the day, catering to all on-spot registration till 4 pm.Almost 131 people got tokens till 1.30 pm on Thursday, of which 90 were inoculated. “Walk-in registration is open for all. Since there are two session sites, the process is fast if the server is not down. We inoculate everyone almost till 4:30 pm. The footfall is generally high during morning hours,” said Civil Hospital medical superintendent Dr Manish Kumar.Other hospitals have asked the visitors to register themselves on the hospital’s mobile app before coming for on-spot registration.According to Artemis Hospital head administrator Reena Tiwari, people receive a message confirming the registration for walk-in after they register themselves on the hospital’s mobile app. They go through the verification process on Co-Win and the fee payment process before the vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/511-of-total-vaccination-reported-from-public-facilities-101614879166076.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Poor performance in economy due to Covid-19: City-based businessmen||The recent Covid-19 pandemic left the city’s industrial sector paralysed for almost a year, with business yet to make a full recovery and economic opportunities being hit. The effect was reflected in a low score on this count in the Ease of Living Index, which was released countrywide on Thursday.The Millennium City, which has long been touted as the engine of economic growth in Haryana, scored only 32.5 out of 100 under the Economic Ability pillar. Although the national average was much lower, at 13.17, industry leaders in the city said that Gurugram’s poor performance on this parameter was surprising.They said that Gurugram was hit badly due to the lockdown in 2020 as most businesses and manufacturing stopped and the secondary and allied business sector, such as transport, security, food and beverages, failed to generate revenue. The food and beverage business and liquor industry, which account for a high proportion of jobs, have still not recovered while the real estate is still trying to find a way forward, according to local business associations.The recent decision to implement job reservations for locals in such a scenario does not augur well for the future of the city, said experts but they agreed that Gurugram should bounce back as a favoured business destination as it has resilience and depth.Vinod Sood, managing director, Hughes Systiqe, an IT company, said that while software companies have managed to remain unaffected, the pandemic has hit ITes and BPOs badly. “The service providers were also hit but things are bouncing back and the city will again score among top cities for business and economic opportunity as it has always been,” said Sood, who also holds the chair of National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), Haryana.Experts said that the IT sector, which generated a lot of allied businesses like cafeterias, cab services, pantry jobs, security business, etc, are also working at 25% capacity as a majority of people are working from home.Owners of manufacturing companies, however, said that they are positive about Gurugram and said that the low numbers on the index might be an aberration. “This is only a blip on the radar as Gurugram is and will always remain a top job and business destination. The city has jobs for everyone and of every kind. Secondly, the wages are better and workers are well off,” said Manmohan Gaind, a Manesar-based industrialist.Pawan Yadav, who owns a telecom-related manufacturing unit, said that demand was growing and business was getting back to normal. “Gurugram, like any other part of the country, suffered during the pandemic but we are seeing job generation. Demand is good and the industry is looking for workers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/poor-performance-in-economy-due-to-covid-19-city-based-businessmen-101614879165444.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Mobility problems continue to weigh down city||Mobility remains a challenge for city agencies even after several decades of rapid urban development, as per the findings of the Ease of Living Index released by the Central government on Thursday. The city scored 25.84 in the category of mobility, ranking among its worst score in the parameters.Although a comprehensive mobility plan was conceived in the last two years, its implementation remains pending. Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that mobility continues to remain a problem in the city due to fragmented development and lack of connectivity between individual pockets.“Different pockets of development came up at different times and locations in a fragmented manner unlike the neighbouring city of Delhi, where development started spreading outwards from centre and that is how transport facilities were also developed. Since development was fragmented, intracity mobility got affected and the places were not connected by a good network,” said Sewa Ram.Gurugram had performed poorly in the 2018 edition of the Ease of Living Index as well, with the city being ranked 69 in this sector. In the 2020 edition, the city ranked 31, albeit only among the 62 cities with a population of less than a million.To understand the mobility standards, the current report has taken three indicators, availability of public transport, transport-related fatalities and road infrastructure, into account. The city has limited Metro connectivity, with only five stations, and there has been no expansion beyond the last station at Huda City Centre since 2010 although plans are afoot. Though the Rapid Metro was introduced in 2012, its reach remains confined to a few localities. A city bus service started in 2018 has provided some relief but it is yet to form a complete network to provide seamless mobility and last-mile connectivity.The report states, “Urban mobility emerges as one of the greatest challenges to urbanisation. With growing resources and population, the need for expansion in transportation services arises… Over 60% of the cities participating in this index have scored below the national average of 28.05.”Speaking on improvements in the sector, Maqsood Ahmed, additional chief executive officer for mobility division with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, said, “Mobility has been an issue in the city, but we are working to improve it by increasing buses, making specific paths for cyclists through our comprehensive mobility plan that has been approved by the chief minister and is in the implementation stages.”The state government, meanwhile, said it was planning to slowly switch to electric buses in Gurugram as a more sustainable measure to improve connectivity.Mool Chand Sharma, state transport minister, said that following the guidelines of the Central government, the state is also working towards switching to electric vehicles from CNG vehicles.“Along with starting more minibus services to improve intracity connectivity in Gurugram and proper implementation of the comprehensive mobility plan, we are also working on slowly switching towards electric vehicles. There has been a slight shift already with people using electric cars and two-wheelers, but the state government is also aiming to switch to electric buses in large numbers by 2024 to ease mobility issues in the city,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mobility-problems-continue-to-weigh-down-city-101614879164907.html

Muzaffarpur was adjudged the lowest in the Ease of Living Index.In the first edition of the Ease of Living Index in 2018, Patna had scored 18.67 out of 100 and was ranked 109th among the 111 cities across the country.The rankings are based on various parameters, including governance, education, health, housing, power supply and transport, among others.In the latest survey, Patna has scored 53.26 out of 100 and is ranked ahead of Ranchi (42).In the less than a million population category, Biharsharif, with a score of 52.42, has ranked 28th out of 62 cities; Bhagalpur (52.19) points ranked 30th. Muzaffarpur, with 45.53 points, is the lowest among all categories.The cities were assessed on five parameters: quality of life (education, health, housing and shelter, safety and security, etc.), economic sustainability (level of economic development, economic opportunities), sustainability (environment, green building, energy consumption, city resilience, etc.); ease of living and citizen perception survey.As far as quality of life is concerned, Patna has scored 47.02 as against the national average of 51.38 (in million-plus category) and has ranked 42nd out of the 49 cities in this category. Bhagalpur has scored 49, Biharsharif 48.71 and Muzaffarpur 45.82 on the quality of life.The Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) was undertaken from January 16 to March 20, 2020. A total of 32.2 lakh citizens from 111 cities participated in the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-city-from-bihar-in-top-10-of-ease-of-living-index-patna-climbs-a-notch-101614877228999.html

In 2018, the central government announced an increase in the amount from Rs1,850 to 3,000 per year, but the state government has not implemented the change,” said Poornima Chikarmane, from Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat, Pune.These children wrote postcards and held posters with slogans to create awareness about the cleaning occupations scheme on March 1 which is celebrated as the International Waste Pickers’ Day.The postcard reads “Sir, I am Sachin Kamble from Pune. I study in Class 8 in Babu Jagjivan Ram school. My mother is a waste picker. I receive the scholarship amount of 1,850 per year which is given to children of waste pickers but the central government has changed the amount to 3,000 ₹per year in 2018. The change has not been reflected by the state government and I am deprived of the money which I need to continue my education. Covid has severely affected our studies and we request you to please grant us our rightful amount of scholarship.”Chikarmane had met minister Mundhe along with the deputy chairperson of the legislative council, Neelam Gorhe just prior to the Covid pandemic in 2020.Mayur Gaikwad, one of the students of Class 10, said, “I am protesting for our rights, only because we know that if we don’t get the scholarship we will never be able to pursue higher education. Another student of Class 10 Poonam Shinde, said, “My mother has spent her life collecting waste, it is such an important service. Why does it take so long to recognize our value to the world and give us what is rightfully ours.”“We hope that our handwritten letters will hasten the process and we get a sum of ₹3,000 as the scholarship starting this year itself”, said Rutuja Mote, a student of Class 8, studying in PMC school, daughter of a waste picker from Yerawada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/waste-pickers-children-write-to-minister-to-increase-amount-of-scholarship-101614874664092.html

Three FIRs had been registered - one on December 28 and two on January 12 against various activists including Nodeep Kaur and Shiv Kumar for extortion, among other charges.Sessions judge YS Rathor released Kumar on bail on furnishing bond in sum of ₹1 lakh with one surety.Kumar was booked under Sections 148, 149, 186, 332, 353, 384, 379-B and 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and was arrested on January 23.He was arrested on a complaint filed by inspector Ravi Kumar, SHO of Kundli police station, on January 12, for allegedly attacking cops while protesting outside factory number 349 in industrial area of HSIIDC Kundli. Kumar was arrested in this connection.“The court said that Kumar shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or any police officer. He shall not leave India without prior permission of court,” the order of the copy said.Shiv Kumar contended before the court through his counsel Jatinder Kumar that he was not even present at the protest site on January 12.“Co-accused Nodeep Kaur, whose case is identical to that of the applicant, has been released on bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court. In these circumstances, the applicant is entitled to be released on bail on grounds of parity,” the lawyer added.On February 19, the HC had ordered to conduct medical examination of Kumar after hearing a petition filed by his father Rajbir Singh alleging police torture and brutality with Kumar by Sonepat police.In a plea filed in HC, Rajbir had alleged that Kumar, president of Majdoor Adhikar Sanghathan, was picked up by police on January 16, illegally detained for seven days before producing him before the magistrate and sought CBI probe and his medical examination.Medical report submitted by a team of doctors of GMCH, Chandigarh, to the HC had mentioned that Kumar has sustained eight injuries, including multiple fractures, that are more than two weeks old. The nail beds of some of his toes were also found to be broken. The team of doctors had found four injuries simple in nature, two of them are grievous and had not commented on two injuries as regard to their nature because of the possibility of fracture.Doctors had done a psychiatric evaluation of Kumar and said that he appeared “sad and distressed with occasional crying spells.”“He expressed preoccupation with his current situation, reported predominant anxiety symptoms, flashbacks of brutality meted out to him, nightmares, feeling of loneliness, uncertainty about future,” it said, adding that overall, he appears to be in “post-traumatic stress disorder like symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-activist-shiv-kumar-out-on-bail-101614873224024.html

The Ease of Living Index for the year 2020 evaluated the well-being of Indian citizens in cities, across various parameters that consist of four pillars: quality of life, economic ability, sustainability, and citizens’ perception. During the evaluation, Pune scored 58.10 on quality of life, which has a weightage of 35%; 48.88 on economic ability with a weightage of 15%; 75.74 on sustainability; and 66.27 on citizens’ perception. For the last two pillars the weightage is 20% and 30% respectively. (See graphic) There were 14 categories under these four pillars with 49 indicators. Among these 14 categories, such as green buildings, Pune has scored 100, while on safety and security, the score is above 90 and for resilience, 100. On the other hand, on the economic opportunities front, Pune scored below 20, while at the same time the score for level of economic development was above 80. On health, it was less than 60 and for mobility, below 40. Activists said the report rightly observed Pune’s key problem of mobility and poor public transport, along with garbage issues and a need for health facilities. “Pune is following the industrial belt, but due to it being a non-capital city there are some limitations. Like other capital cities, Pune is not getting enough direct investment,” said a senior Pune Municipal Corporation official, on condition of anonymity. Rajya Sabha MP from NCP Vandana Chavan said, “Overall Pune city is best on some parameters. There is natural potential in this city, though there are problems on the ground, such as mobility. Even today I raised the question of dumping on the riverbed.” The PMC accepts that the city has enough health of infrastructure, but it is lying idle. Pune’s big problem is garbage. Every year there are agitations over the issue. The existing solid waste management plants are not working aat full capacity. According to Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA, what is needed for the city is a constant follow up of major projects which have the potential to generate economic opportunities. “Pune has scored very low on economic opportunities, mobility and recreation. Pune has a dozen infrastructure projects announced worth more than ₹50,000 crore. A dashboard of monthly progress on each of these would help. Speedy execution of these would generate economic opportunities, especially for unskilled workers who are most impacted by the pandemic,” Girbane said. College of Engineering Pune (COEP) director Prof B B Ahuja said, “Citizens of Pune are conscious of their responsibilities towards the growing needs of the city. Pune is regarded as the Oxford of the East and so more and more students come here for their academic careers. There is harmony among citizens. It is indeed a proud moment for all of us to get the 2nd rank in the country.”Arun Adsul, former vice-chancellor of the SPPU said, “I have seen Pune developing over the last 50 years, earlier as a student, then as a professor and finally as the vice-chancellor of the university. It is indeed a good and liveable place for not only students, but for people of all ages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-problem-better-on-sustainability-but-low-on-economic-ability-quality-of-life-101614871303808.html

04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Upcoming Budget presentation in Haryana: Revenue deficit, debt burden sore points in economy||A revenue surplus state till 2008–09, Haryana has consistently been in deficit since then. It appears to be fiscally worst off in its class with very high trend growth rate of expenditures particularly interest payments and salaries and a huge debt burden primarily due to the power sector. These red flags about Haryana’s state of finances were raised by the 15th Finance Commission in its report tabled last month in Parliament. The observations are important keeping in view the presentation of budget estimates for 2021-22 fiscal by Chief Minister, ML Khattar later this month. The finance commission said that Haryana’s outstanding debt has been increasing at a trend growth rate of 20.2% between 2011–12 and 2018–19. The debt–gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio also increased from 18.33% in 2011–12 to 25.09% in 2018–19. RD-FD ratio increasing The state’s revenue deficit-fiscal deficit ratio has been increasing over time and is currently 51.4% (2018–19) indicating that most of the state’s borrowings have gone for financing its revenue deficit, the report said. Subsidy, as per the finance commission, constituted around 12% of the total revenue expenditure with power subsidy alone accounting for 87% of the total subsidies. Interest payments are also a huge liability for Haryana. “Between 2011–12 and 2018–19, interest as a percentage of total revenue expenditure has been in the range of 12.5% to 17.6% which is among the highest in the country,” the commission said. “Social security and welfare constituted about 10% of total revenue expenditure with a significant part going to over 25 lakh pensioners under various flagship schemes for the elderly, widows, persons with disabilities. Despite high per capita income, Haryana has a consistently adverse sex ratio and high incidence of anaemia. Yet, health expenditure is only 4.8% of the total revenue expenditure. The pandemic apart, availability of health infrastructure and healthcare professionals in the state is hardly enough to meet its regular needs,’’ the Commission said. ‘Require balance between revenue and capital expenditure’ Chief minister ML Khattar, who holds the finance portfolio, said that payment of salaries, pensions coupled with implementation of the 7th Pay Commission has put a burden on state’s finances. “We have to strike a balance between the revenue expenditure and capital expenditure. The revenue expenditure is a committed liability and not much can be done about it.’’ Khattar said. The CM said that state debt is within the 25% limit of the GSDP as mandated by Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. “At present, its 22.8 %. Under FRBM Act, loans up to 3% could be taken. But this year, the Central government had raised the limit 5%,’’ Khattar said. Finance officials said that debt had increased due to the fact that state government took over the huge debt of power distribution companies. As per the finance commission, the state government took over ₹25,950 crore debt of power distribution companies during 2015–2017 in the form of grants of ₹7,785 crore, loan of ₹15,570 crore and equity of ₹2,595 crore under the Ujjawal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). Further, the loan was converted into equity in 2017-18 and 2018-19. ‘Our GSDP increased two-fold in last six years’ Khattar said that Haryana’s GSDP saw a two-fold increase in the last six years of BJP rule. When the Congress rule ended in 2014-15, our GSDP was ₹3.99 lakh crore. It has increased to ₹8.58 lakh crore now,’’ he said. The finance commission though has remarked that intra-state disparity between the most advanced district (Gurugram) and the most backward (Nuh) is staggering. “Without Gurugram in the equation, Haryana’s GSDP and per capita income would reduce drastically,’’ the commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/upcoming-budget-presentation-in-haryana-revenue-deficit-debt-burden-sore-points-in-economy-101614869323594.html

The irony wasn’t missing. While residents and activists welcomed the ranking, they raised a question over how it was done and said the ground situation is different. Activist Vivek Velenkar said, “We are facing many issues in the city and even raising it regularly. We must get the details about the sample size of this survey and from which locality people have given responses.” “For Punekars, the slow progress of various infrastructure projects, air pollution, traffic jams and absence of a robust public transport system, have been top of their minds,” said Velankar. Rajya Sabha MP from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Vandana Chavan, also an environmentalist, said, “It is our common experience that whenever Pune gets any top ranking, the administration becomes lazy. Whenever we raise a question, they either point at other cities, or claim that we got appreciation from the government. The ground situation is different and there are many issues in the city.” In 2018, when Pune was ranked first in the Ease of Living Index, many were surprised. Activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “The survey may have been conducted only in smart city areas. Doing some basic infrastructure does not make us a liveable city. If someone took a walk on the city’s roads, there would be no need to give any answers. They can see the situation of footpaths, traffic, garbage and many other issues.” Retired civic officer Deennath Patil said, “I worked with big corporates and during my service, lived in almost all the metro cities. I can confidently say that Pune is much better city. I preferred to settle down in Pune after retirement. Pune’s climate, culture, and civic sense is much better. It is true that there is scope to improve, but when we compare it with other cities, even Mumbai, Pune is preferable for many.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/much-irony-little-ecstasy-punekars-react-to-city-s-ease-of-living-index-ranking-101614868843449.html

Its construction will also immensely help to reduce air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region.The Delhi-Gurugram section of National Highway-8 is presently carrying traffic of over three lakh passenger car units (PCUs), which is much beyond the design capacity of this 8-lane highway, leading to severe congestion. With the construction of the present project, 50 to 60 per cent of traffic on National Highway-8 will be reduced, the minister added.The project will also provide around 50 thousand direct or indirect employment opportunities, he said.Being built in four packages, the total length of the expressway is 29 kilometres out of which 18.9-kilometre length falls in Haryana while the remaining 10.1-kilometre length is in Delhi.It starts from Shiv-Murti on National Highway-8 and ends near KherkiDaula Toll Plaza.Once complete, the minister said, it will be an "engineering marvel" of the country with the longest (3.6 kilometres) and widest (8 lanes) urban road tunnel in India.

04-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor accepts state forest minister Sanjay Rathod’s resignation||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Thursday accepted Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod’s resignation as the state’s forest minister, hours after it was sent to him by the government. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition party in the state, was putting pressure on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)-led government to send Rathod’s resignation to the governor.Rathod, whose name had emerged in connection with the death of a 23-year old woman, tendered his resignation to chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on February 28. The woman from Parli town in Maharashtra’s Beed district apparently jumped off a building in Pune on February 8. A case of accidental death was registered with the Wanawadi police station in Pune.Few days after the woman’s death, audio and video clips along with photographs went viral on social media which purportedly linked her with Rathod. The BJP accused the Shiv Sena leader of being involved in the woman’s death and demanded an investigation into the case.Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari accepts the resignation of Forest Minister Sanjay RathodRathod had tendered his resignation over his alleged connection with the death of a woman in Pune in FebruaryFollowing Rathod’s resignation last week as a cabinet minister, Leader of Opposition (LoP) and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on February 28 that no first information report or FIR had been registered against him despite the availability of evidence and went on to blame ‘higher-ups for shielding him’. On the other hand, the BJP’s Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil said that Rathod’s resignation was a result of the constant pressure put by the people of Maharashtra and the BJP. Patil added that he was glad that CM Thackeray displayed courage in removing Rathod as a minister.Rathod, a four-time legislator from the Digras assembly constituency in Yavatmal district, has denied all charges and demanded a fair investigation. The 49-year-old leader added that the opposition defamed him and all this was being done to destroy his political career.Rathod is the second minister in the MVA government whose name has surfaced in a criminal case. Earlier, state minister of social justice and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde had been accused by a 38-year-old woman of rape, who later withdrew her complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-accepts-state-forest-minister-sanjay-rathod-s-resignation-101614862844985.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Found discrepancy, manipulation in income worth ₹650 crore, says I-T dept after raids on Anurag Kashyap, Taapsee Pannu||The income tax department said on Thursday that it found discrepancy and manipulation of income during the searches at various places linked to actor Tapsee Pannu, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap and his partners who launched the now shuttered production house Phantom Films. There was also huge suppression of income compared to the actual box office collections, the IT department further said.Also Read: All you need to know about the raidsGiving details about the searches, the officials said that the production house staff was not able to explain discrepancy of around ₹300 crore.The officials also said that they found evidence related to manipulation and under-valuation of share transactions of Phantom Films amongst the film directors and shareholders, having tax implication of about ₹350 crore. Evidence of cash receipts by the leading actress amounting to ₹5 crore has also been recovered, they further said.The officials added that further investigation is on, adding that raids are still being carried out.The searches, part of a tax evasion probe against Phantom Films, were carried out across 28 locations in Mumbai and Pune on Wednesday, according to government release. Properties linked with Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibhasish Sarkar and some executives of celebrity and talent management companies KWAN and Exceed were also raided. During the search, seven bank lockers were found which have been placed under restraint, the release said.The others searched include some Phantom Films production house employees, which was dissolved in 2018, director-producer Vikramaditya Motwane, producer Vikas Bahl and producer-distributor Madhu Mantena.Both Pannu and Kashyap, who are shooting in Pune, were also questioned by the income tax officials. They are collaborating in the upcoming film "Dobaara".The raids were slammed by opposition parties. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that the raids are being carried out against those who are pro-farmers.He used three popular Hindi idioms in his tweet - 'Ungliyon pe nachana', 'Bheegi billi banna' and 'Khisiyani billi khamba noche' - to say what he believes they mean in the current context.Similar thoughts were expressed by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik. His cabinet colleague and Congress leader Ashok Chavan said this is nothing new. "We have been seeing this as happening often. Those who put forth facts are being pressurised in this way so that they don't speak up," said the PWD minister.But government ministers rejected allegations that the raids against Kashyap and Pannu were linked to their comments, which are seen at times critical of the BJP."This is too much. Probe agencies undertake investigations based on credible information and the matter later goes to courts as well," Union minister Prakash Javadekar said at a press conference on Wednesday.Pannu's last tweet was on March 1, in which she strongly spoke about the Supreme Court asking a man accused of repeated rape whether he was willing to marry the woman. Kashyap, meanwhile, has been quiet on Twitter in recent time. He visited the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Shaheen Bagh during the anti-CAA protests last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/found-discrepancy-manipulation-in-income-worth-rs-650-crore-says-i-t-dept-after-raids-on-anurag-kashyap-taapsee-pannu-101614862392768.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Police submit report in court on probe against Kangana Ranaut on posts||Mumbai Police on Thursday submitted before a magistrate court a report of their inquiry into a complaint against actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister for posting alleged hateful messages on social media.In October last year, the magistrate court in Mumbai asked suburban Amboli police to conduct an inquiry into a private complaint, filed by lawyer AliKashif Khan Deshmukh, related to the alleged objectionable messages and file a report by December 5.The police failed to submit their report within the time-frame given by the court.The court later extended the deadline which, too, was missed.During a hearing on February 5, the court asked the police to submit a progress report on the inquiry it had ordered into the complaint against Ranaut and her sister and posted the matter for further hearing on March 4.The police on Thursday filed a report of their probe into the matter.The court heard the arguments and kept the matter for orders on April 5.According to the complaint, Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel had posted an objectionable message on Twitter in April last year, targeting a particular community, following which her account was suspended.Ranaut then posted a video in support of her sister and in the clip allegedly referred to members of a particular community as "terrorists", the complainant said, seeking a police investigation and action against the two.

04-03-2021||Lucknow||Budget passed in UP Assembly; House adjourned sine die||The Uttar Pradesh Assembly was adjourned sine die on Thursday, a week ahead of the schedule, after the House passed the annual budget for 2021-22, the largest budget so far in the history of the state.The government presented the last budget of its current tenure last week with an outlay of ₹5,50,270.78 crore.The first paperless budget of Uttar Pradesh, which intends to make the state "aatmanirbhar" (self-reliant) as Finance Minister Suresh Khanna put it, includes new schemes worth ₹27,598.40 crore.The brief session, which was to conclude on March 10, was curtailed following requests from lawmakers to wrap it up so that they could campaign for the upcoming panchayat polls in the state.As soon as the House met for the day, Khanna, who is also the parliamentary affairs minister, said due to the upcoming panchayat polls and the recurrence of Covid-19 cases in some states, the proceedings will be completed and the House will be adjourned.Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary of the Samajwadi Party (SP) termed it "murder of democracy" and said the Assembly members do not have to contest in the panchayat polls and that the House should be run till March 10, as decided earlier.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Lalji Verma and Congress Legislative Party leader Aradhna Mishra Mona too cited rules and said the proceedings should continue and there is no reason for curtailing the session.Khanna, however, cited examples from 2009, 2006 and 1991 and said as the number of coronavirus cases is also rising, the budget should be passed and the House adjourned sine die.Dissatisified with the "undemocratic" move of the government, opposition SP, BSP, Congress and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) staged a walkout.Subsequently, the budget and the related appropriation bills were passed by a voice vote.Several amendment bills were passed before the House was adjourned.The session commenced on February 18 with the governor's customary address to the joint sitting of the Assembly and the Legislative Council, but it was marked by opposition protests and walkouts.Replying to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the governor for her address, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath slammed the opposition members for their "behaviour".Later, while speaking on the budget, Adityanath flayed the SP, accusing it of presenting "directionless" state budgets in the past, unlike the budget presented by Khanna, which was "lauded by various chambers of commerce and welcomed by all sections of the society".Opposition parties, on the other hand, said the budget was anti-poor and anti-farmer.As the opposition tried to corner the government on the issue of law and order, Adityanath sought to turn the tables on the SP on Wednesday over incidents of crime in the state, asking why the word "samajwadi" gets tagged to every criminal.He referred to an incident in Hathras, in which a man out on bail after his arrest in 2018 in a molestation case allegedly shot dead the victim's father.The Assembly passed two key bills on Monday, including one that relates to recovery of damages to public and private properties from protesters, amid opposition demands that it be referred to a select committee.According to the statement of reasons and object of the Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damages to Public and Private Property Bill, 2021, protesters found guilty of damaging government or private properties will face imprisonment up to a year or a fine ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹one lakh.The House also passed the Uttar Pradesh Goonda Control (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to empower the joint and deputy commissioners of police to act under the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/budget-passed-in-up-assembly-house-adjourned-sine-die-101614849956501.html

04-03-2021||Chandigarh||CII red-flags Haryana govt on 75% quota to locals in private firm jobs||Much before Haryana assembly in November 2020 passed the Bill that now binds industry to reserve 75% jobs for locals, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) had cautioned the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government about adverse impact of this decision on existing businesses and investments. Coinciding with CII’s strong reservations about this move of the state government, some local industry associations of Haryana had petitioned the Punjab and Haryana high court to apply brakes on this contentious bill. The court had, however, declined the plea on the grounds that bill was yet to become an Act, CII functionaries familiar with this matter said. On Wednesday and the day after chief minister Khattar announced that Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya had given assent to the bill, the CII, which is apex industry organisation, made it clear that it was miffed with this populist decision and reminded Haryana about “Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat” vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “At a time when it is important to attract investments at state level, the Haryana government could have avoided imposing restrictions on Industry. Reservation affects productivity and Industry competitiveness,” Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, CII, said in a statement. “We hope Haryana government relooks at the legislation. With Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’ we look forward to an integrated and mobile labour market within the country.”Under the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, the private sector will have to employ 75% of the local candidates with respect to such posts where the gross monthly salary or wages are not more than ₹50,000. This Act applies to all the companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, and any person employing ten or more persons. Sources in CII said their director general Banerjee’s statement is a reflection of the tough stand the CII had taken in the run up to Haryana drafting this bill. Immediately after learning about Haryana’s decision to pass the legislation, the CII functionaries flagged the concerns of the Industry actively to the State government. At least six representations along with suggestions (see box) were submitted to chief minister Khattar and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala to reconsider the decision. “This law if implemented is bound to impact existing businesses present in the state and slow down investments while further affecting ease of doing business ranking of Haryana,” the CII functionaries told Hindustan Times. The CII’s warning that the new law has potential to affect in what is called ease of doing business comes in the backdrop of Haryana slipping to the 16th slot in 2018-19 rankings from the third position. CII sources say the “job reservation act” has potential to give a blow to the industry friendly image of Haryana. In the run up to the government tabling the bill in the Vidhan Sabha, the CII held discussions with “major industrial houses” in the state regarding the impact of this legislation on their businesses. “They have been saying that this Act is going to affect their businesses in a big way and that they will have o rework their expansion plans in Haryana. We have been requesting the state government to reconsider the decision as this will have a long term negative impact on Haryana’s image as a business hub,” CII officials privy to the talks with the government, said.Senior executive committee member, Garments Export Manufacturers Association (GEMA), Gautam Nair, said that the 75% private sector job quota is not a good policy as the apparel export industry has to work in an extremely competitive market. “We have been losing business to countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. Apparel exports is a labour intensive industry and we are already not competitive. Legislations such as these will further erode our competitiveness,’’ Nair said. Nair whose Matrix Clothing manufactures garments for brands like Ralph Lauren and Gapp said if the government introduces such distortions then workers efficiency and competitiveness will decrease. “ The apparel industry is primarily situated in Gurugram and Faridabad. There is not enough local labour to do this job. This industry needs migrant labour from Bihar, Jharkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh.” President of Gurgaon Industrial Association, Jagananth Mangla, said that the industry needs skilled and proficient workforce which can handle its machines and equipment diligently. “We have been opposing the private sector quota move. But since the government has enacted a law despite our opposition, we will figure out how to go about it,’’ Mangla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cii-red-flags-haryana-govt-on-75-quota-to-locals-in-private-firm-jobs-101614858456262.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Virbhadra asks HP CM to show magnanimity, Jai Ram insists on apology||The deadlock between the ruling BJP and the Opposition over the suspension of five Congress legislators for the duration of the budget session for allegedly manhandling the governor continued for the fifth day on Thursday as both sides refused to relent. The Opposition abstained from participating in the proceedings of the House. The legislators, party workers and leaders, including the Congress’ state chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, covered their faces with black ribbons and staged a sit-in protest outside the Vidhan Sabha. Veteran Congress leader and former chief minister Virbhadra Singh also joined the protesting legislators and requested the chief minister to ‘show magnanimity and soften his stance’. Virbhadra Singh described the registration of cases against the Congress legislators unfortunate. “Had I been present in the Assembly, I would have resolved the matter within hours. It is the duty of the Opposition to raise issues. In a democracy , it is the right of the Opposition to protest. The governor was not insulted. It was their right to protest, and they protested, “ he said “Where is the need for tendering an apology as the Opposition did not mishandle him. The Government should not adopt tough posturing,” the veteran leader said. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who is leader of the House, however, refused to the budge and parceled the blame squarely on the Opposition’s soldier. After the Assembly was adjourned for the day, Thakur said, “The fault does not lie with the government. The Opposition has committed a grave mistake and should tender an unconditional apology to the governor. Had the Opposition targeted me, the matter could have been overlooked, but they misbehaved with the governor.” On Virbhadra Singh’s request, the CM said, “I hold him in high regard. However, we also remember the time when we were bundled in buses and thrown in the forest for walking into the well of the House.” ‘Footage of episode should be shown in House’ Thakur said, “The leader of Opposition jumped to conclusions before the governor could finish his address and termed it a bundle of lies. If there is a provision, the footage of the entire episode should be played in the House so the truth can be differentiated from lies.” On the Opposition refusing to attend the proceedings, the CM said, “Had they been in the House it would have been good . Barring those who had been suspended, others could have attended the House, but the Congress violates the rules time-and-time again.” Five legislators - leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, Harshwardhan Chauhan, Vinay Kumar, Satpal Singh Raizada and Sunder Thakur - were suspended for unruly behaviour and obstructing governor Bandaru Dattatreya on the opening day of the budget session on February 26. The suspension has led to a stalemate in the budget session with Opposition members asking the Speaker to revoke his decision. On a complaint from the marshal, the police had registered FIRs against the legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virbhadra-asks-hp-cm-to-show-magnanimity-jai-ram-insists-on-apology-101614857976757.html

He also announced that mother tongue will now become the medium of instruction in elementary schools of the state, in line with the new education policy.“With over 20% of the budget, a lot has been done in the education sector in the last one and a half decade, but now, the focus will entirely be on improving learning outcomes and this can be done only by teachers, who are central to the education system,” said Choudhary.“I also urge the regional officials to ensure that the teachers got their due without running around offices. It needs continuous effort to improve the quality of education,” he added.The minister was replying to the debate on his department’s budgetary demand of ₹38,035 crore, which was passed by the Bihar Vidhan Sabha. The opposition leaders, however, slammed the government for poor quality education in the government schools.In keeping with the New Education Policy (NEP), the minister said that education in elementary schools would now be imparted in mother tongue. “It has been proved that children are more receptive in their mother tongue and Mahatma Gandhi also strongly batted for this. The government is also in the process of developIng a roadmap for implementation of NEP,” he added.Also Read: Bihar Dy CM promises makeover of Hindu holy site at Simaria GhatThe minister said that the government is committed to increasing gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education. “So far, the government has sanctioned ₹3290 crore under students’ credit card scheme, part of the Bihar government’s 7-Resolves, to help students of underprivileged sections pursue higher and technical education, while ₹1538.86 crore has already been released for benefit of 110,456 students,” he said.Choudhary said efforts were underway to develop one model school in each of the 38 districts of the state. “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, education suffered in schools. Therefore, the bridge course has been planned to cover the gaps, as many students could not have access to online education,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-minister-promises-focus-on-teaching-in-mother-tongue-and-learning-outcomes-101614850297998.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC suggests special spots to feed strays: Spot on, say animal lovers||In almost every other neighbourhood in Delhi, there’s this constant battle between the animal lovers who want to feed strays and the other residents who feel it’s unsafe to do so when animals are in close proximity to residential areas. Recently, three animal lovers filed a petition against one Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA) in Vasant Kunj for hindering feeding of stray dogs. And now, the Delhi High Court has asked all those involved to identify a spot that can be used for the purpose of feeding and taking care of strays. Many a times, the tussle between the two schools of thought has turned into nasty fights and sometimes residents end up penalising animal lovers for going out of their way to tend to the strays in their locality. In a recent incident, residents of an apartment complex in Gurugram reportedly held a family hostage for feeding stray dogs, alleging an increase in cases of dog bites. So would allocation of a spot for this purpose help solve the rampant issue in Delhi-NCR? Anuradha Sehgal, who runs an NGO Bowl of Life, feels hard to believe that RWAs blame feeders. “Most of us who take care of animals and their needs, do so at our own expense. We are doing a service to the animals, but above that we are also helping those people who don’t take any responsibility for the well-being of strays. Dogs are territorial; to be able to sterilise or vaccinate them, it’s important to regularly feed them and gain their trust. It’s extremely sad that society excludes such individuals who are helping the voiceless,” says Sehgal, who feels that it’s on all of us to care for animals. “The Delhi HC order is a good option, and should be implemented everywhere! It takes one bowl of food and water to ensure strays have a good life. If each person took care of one animal outside their home, India would soon have no strays. We cannot continue to practice speciesism and think only about ourselves,” she adds.Other animal lovers such as Akshey Joshi from Gurugram also feels that having designated places for feeding strays will go a long way in creating harmony. He explains, “Some people have issues with dogs dirtying the place, which I think isn’t unfair. Most societies ought to have designated corners to keep the friction to a minimal. It’s crucial for everyone to understand that the lives of these animals are in fact legally protected and so is the right of people to tend to them, especially since we’re the ones taking habitable space away from them.” And Noida-based animal rescuer Pooja Bhat believes sensitisation and sterilisation of strays can help mend the bridge between RWAs and animal lovers. “I believe both need to come to a table and discuss issues to find amicable solutions. A significant difference can be made if everyone and not just animal well wishers make efforts. For example, in Noida sector 31, the RWA has allocated an animal welfare fund for feeding and sterilisation of strays in their locality, along with a designated spot for feeding! People also need to understand that one can’t just feed an animal anywhere and everywhere,” says Bhat.

Covid, for many, came as calamity they had never anticipated.Also read | Maharashtra sees 9,855 fresh Covid cases, sharpest 1-day spike since October 17The family of former mayor of Datta Ekbote is braving all the odds to come to terms with the tragedy which struck them, as Covid-19 has claimed three of their family members.The family feels let down by the PMC administration, following the deaths of the three family members due to Covid-19 - the former mayor, his son Ravindra Ekbote (51) and daughter Renuka (62).The family - grandson Gaurav, his wife Rajashree, mother Meenakshi and grandmother Kaveri (85) - stay in a small room in Ganj peth.Gaurav was employed at a private institution and lost his job after the imposition of lockdown.His grandfather Datta Ekbote was a noted socialist leader who breathed his last at Sassoon General Hospital. Ekbote, is known for his involvement in the fight for the rights of bidi workers and their empowerment.“Our demands must be fulfilled as it is the duty of the PMC to ensure that we get the requisite compensation from the authorities. The loss can never be compensated,” Meenakshi Ekbote said.As on Sunday, Pune district reported 8,115 deaths due to the infection, of which 4578 are from city areas alone.A PMC analysis shows that most of those died are above 50 years of age.“We lost three of our family members and the situation on the ground is tough. We are eligible for ₹50 lakh compensation announced by the government, but still nothing has been done on the ground. Our request to PMC has fallen on deaf ears. We have requested the PMC to release ₹25 lakh as compensation and offer me a job so that we can recover from the huge setback,” said Gaurav Ekbote.In some cases, getting the body cremated was a challenge for family members, something that added to the trauma. This PMC staff and NGOs had to take initiative, as relatives were scared to take possession of a corpse infected with Covid-19.In July and August, PMC assigned 12 crematoriums where final rites on Covid mortalities were performed.Also read | Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal gets first shot of Covid-19 vaccine﻿However, most crematoriums were overburdened.Relatives of Covid-19 victims were found to disappear just before the funeral, leaving health workers and social workers with the corpse.According to the law, the last rites cannot be performed without a relative’s approval and the corpse could not be stored a due to the infection .Social workers and health department officials found it hard to track down absconding relatives to get consent for the final rites.The deaths also took away earning members for many.Arshiya Shaikh (22), daughter of Nazir Hussain (65), a resident of Yerawada, also lost her father and uncle Mushir (55) in the Covid crisis in May 2020.Arshiya stays with her mother, sister, aunt and her three children aged 10, 12 and 15.“Covid-19 crisis struck us at the roots, as we lost two earning members. My mother had also taken ill due to Covid-19 and was sent to an isolation facility.. It is nearly nine months and things have changed for the better for the family. I have got a job and our relatives helped us financially to tide over the crisis,” said Arshiya.Like Arshiya, Adarsh Pihal (23), a resident of Bhavani peth, also lost his mother Hirabai (60), in April last year. The loss shattered the family. “We stay with our father, sister and aunt in our house. My mother worked for a private firm earned well for the family. Currently, things are bad and I am desperately searching for a job so that we can survive the financial impact of the Corona virus,” said Pihal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-year-of-covid-ripped-apart-by-loss-of-near-and-dear-ones-families-struggle-to-recover-101614845675106.html

He claimed that the state government used to get more than ₹2 crore as tax from this place every year; yet, it lacked basic amenities like concrete-paved banks suitable for bathing, and an electric crematorium. Several lives are lost every year due to drowning, said the BJP member. Another BJP member Rajnish Kumar said in terms of religious significance, Simaria Ghat was Prayagraj of Bihar.The deputy CM acknowledged the members’ sentiments and said he would strive to resolve the issues affecting the devotees and tourists. He said an electric crematorium was planned there but couldn’t materialise as the land earmarked for the purpose was acquired for widening of the national highways. “The government had allotted ₹1.97 crore to Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (Buidco) for crematorium in 2017-18 and ₹97 lakh out of that sum was released to launch work on the project,” added Prasad.Also Read: Phanishwar Nath Renu’s birth centenary: Call to turn village into tourist spotSerious irregularities in Patna Smart City projectDeputy CM Tarkishore Prasad admitted in the legislative council that the departmental committee had detected serious anomalies in settlement of tender for development of integrated control command project—a component of Patna Smart City project—and hence cancelled it.

04-03-2021||Delhi||A clean act: Youngsters give a new lease of life to these Delhi walls||One fine Sunday, the residents of Rohini woke up to the sight of some walls getting rid of garbage and getting a splash of bright colours at the hands of 40 youngsters! The walls in the area around Sai Baba temple in Rohini had mounds of garbage lining the dilapidated walls, for the longest time. “The place, in spite of being frequented by so many people, had been a mess for years. The walls were stained and an eyesore. So we decided to have our weekly cleanliness drive in Rohini,” says Shankar Singh, a 23-year-old software engineer, and founder of the NGO Vrikshit Foundation, which lead the group that gave a makeover to this nook. Environment conscious youngsters had gathered from around the city to take up this task. Lakshita Gupta, a Sanskrit (Hons) student at Miranda House college, Delhi University, says, “At the drive, we were provided with all the equipments like gloves and masks. It took us 15 hours to clean up and paint the whole place, but to see people click selfies there once we were done, was worth it!”“For the clean up, I travelled on my bicycle from Greater Noida upto Rohini,” says Bichitrananda Rout, another member of the group, adding, “I believe our environment can only be changed by individuals who implement a conscious and responsible behaviour.” And Rohini residents are ecstatic at the revamp, and express enthusiasm to maintain their surroundings henceforth. “These kids have executed what the local bodies couldn’t. We have been filing complaints for five years now, but to no avail. We are extremely proud and thankful for what these kids have done for us,” says Umesh Gugarwaal, a resident in the neighbouring locality.But this isn’t the first place that these young volunteers have worked upon to sanitise and beautify surroundings in the Capital. Singh adds, “I started the NGO after being inspired by cleanliness drives conducted on Mumbai’s beaches... We run cleanliness drives across the city because we want to send a message that this is as much our responsibility as it is of the government. It is a collective responsibility and we also inform the locals about our efforts so that they feel involved in the upkeep of the place. So far we have cleaned over 200 locations in the country, and the activities are funded from our salaries and pocket money.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-clean-act-youngsters-give-a-new-lease-of-life-to-these-delhi-walls-101614844059101.html
04-03-2021||Other||Taste of life: The leaf cups vs brass bowls debate swings an election||In 1935, the Government of India Act granted a large measure of autonomy to the provinces in British India. The Act abolished diarchy and introduced direct elections, increasing the franchise from seven million to 35 million people. Accordingly, provincial elections were held in the winter of 1936 - 37. While the election campaign was going on, on December 5, 1936, a letter written by one Dattopant Supekar appeared in the Marathi newspaper “Jnanaprakash”. It asserted the importance of the forthcoming elections and urged the residents of Pune to choose their representatives wisely. But, it also admonished the candidates and their followers for downgrading the level of public discourse. “We are supposed to elect our representatives to the Legislative Assembly, and what are some people talking about? Plates and bowls! Why is this even a topic of discussion? We should concentrate on issues of national importance. Let us not worry about which bowls to use when one is hosting a feast”, the letter said. Though this letter did not name anyone, the jab about “plates and bowls” was clearly directed at Bhaskar Balwant, alias Bhausaheb Bhopatkar, who, six years earlier, had endorsed the use of bowls made of brass, instead of leaf cups.Bhopatkar was a leading lawyer, who in April 1905, had launched a Marathi newspaper named “Bhaala” (Spear) to support staunch Hindu nationalism and equally staunch orthodoxy. Bhopatkar and “Bhaala” played a very important role in the socio-political scenario of 20th century Maharashtra.In May 1931, he wrote a small article in his newspaper condemning the practice of using leaf bowls, or cups, and plates during feasts. Small sticks used to put the plates and bowls together often caused injuries, he argued. Eggplant and potato curry, spiced buttermilk, rice and lentils was the common menu then, and the leaf cup filled with buttermilk would be supported between the mound of rice and the thick curry. According to Bhopatkar, this was not a pretty sight. The buttermilk would spill over and the plates often tore up. The solution was to give up the practice of using leaf cups and plates and to switch to brass utensils. Unlike several leaders of those times,Bhopatkar did not ignore the socio-political impact of rituals and behaviour related to food. He made it a point to make his readers aware about what he thought were the best practices when it came to cooking and devouring food.Charity dinners were in vogue in Great Britain and British India in the early 20th century. Bhopatkar emulated those and started the tradition of commemorating the death anniversary of Lokmanya Tilak by organising charity lunches. The menu would be sheera (suji ka halwa), potato curry, puri and rice. The event was quite popular in Pune for several years after 1923, and was known as Lokmanya Bhojan. For many years, he would distribute sheera near Tulsibaug on the birth anniversary of Tilak.Bhopatkar clearly loved sheera. Around 1930, a movement was launched by some Gandhian followers to oppose tea and tea shops in Maharashtra. Sugarcane juice was endorsed as a substitute for tea. Young men were encouraged to open sugarcane juice parlours in Bombay and Poona. Bhopatkar wholeheartedly supported the move, but at the same time wrote that people who did not like sugarcane juice should continue drinking tea if they wished so. The British always ate something while having tea, so one should ideally have some sheera with lots of almonds and ghee with tea, he wrote. If one could not afford eating sheera everyday, non- Brahmins should open bakeries and bake biscuits for Brahmins, he opined. When elections were announced in 1936, Bhopatkar decided to contest. His brother, LB alias Annasaheb Bhopatkar, was contesting too on the Democratic Swarajya Party ticket. Both campaigned against each other. While swadeshi, autonomy, untouchability were the bigger topics of discussions, the issue of use of leaf bowls/cups and plates too cropped up, albeit inadvertently.If Bhausaheb were elected, he would make the use of brass utensils mandatory, people were told during a couple of rallies. This obviously did not go well with some, because using brass utensils meant spending much more money for the feasts. Many voters were annoyed because this was hardly an issue for them and they hated that it was being discussed, albeit on a small scale, during such an important event.The Bhopatkar brothers lost the election, not entirely due to the unwarranted attention towards leaf cups. Nevertheless, the discussion around the use of leaf cups continued with much gusto for a few years after the elections were over. Bhopatkar actively campaigned for the abandonment of leaf cups, because the issue had generated a renewed interest during the elections. Pune slowly gave up on them and embraced brass/aluminium and later, stainless steel utensils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-the-leaf-cups-vs-brass-bowls-debate-swings-an-election-101614844055121.html

Research scholars also turn up here to research his writings,” Dakshineshwar Renu, son of Phanishwar Nath Renu, said before adding, “The literary potential of the village can be tapped and be used as a tourism product.”Researchers from China, Russia, UK and Uzbekistan keep visiting the village for research work. The village also gets many visitors from Nepal, where he spent many years and even participated in the political movement.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had got Renu Bhawan built in the village at a cost of ₹two crore but tourism infrastructure needs to be developed for customized tour packages, says Renu’s son.Also Read: Regional languages to be medium of instruction in Bihar's elementary schoolsDr Ram Bachan Roy, a noted writer, former member of the legislative council and one of the close associates of Renu ji, recalled him as a “multifaceted personality”.

He added that the state government was providing benefits of welfare schemes to all people without any discrimination.Making an intervention during the debate on the state Budget, he alleged that the previous governments used a ‘pick and choose’ policy to identify beneficiaries of welfare schemes, while his government was committed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ mantra.“The Muslim population in UP is 17-19%, but their share in the benefits of welfare schemes is 30-35%,” he said, drawing attention of SP member and Leader of Opposition (LoP) Ahmad Hasan.

04-03-2021||Business||Industry captains seek ease of Karnataka curbs on iron ore export and sale||The southern chapter of the Federation of Indian Minerals Industries (FIMI) on Wednesday made a representation to the Karnataka government expressing the distress on the sector due to restrictions on sale and exports of iron ore.“There is a peculiar disparity in the state of Karnataka owing to the restrictions, where the steel industry is free to import from other states and countries while the miners are restricted to sell through e-auction only to the end users around the state,” according to the letter addressed to the government.FIMI said this has added the ‘artificial oversupply’ of iron ore in the state leading to depressing prices and leaving large quantities unsold and huge stockpiles in the mines.FIMI said the restrictions have led to an estimated revenue loss of ₹3,000 crore per annum to the state.The legal entanglement for auctions of existing stockpiles and export restrictions from the state by the Supreme Court (SC) almost a decade ago (2011) among other authorities has forced Karnataka to pursue a cautious approach, adding to delays, unrealised potential and loss of revenues, industry leaders and officials said.“(The) Government should look into expediting e-auctions and whatever reserves are there, they should explore and auction it. They (the government) will get a huge amount of revenue out of that,” Vinod Nowal, Deputy Managing Director, JSW Steel Ltd, said.He added that the e-auction process exists, but fresh areas need to be explored and all clearances should be expedited.In October last year, FIMI had estimated that the state endured ₹29,000 crore losses due to the ban on iron ore exports.Iron ore mining in Karnataka is a political hot potato after the issue led to the collapse of the first Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the south. B.S.Yediyurappa, then (and incumbent) chief minister of Karnataka, had to relinquish power after the political face-off against his own cabinet colleague, Gali Janardhana Reddy from the mineral-rich district of Ballari, about 320 km from Bengaluru. A report by then Lokayukta, Justice N. Santosh Hegde, had detailed the extent of illegal mining, losses to the state exchequer and large-scale and irreversible degradation of the environment in areas by mining lords, including the infamous ‘Reddy brothers’.“The mining industry in Karnataka has not lived up to its potential. It is a big travesty that when you have ore in Karnataka, you are bringing it from Odisha. It makes absolutely no sense,” Basant Poddar, former chairman and current member of the FIMI, said.Poddar estimates that Karnataka has barely auctioned 15% of its capability that has left the industry at the mercy of piling costs, shortage of iron ore and without any imminent reprieve.Despite the huge iron ore reserves in Karnataka, large corporations like JSW have depended on Odisha to make up for shortfalls.“Iron ore for steel industry is in short supply in Karnataka and we are bringing it from Odisha which has a logistical problem,” Nowal said, adding that the company brings in about 3-4 million tonnes of ore from Odisha to make up for at least 15% shortage in the state.He said that logistics cost in India is about 2.5 times more than global costs, adding to piling up operational expenses.The state government has reached out to the Centre to expedite clearance requests for at least four pending proposals of the Karnataka State Minerals Corporation Ltd.“Exploration activities are underway in about 24 blocks in the state. But all of this depends on clearances from the forest department and the Centre,” said a senior official at the state mines and geology department, requesting anonymity.Several petitions have been filed by the industry in the SC for some relief, FIMI added.There are about 25 major mineral licensees operating in Karnataka, according to government data. Industry leaders also point out the deputation of inexperienced and incompetent officials to the mines and geology department, leaving the sector at the mercy of a complex bureaucratic process.Poddar said the impact of restrictions is being felt largely by the micro, small and medium enterprises, which do not have deep pockets to compete against big corporations.He said Goa is now importing iron ore from South Africa. He added that ore was being sold at $50 per tonne in Karnataka whereas the price is around $150 per tonne in exports.Meanwhile, environmentalists believe that unscrupulous mining is leading to widespread destruction of fragile ecosystems in the state. “Mining licences are given without any thought or consideration for the environment. This is a revenue-oriented approach with mindless growth and reckless development,” AN Yellappa Reddy, a noted environmentalist, said.Environmentalists have also raised the issue of the large-scale and irreversible damage done to the ecology in areas like Ballari, Chitradurga and other places. Thousands of crores from district mining funds, rehabilitation and other purposes remain unused in the 10 years since the SC judgement on Karnataka, experts said.While iron ore mining is strictly monitored, other forms of mining like stone and sand are being carried almost unregulated in the state, according to officials and industry leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/industry-captains-seek-ease-of-karnataka-curbs-on-iron-ore-export-and-sale-101614832344050.html

The decision was announced by deputy chief minister-cum-finance minister Chowna Mein while tabling the state’s annual budget in the Arunachal Pradesh assembly on Wednesday. “I am happy to announce a major initiative to develop three model villages on a pilot basis in the Indo-Tibet China border areas, one each in eastern, central and western part of the state. I propose to earmark a fund of ₹30 crore for the same,” the budget speech read. Also Read | China using Covid-19 pandemic to increase restrictions for foreign journalists“These model villages would serve as pilot projects which will be further expanded to cover many more such villages. The scheme would encompass innovative ways to dovetail socio-economic cultural needs of village life while establishing the model villages,” it added. Mein said that services of border guarding forces would be roped in to design and implement the scheme. Arunachal Pradesh shares an 1126km-long border with China. Due to high altitude and inhospitable terrain, most of these border areas are not clearly marked and there have been reports of incursions in past. In January this year, there were reports that China had constructed a village in the border area in Upper Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. Indian officials later stated that the area has been under Chinese control since 1959. “It is of critical importance that areas near the international border are rapidly developed so that a permanent and patriotic border population acts as a check against any foreign misadventure,” Mein said in his speech. “Development of border villages will remain an important priority of our government. We will continue to work for the comprehensive development of border villages by providing them good road connectivity, power, water supply, health and education,” he added. Mein proposed the allocation of ₹5 crore to repair foot suspension bridges in border areas used by the border guarding forces for patrolling. The minister also earmarked ₹40 crore to start a border village illumination programme, which would involve setting up small and micro hydro-power projects in remote border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/arunachal-to-develop-3-villages-on-china-border-to-check-foreign-misadventure-101614832775315.html

The latest setback follows the desertion of party’s lone member of the Bihar Legislative Council (MLC), Nutan Singh, to the BJP.“No, they are not our leaders. Some of them were thrown out of the party months ago, there are many who are not even the primary members,” said Raju Tiwari, executive chairman, LJP, claiming the desertion ‘was blown out of proportion.’Tiwari claimed that some deserters were followers of former LJP state general secretary Vishwanath Prasad Kushwaha, who joined the BJP. “He has been out of our party fold for the past many months. If a few people join the BJP under his leadership, it should not be seen as a split in our party,” said Tiwari.BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal welcomed the switch. “As many as 175 leaders, ranging from state to district and block level office bearers, besides panchayat presidents of the LJP chose to join the BJP. We welcome them in our party,” Jaiswal said.Former LJP state general secretary Vishwanath Prasad Kushwaha, state general secretary Dalit Sena, former district president Shyamnand Prasad and district secretary Birju Thakur among others joined the BJP in presence of state president Sanjay Jaiswal here.“Some of us had resigned last year as we were feeling suffocated in the LJP. The party is reduced to a drawing room organisation, where even old party workers don’t have access to Chirag Paswan. Hence, they preferred to join the BJP” said Vishwanath Prasad Kushawaha, ex-member Bihar state executive committee and in-charge Sitamarhi district affairs.Also Read: 'Rahul Gandhi’s take on Emergency is his personal opinion,' says CM Nitish KumarThe desertions have gathered pace LJP following the party’s dismal showing in Bihar Assembly elections last year, when it could win only one seat.On February 22, Nutan Singh, wife of Bihar minister and BJP MLA Neeraj Kumar Singh, and the lone LJP MLC joined the BJP, preceded by more than 200 mid-level and lower-rung leaders who joined the Janata Dal United or the JD(U) in Bihar.“We have been associated with Ram Vilasji for about 37 years. But Chirag is totally inaccessible to the old party workers. There is no respect for the workers in the party and hence the circumstances forced us to resign in November last year. But nothing was done to keep the old leaders in the party,” said Premchand Hazra, ex-West Champaran district general secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/175-ljp-functionaries-join-bjp-party-disowns-turncoats-101614830285665.html
04-03-2021||Bangalore||Unfulfilled promises, lack of new projects loom large over Karnataka government||Karnataka chief minister B.S.Yediyurappa is scheduled to present the state budget for 2021-22 on March 8 even as the cloud of poor expenditure numbers, lack of infrastructure and failure to fulfil projects and schemes announced in the previous budget looms large over the two-year-old government.While the government claims to have performed to the “best of their abilities” given the financial constraints during the previous year, the lack of visible schemes and programmes aimed at mitigating the plight of the people in the calamity-prone state is likely to weigh in on the performance of the government.“Whether it is roads, water or jobs under MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), we have performed exceedingly well,” KS Eshwarappa, Karnataka’s minister for rural employment and panchayat raj (RDPR), said.He said that the ‘Grameena Sumarga’, a scheme for the construction of rural roads, was probably the only one impacted due to the fund crunch.The sentiment, however, is not shared by the opposition or BJP’s own legislators, who complain over the lack of work in their respective constituencies.“It is our government only in name. There is absolutely no work happening in our constituency,” said a BJP legislator, requesting anonymity.At least two other BJP legislators mirrored the sentiment, adding that turncoat ministers and even the opposition party legislators were given more preference than core-party workers, who had helped the party get 104 seats in the 2018 elections.Several BJP legislators have met the central leadership in the past months to express their concerns about the state government that has further soured relations between Yediyurappa and the party high command.Already under pressure over rising dissent, factionalism, scandals and a threat to this own term in the top office, Yediyurappa has struggled to find a balance to manage expectations of the state as well as to initiate schemes that would not just help his own political goals but also that of the party that faces the assembly polls in 2023.According to 2020-21 budget estimates, Karnataka was set to lose at least ₹20,000 crore due to reduction in share of central taxes, goods and services tax (GST) and the new calculations, under the 15th Finance Commission, have reduced the state’s share from 4.71% to 3.64%.“If they have borrowed double the permissible limit, it probably makes up for more than the loss of revenues. So where has this money gone?” Krishna Byre Gowda, former minister and Congress legislator, asked.He said the reduction in revenue was a narrative spun by the government to make up for its non-performance.The government has expressed its helplessness repeatedly but has so far only passively pursued the Centre to release funds for flood relief and other financial help to sustain itself.Yediyurappa had increased cess on petrol, diesel and on liquor to mitigate the fund-crunch at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year.The government is likely to feel the pinch of the fund-crunch as demands by labour-intensive sectors like Anganwadi workers, civic workers in Bengaluru, transport corporation workers among other sections intensify agitation seeking higher wages.Revenue expenditure or payment of salaries, servicing loans and pension payouts account for a lion’s share of the state’s earnings and the BJP government had estimated an increase of approximately ₹10,000 crore for 2020-21.Departments like RDPR, which depend on central and state grants, have shown an expenditure of over 90%.Irrigation and industries department expenditure is also near 100%, at least three senior government officials said.Yediyurappa has spent a better portion of his two-year tenure as CM trying to douse one crisis after another, including dissent, dissatisfaction over cabinet berths and uncertainty over his continuation in the top chair among other challenges with little time dedicated for new schemes or developments. He has focused on setting up caste-specific boards that have been criticised by the opposition and even challenged in courts.Yediyurappa had announced an additional assistance of ₹4,000 along with the ₹6,000 announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government to small and marginal farmers under the “Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Scheme”.The pitiable state of roads and infrastructure in Bengaluru, the state’s growth engine and India’s IT capital, paints a poor picture of the government.The 2020-21 budget had allocated ₹8,344 crore for the city’s development.“There are no schemes that have some recall value that have been announced in the budget. Soon after the budget, the lockdown has washed away the memory of most of the announcements made in the budget,” said a political analyst, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/unfulfilled-promises-lack-of-new-projects-loom-large-over-karnataka-government-101614830006990.html

They stated that the child’s mother had been unwell and had been advised bedrest. So, in 2019 she and the child temporarily shifted to Nashik to stay with her mother.Also Read | Bombay HC asks Amazon to take down film over actor’s defamation caseThe child was admitted to a school in Nashik and after recuperating, the woman and child were ready to return to Pune for the 2020-21 academic session, but could not in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the woman returned to Pune whereas the child, by then admitted to an international school at Pune, was undergoing lessons online while staying in Nashik.However, when the couple later went to Nashik to bring back the child to Pune, his grandmother refused to part with him. She approached police and the child welfare committee, claiming that there was a matrimonial dispute between the parents, which was adversely affecting the 12-year-old, and it was in the best interest of the child that he stay with her.The couple then moved the high court for custody of their child.A high court bench comprising justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale accepted their contention, holding that “the ordinary comfort of the child, his contentment, health, education, physical, moral and intellectual development, upbringing and well-being, as also his future certainly lies with his parents.”What weighed with the judges were the facts that the father of the child was an electrical engineer at a senior post in a multinational company, whereas grandmother did not appear to be educated and her financial condition also did not appear to be sound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/grandmas-bond-with-grandchild-special-but-she-can-t-replace-parents-bombay-hc-101614829535076.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Digitised PDS: Now, automatic food vending machines to be set up||The Union government is likely to gradually move towards automatic dispensing machines to provide subsidised food grains to nearly 800 million beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act. The shift is aimed at bringing transparency, plugging leakages, and ushering in real-time management of the country’s food stocks.Trial runs to dispense monthly quota of food grains to the poor through automatic machines are being carried out in five cities, including Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.The initiative is part of the food ministry’s programme to modernise the public distribution system (PDS), a chain of over 400,000 traditional fair price shops which serve as the endpoint for disbursal of cheap food to beneficiaries.Also Read | 4 million Aadhaar-linked PDS cardholders avail foodgrains in BiharThe government now provides subsidised grains to the poor through the “One Nation One Ration Card” digital system, which offers the mobility of in-kind subsidies, which allows beneficiaries to draw their ration from anywhere in the country and not necessarily from their usual place of stay. This is a boon for the country’s vast migrant labour force.“Automatic grain dispensing machines are being tested in five cities on a pilot basis that enables beneficiaries to obtain subsidized food grains without having to visit a fair price shop,” an official said, requesting anonymity.In the automated machines being experimented with, beneficiaries have to feed some simple inputs about their ration card along with biometric-based authentication into the internet-linked machine, which then dispenses the monthly quota of grains.The PDS is a lifeline for the nearly 800 million food-insecure Indians who receive cheap food of 5 kg grains per month per beneficiary from government-held granaries.India ranks 94 among 107 countries on the Global Hunger Index 2020 and is placed in the “serious hunger category” with a score of 27.2.“With automated machines, not only will beneficiaries have more ease to access the benefits because these machines will be conveniently deployed but the government will also have a real-time update of food movements across the country,” the official said.According to Aaditya Verma of The Northcap University, Gurugam, an expert on the PDS, the “existing ration distribution system has a high level of corruption such as inaccurate measurement of food grains, long waiting times in queues, material theft in ration shops and manual distribution of the food grains”. A fully automated model will offer “high levels transparency” at all the stages.The “One Nation One Ration Card” system now covers 650 million citizens. The country’s food-rationing system has been fully digitised in 26 states, allowing beneficiaries to receive subsidised food handouts there.A digitised PDS system links Aadhaar biometric details of ration cardholders with their entitlement details, enabling software to allow dispensation of foodgrains to any beneficiary anywhere. Until now, beneficiaries could only get access to rations in their hometowns, which meant those who migrated elsewhere for work lost food aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/digitised-pds-now-automatic-food-vending-machines-to-be-set-up-101614828035391.html

04-03-2021||City||Ahead of Tamil Nadu elections, Sasikala says she will ‘stay away from politics’||Expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader VK Sasikala, who was a close aide of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, said on Wednesday she will “stay away from politics”, an announcement that came amid buzz of her return to the party just weeks ahead of the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.In a two-page statement, Sasikala urged the AIADMK cadre to stay united and defeat the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in the assembly polls. “I never wanted any position, title or power. I’ll always remain grateful to beloved cadre of Puracthi Thalaivi (revolutionary leader, as Jayalalithaa is addressed) and people of Tamil Nadu. I’ll keep away from politics and pray to my akka (sister) whom I’ve always worshipped and the almighty for Puratchi Thalaivi’s golden rule to continue,” she said.“The cadre will have to strive hard to prevent the evil force of DMK from returning to power to ensure the golden rule of Amma continues,” Sasikala added. “I would like to continue my life, as I was executing the vision of Jayalalithaa,” she said.After being released from a Bengaluru prison following the completion of a four-year term in an assets case, Sasikala last month announced her intention to engage in active politics.Earlier on Wednesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the AIADMK would decide on accommodating Sasikala in the ruling party-led alliance for the April 6 assembly polls. The AIADMK, however, ruled out accommodating her or her nephew TTV Dhinakaran-led Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam in the party or in the alliance.After Sasikala’s announcement, BJP state president L Murugan welcomed the move, adding to her call that the DMK should be defeated.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-tamil-nadu-elections-sasikala-says-she-will-stay-away-from-politics-101614809421982.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Big boost for AAP in municipal bypolls; ruling BJP draws blank||A year ahead of elections to Delhi’s municipal corporations, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday won four out of five wards in civic bypolls held on February 28, while the Congress bagged one seat, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has been the ruling party in the three MCDs for 14 years now, drew a blank.Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal said the result were a positive message for his party ahead of the 2022 contest. “The results show that the people of Delhi trust the AAP’s model of good governance,” he said, before accusing the BJP of corruption and misgovernance in the three municipal bodies.In terms of overall vote share, the AAP got 46.1% of the total votes cast. The Congress and the BJP got 27.29% and 21.84% respectively, according to election commission data.Out of the five seats that went to bypolls on February 28, AAP retained three seats that it had won in the 2017 municipal polls, and gained one from the BJP, while losing one to the Congress.The bypoll results are a blow to the BJP -- the party lost all seats with margins varying from 2,700 to 7,000 votes, which are significant given the sizes of wards, indicating the people’s dissatisfaction with the performance of the civic bodies.Of the five wards, the AAP pushed the BJP to second place in four -- Kalyanpuri (margin of 7,043) and Trilokpuri East (margin of 4,986) in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation; and Rohini-C (margin of 2,985 votes) and Shalimar Bagh (margin of 2,705) in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.While the first three were won by the AAP in 2017 municipal polls, too, Shalimar Bagh was won by the BJP in the last municipal polls.The AAP, however, lost Chauhan Banger ward (one of the few wards with a large Muslim population) in east Delhi to the Congress by a margin of 10,642 votes.The five seats fell vacant after four councillors won the assembly elections in 2020 representing the AAP, and one -- Renu Jaju, former BJP councillor from the Shalimar Bagh ward -- died two years ago.During its bypolls campaign, AAP had hit out at the BJP for corruption, mismanagement and flawed policies, which, it alleged, has landed the corporations in a crisis. The BJP, on the other hand, was blaming the ruling party in the Capital for paralysing the corporations by not giving funds on time.“The BJP should resign from the municipal bodies after this miserable defeat and let the municipal polls happen in Delhi right now. People have lost their trust in the BJP. They believe that only the AAP can bring a positive change in the municipal corporations,” AAP’s incharge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak said on Wednesday.Accepting defeat in the bypolls, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said: “We accept the people’s verdict. But this is not the end. We will analyse the results and see where we went wrong. We still have a lot of time to prepare for the municipal polls.”While the Congress won just one seat, Chauhan Banger, the party’s vote share improved as compared to the 2020 assembly polls. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said: “The impressive show by Congress in the by-elections and the victory in Chauhan Banger ward has raised the party’s overall vote share from 6% (in the last Assembly elections) to 22% now.”Rahul Verma, a fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, said, “In terms of overall figures, the AAP was in power in four of these five municipal seats, and they will continue to be in power in four. It has lost one seat and gained one. There is not much difference as far as the numbers are concerned. However, I would still say the party has much better prospects in the 2022 municipal polls. They have won the assembly polls with a huge majority for two terms now and the party machinery has strengthened at the grassroots level.”Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor in the department of political science at Ramjas College, said, “These are local elections where the candidate matters a lot. In these elections, local issues are of real importance. People have seen and benefitted from AAP’s model of governance. The bypoll result indicates that people are happy with it.”Delhi has 272 municipal wards -- the north and south Delhi corporations have 104 wards each and the east corporation has 64 wards. The BJP has a majority in all three of them with 64, 70 and 47 councillors, respectively. If all three of them are taken together, the AAP and the Congress have 49 and 31 councillors, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/big-boost-for-aap-in-municipal-bypolls-ruling-bjp-draws-blank-101614808258798.html
04-03-2021||Gurugram||Job quota law regressive, say Gurugram industry leaders||Information technology, auto and export companies based in Gurugram on Wednesday said that the Haryana government’s decision to reserve 75% jobs for local job-seekers who have a state domicile will signal that the city and the state were no more business-friendly destinations.While IT industry leaders termed the government’s new law as regressive, industrialists based in Manesar questioned the legality of the quota and said that they were looking for possibilities to challenge the government decision in a court of law as it will enable “another era of inspector raj in the state”.Haryana governor, Satyadev Narayan Arya, on Tuesday gave his assent to the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, which provides for 75% reservation in private sector to job seekers in the state which have a salary of less than ₹50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms. The quota will initially be applicable for 10 years, after it is notified by the government.Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who made the job quota a central plank of his election campaign in 2019, on Wednesday said the state government will begin a massive employment campaign from next month for youths of the state to benefit, as per their qualification and skills.Chautala, however, also made it clear that the government will make an exemption in the reservation if a company fails to find local skilled employees.Stating that there is a provision of penalty if the firms violate rules of this law, he said private companies will have to mandatorily give complete details of their registration and employees on the portal.More than 300 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Gurugram that has emerged as one of the largest IT and ITes hub in the country with several top companies setting up operations in the last two decades. It is also home to large auto and auto part makers such as Maruti, Hero Moto Corp and Honda, while garment exports also forms a major chunk of industry.Vinod Sood, managing director, Hughes Systiqe and chair, NASSCOM, Haryana, said that the new law and will send a very wrong message to MNCs and IT companies, which are headquartered abroad. “While all other states in India are coming up with forward-looking policies, this reservation will create a perception that Gurugram is no longer a business-friendly destination. Companies abroad don’t want to get into such technicalities and their immediate response would be to expand or shift to Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad. The reservations might have some caveats, but optics are bad, and don’t augur well for the city,” said Sood.IT companies also said that instead of imposing reservations there is need to skill train local youths for these jobs.“We appreciate the desire of the government to create jobs for local youths. However, it is ironic that an industry that competes around the world and brings nearly ₹5 lakh crore in foreign exchange into India will have to deal with these restrictions that may hamper its operations and efficiency. We are also nervous that the current scope of reservations may be expanded later. We believe the best way to expand opportunities for youth is equipping them with skills,” Manas Fuloria, CEO, Nagarro, a city-based IT company.Industrialists based in Manesar were also worried that the job reservations will bring back the era of ‘inspector raj’ and it would be difficult to run industrial units. “Where are the workers in Haryana who are experts in leather cutting, fabric stitching, cutting, weaving. These jobs need talent and is mastered when generations work on the same skill set. This move will destroy the export industry and other manufacturing units in Gurugram and Haryana. We are looking for options to challenge this move in a court of law,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association, who heads an export company.The Confederation of Indian Industry’s Haryana chapter said that Haryana was already facing a tough competition in attracting industrial investment as other states are offering liberal industrial policies and employment incentive schemes. The government’s new move will prove to be quite the deterrent to bring in new investments.“The law will act as a blow to the industry-friendly image of Haryana. This law is detrimental to the economic growth of Haryana and will impact existing businesses present in the state by slowing down investments and further deteriorating the state’s ease of doing business ranking,” said Anadi Sinha, vice chairman, CII Gurugram zone and group president - HR and corporate affairs, Minda Industries Ltd, which has large presence in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/job-quota-law-regressive-say-gurugram-industry-leaders-101614806817165.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Maha cops force girls to strip, govt orders probe||he Maharashtra government formed a four-member committee to probe an incident in which girls were allegedly forced to strip and dance by policemen at a hostel in Jalgaon, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Wednesday.Deshmukh made the announcement during a debate on the issue during zero hour in the Assembly, when Bharatiya Janata Party leader Sudhir Mungantiwar attacked the government for the alleged failure of law and order situation.According to media reports, some girls from Ashadeep hostel in Jalgaon complained that people from outside and policemen were allowed to enter the facility on the pretext of a probe and some girls were forced to strip and dance. The incident took place on February 2.Raising the issue in the assembly, BJP MLA from Chikhali, Buldhana, Shweta Mahale said that a video of the incident has also surfaced.Deshmukh replied that a team comprising a psychiatrist and a woman police officer has been constituted, assuring action within two days. “It is a very unfortunate incident. A four-member high-level committee of officials has been formed to conduct a probe into it,” he said.“We have been collating the information and the available documentary evidence including video clips. Statements are being recorded. Strict action would be taken against those found guilty after the report is submitted in next two days,” he said.Social workers in the area have filed a complaint with the district collector, Abhijit Raut who formed the four member team. No police complaint has been filed as yet.Mungantiwar accused the state government of not taking the issue seriously. The case is an example of the failed state of law and order, he said, adding that the BJP would seek imposition of President’s rule. “If such type of serious case which proves that our sisters and mothers are not safe... are not taken seriously by the government, it is evident that the law and order here has failed... Take immediate action and suspend policemen involved,” he said.“Our expectation is that you take immediate action sensitively,” the leader of opposition, Devendra Fadnavis said supporting Mungantiwar’s demand for president’s rule.Reacting to the BJP leaders, minority welfare minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik demanded their statements be expunged. “This is a direct threat to the government. Ours is an elected government with full majority,” Malik said. Deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal said, “I will take a call on expunging the proceeding after examining it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-cops-force-girls-to-strip-govt-orders-probe-101614805017849.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The moong masoor ambassador||Surely there’s nothing wrong with moong masoor—but this dal certainly isn’t celebrated much. In restaurants, you are more likely to find dal makhani, not the humble moong masoor. But at least one person’s life in the city revolves around it.“I make it every day for my lunch,” says Muhammed Hashim. A long-time staffer in a central Delhi hotel, Mr Hashim is busy preparing his meal during his midday break. He’s of course making the moong masoor. He has set up his makeshift kitchen on the floor of his room and is quietly chopping onions and tomatoes. Green chilies and dhaniya are already chopped. A pot of dal is on a low flame. “It takes about 20 minutes to cook,” says the gentleman in a voice permeated with extreme politeness.Looking thoughtfully at the pot, he mutters that “my dal is always very simple. Only a little salt and haldi powder. No mirchi. No garam masala.”In his 60s, Mr Hashim lives alone. Nobody taught him the recipe of his favoured dish. He smiles while chopping a tomato with great care. “One lives, one learns,” he declares enigmatically, as if reading aloud a bumper sticker at the back of a truck.To be sure, Mr Hashim admits he has good feelings for a few other dishes, too. “My mother used to make delicious meat curry... my wife and my daughter-in-law too make good meat,” he says. The family lives in the village in Darbhanga, Bihar. “But no other dish can come close to moong masoor... it beats every meat.”Even so, this same masoor day after day after day? Doesn’t his palate rebel?Mr Hashim shakes his head, though he confesses that “sometimes I cook something different... I made gosht (meat) the day before yesterday.” Here he suddenly stops and makes an eye contact with his interlocutor. “I tell you by experience that moong masoor gives more taakat (energy) than the gosht.”He now lifts the lid from the pan to check on the dal. “A few more minutes,” he murmurs. He was sitting cross-legged all this while, but now settles on his haunches and briefly stirs the dal, saying, “After this I’ll make rice and the lunch will be ready.”At night too, he makes his own dinner. “I will again make masoor,” he confirms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-moong-masoor-ambassador-101614804557952.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Budget session: AAP, SAD compete to corner Capt govt||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) vied with each other in the state assembly on Wednesday to corner the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government. The two parties, which are jockeying to dominate the opposition space ahead of next year’s assembly polls, went after the state government from the word go, targeting it over the delay in post-matric scholarships for SC students, irregularities in Mohali land auction, and, last but not least, Uttar Pradesh gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s custody. The SAD and AAP legislators then staged walkouts from the House in quick succession over the delay in the implementation of pay commission and release of dearness allowance instalments, and scrapping of power purchase agreements (PPAS) with private power plants, respectively. As soon as the question hour got over, leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema, SAD legislator Bikram Singh Majithia and several other MLAs of the two opposition parties were up on their feet to draw speaker Rana KP Singh’s attention for time to speak during the zero hour. The speaker allowed Cheema first, and he began by blaming the Congress government for the suffering of lakhs of students due to the failure of the state government to release funds under the scholarship scheme. Citing a reply he received from the Union government under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the LOP accused the government of diverting the scheme funds and not submitting the utilisation certificates to the central ministry. Majithia, who was the next to speak, tore into the Congress government over custody of Ansari, who is facing trial in UP in several criminal cases. Accusing the Punjab government of shamelessly shielding the gangster-turned-politician, the Akali leader demanded a CBI inquiry. He said when the state government did not have the money to implement the pay commission and release dearness and other allowances of its employees, it was wasting money. However, his remarks on efforts being made by the state government in the court in this matter were expunged by the speaker. A Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau, Ansari, is wanted in UP for trial in 14 cases on charges of murder, extortion, etc. He is lodged since January 2019 in a jail in Punjab where he was named in an extortion case by a builder. Then, the SAD members asked for a discussion on the 6th State Pay Commission and the state government’s reluctance to give Punjab scales to its employees, but were not given time. The members responded by entering the well of the House, raising slogans against the state government. They continued raising slogans for six minutes before staging the walkout. Within minutes, slogan-shouting legislators of the AAP were also in the well of the House to protest against the high power rates in Punjab, repeated tariff hikes and the delay in scraping of power purchase agreements with private power plants. The party MLAs had also marched from the MLA Hostel to the state assembly in the morning to register their protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-budget-session-aap-sad-compete-to-corner-capt-govt-101614802353992.html

Now, the family members of Rajvansh — her brother Padamjit Singh and second brother Kamaljit Singh’s family have a dispute over property. Priya, who was in a relationship with Chetan Anand, elder brother of actor Dev Anand, was murdered in 2000 in Mumbai. She died issueless.The high court had ordered CBI probe in October on the plea of Padamjit Singh, 84, a former United Nations executive living in the US, who alleged that a petition filed on July 8, 2020, using his name was not, in fact, filed by him.The July 8 plea had claimed that Padamjit never sold his 50% share of the property to a woman named Pritam Kaur. However, Padamjit ’s affidavit in August 2020 stated that he had sold his share of property to the woman and that he had authorised none to file the July 8 plea. When the lawyer appearing in the July 8 petition was questioned, he told court that the matter was brought to him by another lawyer and all requisite permissions to file the plea were obtained on mail.Subsequently, the HC had sought response from all parties involved, including family members of the NRI’s brother, who had further given power of attorney to a third person, and the woman who had bought the property. The HC bench of Justice Jitendra Chauhan and Justice Vivek Puri has sought fresh status report by April 29 and directed the registry to provide all the necessary original documents to the inquiry officer of the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-sector-5-property-grab-case-hc-seeks-fresh-status-report-from-cbi-101614801993784.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||6 years on, UT industrial policy remains a non-starter||Six years have passed since the UT administration notified the Chandigarh Industrial Policy, 2015 — which was considered as the panacea for city’s industry problems — but it still largely remains only on paper.The policy assured to boost ease of doing business, ease of transfer of property, promoting city’s industry at national and international levels, development of infrastructure in the industrial area, and a preferential procurement policy for the city’s industry. Industry was allotted dedicated sectors — industrial area phases 1 and 2 in the original city plan. But it took another 60 years for an industrial policy to come up. Phases 1 and 2 have 1,884 plots spread over 150 acres.“In the last five years, the number of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) decreased by nearly 35% and industrial workforce shrank by around 20%. Nearly 40% space in the twin industrial areas is lying vacant,” said Naveen Manglani, president, Chambers of Chandigarh Industry.Ease of doing businessOn top of the policy assurances was facilitating ‘ease of doing business’ by creating a robust single-window system, and a common application form compatible with the electronic platform.Manglani, said, “For setting up a new industry or expanding an established one, one has to run pillar to post in the city. There are multiple government agencies from which one needs to get permissions and approvals. There is also no set time for granting these. It is high time an effective single-window system gets introduced in the city.”Ease of transfer of propertyWith nearly 75% of the industrial area allotted on the leasehold basis, the policy assured facilitating clear title of land to the allottees.“Allowing transfer of leasehold of property to freehold property and even to leasehold property is pending for so many years even though the policy assured it,” said Arun Mahajan, secretary, Industries Association of Chandigarh.Industrialists complaint that the leasehold property has created obstacles in getting loans for industry expansion.“When the property title is not clear, banks are not keen in lending money. Lots of properties have been transferred on general power of attorney, which is now not being recognised by the UT administration that further complicates the property rights. There is also an issue of exorbitant charge of unearned profit in transfer of leasehold to leasehold,” Mahajan added.Other promisesPromoting the industry at the national and international levels is also an important feature of the policy, which only remains on paper.Similarly, a preferential procurement policy was to be formulated for city industry so that they could get preference when the administration make procurements.“A centre of excellence was to be set up, time-bound schedule for clearance of investor application was assured, and marketing assistance was to be given. Industry is still waiting for it,” Siddharth Gupta, a city-based entrepreneur, said.UT adviser Manoj Parida, said, “Central government’s policy on industry is being strictly followed. In UT, single window is available for all departments, including industry. There are certain policy decisions, like land use, which require ministry of home affairs’ approval. All other incentives by central government like MSME, finance, loan and mortgage are being given. If industry associations have some proposals, they are welcome for discussions.”Promised, but not delivered||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6-years-on-ut-industrial-policy-remains-a-nonstarter-101614801873849.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh house grabbed: Journo’s six bank accounts traced||A day after a journalist and a realtor were arrested for forcibly grabbing a 48-year-old man’s house in Sector-37, the police on Wednesday traced the former’s six bank accounts and conducted searches at his house in Sector 37. The scribe, Sanjeev Mahajan, and property dealer Manish Gupta are accused of kidnapping and torturing the victim, Rahul Mehta, 48, the only surviving heir of his family, to secure the general power of attorney (GPA) of his 338 square yards house, and selling it to Manish’s brother Saurabh Gupta in March 2019.Besides Sanjeev and Saurabh, others named in the FIR are Khalendra Singh Kadyan and liquor contractor Arvind Singla, to whom the GPA was transferred; Satpal Daggar, brother of a UT DSP; Ashok Arora, slain bouncer Surjit Singh, Shekhar and Daljit Singh. Police also questioned Arvind on Wednesday with regards to the disappearance of Rahul, who was left at a stud farm in Gujarat in 2017, before being shifted to various ashrams in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and New Delhi, where he is now lives in a similar facility.Police are also looking into the role of several cops, as the FIR details that the meeting regarding the deal of the house was held at the office of Satpal’s cop brother. The FIR also mentions the name of the then Sector 39 station house officer (SHO), who failed to take action on allegations of assault and forcible ouster of Rahul’s tenant. Police have yet to question these officials. “We are verifying the allegations. Everyone, whose name crops up in the probe, will be investigated,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-house-grabbed-journo-s-six-bank-accounts-traced-101614801755139.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Oppn lambasts Capt govt on poll promises, treasury benches count ‘achievements’||The opposition — Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — on Wednesday cornered the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab for “failing to fulfil any of the promises” made to people ahead of the 2017 assembly polls in the last four years. The treasury benches, however, claimed to have fulfilled all the promises, saying the Congress was headed for a victory repeat in the 2022 Punjab polls. During the debate on the governor’s address on the third day of the budget session, Akali MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu said the Congress government is charging ₹11 per unit of electricity against its promise of cheaper power at ₹5 per unit. “Even the poor, scheduled caste and backward class consumers are being forced to pay the high tariffs. The Congress will not be voted back to the power as it has deprived poor Dalit students of education. Many were denied their degrees since the 2018 session for not depositing fees as their scholarships funds were never paid to them,” added Tinu. He accused state justice minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot of embezzling ₹56 crore from scholarship funds last year and was then being given a clean chit by the CM. Without naming anyone, the MLA raised questions on the appointment of a principal adviser to the chief minister. “He accepted a monthly salary of ₹1 and has been given all the perks and facilities of a cabinet minister. It needs to be disclosed by the government as how many crores he will be getting under the table,” asked Tinu. AAP legislator Meet Hayer demanded registration of a criminal case against the newly appointed principal adviser to CM, as he had showed big dreams ahead of the 2017 polls. His party colleague Budh Ram raked the issue of sacrilege of the Sikh holy book in 2015, accusing the government of failing to take any action in this regard. “Punjabi University, Patiala, is under a loss of ₹400 crore and the teachers have not been given salaries for 3 months. Dearness allowance (DA) to the state government employees has not been paid,” he added.SAD’s Sharanjeet Singh Dhillion accused the Capt government of playing fraud upon farmers of Punjab. “Against its promise to waive debt to the tune of ₹90,000 crore, only a small fragment of ₹4,625 crore (5%) was waived. The sewa kendras set up by the previous government were shut and 6,000 people were rendered jobless,” he said. Defending the ruling party’s record, Congress MLA Tarsem Singh DC said the government has done its best to fulfill the promises made to people. Also, party’s Navtej Singh Cheema wondered as why everyone was so scared of the new adviser (to CM). “We are going to pull out an impressive victory in the 2022 polls on the basis of our government’s good work,” he added. Countering the AAP’s claims, health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the government did its best to handle the coronavirus pandemic and its response was better than Delhi’s. AAP’s Aman Arora said, “Before becoming MLA, I used to think that the governor’s address is a pious document and every word written in it is a truth. But I found that it has imaginary things mentioned which never happened on the ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oppn-lambasts-capt-govt-on-poll-promises-treasury-benches-count-achievements-101614801753892.html

04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Will urge Centre for funds to raise honorarium of mid-day meal workers: Punjab school edu minister||School education minister Vijay Inder Singla on Wednesday said that the state government will request the Central government for additional funds to enhance to honorarium of cooks-cum-helpers to ₹3,000 per month under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme. Responding to BJP MLA Arun Narang’s question regarding the action being taken by the state government to enhance the monthly honorarium of mid-day meal workers to ₹3,000 from ₹1,700 in the state, the minister said that since MDM was a centrally sponsored scheme, the state government would take it up with the central government. “The scheme is jointly funded by the central and state government on 60:40 sharing basis. However, the Centre contributes on ₹600 and the state government is giving more than its agreed share,” he said, pointing out that the honorarium was increased by ₹500 per month by the present government in 2017. When Narang reminded the minister of the Congress’ poll promise to hike to increase their honorarium to ₹3000 per month, Singla said the department would also take up the matter with the finance department. Punjab’s ODF status questioned AAP MLA Aman Kumar Arora questioned the open defecation free (ODF) status of districts, blocks and villages in the state. The member, who asked the government about the procedure adopted for declaration of ODF and the funds spent on construction of toilets between 2017-18 and 2020-21, said there were several villages across the state where people were still defecating in the open and no toilets had constructed. In response to his question, water supply and sanitation minister Razia Sultana said that all districts, blocks and villages were open defecation free and ₹415.72 crore were spent from 2017-18 to 2020-21 on building toilets. The MLA urged the speaker to set up a committee to visit to check if toilets had been built in all villages and people were still defecating in the open. However, the speaker refused his request, saying that a committee cannot be set up during the question hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-urge-centre-for-funds-to-raise-honorarium-of-mid-day-meal-workers-punjab-school-edu-minister-101614801213883.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra ATS arrests major drug supplier from Himachal Pradesh||The Maharashtra Anti-terrorism squad (ATS), in a covert operation on Saturday, arrested a hotelier from Kullu district in Himachal Pradesh for allegedly supplying charas to Mumbai, Pune, and other parts of the state for several years. He was brought to Maharashtra on Tuesday and was produced before a court in Pune on Wednesday. The court has remanded him in police custody till March 9, said a police officer. ATS officers claimed the arrested accused, Roomy Thakur, who runs hotel River View in Kullu, is the kingpin of the drug supply racket and allegedly delivered charas through his people in Mumbai, Pune, Goa and Bengaluru. A team of Maharashtra ATS went to Himachal Pradesh in the last week of December 2020 after Pune government railway police (GRP) arrested Lalitkumar Dayanand Sharma, 50, a travel firm owner; and Kaulsingh Rupsingh, 41, a driver, with 34.4kg of charas. The case transferred to ATS to find out the source of the drugs, the people behind the racket, their distribution network and more importantly, if the gang had any links with terror groups, said an ATS officer.Initial investigation revealed that most of the seized drugs were to be distributed in Mumbai, while 5kg each was to be transported to Bengaluru and Goa, 2kg was meant to be supplied in Pune, said an officer. Deputy inspector general (DIG) Shivdeep Lande of ATS said, “The team had conducted several raids in Himachal Pradesh, following which Thakur’s role became clear. A team was then stationed in Kullu for almost a month. He runs a hotel River View in Kullu”. A dedicated team has been assigned to investigate the case from all possible angles, said an officer.Sharma and Rupsingh, both arrested earlier by Pune GRP, are natives of Himachal Pradesh. Pune GRP had made arrested them after receiving a tip-off about two men travelling from Delhi to Pune by train with drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ats-arrests-major-drug-supplier-from-himachal-pradesh-101614801153747.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Delete scene, withdraw movie from viewing platforms: Bombay HC to Telugu filmmakers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed makers of a Telugu film to withdraw the film from all viewing platforms till they deleted a portion of the film where a photograph of a model and actor was shown as that of a commercial sex worker.The directions were issued after the actor approached the HC seeking damages for defamation from the filmmakers for using her photograph without her permission and in a derogatory manner. The court also directed Amazon Prime to withdraw the film from its portal till the objectionable scene was deleted and the court’s permission was taken for re-releasing the film. A single bench of justice GS Patel, while hearing an interim application in a commercial suit filed by actor Sakshi Malik, was informed by advocates Alankar Kirpekar and Saveena Bedi that while a suit was filed against Venkateswara Creations Pvt Ltd for claiming damages in defamation, the application sought removal of the objectionable scene wherein Malik’s photograph was used without her permission and in a derogatory manner. Kirpekar informed the court that in 2017 the actor commissioned a photographer to make her portfolio after making a mark for herself in Bollywood through songs and movies. The photographer had shared the portfolio with Malik, following which she uploaded some of the photographs on her social media account. The advocates informed the court that a Telugu film released in September 2020 contained a scene showing the photograph of the actor from the portfolio on a mobile screen depicting her as a commercial sex worker. Kirpekar submitted that it was violation of the actor’s privacy and that it was an unauthorised use of private material. He further claimed the nature in which it was used was derogatory. In light of these submissions, Kirpekar sought directions to the filmmakers to delete the scene. The filmmakers represented by advocate Akash Menon, however, informed the court that they had got the photograph from a commercial agency for the scene and it was used only after they were assured that the same could be used legitimately. While agreeing with Kirpekar, justice Patel said, “It seems to me self-evident that it is not possible to use the image of any person for a commercial purpose without express written consent. If images are to be used without such express consent, they must be covered by some sort of legally enforceable and tenable licensing regime, whether with or without royalty. Simply using another’s image, and most especially a private image, without consent is prima facie impermissible, unlawful and entirely illegal.” While directing Amazon Prime, India to stop telecasting the film, the court directed the filmmakers to take down the film from all viewing portals and to delete the entire scene and get an approval from the court before releasing it again. “The entire sequence which has the image of the Plaintiff is to be removed immediately. If the 1st and 2nd Defendants (filmmakers) wish to replace the deleted segments, they are free to do so but without using any of the Plaintiff’s images in any shape, fashion or form without her express written consent. The 3rd Defendant (Amazon) will have 24 hours to discontinue the availability of the film.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delete-scene-withdraw-movie-from-viewing-platforms-bombay-hc-to-telugu-filmmakers-101614801035968.html
04-03-2021||Chandigarh||Indian made foreign liquor to get dearer in Chandigarh||Come April, the Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) is set to cost at least 10% more, while prices of beer and wine are unlikely to increase.In the excise policy 2021-2022 announced on Wednesday, the UT administration has decided to keep the licence fee and excise duty on beer and wine unchanged, but the duty on IMFL has been increased by 6%.This, market experts say, will inflate the prices of popular liquor brands by 10% to 12%.In addition to this, the market price of liquor will also depend on the rate at which liquor vends are auctioned.Cow cess imposed last year will continue to be charged at ₹5 per bottle.With the new policy, the administration expects to rake in a revenue of around ₹700 crore.The number of liquor vends has been increased from 94 to 96. To curb the menace of cartelisation and monopolistic practices, a single entity will be entitled to allotment of a maximum of 10 vends.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, after a detailed presentation with the UT adviser Manoj Parida, secretary (excise and taxation) and other senior officers of the excise department, approved the new excise policy on Wednesday.“The new policy is aimed at balancing the aspirations of the consumers, manufacturers, wholesalers/retailers and the government. After the pandemic setback to the industry, we had to restrict the enhancement to the minimum,” said Parida.Last year, the administration had imposed a 12% increase in the excise duty from 2019. The policy had come into effect from July 1, 2020 after the initial policy announced on March 9, 2020, couldn’t be implemented due to the Covid-19 lockdown.PERKS FOR HOSPITALITY INDUSTRYIn order to boost the hospitality and tourism industries in Chandigarh, the administration has decided against increasing the licence fee of hotels, bars and restaurants.It has also allowed mini-bars at 3-Star and 4-Star hotels in addition to 5-Stars or above category of hotels.Microbrewery licencees can sell draught beer against excise permits to bars, restaurants and clubs by following proper standard safety measures. For this, kegs of up to 50 litres are allowed. Beer shall not be packed in bottles, cans or pouches for sale.No new bottling plant licence will be granted, which Parida termed “a bold and right step”.The basic quota of IMFL has been increased from 100 lakh proof litres (PL) to 110 lakh PL, while the quota of countrymade liquor has been increased from 8 lakh PL to 12 lakh PL.The allotment of licensing units will continue to be made through e-tendering system for transparency, and online system will also be used for issuance of permits and passes.NEW CATEGORY OF BEERTo promote beverages with low-alcoholic content, a new category of beer – super mild beer, containing alcoholic content up to 3.5% – has been introduced. Most of the widely consumed beers contain 4-6% alcohol.The policy has made alcometers mandatory at taverns (ahatas). The facility is already mandatory at bars, restaurants and clubs for voluntary assessment of alcohol level. They also have to post a signage at a proper place, clearly mentioning the permissible limits of consumption of alcohol as per relevant laws, and also mentioning thereof “Be Safe-Don’t Drink and Drive”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/indian-made-foreign-liquor-to-get-dearer-in-chandigarh-101614801034858.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Centre’s role now important in Maratha quota matter: Ashok Chavan||State public works department minister Ashok Chavan, during the question hour in the legislative Council on Wednesday, said the role of Central government is important in Maratha reservation. Chavan said the Centre must take steps to back the Maratha and other reservations in the country by seeking to tag all quota related matter in the Supreme Court and a larger constitutional bench to hear the matter. The regular hearing for Maratha reservation issue is scheduled to commence from March 8. Chavan heads the state cabinet sub-committee on Maratha quota. Congress legislator Sharad Ranpise, through a starred question, sought to know what assistance the state was seeking from the Centre and the state’s preparedness in the matter. Responding to the question, Chavan said that the Centre needs to make its stance clear on few points which will not only help Maratha quota matter but also reservations issues in other states, besides the 10% EWS quota of the Centre. “The petitioners in the case have contended that Maharashtra’s quota has gone over 50% with reservations for Maratha. There are 16 states in the country where the reservation has gone over 50%. Parliament that passed a quota for EWS that too is over 50%; that decision too is challenged by this. The Centre now has the opportunity, through Attorney General, to tag all these matters together,” he said in his reply. Chavan also mentioned legalities that create hurdles in the matter and said that Centre could overcome that by seeking a larger constitutional bench to hear the reservation case. The leader of opposition of the legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, said the state government is merely passing the buck to hide its failure. Darekar demanded that keeping the legalities aside, the state government should allow people who have got appointment letter in the job, through the quota, to start their service. Chavan, in the response, said, “The Bill was passed unanimously, so now [again] you have the opportunity. We are putting forward our case on this matter; we are requesting to put forward positive steps as you are in power in Centre... About the jobs, the stay order of SC is clear: ‘Admissions to educational institutions for the academic year 2020-21 shall be made without reference to reservation provided in the SEBC Act. Appointment to public services and post and the government shall be made without implementing the reservation as provided in the Act.’ This is the interim order which states that we cannot proceed further’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centres-role-now-important-in-maratha-quota-matter-ashok-chavan-101614801033770.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai group set to make mattresses for homeless using discarded plastic||A group of Mumbaiites have come together to collect plastic from across the city, make mattresses using them and distribute to those living on the streets before the onset of monsoon.As a demo, the group of six women — called Food Army —involved around 1,000 volunteers to make a 6ftx3ft mattress using discarded plastic bags. With an aim of making 100 such mattresses for the homeless, members of the Food Army said their larger aim is protecting the environment by reducing plastic burden on the planet, while at the same time generating employment for women.Food Army started their work in 2014 with reaching out to victims of natural calamities and giving them home-cooked food. Rintu Kalyani Rathod, founder of the group and a resident of Santacruz, said, “We have been helping the needy during natural calamities with food and grains. This (mattress) project is very close to us.”The plastic collection drive will be held on March 5 and 6 where citizens can give away polythene bags of various thickness, grocery plastic packaging bags, multi-layered wrappers of biscuits, chocolates, detergent and more. Food Army will also provide information about the 32 collection centres across Mumbai to the donors.The group has employed two women to make plastic mattresses and is set to add four more women for the purpose. They also aim to involve rescue foundations by training girls to make plastic mattresses.“Street children and women will collect plastic from donors and hand it over to us. In return, we will give them grains. We will reuse the plastic waste by engaging underprivileged women after training them, thus providing employment and also reach our ultimate goal to reduce plastic waste,” Rathod added.People are requested to WhatsApp on 7977818669 (non- calling number) to donate plastics or help in the project.Food Army, which does not accept monetary donations, had despatched 35,000 theplas to victims of the 2014 Kashmir floods, one lakh theplas to Nepal for earthquake victims in 2015, 30,000 to Chennai in 2016 and 85,000 to Gujrat flood victims in 2017. They had also sent 75,000 kgs of grains to Kerala flood victims in 2018 and groceries and other household items to Orissa in 2019 for the victims of Cyclone Fani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-group-set-to-make-mattresses-for-homeless-using-discarded-plastic-101614800853044.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Harassment at Jalgaon hostel: 4-member panel to conduct probe||The Maharashtra government has constituted a four-member committee to probe an incident in Jalgaon, wherein policemen allegedly made girls from a government hostel strip and dance. State home minister Anil Deshmukh said action would be taken against the guilty in the next two days, once the probe report was submitted. BJP MLA Shweta Mahale raised the issue during the zero hour in the Assembly said the girls complained that people from outside and policemen were allowed to enter the facility on the pretext of a probe and some girls who refused to join the investigation were forced to strip and dance. The Assembly witnessed uproar after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sudhir Mungantiwar during the debate on the issue said they will have to demand president’s rule in the state on the grounds of failure of law and order. Mungantiwar said the state and home minister were not serious about the shameful treatment given to the women in Maharashtra. Deshmukh said a probe committee of four, including a psychiatrist and woman police officer, has been constituted and action would be taken against the guilty in two days. “We have been collating the information and the available documentary evidence, including video clips. Statements are being recorded. Strict action would be taken against them found guilty after the report was submitted in next two days,” he said. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said as the video clips are available there is enough evidence to take quick action against the culprits. He said there was nothing wrong in demanding president rule for failure of governance in the state. To this, minority welfare minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik took strong objection saying it was a threat given by the opposition to the state government. He also demanded to expunge the statement from the proceedings. Deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal said that he will decide on expunging the reference after examining it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/harassment-at-jalgaon-hostel-4-member-panel-to-conduct-probe-101614800793716.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||BJP mounts pressure to send Sanjay Rathod’s resignation to Governor||Claiming that forest minister Sanjay Rathod’s resignation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was just a farce and the state was shielding the minister despite evidence, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started to mount pressure on the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to send the resignation to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Rathod, whose name surfaced in the suicide case of a 22-year old woman, had submitted his resignation to Thackeray on Sunday. As Thackeray has not sent the resignation to Koshyari, Rathod continues to be a minister. As the head of the state, the governor has to accept a minister’s resignation after which the latter ceases to be a member of the state’s council of ministers. The BJP has been attacking Rathod for the past three weeks, alleging the audio clips that went viral on social media clearly prove the involvement of the minister. Former minister and senior BJP leader Sanjay Kute said on Wednesday. “Until it is not sent to the governor, the process is not complete. This is nothing but an eyewash. The resignation was taken just to avoid further embarrassment. I think it has been kept framed at Matoshree (Thackeray’s residence). The Thackeray government is shielding the minister and he may be reinstated after a few months.” Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday took a swipe at Thackeray. “The chief minister had said that he has not kept the resignation to frame it, but I don’t think it has been sent [to the Governor’s Office yet].” A Shiv Sena leader said the resignation is unlikely to be forwarded to the Governor. “Once the probe is completed, Rathod may come back if he is given a clean chit. If it is accepted by the Governor, the minister will have to be sworn in again if the government wants to reinstate him,” the leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mounts-pressure-to-send-sanjay-rathod-s-resignation-to-governor-101614800553634.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Only chanting slogans doesn’t make one a patriot: CM Uddhav Thackeray||In a veiled attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leadership, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said just chanting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ doesn’t make one a patriot and those questioning the Central government are called “traitors”. He said the country is not someone’s personal property and the BJP is trying to hijack idols such as Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabha Bhai Patel and Veer Savarkar and portraying them as theirs as they don’t have their own. He taunted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over renaming of Motera stadium in Gujarat after his name saying that now the country will never lose a match in that stadium. Thackeray was replying to a debate in the state Assembly on the Governor’s address, which continued for two days. “The Shiv Sena has not fought for freedom but your mother organization (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) also never fought freedom struggle. One doesn’t become a patriot by just chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’. If the elected government could not provide justice to its people then they don’t have the right to chant this slogan (Bharat Mata Ki Jai),” he said, slamming the Modi-led government over multi-layered barricading at Delhi borders to prevent the agitating farmers entering the capital. “Terrorists wouldn’t have infiltrated the country if this much security arrangements were made at the borders. Are these farmers terrorists or traitors? This country is not your private property. It is also a property of the farmers as well,” he said. Taking a swipe over renaming of Motera stadium, he said, “Someone said now we won’t be losing any cricket matches because the name of the stadium has been changed. We won’t be losing any match in that stadium… You erase the name of Vallabh bhai (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel), do not award Bharat Ratna to Savarkar (Veer Savarkar) and try to teach Hindutva to us.” He said the state has proposed the Centre to award Veer Savarkar with ‘Bharat Ratna’ and also sent two letters in 2018 and 2019 in this regard. The state has also passed a resolution for granting classical language status to Marathi language, which is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s (Maratha warrior king) language, and completed all necessary documentation. A proposal to rename Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj) is again pending with the Centre. Reacting to Union home minister Amit Shah’s comment, Thackeray said, “Whatever was decided between Amit Shah and me inside Balasaheb Thackeray’s room at Matoshri was denied shamelessly. I am purposely using this word because that room is like a temple for us.” He also said he still wonders why Devendra Fadnavis (the then chief minister) was asked to wait outside Thackeray’s room during that meeting. He also pointed out that the BJP didn’t make a law for construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya despite being in the government for six years and tried to take the credit after a decision came from the Supreme Court. “Now they are collecting money for temple construction from the people and again trying to take the credit,” he said taking a jibe at the ruling saffron party. Responding to the accusations, former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the chief minister is yet to understand the difference between a reply on issues raised in the Assembly and addressing a public rally. “He (CM Thackeray) could not reply to the issues raised by us, be it corruption in handling Covid-19 pandemic or providing relief to the farmers hit by pink bollworm, a pest that damages cotton farms,” Fadnavis told reporters at Vidhan Bhavan premises.He said that the chief minister is lying through his teeth on the claims made by Thackeray over the union home minister. “He is lying through his teeth on whatever he said about the union home minister. He (Thackeray) also knows the truth,” he remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-chanting-slogans-doesn-t-make-one-a-patriot-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101614800253726.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks authorities to reply to PIL against removal of cash lanes at toll plazas||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the Union Road Transport Ministry and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL) which has challenged a February 15 circular by the authorities wherein toll plazas were authorised to collect double toll fees as fine from vehicles not having FASTag. The responses are to be filed before the next hearing on March 10. The PIL has alleged that the decision to replace cash lanes with FASTag lanes was taken arbitrarily, and added that as the decision left no scope for cash payment, it would create problems in the event of any technical problems faced by the commuters or toll plazas. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by Arjn Khanapure, was informed that the petitioner was a regular user of state and national highways and that He was forced to pay double toll charges on February 16 at Dumbarwadi Toll Plaza for a single journey as he did not have FASTag. The petitioner said that he was informed that the double charges were being collected as a fine for not having FASTag and a decision to that effect had been taken and announced by the authorities on February 12 and 14. The petition further states that after the incident, the petitioner inquired and found that there was no provision in the Highways Act to collect double charges, and hence the decision by the authorities to allow toll plazas to collect double charges was arbitrary and illegal. The petition also states that the discontinuation of cash lanes, which were existing till February 15, was also detrimental as any technical problems such as connectivity issues, non-functional or faulty RFID readers, power failures would create problems for not only commuters but also toll plazas. In light of the submissions and the fact that many people were not comfortable with the use of FASTag due to illiteracy, hesitance in using e-wallets and other logistical problems, the petition urged that the authorities should be directed to have the option of cash lane so that it could be used by such persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-authorities-to-reply-to-pil-against-removal-of-cash-lanes-at-toll-plazas-101614799773556.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra announces probe into Devendra Fadnavis’s plantation drive||The Maharashtra government announced a probe by a panel of members of the legislature into tree plantation drive, the pet project of previous Devendra Fadnavis government, after a few members alleged the drive was scam-driven. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the committee will be constituted by March 31 and will be given four months to submit its report.The government also announced a probe into the alleged ₹14-crore scam by Nagpur-based Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Samata Pratisthan. Social justice minister Dhananjay Munde has declared suspension of the government officials involved in the scam, which had come to the fore during the audit by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).“The scam amounts to ₹14 crore, allotted for the celebration of Dr BR Amebdkar’s 125th birth anniversary. The financial irregularities were revealed in the audit. The officials involved deliberately kept the CAG under dark by hiding the details. We are suspending the officials immediately. The SIT [special investigation team] will probe the irregularities further,” Munde said.Munde said that the departmental committee appointed to probe the irregularities have revealed many anomalies. “The fund was spent without the knowledge and permission of the board of directors. The officials involved in the irregularity were politically well connected,” he said in a reply during question hour.The question over plantation of 330 million trees during Fadnavis government’s rule was raised by Ramesh Korgaonkar, Shiv Sena’s MLA from Bhandup. Korgaonkar asked about the survival rate and the amount spent on the drive, saying many of the trees are believed to not have survived despite spending a huge amount. Minister of state for forest Dattatrey Bharne said the survival rate was 75.63%. “Forest department spent ₹429.78 crore on the drive implemented between 2016 and 2020. 28.27 crore (282.7 million) trees were planted and their survival rate by October 2020 was 75.63%,” he said. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis took strong objection to the probe, saying it was being constituted out of vengeance and to do politics over the issue. “Generally, around 60% trees from such drives survive. Here, the rate is too high against set parameters. The probe is being announced out of political vendetta,” he said.Former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who spearheaded the drive, said any such probe is welcome as nothing will come out of it. “The government should ensure that it would not face embarrassment after the report was submitted. It was a noble cause undertaken by our government and we achieved the goal. We are not afraid of any such probe as there was nothing wrong in it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-announces-probe-into-devendra-fadnavis-s-plantation-drive-101614799653718.html

Police then circulated the image of the suspect to different police stations and informers to ascertain the identity. On Monday, police received a tip-off that a man was trying to sell an antique clock at the black market in Jogeshwari for ₹2 lakh. Following this, the police laid a trap and arrested Mahantoh. “Mahantoh told us that he had lost his job during the lockdown and needed money,” said Bandale. The accused also revealed that since he worked as a salesman he used to visit various localities and had also gone to the antique showroom in the past. He had noticed that there was window behind the showroom which did not have a grill.The accused then planned the theft and broke into the shop during night in July. He allegedly threw the antique piece one by one through the window and collected them once he was out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-salesman-arrested-for-theft-of-antiques-worth-70-lakh-101614799353662.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shakti Mills gang rape convict arrested in assault case||Mumbai Police’s crime branch arrested two people, including 25-year-old Akash Jadhav — a Shakti Mills gang rape convict, for allegedly stabbing a Bandra resident on February 28. The victim is still undergoing treatment at Sion hospital. Police officers said Jadhav has committed more than 10 serious crimes including attempt to murder in the past three years, after he was released from Nashik Borstal School in July 2017.At the time of Shakti Mills gang rape case, Jadhav was 17-years old. He, along with one more minor and four adults, were nabbed in connection with the gang rape of a 23-year-old photojournalist at defunct Shakti Mills compound on August 22, 2013. In July 2014, the juvenile justice board of Mumbai had sent Jadhav and the other minor to Nashik Borstal School for three years. According to the police, Jadhav and his associate, Ankit Naik, 25, both allegedly stabbed Rizwan Shafi Qureshi, 28, with a knife on his head and hand near Nargis Datt area in Bandra (West)on February 28. Jadhav and Naik came to Bandra on bike and were searching for a drug peddler to buy MD around 4am when they saw Qureshi and asked him to arrange MD, said a police officer. When Qureshi said he was not a peddler, Jadhav took out a knife and stabbed him in the head and hand and fled from the spot. Qureshi sustained severe injuries and currently undergoing treatment at Sion hospital. He had memorised the bike number and gave it police during investigation, said inspector Nandkumar Gopale of crime branch unit 9. Following this, a case was registered in Bandra police station against two unknown persons under sections 326 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Meanwhile, crime branch unit 9 also started a parallel probe. Using the registration number, police traced the bike and found that Jadhav was using it at the time of the incident, added Gopale who was also part of the investigating team in Shakti Mills gang rape case.“I was shocked when I got Jadhav’s mobile number and saw his picture. I immediately formed a team to trace him. We got his address in Dombivli area. Our team waited two days outside his residence and arrested him on Wednesday morning,” said Gopale. During interrogation, the police learnt about Naik and arrested him near Saat Rasta circle, added Gopale. Jadhav is a habitual offender with this being the 11th criminal case registered against him since his release from the remand home after three years of confinement, said deputy commissioner of police Akbar Pathan of the crime branch. Two months after he was released, he assaulted a 48-year-old man from Mahalaxmi. Later, Jadhav along with his associate allegedly assaulted another man in NM Joshi area. Several offences including kidnapping, extortion and an attempt to murder case were registered against him and his associates in NM joshi Marg, RAK Marg and Agripada police stations, said an officer. Naik also had murder and attempt to murder cases registered against him in Kalachowki and NM joshi Marg police stations, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-shakti-mills-gang-rape-convict-arrested-in-assault-case-101614799233615.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mangrove cover in Maharashtra up by 16%, finds survey||Mangrove cover in the Maharashtra’s coastal districts increased by 16% between 2005 and 2019, suggests a survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) at the behest of the Maharashtra forest department. From a total cover of 304.39 square kilometres (sq km) in 2005, Maharashtra’s coastline now has a mangrove cover of 353.18 sq kms, indicating an additional 48.79 sq kms of mangroves.According to a summary of the report, which has been seen by Hindustan Times, six of Maharashtra’s seven coastal districts reported an increase in mangrove cover during the study period, with the exception of Palghar where the opposite was observed. All districts reported an increase in dense mangrove cover and a decline in sparse mangrove cover.Raigad recorded the highest increase with adding 22.20 sq kms of mangroves to its coast during the study period, followed by Mumbai city and suburban districts where mangrove cover grew by 12.90 sq km. Meanwhile, Thane saw an addition of 6.40 sq km mangroves, followed by Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, which saw 3.01 and 0.30 sq km increase, respectively.However, the report also attributes the increase only to the growth of dense mangrove cover, while sparse mangrove cover declined in each of the districts surveyed. Raigad, for example, gained about 42 sq kms of dense cover during the study period, but lost more than 20 sq kms of sparse mangroves. Palghar, which was the only district to record a decrease in mangroves, gained 8 sq km in dense cover but lost more than 19 sq kms of sparse cover. Across Maharashtra, “about 44.25 sq km of sparse mangrove is converted to dense mangrove, which is considered to be a positive change and 16.17 sq km of dense mangrove is changed to sparse mangrove, indicating the degrading stage of such mangroves,” states the summary of the report, which officials said will soon be submitted before the Bombay high court as part of an ongoing litigation.Environmentalists, however, viewed these results with scepticism. “Depletion of sparse mangroves means that tidal flow to the land has decreased. Increase in density is not necessarily an increase in extent of mangrove cover,” said Stalin D, environmentalist and director of NGO Vanashakti. Stalin also pointed out that too dense mangroves will result in less room for waders, thereby adversely impacting the ecosystem’s ability to sustain biodiversity.Officials from the Maharashtra forest department’s mangrove cell said that these findings require further investigation. “The increase in mangrove cover is due to better legal protection as reserved forests under the Indian Forest Act. Sparse mangroves have now become dense mangrove. However, in some areas it may be due to mangroves coming on mud flats, thereby decreasing the width of the creeks, particularly Thane Creek. We are analysing this aspect,” said Virender Tiwari, principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Commenting on the situation in Palghar, Tiwari said, “The reduction in growth of mangroves there may be due to more people practising aquaculture, mainly for prawn fishing. This is again something we are looking into.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangrove-cover-in-maharashtra-up-by-16-finds-survey-101614798574546.html

04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Businessman Deven Mehta booked for duping architect of ₹11.66 crore||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police on Wednesday booked businessman Deven Mehta of Smart Card IT Solutions, one of the largest manufacturers of smart cards in India, for cheating an architect to the tune of ₹11.66 crore.Mehta allegedly took his service for interior designing of three of his properties in Mumbai and Alibag but defaulted in making the payment.The complainant architect, Nozer Rishi Wadia, 66, a Malabar Hill resident, has been in the interior designing business for the past 35 years.In his complaint to the police, Wadia stated that in 2016, he was introduced to Mehta and wife Ushma in his rented residence at Kanta Building in Malabar Hill, by a common acquaintance. Mehta then asked him to remodel his rented house. “It was decided that Mehta would pay the cost of the furniture and Wadia’s fee - ₹20 lakh, but he allegedly paid only ₹5 lakh. He assured Wadia that he would give him more work in future and would make the balance payment in new orders. Mehta also did not pay for the furniture,” Wadia alleged in his complaint.Deven Mehta said, “Its a frivolous complaint. This complaint was made to EOW by Nozer Wadia three years ago, but then the EOW officers had then disposed it of, terming it a civil matter as they did not find any criminal aspect in the complaint. I have made all the payments to Wadia and have sufficient proofs of the same. I don’t understand the logic behind reopening an already disposed off matter.”Hwoever, the complainant Nozer Wadia refused to comment on the matter.In December 2016, Mehta entrusted Wadia with the interior work of his 10,000 square feet luxurious flat in a building on Altamount Road. “Mehta and Wadia mutually decided terms and conditions for the deal. Wadia carried out interior work worth ₹1.11 crore which included his architecture fee of ₹70 lakh. But Mehta only paid ₹10 lakh to Wadia, despite Wadia regularly presenting bills to him. When he asked about the rest of the payment, Mehta told him that he wishes to give him another order for the interior of his bungalow in Alibag and promised to make payment of all the balance dues after the work,” said an EOW officer.Wadia’s firm carried out all the interior work worth ₹16.5 crore at Mehta’s bungalow, Jay Niwas at Alibag. This included Wadia’s architecture fee of ₹2.13 crore. However, Mehta paid only ₹50 lakh to Wadia. This is when Wadia realised that Mehta has no intention of making his full payment. Wadia, after waiting for months, recently approached the police and lodged a first information report (FIR).“Mehta between 2016 and 2017 allegedly took services from Wadia and various other contractors worth ₹17.86 crore but paid only ₹6.20 crore and cheated him and other contractors of ₹11.66 crore. He also failed to make payment for the furniture worth ₹71 lakh,” the FIR states.Mehta and Ushma have been booked under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code after a preliminary inquiry find material in the case.Mehta was in news for buying an apartment in luxurious Lodha Altamount for ₹57.45 crore in 2017.He was previously arrested by EOW in 2019 at the Mumbai airport for allegedly cheating a Hong Kong-based Non-resident Indian (NRI) of ₹9 crore under the pretext of selling him a 5-acre land in Raigad which belonged to the forest department.Earlier this year, he was also arrested by Pune GST officials for alleged fraud and causing a loss of ₹45 crore to the revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-businessman-deven-mehta-booked-for-duping-architect-of-11-66-crore-101614798453727.html
04-03-2021||Other||Mumbai: Woman cop, lover arrested for killing husband||Manor police on Wednesday arrested a 25-year-old woman constable deployed with the traffic police, an associate of a senior inspector and three others for allegedly killing the constable’s husband.The accused have been identified as Snehal Patil, Vikas Pashte, 30, an aide to the senior inspector in-charge; Swapnil Govari, an outsourcing agent with MSEDCL; Avinash Bhoir, electrician and Vishal Patil, a security guard. According to police, Patil allegedly gave ₹2.50 lakh contract to Govari, Bhoir and Vishal to kill her husband Pundalik Patil, 35, an autorickshaw driver she was in a relationship with Pashte.Dattatray Patil, superintendent, Palghar police, said, “On February 17, night, as per the plan, the three accused hired Pundalik’s autorickshaw. After they reached Dhekale, on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway, the trio asked the Pundalik to stop the rickshaw. The three accused then hit Pundalik at the back of his head with an iron rod five times and dumped his body on the floor between the passenger and the driver seat, and tilted the vehicle to make appear as an accident.”“Before the crime, Pashte had conducted a recce and hired the victim’s auto twice. He would send the other three accused in his auto and would pay ₹1,000 per trip. He would make calls from different numbers to Patil to confuse police with the call data record (CDR),” said Shinde. Assistant inspector Pratap Darade said, “After investigating the crime scene, the Manor police confirmed it was murder. Also, the post-mortem report revealed the same. We are yet to recover the murder weapon.” “However, the sketch made by our police artist matched with Pashte and he was arrested. He then revealed the names of four other accused. All five have confessed to the crime,” Shinde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-woman-cop-lover-arrested-for-killing-husband-101614798333637.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Kirit Somaiya files police complaint against Maharashtra CM; Sena says claims false||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya has filed a police complaint against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, at the Revdanda police station in Raigad district, for allegedly misusing his position for purchase of 19 houses by his wife Rashmi and Manisha, wife of Shiv Sena legislator Ravindra Waikar, at Alibag.Somaiya said he will approach the Bombay high court (HC) if the police failed to register a first information report (FIR) against Thackeray.The Shiv Sena has called the allegations a pack of lies and said the allegation does not deserve a police complaint.“There is not a single house on this plot, forget 19 houses. If there is no construction, then how come Somaiya came up with this figure of ₹5.29 crore? How can Uddhavsaheb declare something in his affidavit which is not there in the first place?” questioned Waikar.Somaiya accused Thackeray of not disclosing the purchase of 19 houses in a 23,500 square feet area, at Korlai village in Alibag, in his election affidavit. “Architect Anvay Naik constructed these houses in 2008-09. These houses were purchased from Naik in March 2014. These were transferred in Rashmi’s and Manisha’s name only on November 12, 2020. That means they were benami properties for six years. This is against the law,” said Somaiya.“This clearly shows that Thackeray, as the head of state, played an important role in facilitating this dubious deal,” he added.Somaiya had complained about Thackeray to the Election Commission and the income tax department.Naik had died by suicide in 2018 and the case was reopened in November 2020, in which journalist Arnab Goswami was arrested for abetment of suicide. “Since Thackeray had dealt with Naik, even he should also be investigated in this suicide case by the police,” demanded Somaiya.Waikar, whose wife Manisha is the joint owner of this plot, said that even the collector has surveyed the plot and found no construction at all. “All that is there, is just a dilapidated watchman’s house, three wells and a cowshed which were already present when we purchased the plot,” said Waikar.Waikar said this does not merit a police complaint in the first place. “This is a simple real estate transaction and we have paid stamp duty, all the taxes and have not caused any loss to the state exchequer. Forget FIR, this does not even qualify for a simple police complaint,” said Waikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kirit-somaiya-files-police-complaint-against-maharashtra-cm-sena-says-claims-false-101614798153649.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Final-year students miss campus, canteen, farewell||The final year of college is an emotional time for students as they make memories on campus that they will cherish for years to come. However, this year has been different as campuses remain shut across the city. As the semester draws to a close, the chances of visiting the campus and meeting friends for one last time are diminishing. This has left the graduating batch of 2021 with a sense of longing. “I was eager about starting my final year before the pandemic and wanted to make the most of it. But now we are just attending online lectures. I miss eating dahi papdi chaat in the college canteen, completing projects on the college staircase at the last minute, attending morning lectures and craving for coffee, bunking lectures to watch movies or try a new restaurant,” said Yesha Shah, Bachelor of Mass Media student at Usha Pravin Gandhi College, Vile Parle. “I think we won’t get a chance to have a farewell and have lots of fun one last time,” Shah added. At the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), students said the academic structure is designed such that they have relatively more time in their hands in the final year. “In the initial years, students are very busy with the academic workload and club activities. However, in the final year, apart from the one big activity of placements, the academic load is comparatively less. So this is the year when students interact with more people, especially from outside their branch,” said Aman Rai, a final year B.Tech student at the mechanical engineering department of IIT-B. With a little time on his hands, Rai, who hails from Nagpur, had plans for exploring Mumbai more in the final year but has missed the opportunity. Another aspect of the final year of college that students are missing is the events. “The campus is usually buzzing with events. There is a traditional day, childhood day, annual fests, social work etc. These are fun times. We make new friends and learn from each other. It’s difficult to quantify what we’ve missed out this year,” said Akshata Pawar, final year botany student at Sathaye College, Vile Parle. “While there are no plans for an online farewell as yet, even if we do, it won’t be the same,” said Pawar. “The placement preparation process is a very unique experience, and it would have been nice to be there on campus for it, instead of doing it online,” Rai added. Shakshi Rane, a third-year, commerce student from ML Dahanukar College, said she missed taking exams offline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-final-year-students-miss-campus-canteen-farewell-101614798034055.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mercury crosses 37°C; IMD warns of warmer than usual summer in Mumbai||The city witnessed its warmest day of the season so far on Wednesday. The Santacruz weather station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, up from 35.3 degrees Celsius a day prior. Wednesday’s reading was 4.4 degrees Celsius above normal.Officials attributed the spike in Mercury, to dry, warm winds blowing at a low altitude over the city at around 900 metres above mean sea level, coming from an anticyclonic circulation over central India.Officials also cautioned that the upcoming summer season is likelier to be warmer than usual. “The entire Konkan coastal region is likely to see a warmer summer this year. Days will be about a quarter of a degree warmer while nights will be about half a degree warmer,” said Dr Shubhagi Bhute, a scientist at IMD. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 20.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which was at normal, and only slightly slower than the previous day’s reading of 20.6 degrees Celsius.Colaba, on the other hand, the maximum temperature was recorded at 34.5 degrees Celsius (up from 32.5 degrees a day prior), but the minimum temperature was recorded at 22.3 degrees Celsius (same as the day prior).As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Santacruz, there may be some relief from the heat on Thursday. The maximum temperature is expected to drop and remain at 35 degrees Celsius for the next week, while the minimum reading is also predicted to remain at 21 degrees Celsius. Mainly clear skies will prevail.Meanwhile, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research, air quality on Wednesday returned to the poor category with the air quality index (AQI) of 208.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mercury-crosses-37-c-imd-warns-of-warmer-than-usual-summer-in-mumbai-101614797913616.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Man dies after getting second dose of vaccine: Family awaits post-mortem report||A day after a 45-year-old private health care worker, Sukhdev Kirdat, died in Bhiwandi minutes after taking the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, his family is awaiting the post-mortem report to know what caused his sudden death. The police have registered an accidental death report as the post-mortem by JJ Hospital did not give any conclusive results. The police said the hospital was awaiting a few more tests to determine the cause of death. “When he took the first dose, he did not face any health issue. That day he went to work like usual and the doctor for whom he worked reminded him to go and take the second dose of vaccine,” said Prithviraj Salunke, 24, nephew of the deceased. Kirdat who lived in Thane’s Manorama Nagar is survived by his wife and 13-year-old son. He was taking medication for hypertension for the past three years. He has been working as a driver to a doctor in Bhiwandi for 8-9 years. Yogesh Chavhan, deputy commissioner of police, Bhiwandi, said, “The post-mortem report submitted by expert doctors states their opinion is reserved “It might be just a coincidence that the beneficiary suffered cardiac arrest right after the vaccination,” said Dr Prashant Patil, president Indian Medical Association, Kalyan. Dr Pankaj Kumar Kasar, an interventional cardiologist from Kalyan said, “It is very rare that a vaccine cause any heart ailment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-dies-after-getting-second-dose-of-vaccine-family-awaits-post-mortem-report-101614797312890.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals all set for phase 3 of Covid vaccination||Most of the 29 private hospitals given the go-ahead by the Central government on Tuesday to conduct Coid-19 vaccinations will start doing so from Thursday, officials said. Also, on the third day of the vaccination drive’s third phase on Wednesday, no chaos was reported at any of the centres. The authorities attributed this to the smooth functioning of the centralised CoWIN portal.Overall, on Wednesday, 11,019 senior citizens above the age of 60 and those above 45 years of age with comorbidities were vaccinated at 22 vaccination centres and three private hospitals, almost double the 6,863 vaccinated on Tuesday.Further, on Wednesday, several citizens took to social media, a contrast from the previous day, expressing their satisfaction over the arrangements. Prashant Prasad, a resident, tweeted, “On Tuesday, there were phenomenal arrangements at the BKC jumbo centre. It was extremely impressive as my parents were in at 8.30am and out at 10am. Crowd management is impeccable.”Earlier, on the first and second days, crowding was reported at several vaccination centres, including at BKC and the NESCO centre in Goregaon. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had maintained that it is following up with the Centre on fixing glitches on the portal. On Wednesday, on-the-spot and pre-registered vaccinations were conducted smoothly owing to the portal running smoothly. Dr Pradeep Jadhav, medical superintendent, Bandra Bhabha Hospital, said, “We carried out vaccination as per the stipulated timings, between 9am and 5pm. The vaccination was smoother on Wednesday compared to the earlier two days as there was no technical glitches.”Meanwhile, the 29 private hospitals include many major ones —Hinduja, Lilavati, Jaslok, Kokilaben, Bombay, SL Raheja, Global, Nanavati, Saifee and Fortis. A BMC official said, “Inspections of several private hospitals started on Wednesday and many hospitals were given clearances post inspection. The pending hospitals will also be given clearances in a day or two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-private-hospitals-all-set-for-phase-3-of-covid-vaccination-101614797193427.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s first Covid patients: ‘We have let it stay under the carpet’||“After witnessing the suffering that the virus has caused over the past year, I am thankful to god for saving our lives,” said the 70-year-old, who, one year on, still refuses to divulge his name for fear of being stigmatized.The Andheri-resident and his 68-year-old wife were the first two cases of Covid-19 detected in Mumbai on March 11. They had only just returned from Dubai.The senior citizens did not want to be named because they haven’t told members of their extended families that they tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. “We belong to a village in Gujarat and a majority of our family members still stay there. I didn’t know how they would react to us being affected by Covid-19, and I didn’t want us to get stigmatised for it. We never told them then [when it happened], and it is too late to inform them now. We’ve let it slip, we’ve let it stay under the carpet,” he said.Last year, the husband and wife, visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi on a six-day tour with 40 other people from the state. Their flight landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai on March 1 from where the group dispersed to their homes in Mumbai, Pune, Beed and Nagpur.Eight days later, a couple from the same group who had taken a taxi to Pune, tested positive for coronavirus disease, making them the first two patients in the state. It turned out that the rest of the 40 were infected too.****On March 10, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made a call to the couple’s Andheri residence. The city municipal body was conducting a contact tracing exercise in an attempt to track down all the people who had travelled with the Pune couple. The officials asked the husband and wife to report to Kasturba Hospital, immediately.The wife, already a patient of diabetes and hypertension, felt afraid. For the past three days, she had been experiencing breathlessness, cough, fever and a loss of appetite. But she didn’t hide these symptoms from the civic authorities; they made their way to the city’s only infectious diseases hospital the same day. In the afternoon, their swab samples were collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. The couple was put under quarantine in a hospital ward.****By February 2020, international flyers entering Mumbai and exhibiting symptoms were already being quarantined in the isolation ward of Kasturba hospital until their swab reports, sent to NIV, like returned negative for the virus. On February 3, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the nodal central agency overseeing the country’s response to the virus, allowed Kasturba hospital to conduct its own Covid-19 tests, making it the first civic-run testing centre in the state. However, it still needed to send its samples to NAV for confirmation of results.“We have a state-level testing facility where we have been analysing samples such as HIV, E-coli and other viral infections for years. Once a team of experts from the central government inspected the lab infrastructure, they immediately selected us for the testing,” said Dr Chandrakant Pawar, the medical superintendent of the hospital.The leafy campus located in Byculla had 150 beds for patients of infectious diseases, who needed to be quarantined or isolated. Of these, the hospital initially reserved 20 to quarantine possible Covid patients. Within a month, the hospital raised the number of beds to 275; till date, it has treated over 4,000 Covid patients.That sort of scaling up was only possible, Pawar said, because the hospital recruited health care staff. “We had to get resident doctors from other hospitals. We increased the number of doctors from 8 to 30 and recruited around 200 additional nurses.”Everyone worked round the clock. Till July, the hospital even put up their staff members in hotels and lodges in case they were worried about returning home to their families.The 129-year old hospital is no stranger to pandemics. Established in 1892 as the Arthur road hospital or City hospital, it was built as a sanatorium for people suffering from infectious diseases. In 1896, when the bubonic plague first hit what was then Bombay, spreading through Nowroji slums in Mandvi and infecting thousands, the hospital began admitting affected patients. The medical superintendent at the time, Nasserwanji Hormusji Choksy, received a title from the British for his tireless work during this pandemic.Later, the hospital treated patients affected by the Influenza pandemic in 1917-18, which hit the residents, particularly the poor, hard. Millions died in the city, although there are no records of how many were actually affected.Since then, the hospital has always risen to help the city whenever it has come under attack of microorganisms. In 2009, when the H1N1 pandemic struck, the hospital was one of the main centres providing isolation wards and treatment facilities for the affected patients in Mumbai.It’s no surprise then that the hospital’s wards are named after diseases. There’s a swine flu ward, a chickenpox ward, a jaundice ward, and even an isolation ward named after Ebola.“The hospital has been a safe haven for Mumbai residents whenever the city has witnessed any infectious diseases outbreak. Every staff member is trained to handle such patients in sudden crisis,” said Dr Jayanthi S Shastri, in-charge of the molecular diagnostic laboratory at the hospital.It was Shastri who received the call from NIV on March 11 confirming that the Andheri couple was Covid positive.***After five days of quarantine, the wife recovered, and tested negative. She was shifted to the outer wing of the ward. The husband, also a diabetic, remained in quarantine with another patient. “Though I had fever and body ache, I was feeling fine until I started vomiting on the ninth day of my quarantine. That continued for another day,” he said.His oxygen saturation levels dropped to below 80%, but the husband didn’t require ventilator support or a stay in the Intensive Care Unit.While both were treated with a drug combination of hydroxychloroquine, Tamiflu and Lopinavir, the husband was administered with an additional antibiotic injection since he had developed fluids in his right lung due to pneumonia.“They were the first patients to be treated with a drug combination of hydroxychloroquine, Tamiflu and Lopinavir. Although there is no specific evidence about the effectiveness of the drugs, we used the drugs as an experiment which actually worked,” a doctor from the hospital who was involved in her treatment had told HT in April last year.At the time of treating the husband-wife duo, knowledge about the virus and how to treat it was limited, so doctors used a combination of drugs—Tamiflu (oseltamivir or Fluvir), an antiviral used in treatment of swine flu; hydroxychloroquine, a medicine used to prevent and treat malaria; and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug Lopinavir. With growing research across the globe, doctors added Tocilizumab and the antiviral, Remdesivir, in the regime. Later, steroid and blood thinners were also added to the list, along with vitamins. Convalescent plasma therapy also gained popularity among doctors over the following months.At present, hydroxychloroquine and Tocilizumab have lost its shine, but doctors still use a cocktail of other drugs for treatment.It was only midway through their stay that the seriousness of being infected with Sars-CoV-2 dawned upon them. On March 17, a 64-year-old man, who was also admitted to Kasturba and quarantined, succumbed to the infection becoming the first casualty of the pandemic in Mumbai.“Till then, I thought the virus is not deadly. But when I saw the ward boy carrying away the body wrapped in a white plastic bag, my heart sank,” the husband recalled. “For the first time, I felt scared.”***“We are either provided with the old HIV PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] kits or donated kits which are of poor quality. These don’t even cover the whole body. The upper body cover is too thin to stop any possible contact of the virus to the skin. All doctors and nurses are given proper high quality PPE,” a staffer said during a protest that a group of them had held last April. Following the protest, city mayor Kishori Pednekar also visited the hospital.Even as Kasturba hospital grappled with the same shortage of PPE kits that health care and frontline workers around the country were facing at the start of April, the civic body converted Seven Hills, a private hospital in Marol into a Dedicated Covid Care Hospital. Later, the civic-run BYL Nair hospital was also converted into a dedicated Covid hospital. This was done to ease the burden on Kasturba and King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital, Parel, both of which had become the ports of call for severe patients.When experts from the central government visited the hospital in May, they observed that the hospital lacked a negative pressure room, UV lights, high-efficiency particulate air (or HEPA) filters, and an anteroom (sort of an in-between chamber) between the patient’s area and general corridor. Despite these infrastructural shortfalls, Kasturba continued to treat a large volume of patients. The footfall of suspected Covid-19 patients in the hospital’s outpatient department that once ranged at 1,200 on an average a day has now fallen to 50.Last month, the BMC declared that it would make a separate building with a 150-bed facility in preparation for another pandemic.“We need a state-of-the-art hospital for infectious diseases, so we would try to make a centralised hospital for future usage. The new building will have all advanced facilities for immediate usage of patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, while speaking during the budget announcement.***On March 24, the husband and wife were discharged. They had spent 14 days at the hospital. When they returned home, neighbours came forward to help them get down from the ambulance.“The hospital staff was extremely kind. After we got back home, we were still very weak. Our neighbours carried me on a plastic chair to the house. I was down with a stomach infection and my husband used to get breathless. It’s our neighbours who gave us food for a week until we improved,” said the wife.“On the first day of our quarantine, the ward had only 20 beds. But when we left 14 days later, the ward had more than 50 beds with around 25 suspected patients,” the husband said.The couple’s children, a daughter and son, live abroad and could not visit as all international and domestic flights had been shut down.As it turns out, the daughter, a resident of Singapore now, had interned at Kasturba hospital as a medical student two decades ago. “My daughter said we were in the best hands and I shouldn’t worry,” the 70-year-old said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-first-covid-patients-we-have-let-it-stay-under-the-carpet-101614797073559.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Not a second Covid wave, but a spike: Maharashtra task force||Maharashtra at the moment is likely witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases and not a second wave, believes the state’s task force, saying the test positivity rate indicates so and that the current trajectory is similar to September 2020 when there was increased movement of people due to Ganesh Chaturthi. This comes amid the steady spurt in cases in the state over the past few weeks, fuelling speculation, however, experts attribute this rise to increased testing.According to experts, a spike means the number of cases rises for a few days and then comes back to normal levels, while in the case of a wave, the infections keep rising,In February, the test positivity rate — the total number of cases testing positive for Covid-19 against the total tests done — was 7.8%, despite the 40% rise in cases from January, data revealed. “We conducted over 1.6 million tests in February, as a result of which, new cases increased. Had there been a second wave, the positivity rate should have also surged. In January, Maharashtra recorded around 5% positivity rate, which in February increased by a mere 2 percentage points,” said Dr Satish Pawar, state surveillance officer. According to data provided by the state health department, there were 90,673 cases in Maharashtra in January, which increased to 126,723 in February. The sudden spike was observed from mid-February with a significant share from Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola, Mumbai and Pune. In contrast, the state’s positivity rate was higher in the last four months of 2020 — 20% in September and October; 18% in November and 16% in December. Data from the state health government showed that in September 2020, as many as 2,646,276 tests were conducted in the state; in October there were 2,182,198 tests. In January 2021, 1,869,535 tests were conducted. In Mumbai, too, when 543,821 tests were conducted in September, the positivity rate was 14%. However, while the number of tests in January and February stood at 433,681 and 459,794, the positivity rate didn’t show a spike. It was around 4% in January and 5.3% in February. “Last year, in the middle of September, the state had observed a similar spike after Ganesh Chaturthi and gradual relaxation of the lockdown. It gradually flattened by October-end. So, this year, with the starting of local trains and laxity on the part of citizens in not following Covid norms, cases increased. So, we can’t call it a second wave,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, attached to Bombay Hospital and in charge of Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19, also overruled the spike as a “second wave”. “There has been a mutation of the virus, which is more infectious. But it is contained to a few districts like Amaravati, So far, considering that there hasn’t been much of a surge in positivity rate and also, the death rate is under control, we may not be facing a second wave. But we need a few more days to come to a conclusion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-a-second-covid-wave-but-a-spike-maharashtra-task-force-101614796953519.html
04-03-2021||Mumbai||Passengers from Brazil will undergo 7 days hotel quarantine in Mumbai||The incoming passengers from Brazil will now be quarantined in a hotel for seven days, as per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) circular released, on Wednesday. According to the circular, any passenger, on testing negative post-seven days of mandatory hotel quarantine, will be allowed to go home subject to seven days home quarantine. However, if tested positive after seven days, passengers will be admitted at GT Hospital or SevenHills Hospital followed by four private hospitals including Bombay Hospital, Raheja Hospital, Hinduja Hospital and Reliance Hospital. This is being done owing to the available evidence of new strain or mutated Covid-19 virus in circulation from several countries around the globe.Until now, passengers coming from the UK, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East are already following the above rules, but they were admitted only at GT or SevenHills Hospital. However, with the addition of Brazil to the list, the BMC has also given the option of getting admitted to private hospitals.This was followed by the Central government decision of making it mandatory, starting from February 17, 2021, for incoming passengers from Brazil to get institutional quarantined for seven days.A BMC official said, “The direction to quarantine incoming passengers from Brazil was already given on February 18 by the municipal commissioner, however, a formal order was pending, which was issued on Wednesday. Also, the list now offers options for getting admitted in private hospitals considering with the addition of Brazil, the strain of passengers increases on public hospitals.”Meanwhile, as per the practice, there will be several passengers who will be exempted from the mandatory quarantine rule. This includes those who are government officials, having a death in the family, pregnant women or officials of an embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/passengers-from-brazil-will-undergo-7-days-hotel-quarantine-in-mumbai-101614796893576.html

A state health department official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The state’s numbers are going to hover around 8,000-10,000 for a week with an occasional dip. The increase is due to increased viral activity in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Vidarbha regions for the past two-three weeks. We have scaled up the testing; with targeted testing coupled with tracing, we are getting more cases. However, the numbers will stabilise in a couple of weeks.”Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday issued a circular, adding Brazil to the list from where incoming fliers will be quarantined in hotel for seven days. On testing negative, passengers will be allowed to go home and then follow a seven-day home quarantine.

04-03-2021||Delhi||SC panel inspects Metro Phase 4 sites to see if trees can be saved||The Supreme Court-constituted Central Empowered Committee (CEC) on Wednesday conducted the first round of inspections of the Delhi Metro Phase 4 construction, after a petition was filed before the Delhi high court to save over 11,000 trees that are proposed to be felled to make way for the new corridors.In a petition before the Delhi high court, it was submitted that for the construction of three of DMRC corridors —Janakpuri-RK Ashram, Maujpur-Majlis Park and Aerocity-Tughlakabad—the Metro had sought permission to cut 11,454 trees. The petitioners had also sought a change in alignment of Metro Phase 4, from above ground to underground.The members of CEC, chief project manager of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), representatives from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the petitioner of the case, urban ecologist Vallari Sheel, visited the under-construction site on the Janakpuri-RK Ashram corridor on Wednesday, to ascertain whether trees, which have been marked by the DMRC for felling, can be saved.“The team inspected stretches, including the Najafgarh drain, Mangolpuri, and section of the Outer Ring Road between Derawal Nagar near Mukarba Chowk and Pul Bangash. The inspection ended at RK Ashram, the other end of the proposed Metro corridor,” an official present during the inspection on Wednesday said, on condition of anonymity.The official added, “The second round of inspections are scheduled for Friday, when the Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor of the DMRC will be inspected.”On February 11, the high court had asked the CEC to “consider as representation” the plea, which contended that felling over 11,000 trees for the Metro construction would have an adverse effect on the ambient air quality of the national capital, where pollution is already at critical levels.In a notice issued on February 15, CEC member secretary had called the Delhi chief secretary, principal chief conservator forests (PCCF), public works department (PWD) engineer-in-chief, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) member secretary, as well as representatives of the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC) and ministry of housing and urban affairs, to hear the grievances of the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scpanel-inspects-metro-phase-4-sites-to-see-if-trees-can-be-saved-101614795213317.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Court grants bail to five arrested for violence on R-Day||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to five persons, including a class 10 student, arrested in connection with the violence at Nangloi Chowk during the farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day. While granting bail, the court said the accused cannot be kept in custody on the mere apprehension that they would commit the same crime again, especially when they have no criminal antecedents.Additional sessions judge Sudhanshu Kaushik granted bail to class 10 student Naveen, Ashish, Parvesh, Deepak Singh and Ravi on a bail bond of ₹30,000 while also noting that no tear gas gun was recovered from the accused despite the city police claiming that the accused had forcefully taken the gun from the police.“It was alleged that during the incident, the accused and his accomplices robbed the tear gas gun of the police but the same could not be recovered. Record shows that investigation in the matter, qua the applicant, already stands concluded. He is stated to be in custody for more than a month. No previous criminal involvement of the applicant has been alleged by the prosecution,” Kaushik said.“Keeping in view all these factors, I am of the considered opinion that there is no point in keeping the accused further detained in custody. He cannot be kept detained in custody merely on the apprehension that he might again commit a similar offence, more particularly, when there is no record of previous involvement,” the judge said in five separate orders for each of the accused.The police had arrested the accused on charges of rioting, dacoity, criminal conspiracy and damaging public property during the tractor rally to protest against the three contentious farm laws of the Centre. The police, while opposing the bail pleas, had contended that there are serious allegations against the accused and several police personnel were injured in the rioting.The police also told the court that in order to disperse the mob, they had to fire tear gas shells following which the protesters turned violent and started attacking the police personnel with sticks, rods, stones and deadly weapons. The police also said the accused are not farmers and were hired to instigate rioting.Appearing for the police, the public prosecutor (PP) told the court that the agitation against farm laws is still continuing and there is every likelihood that the accused might commit similar offences, in case they are released on bail.Advocate Jaspreet Singh Rai for the accused told the court that the accused had been falsely implicated in the present case and they have been kept in custody without any purpose since January 26. He said there was an inordinate delay of around 18 hours in the registration of the FIR while contending that the delay has not been explained by the police.He also stated that the accused had come to Delhi to peacefully participate in the protest march of farmers and they did not resort to rioting. He argued that the accused have not been captured on any CCTV cameras and the police have falsely implicated them. He added that nothing but sticks were recovered from the accused.The court accepted the contentions and granted bail to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-grants-bail-to-five-arrested-for-violence-on-rday-101614795153453.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Riots, Tablighi Jamaat issues resonated in Chauhan Banger result||Of the municipal five wards where bypolls were held on Sunday, Chauhan Banger– a Muslim-dominated ward in north-east Delhi where communal riots erupted in February last year, recorded the biggest victory margin.The Congress won the seat defeating the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by a margin of 10,642 votes. In the other four municipal seats that went to the bypolls, AAP defeated BJP with victory margins ranging between 2,705 (Shalimar Bagh) and 7,043 (Kalyanpuri), election commission data showed.Zubair Ahmad, the Congress candidate who won the seat on Wednesday, said: “People in the area were affected by the north-east Delhi riots and they felt that Arvind Kejriwal abandoned them during the crisis. Then, they were disgruntled about the way the AAP government dealt with the Tablighi Jamaat issue during the Covid-19 lockdown. There were development-related issues too and people of Chauhan Banger did not have any trust on AAP.”Zubair is the son of Mateen Ahmad, five-time MLA from Seelampur assembly segment. Ahmad, a veteran Congress leader, unsuccessfully contested the 2020 assembly polls from Seelampur. Chauhan Banger ward is a part of Seelampur assembly constituency.The AAP candidate, Mohd Ishraq Khan, a former MLA from Seelampur, agreed that there was “anger among people in Chauhan Banger” but said, “While we focused our campaign more on development issues – sanitation, school, health centres, roads, etc – the Congress focused on the riots and Tablighi Jamaat issues.”The AAP’s in-charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak said the party could not win the Chauhan Banger seat because the Congress candidate was more “popular” among people and there were other “local factors”. He further said, “But the biggest thing is that the BJP did not win a single seat in the municipal bypolls.”Chauhan Banger ward has around 40,000 voters, of which around 22,000 cast their votes in the February 28 municipal bypolls, election commission data showed. While the Congress got 16,203 votes, the AAP got 5,561 and the BJP candidate got only 105 votes in the ward.Praveen Rai, political analyst with the centre for study of developing societies, said: “The huge gap between the votes garnered by the Congress and runner up AAP in Chauhan Banger reflects the resentment among the Muslim community over Delhi riots and the Tablighi Jamaat incidents... The AAP has to develop political strategies to ensure that it retains its Muslim voter base in Delhi. The alienation of the Muslims from AAP can lead to an en-masse shift of the community’s vote to the Congress in the 2022 municipal polls. This will not only hurt the electoral prospects of AAP in local elections in the national capital, but also help save the BJP from a major political defeat.”Rahul Verma, a fellow with the Centre for Policy Research, differed. He said, “It would be difficult to draw larger interpretations from this one ward. Similar resentment factors -- related to the anti-citizenship law protests and AAP trying to fight the BJP with Hindu-oriented strategies such as Hanuman worship during the assembly poll campaign -- could have affected the Muslim vote base ahead of the 2020 assembly elections too. But Muslims still voted for the AAP in large numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/riots-tablighi-jamaat-issues-resonated-in-chauhan-banger-result-says-winner-cong-candidate-101614795153976.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Five held for violence and rioting in Mukundpur in outer Delhi||After a video of mob rioting and firing in the air in outer Delhi’s Mukundpur surfaced on social media on Tuesday, police arrested five men on Wednesday and said the violence was perpetrated by a group of men to intimidate and dissuade their rivals in a plot dispute.The video, taken from CCTV footage, is about 6 minutes long and shows at least 10 to 15 masked men carrying rods and stones hitting the shutter of a chemist’s shop, damaging parked motorcycles on the road, pelting stones, and firing in the air. On Tuesday, the video was widely shared on social media, prompting the Delhi Police to register an FIR and identify the rioters.Police said the video was from Mukundpur, under the Bhalswa Dairy police station limits in outer Delhi, and the incident took place on March 1.Deputy commissioner of police (Outer) Rajiv Ranjan identified the five men as Rahul, Arif, Rakesh (identified only by their first names) Amit Khanna, and Rustom Ali. “We have identified more suspects. Five teams are still conducting searches to arrest the others,” the officer said.Police said the men had a dispute with a resident of Mukundpur. “They wanted to usurp a disputed plot and resorted to violence as a show of strength. We have recovered one spent bullet cartridge from the spot. The arrest has been made on the basis of video evidence. We have identified other persons and will make more arrests soon,” DCP Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/five-held-for-violence-and-rioting-in-mukundpur-in-outer-delhi-101614795094729.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||220 acre Bharat Vandana park in Dwarka sub-city gets green clearance||Spread over 220 acres of verdant greenery in Dwarka sub-city, Bharat Vandana park is being developed as a major tourist destination by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). The project -- the park will be developed in the shape of lotus —recently got clearance from the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC).DDA officials said it will be a one-of-its-kind park with an eco-forest zone, several lakes, cultural and adventure sports facilities and a ‘Mini India’ park that will have replicas of important monuments from different states. The park is being developed by NBCC India, which was roped in by the DDA in 2019.“The project has got the environment clearance,” said a DDA official on Wednesday.The park will be designed in the shape of a lotus flower with each petal acting as a zone for a dedicated activity. As per the plan, the park will have 10 zones: congregational zone, cultural zone, pushpa kriti sarovar zone, eco-sensitive zone, meditation garden zone, fun park zone, adventure park zone, lake view restaurant zone, mini India zone and the vandana sarovar zone.DDA officials said each zone will be spread over 10 to 12 acres. For instance, the fun park will have gaming and other facilities for children while the eco-sensitive zone will be developed as a dense green zone with a large number of medicinal plants. The plan, DDA officials said, is to eventually hold tree walks for nature enthusiasts. There will be a dedicated area for food plazas and restaurants, including one overlooking the many water bodies and lake.The project was conceived in 2019 and its foundation stone was laid by Union home minister Amit Shah in December 2019. The ₹530 crore project is aimed at developing the park as one of the main tourist attractions in the national capital. DDA officials said work has started at the site and the project is expected to be ready by November 2022.The adventure park is going to be a key attraction at the park. DDA officials say the Delhi Master Plan 2021 allows adventure parks to be developed on up to 10 hectares. The adventure park proposed at the site will have a zip-line facility.The mini India park will be the other key attraction as it will have miniature replicas of popular monuments in the country. The park has been conceptualised to outline the heritage of India, said a DDA official.When the plan was proposed, environmentalists and some local residents had opposed it, as they wanted the area to be developed as a biodiversity park. Diwan Singh, an environmental activist and a resident of Dwarka, said, “This area should be developed as a natural green space. It will help mitigate the increase in pollution in the area. There is a provision to make a parking space for 1,700 vehicles. Given the increase in pollution levels, there is a need to protect such green spaces.”As per the EAC minutes, close to 99 acres of the area will be developed as a landscape area and over 26 acres will have water bodies and lakes. There will be 30 rainwater harvesting recharge pits spread across the park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/220-acre-bharat-vandana-park-in-dwarka-sub-city-gets-green-clearance-101614795093440.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi traffic police test new diversion plan for Ashram flyover extension||Delhi traffic police on Wednesday began trials on a diversion plan that will see vehicles on the Ring Road and Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway being redirected as the Ashram flyover is extended. Traffic officials said that this was an assessment to see how the traffic flow would be impacted during peak rush and non-rush hours, once the diversions are put in place for construction work.On Wednesday, vehicles coming from east Delhi and Noida via the DND, going towards Lajpat Nagar, were not allowed to take the Ashram flyover. Instead, the traffic was diverted to Mathura Road, from where they had to take a U-turn from the New Friends Colony traffic signal and then take a left turn on the Ring Road towards Lajpat Nagar.This diversions were first put in place for four hours between 11am and 3pm, before being again implemented after 7pm.Senior traffic police officials said that the diversion was lifted and traffic movement was normal during the peak traffic hours — between 8am and 11am, and then again between 3 pm and 7pm.“Since this was the first day, we tried the route only during the non-rush hours, so that there are no major traffic holdups. We will be trying this route and different permutations of it in the coming days before a final diversion plan is approved for the Public Works Department (PWD),” said a traffic police official.The official also said that this was not the final diversion plan that will be in place once work for the extension of the Ashram flyover is started.“Since this stretch is among the busiest, and it already has some ongoing construction work, formulating a traffic plan for minimum inconvenience to commuters is becoming a little tricky. But we will come up with the best route. We are likely to release the final traffic plan in two weeks,” the official said.Traffic police and PWD officials confirmed that the construction agency had sent a request to divert traffic on the Ring Road in January this year, to initiate work for the extension of the Ashram flyover.In their permission request, the PWD had stated that the construction work of the underpass at the intersection was in its final leg, and before any major digging work begins on the Ring Road, the barricades placed on Mathura Road will be cleared and this will act as a diversion for traffic. The current deadline for the completion of the underpass is April 31.Hindustan Times had on Tuesday reported how the simultaneous construction work at and around the Ashram intersection, from where every day over 3.5 lakhs vehicle pass during peak traffic hours, is likely to cause a traffic nightmare for commuters.The Public Works Department (PWD) last month started work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road, even as work on a 750-metre Ashram underpass is going on after already missing its deadline. These two projects running simultaneously has made one of the Capital’s most crucial intersections — one that connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the connection for two NCR cities Noida and Faridabad — a nightmare for commuters.After missing its December deadline, the PWD is yet to finish work for the 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and CSIR Apartments on Mathura Road. A week ago, the PWD also started placing barricades on the Kilokri side and on the Maharani Bagh side of the Ring Road, which has further thinned down space for traffic movement.Experts said that the PWD is “biting more than it can chew” and this will ultimately result in long and mismanaged traffic on the stretch. The impact of this is also likely to spillover to adjoining roads, including Sarai Kale Khan, Noida Link Road, Meerut Expressway, and the Ring Road.“What we are seeing at Ashram is a classic example of poor site management from traffic and safety point of view, and the agency is repeating the same mistakes by undertaking work on the Ring Road before wrapping up the underpass project. How does the agency expect Mathura Road to take the load of the flyover, when large portions of it are barricaded?” said Subhash Chand, head of traffic engineering and safety division at the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-traffic-police-test-new-diversion-plan-for-ashram-flyover-extension-101614795094159.html

04-03-2021||Delhi||MCD bypolls: BJP’s loss outcome of poor performance in civic bodies||Drawing a blank in the bypoll to five municipal wards and losing one of its strongholds has come as a setback to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP0 ahead of the 2022 civic polls in Delhi with political analysts pointing out that the results reflect the party’s poor governance of the three municipal bodies.To be sure of the five wards that went to polls, AAP had won four in the 2017 civic polls and the BJP won the fifth seat. The BJP rules all three municipal corporations with a clear majority and the current results will not have a bearing on the party position in the three MCDs.Party leaders, however, admitted on Wednesday that the defeat of BJP candidate in Shalimar Bagh ward, which is considered its stronghold, is likely an outcome of its performance in the three MCDs as well as anti-incumbency.Experts also said that the AAP’s sustained campaign on local issues and the Delhi government’s record also helped it sweep the bypolls. Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor in the department of political science at Ramjas College, said, “AAP’s victory in Shalimar Bagh is an indication that people like their model of governance. People have seen how the party managed the Covid crisis.”Residents of Shalimar Bagh said for the past four years the area witnessed little development. They said they voted for essential services such as sanitation, good roads, etc.Sanjay Saini, a resident of Shalimar village, said, “From sanitation to road repair, the civic bodies have not been able to provide any essential services. They don’t have the funds for it. Our ward is one of the most neglected wards as no work has happened here in the past five years, especially after the death of the sitting councillor.”Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, who was in-charge of Shalimar Bagh, said, “We accept the verdict. There are a lot of factors that were responsible for today’s result and we will analyse it.”AAP’s in-charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak said the BJP’s poor showing shows that people are not happy by its performance in the MCDs. He also said that AAP did extremely well. “Four out of five seats is a big win, especially a seat like Shalimar Bagh which was a stronghold of the BJP. The BJP losing that seat and scoring a zero in the bypolls shows how disgruntled people are with the BJP.”In its campaign, the BJP focused on the work done by the Centre and alleged failure of the AAP government to deliver on its pre-poll promises. The BJP also raised the issue of alleged corruption in the Delhi Jal Board. It held protests and rallies in different parts of the city against the AAP. It also carried out fund collection drive for the Ram temple, citing it as one of the key achievements of the BJP.Locals, however, said national issues cannot work in local elections. “What the Modi government has done is irrelevant in this election, as it is a local election and people voted on local issues,” said Giri Bharadwaj, a resident of CC block in Shalimar Bagh.In other wards too, the issue of sanitation, repair of internal roads, encroachment, lack of development were the key issues on which people voted. In Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri East, BJP lost the election to AAP by 7,043 and 4,986 votes respectively.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that the party will analyse the result and take corrective measures. He also accused the AAP government of paralysing the corporations by not releasing funds on time. Gupta said, “We will have to look into all the aspects and analyse the reason for our defeat. The municipal corporations have not been able to work properly due to the lack of funds. The Delhi government is to be blamed for it.”Playing down the bypoll results, some BJP leaders said that not much should be read into it. They said that of the five wards, BJP won only Shalimar Bagh in 2017.Other party leaders demanded a course correction, citing margins of loss. “The margin of victory in municipal bypolls is usually not very high. The fact that we lost Kalyanpuri by 7,043 votes and Trilokpuri East by 4,986 votes. Losing our stronghold (Shalimar Bagh) by 2,705 votes indicates that there is something wrong. The party needs to change its strategy,” said a senior BJP leader, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcdbypolls-bjp-s-loss-outcome-of-poor-performance-in-civic-bodies-101614795034795.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Winter was more polluted this year, but saw fewer smog days: CSE analysis||The seasonal average pollution levels in Delhi this winter was higher than previous years, but the severity and smog episodes this year was lower, an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has shown.The analysis also shows that north Delhi recorded the worst pollution levels in the city this winter, with Jahagirpuri emerging as the hot spot with the worst air.There were two continuous smog episodes during this year’s winter. The first episode was of longer duration as it started on November 3 and lasted seven days. The second started on December 22 and lasted three days. Thus, the continuous smog episodes were fewer and shorter compared to previous winters. The 2019-20 winter had three smog episodes of eight, six and five-days durations respectively; the 2018-19 winter had four smog episodes of 10 days, two episodes of six days, and one of three-days duration.Among the four neighbouring satellite towns of Delhi, Ghaziabad was the most polluted, the CSE’s winter air quality analysis — which was made based on the air quality recordings of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) official online portal Central Control Room for Air Quality Management (CAQM) between October 15 and February 1— further read.“There is always a special interest in understanding winter pollution trends, given the extraordinary situation we faced due to the pandemic this year, as well as the fact that winter remains the most difficult season in this region due to atmospheric conditions of inversion, calm wind, and cold weather,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE.She added, “The winter air traps local and regional pollutants and gives rise to the deadly winter smog that we, the residents of Delhi-NCR, are so familiar with.”The trends show that the number of days with ”severe” and “very poor” levels of PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) concentration was comparatively lower this winter. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), which is a set of emergency measures that kick in as the PM levels reach a certain mark, air quality is considered to be in the ‘severe’ zone when the PM 2.5 levels are above 250ug/m3 or the PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) are above 430ug/m3. It is categorised as ‘poor’ when the PM 2.5 levels are between 91ug/m3 and 120ug/m3 or the PM 10 levels are between 251ug/m3 and 350ug/m3.However, the number of days in the “poor” pollution category has increased. At the same time, the overall city-wide average for the season was comparatively higher this year, the analysis found.For Delhi, this average stood at 186μg/m3, which is 7% higher than the seasonal average of 2019-20 winters.Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE’s urban lab team of the sustainable cities programme, said, “On a year-on-year basis, the annual average PM2.5 levels are declining in Delhi. Is this also moderating the impact on the pollution build-up and severe peaks during winter? This analysis of winter pollution trends since 2018 helps understand the patterns of change.”He said,“Overall, higher seasonal average but lower peak can be attributed to meteorology and changes in farm stubble burning patterns. But considerable variation has been noted among individual stations in the city. This also indicates the dominance of local pollution sources.”At a more hyper-local level, except at Wazirpur and Sahibabad, all the locations in the Delhi-NCR pollution hot spots list saw a spike in the seasonal PM2.5 levels, compared to last winter.Jahangirpuri, with a seasonal average of 256μg/m3, was the dirtiest among the hot spots. Bahadurgarh — that recorded an almost 50% spike in its PM2.5 level — was the cleanest.The findings also showed that steep deterioration was noted in many locations in the Capital that are not yet designated as ‘hot spots’ by the pollution monitoring agencies.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPC) defines hot spots as those areas where the annual average pollution levels are higher than the mean value of the city.During the winter months, at least 14 more locations registered higher seasonal averages than the mean of recognised hot spots (197μg/m3).These were Alipur, Delhi Technological University (DTU), ITO, Nehru Nagar, Patparganj, Sonia Vihar and Vivek Vihar in Delhi, sectors-1 and 116 in Noida, Loni, Sanjay Vihar and Indirapuram in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park in Greater Noida, and Bulandshahr.“These trends show that urgent next steps are needed for scale and speed of action across all sectors and across NCR. The region needs massive clean fuel and technology transition in industries, time-bound implementation of power plant standards, massive transportation and mobility transition across Delhi and NCR, and a paradigm shift in waste management with strong compliance and accountability,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/winter-was-more-polluted-this-year-but-saw-fewer-smog-days-cse-analysis-101614795034251.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||Bypoll results indication of things to come outcome of 2022 civic polls:Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the results of the bypoll to five municipal wards has given a positive indication ahead of the 2022 municipal polls in the Capital, adding that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has failed to govern the municipal corporations in Delhi (MCDs).While the AAP is in power at the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal bodies. Full municipal polls are scheduled to be held in Delhi in 2022.“I congratulate party workers for their hard work and the people of Delhi for the big win. The results show that people of Delhi trust the AAP’s model of good governance. In 2015 assembly polls, we won 67 out of 70 seats. In 2020, we won 62 out of 70 seats. Now, we have won four of the five seats in the municipal bypolls. It shows that people are happy with our work,” said Kejriwal on Wednesday, while addressing a gathering at the party headquarters on DDU Marg in central Delhi.The AAP on Wednesday won four of the five wards where bypolls were held on Sunday. Wards which went to polls were Rohini-C and Shalimar Bagh under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation; and Trilokpuri East, Kalyanpuri and Chauhan Banger under the East corporation. The AAP won all wards except Chauhan Banger where the Congress candidate defeated his AAP rival. The BJP could not win any seat.The five seats fell vacant after four councillors won the assembly elections in 2020 and one died (the councillor of Shalimar Bagh) two years ago.Kejriwal said, “Also, the BJP winning no seat in the bypoll reflects that people are extremely unhappy with BJP’s governance of the municipal bodies. The BJP has failed in the governance of the MCDs and there is corruption everywhere. Their constant rant about seeking funds from the Delhi government for operating the MCDs have upset people. The Delhi government has paid all its dues to the BJP, but the BJP leaders have spent it all. Now, they cannot even pay salaries. Even the Delhi government gets very less from the central government, but we chose to work harder on better governance instead of ranting about inadequate funds. People know these things. We have improved hospitals, schools, subsidised power and water bills and improved condition of roads.”The chief minister also mentioned the vandalism at the Delhi Jal Board by a mob led by Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and some workers of BJP barging into the residence of Manish Sisodia, saying people have taken note of the politics of violence being perpetrated by the BJP.“This is not why people had voted the BJP to power in the municipal polls (in 2017). The bypoll results give an indication of how people would vote in the 2022 municipal polls in Delhi. I congratulate all the winning candidates and wish them luck for better work in their municipal wards,” said Kejriwal.Delhi-BJP president Adesh Gupta dismissed CM’s allegations as “baseless”. He said, “We accept the people’s verdict. But this is not the end. We will analyse the result and take corrective measures. We have a year to prepare for the municipal polls. We will continue our protest against the failure of the AAP government to deliver on its promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bypoll-results-indication-of-things-to-come-outcome-of-2022-civic-polls-kejriwal-101614795033576.html
04-03-2021||Delhi||DU, College of Art faculty oppose merger with Ambedkar University Delhi||Delhi University officials and members of the faculty at the College of Art on Wednesday said the Delhi government’s decision to merge the institution with the state-run Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) was “illegal and arbitrary” even as the AAP government asserted that the college needed reforms and that it was authorised to decide the college’s affiliation.The college, which is currently affiliated with Delhi University, is funded fully by the Delhi government. The Delhi Cabinet on Tuesday decided to merge the college, located on Tilak Marg in central Delhi, with AUD. It offers six undergraduate and five postgraduate courses in applied art, art history, painting, printmaking, visual communication, and culture. Around 1,400 students are currently enrolled with the college.DU officials and the faculty also alleged that the government did not follow the due process.DU registrar Vikas Gupta said the Delhi government has not followed the “democratic process”. “The government wrote to the university 8-10 days ago, saying that they wanted to take over the college. But it did not give us the required time to follow the due process.”“As per the democratic process, we asked the principal of the College of Art to give the comment. Once we receive the response, we will have to place it before our academic council. In case the academic council approves, the matter will go to the executive council for final approval. However, we have not yet received any comment from the college principal yet and the Delhi government has already announced the decision... We are not even sure if the Ambedkar University can affiliate colleges,” he said.Also read: DU, Singapore Fine Arts Society sign MoU on collaboration in Indian musicDelhi education minister Manish Sisodia said the government was authorised to take a decision about a college owned by it. “It is a Delhi government college. It’s up to the Delhi government to decide from which university it wants to attach it. The college is in really bad shape. It needs lots of reforms and its staff needs lots of support,” Sisodia said, adding that the Ambedkar University Delhi is authorised to have constituent colleges.DU will write to the Delhi government on Thursday, asking it to follow the “due process”, said Dean of Colleges Balram Pani. “The way the Delhi government has taken the decision is illegal. We are writing to them to follow the due process before taking any decision...We will take legal action in the matter if the government will not do so” he said.The college faculty said on Wednesday that they were not consulted by the authorities. “We got to know about the decision through news reporters on Wednesday. The change in affiliation with a state university will change our service conditions and salary structure… We have been getting frantic calls from the students since morning. Most of the students enrol here just for a DU degree,” said a faculty member at the college, requesting anonymity.College officiating principal BS Chauhan, however, said that it will be good for the college and students if it merges with AUD. “The college has been struggling to function smoothly due to the involvement of multiple agencies. There has been no permanent appointment on the principal’s post since 2012. We only have 14 faculty at present on over 56 sanctioned posts. All the remaining posts are lying vacant. The Delhi government’s decision will be good for the college and students,” he said.In a statement, DU teachers’ association (DUTA) criticised the Delhi government’s decision. “This can be seen as a continuation of the attempts to push premier and specialised institutions into the self-financing mode with no responsibility to fund as was done in the case of DTU and NSIT,” it said.In 2019, the Delhi government de-affiliated the Delhi College of Engineering from DU and made a separate university called the Delhi Technological University (DTU). It also converted DU’s Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology into a university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-college-of-art-faculty-oppose-merger-with-ambedkar-university-delhi-101614794972768.html

04-03-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka minister steps down after accusations of sexual exploitation||Ramesh Jarkiholi, who served as Karnataka’s water resources minister in the B.S.Yediyurappa-led government, on Wednesday resigned from the cabinet a day after allegations of sexual exploitation surfaced against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Gokak in Belagavi district.In his resignation letter, which was shared by the chief minister’s office, Jarkiholi stated that the allegations against him are “far from the truth”.“There should be an investigation into this. Even though I am innocent, I am taking moral responsibility and resigning from the cabinet,” Jarkiholi said in the letter, written in Kannada.Jarkiholi’s resignation comes a day before the commencement of the month-long budget session in Karnataka. His resignation is expected to help Yediyurappa avoid the issue in the legislature, the incident has given ammunition to the opposition to attack Jarkiholi who was one of the main players in the defection drama that led to the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) -Congress coalition government in 2019.Also Read | Karnataka minister faces allegations of sexual exploitation“It is disgusting to watch. Such people (Ramesh) are ministers in Yediyurappa’s council of ministers. His brother (Balachandra) has threatened Yediyurappa that he will release a CD against the chief minister if they ask for his brother’s (Ramesh) resignation. Should such people remain in power,” Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of the opposition said, while addressing a gathering as part of the party’s Padayatra near Bengaluru on Wednesday.Jarkiholi was dropped from the Kumaraswamy government over non-performance in 2018. He is one of five powerful Jarkiholi brothers who wield significant influence in the border district of Belagavi, about 508 km from Bengaluru. Dinesh Kalahalli, a social activist, filed a police complaint on Tuesday in Bengaluru’s Cubbon Park station. An unverified video of a person resembling the minister with an unnamed woman has gone viral with TV news channels in Karnataka playing the incident on loop. Also doing the rounds is an alleged phone call between the two, in which the person believed to be the minister is making corruption allegations against the CM.Hindustan Times could not independently verify the contents of the video or the call.Over the last decade, successive governments in Karnataka have been left red-faced over the surfacing of sex-scandals. Hartal Halappa, the food and civil supplies minister in the Yediyurappa-led BJP government in 2010, was forced to resign after allegations of rape. Two years later, two ministers—Laxman Savadhi and CC Patil—of the D.V.Sadananda Gowda-led BJP government were caught watching porn on their mobile phones during assembly proceedings. Savadhi is currently one of three deputy chief ministers of Karnataka while Patil is the minister for small-scale industries. In 2016, HY Meti, then excise minister in the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, was forced to resign after a video of him allegedly seeking sexual favours from a woman surfaced. More recently, Congress MLC Prakash Rathod was caught watching porn during proceedings.“Whatever the complaint is there (against Jarkiholi), based on the complaint we are doing the inquiry as per the law,” Basavaraj Bommai, state’s home, law and parliamentary minister said in Bengaluru on Wednesday.Kalahalli, in his complaint on Tuesday, alleged that Jarkiholi sexually exploited the woman in the guise of helping her land a government job at Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).Ramesh Jarkiholi could not be reached for comment.Jarkiholi, on Tuesday night, told TV reporters that the video was fake and the incident was a political conspiracy. “The identity of this woman is unknown and the complaint has been lodged by some random person. Taking this complaint itself if wrong. I have requested the CM to give the case to the CBI or COD (CID),” Balachandra Jarkiholi, Ramesh’s brother and BJP MLA told reporters on Wednesday after meeting Yediyurappa.Already under pressure for non-performance, internal fighting and the state’s parlous financial situation, the incident has added to the troubles of the Yediyurappa-led government that has two years before it faces elections in 2023. Jarkiholi, who was among the first to defect to the BJP in 2019, helped engineer defections from the coalition government. He is also the district in-charge minister for Belagavi and hoped to be made deputy CM for his role in helping Yediyurappa to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-minister-steps-down-after-accusations-of-sexual-exploitation-101614761972174.html
04-03-2021||World||Italy blocks Astra Covid vaccine export, risks backlash against EU||Italy has blocked a shipment of the AstraZeneca Plc.’s coronavirus vaccine to Australia, using a recently introduced European Union regulation for the first time, in a move that risks triggering a global backlash.The decision comes after Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi called during an EU summit last week for a tougher approach against companies that don’t respect their delivery commitments. Officials in Brussels and in Rome confirmed the news of the export ban of 250,000 doses of the shots, which was first reported by the Financial Times.The impact is likely to be largely symbolic given that the number of the vaccines blocked is relatively small compared to the company’s expected deliveries in the EU and elsewhere. But the move highlights Draghi’s intention to be tougher on pharmaceuticals that do not respect their commitments to the EU, and could encourage retaliatory protectionist measures by other governments.In January, the European Commission introduced legislation which allows curbs on exports of coronavirus vaccines if drugmakers fail to meet delivery targets within the bloc. The rules came into force after AstraZeneca had informed the EU that it was unable to meet its commitments under an advance purchase agreement.Damaging ProtectionismUnder the so-called export transparency mechanism, countries have to inform the commission, the EU’s executive arm, of their decisions to block or allow exports of vaccines outside the bloc. The commission did not oppose Italy’s decision, an EU official said. The company declined to comment.Italy is the first country so far to block the export of vaccines outside the EU, while over 170 requests have so far been authorized, according to a separate EU diplomat.The decision could reignite concerns echoed by many including the World Health Organization that the EU is engaging in damaging protectionism, at a time when countries around the world race to immunize their populations amid growing concerns over fast-spreading coronavirus variants.The EU has so far administered doses equivalent to just over 8% of its population, compared to 32.3% and 24.3% in the U.K. and the U.S. respectively, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. The bloc’s target is to inoculate at least 70% of the region’s adult population by the end of the summer.The export controls may also prove to be a growing headache for drugmakers with so many manufacturing sites in the EU. Most companies at the forefront of the vaccine effort have production capacity in the bloc that is used to serve countries beyond it, or must be sent outside for completion before returning.Johnson & Johnson, which is expected to receive approval for its vaccine from Europe’s medicines regulator next week, explicitly agreed in its contract with the EU that it would be sending vaccines to the U.S. to be put in vials and packaged before returning them.Draghi asked leaders at the latest summit to adopt a more resolute and pragmatic approach to speed up vaccinations and told them the EU’s rollout has to move much faster. He wasn’t convinced by a slide shown to leaders indicating that available doses will be sufficient to vaccinate the bulk of the bloc’s population by the end of September. Draghi said deliveries in the second and third quarters couldn’t be predicted.The newly installed Italian premier is working on an overhaul of Italy’s slow and uneven vaccination campaign, focusing on logistics and recruiting the military to help, as new variants accelerate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.He has signaled a strong break with the past by replacing two key officials who were in charge of countering the virus, and he wants to streamline and standardize inoculation procedures across the country, according to officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential preparations.Draghi is banking on an improved vaccination campaign to help kick-start an economy which shrunk almost 9% in 2020, crippled by the pandemic and both regional and nationwide lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-blocks-astra-covid-vaccine-export-risks-backlash-against-eu-101614879092725.html

Charles Spencer, has alleged that Bashir used false documents, including fake bank statements, and other dishonest tactics to convince Diana to agree to the interview.Police Commander Alex Murray said detectives had “carefully assessed” the allegations and sought advice from lawyers.“Following this detailed assessment and in view of the advice we received, we have determined that it is not appropriate to begin a criminal investigation into these allegations,” he said. “No further action will be taken.“In this matter, as in any other, should any significant new evidence come to light we will assess it," he added.The BBC has begun its own investigation, led by a retired judge, into the circumstances surrounding the program.The interview, in which Diana famously said “there were three of us in this marriage” — referring to Prince Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles —was watched by millions of people and sent shockwaves through the monarchy.Diana divorced from Charles in 1996 and died in a Paris car crash in 1997 as she was pursued by paparazzi.

04-03-2021||World||World’s first space hotel expected to open in 2027. Check the inside of planned 'Voyager Station'||Space construction company Orbital Assembly Corporation recently unveiled new details about its ambitious project of building a hotel above Earth’s atmosphere. Gateway Foundation first came up with the concept in 2012 and the Californian company later established OAC to realise its dream of building the first commercial hotel in space. The company is planning to start building the hotel, Voyager Station, in the low Earth orbit in 2025 that could be operational as early as 2027, reported the Daily Mail.The space hotel will be different from the International Space Station (ISS) since the giant wheel with 24 modules, connected by elevator shafts, will rotate to generate artificial gravity of a level found on the Moon’s surface. It will also have 44 emergency return vehicles (ERVs) with automated flight controls for autonomous landing, according to the construction company.With over 11,600 square metres of habitable space, the commercial station will have many features expected in a cruise ship, including luxury villas, hotel suites, gym, restaurant and bar. “Simulated gravity will offer amenities like toilet facilities, showers, and beds that function similar to what you are used to on Earth,” the company’s website says.Read | Indian-origin Nasa scientist controlling Perseverance rover from his London flatExplaining the design, OAC said in a series of tweets that the Voyager Station will be assembled in orbit before spin-up using automation and telerobotics. The docking hub at the centre, where the Operation and Control Center (OCC) will be located, is expected to function as a stand-alone zero gravity station. The first OCC will be in place from the beginning that will allow the crew members to live on station to operate the pods and drones.The planned orbit and elevation for Voyager Station is 97 degree and 500-550 kilometres from Earth surface in a sun-synchronous orbit. This means the space hotel will be synchronised to always be in the same ‘fixed’ position relative to the Sun, helping reduce thermal stress and allow for almost continuous solar power generation. According to OAC, orbit degradation and space debris risk will also be nominal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-first-space-hotel-with-artificial-gravity-expected-to-open-in-2027-101614876652538.html
04-03-2021||World||Italy sees sharpest fall in energy demand since WWII due to pandemic: Report||Italy's energy demand fell last year at the fastest rate since World War Two as a sharp drop in road and air traffic during the pandemic undercut oil consumption, a study showed on Thursday.Italian energy and technology research centre ENEA said energy demand in the country slumped 10% last year, driven by a 60% fall in oil consumption."The fall in energy demand is the highest since 1943-44, when Italy was in the middle of World War Two," ENEA analyst Francesco Gracceva said.At the time of the financial crisis in 2009 energy consumption fell by "only" 5.7%, he added.ENEA gave no forecasts for whether the decline in demand would continue this year.Severe coronavirus restrictions to contain surging infection rates weighed on energy demand across Europe last year as travel slowed to a trickle and industry cut back production. Italy has been one of the worst hit countries in Europe, with 98,635 deaths from Covid-19.As energy demand fell, carbon emissions in Italy dropped by 12% last year to levels 40% below those of 2005, ENEA said, adding imports of low-carbon technology, especially electric and hybrid cars, jumped 27%.The sharp fall in oil demand pushed the share of fossil fuels in Italy's energy mix to their lowest level since 1961 while gas remained the main energy source.Electricity demand fell 5.3% for the year while power prices fell 15% for companies and 10% for consumers, ENEA said.Thanks to the fall in overall energy consumption, the share of renewable energy rose to 20%, "data that allows Italy to beat the EU target of 17% set for 2020," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-sees-sharpest-fall-in-energy-demand-since-wwii-due-to-pandemic-report-101614877610818.html

Defense officials say the new proposal is being reviewed by the Pentagon.The request underscores the continuing concerns about security and the potential for violence at the Capitol, two months after rioters breached the building in violence that left five people dead. And it comes as law enforcement was on high alert Thursday around the U.S. Capitol after intelligence uncovered a “possible plot” by a militia group to storm the building.The potential plot is tied to the far-right conspiracy theory promoted by QAnon supporters that former President Donald Trump will rise again to power on March 4, the original presidential inauguration day.U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., said she learned that the request for a 60-day extension was made in the last 36 hours, and that the Guard is now seeking volunteers from states around the country to fill the need.Defense officials confirmed that the request is under review at the Pentagon, and that the Guard has started checking states for availability of their troops, in an effort to be prepared if final Defense Department approval is given. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.There are more than 5,000 Guard members currently in Washington, D.C., all slated to go home on March 12, ending the mission.Slotkin said some members of Congress have been concerned about whether there is a solid plan to provide security for members and staff going forward.“We want to understand what the plan is,” she said. “None of us like looking at the fencing, the gates, the uniformed presence around the Capitol. We can’t depend on the National Guard for our security.”She said there has to be a plan that provides the needed security for the buildings and personnel by the Capitol Police and local law enforcement. Slotkin said it was telling that House members hastened to complete major votes Wednesday so they wouldn't have to be in the building where many fled violent rioters in January. Lawmakers, she said, “don't feel totally secure” in the Capitol.U.S. Capitol Police officials have also told congressional leaders the razor-wire topped fencing around the Capitol should remain in place for several more months.Slotkin said, however, that she was going to her office to work on Thursday. “I'm not going to let these guys scare me away,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-request-60-day-extension-of-guard-at-us-capitol-101614877044590.html

People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate."Hope everyone is ok out there - especially on the East Coast who would have felt the full force of that earthquake," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram.There was threat to the capital Wellington and other regions, but civil defence authorities asked residents across the country to stay away from beaches and marine areas as there could be strong and unusual currents.More than 60,000 people reported feeling the quake on GeoNet's website, with 282 describing the shaking as "severe" and 75 saying it was "extreme". Most others described it as light.Aftershocks were still being recorded in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-quake-shakes-new-zealand-but-no-damage-reported-and-tsunami-threat-eases-101614876308709.html
04-03-2021||World||White House says relief checks to go to most who got December payment||Roughly 98% of US households that received a Covid-19 relief check in December will also qualify for the next round of payments being championed by President Joe Biden, according to a White House official.Biden has said that Americans were promised $2,000 in direct checks, but only $600 was approved in December. The president views that promise as a cornerstone of his $1.9 trillion relief package pending in the Senate. His proposal offers $1,400 in additional payments that would quickly phase out based on income, so that money is better aimed at the middle class and poor.Under the current Senate bill, the Biden administration estimates that 158.5 million households will receive direct payments, according to the White House official who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official stressed that almost everyone gets a check twice as large as in December, although 3.5 million households that received some payment from the $900 billion December package would no longer qualify.The decrease is due to tighter limits in the Senate bill on who can receive checks. The Biden administration has wanted to honor the promise made to voters, but it also does not want to be viewed as sending money to the affluent.Under the Senate bill, anyone earning up to $75,000 qualifies for the full $1,400 with the payment being cut off entirely at $80,000. Couples earning up to $150,000 also receive checks with the payments disappearing at an income of $160,000.Still, families that do not receive a direct check might still come out ahead in the massive $1.9 trillion package. The bill expands tax credits for children and childcare and those benefits will go to some of the households that received a check in December but no longer qualify for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-relief-checks-to-go-to-most-who-got-december-payment-101614874145156.html
04-03-2021||World||Waive Covid vaccine patents to benefit poor nations, activists say||Doctors Without Borders (MSF) staged a protest at the World Trade Organization on Thursday against what it said was the rich world's reluctance to waive patents and allow more production of COVID-19 vaccines for poorer nations.Activists seeking a waiver of intellectual property rules unfurled a huge sign reading "No Covid Monopolies - Wealthy Countries Stop Blocking TRIPS Waiver" in the park next to WTO's headquarters on Lake Geneva.They want the terms of the TRIPS agreement -- the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property -- to be overridden to allow generic or other manufactures to make the new products.WTO member states hold fresh talks next week on a proposal by India and South Africa to waive such rules for Covid-19 drugs and vaccines."If we had the waiver, we'd be able in a number of countries to scale up production right now, which would allow for the diagnostics, the medicines, and the vaccines to get where they're needed most," Stephen Cornish, general director of MSF Switzerland, told Reuters at the WTO."Right now we are seeing just a trickle of vaccines making it to the global South, and this is just not acceptable in today's world," he said.Some 100 countries now support the campaign, Cornish added.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), backed the move in a tweet on Thursday: "If a temporary waiver to patents cannot be issued now, during these unprecedented times, when will be the right time?"“Big Pharma” has rejected the proposal that would grant compulsory licensing by overriding patent rules. Britain, Switzerland and the United States, which have strong domestic pharmaceutical industries, have opposed a waiver."Rich countries, the EU, the US, Canada and Switzerland ... are blocking that derogation. And they are doing so in the name of profit and business and status quo instead of putting human lives above profit," Cornish said.Globally, 265 million doses of vaccines have been administered, with 80% in just 10 countries, WHO's top emergency expert Mike Ryan said on social media on Wednesday night.He welcomed the first roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines this week through the COVAX facility that aims to provide doses to lower income countries, starting in Ivory Coast.Nearly 10 million doses have been delivered in more than 10 countries, he said, adding: "That's a huge step forward in terms of at least beginning the journey towards better vaccine equity around the world."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/waive-covid-vaccine-patents-to-benefit-poor-nations-activists-say-101614869269076.html
04-03-2021||World||Iraq beefs up security for pope amid rising violence, pandemic||Iraq is deploying thousands of additional security personnel to protect Pope Francis during his four-day visit, which comes after a spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks raised fears for the Catholic leader's safety.A senior security official who has been briefed on the security plan said that forces involved had been trained to deal with worst-case scenarios, from street battles to bombings and rocket attacks.The hypothetical threats were part of large-scale exercises in preparation for the March 5-8 visit, the first ever by a pope to Iraq. As well as concerns over violence, the country has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases, further complicating preparations.Francis said he was making the trip to show solidarity with the country's devastated Christian community of around 300,000, just one fifth of the number before the US invasion in 2003 and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.Pope John Paul II came close to visiting, but had to cancel a planned trip in 2000 after talks with the government of then-leader Saddam Hussein broke down.Over the past two months, attacks on civilians and military targets have increased. In January, Baghdad suffered its first major suicide bombing for three years when two people detonated themselves in a crowded market, killing at least 32.On Wednesday morning, 10 rockets landed on an airbase that hosts US, coalition and Iraqi forces. Hours after that attack, the pope reaffirmed he would be going to Iraq.The 84-year-old will visit four cities, including the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul, where churches and other buildings still bear the scars of conflict.Francis will also visit Ur, birthplace of the prophet Abraham who is revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews, and meet Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, 90-year-old Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.ARMOURED CARSInterior ministry special forces and the army will set up a security cordon around the pope wherever he goes, while the air force will operate drones around the clock to monitor the routes he will take.There will be an explosives team and counter-terrorism personnel on standby in case of any suspicious devices or street battles.Undercover intelligence and national security officers will also be deployed at gatherings attended by the pope, said the source, who declined to be named while discussing security matters.A technical team can also jam or cut off suspicious phone calls or radio communications, he added.Vatican officials and local Church leaders say they are satisfied that Iraqi forces will be able to provide adequate protection for the pope and his entourage.About 10,000 security personnel will be deployed to protect Francis, who may travel in armoured cars in what would be a departure from the norm for him."Clearly, we are now talking about a trip where security needs are different than other trips, so it is much more probable, possible that an armoured car will be used," Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said on Tuesday.SPRUCING UP THE STREETSPreparations for the pope's trip have been in high gear for weeks.Fresh asphalt has been laid on some roads he is expected to use, and dozens of workers have been applying fresh paint to sidewalks and planting flowers around churches he will visit.Billboards and posters depicting Francis have been erected, and pristine Iraqi and Vatican flags flutter side by side on buildings.Christians are generally excited about the historic trip, seeing it as a sign of solidarity after years of persecution, threats and exodus.But many ordinary Iraqis are less enthusiastic."We appreciate that he's coming, but I don't understand why there is so much attention given to this trip," said Nour Ahmed, 21, a university student in Baghdad.Security forces and armoured vehicles filled otherwise empty streets surrounding two cordoned-off churches the pope is scheduled to go to in central Baghdad."Our preparations from the security forces' standpoint are enough ... it's under the supervision of the Vatican delegation," said the joint operation's spokesman Tahseen al-Khafaji.Nearly two weeks ago, the Iraqi government banned most travel between provinces and imposed a nationwide curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. on weekdays and for 24 hours a day on Friday to Sunday, following a sharp rise in COVID-19 infections.A police official said the coronavirus precautions had made beefing up protection for the pope easier."The potential risk comes from people's movements. Limiting people's movement will help us a lot in our work," said Khaled al-Mohanna, interior ministry spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-beefs-up-security-for-pope-amid-rising-violence-pandemic-101614871661438.html
04-03-2021||World||New UK post-study graduate route to open for Indian students in July||The UK said on Thursday that applications will open on July 1 for the so-called “graduate route” that will allow international students who complete an undergraduate degree or above in Britain to work for at least two years.Britain had witnessed a decline in the number of students from countries such as India after it scrapped an earlier provision that allowed international candidates to work in the country after completing their studies. The UK government announced the new visa route last year.The UK said international students on the graduate route will be able to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years in the case of PhD students.“This will help allow the brightest and the best students from India to continue to contribute to the UK post-study,” the British high commission said in a statement.The graduate route will be unsponsored, meaning applicants won’t need a job offer to apply for it. There will be no minimum salary requirements or caps on numbers – graduates will be able to work flexibly, switch jobs and develop their career as they choose.Indian students are one of the largest international groups studying in Britain and make a “huge contribution to UK public life”, the statement said. According to the latest statistics, the number of student visas issued to Indians increased by 42%, compared to the previous year, and now number more than 53,000. This represents 23% of all British student visas issued, up from 13% in the previous year.The UK higher education sector had pressured the government to resume the practice of allowing international students to work after their studies as more and more students from countries such as India began moving away from Britain to other European countries such as Germany and France.The UK has also extended concessions for students unable to travel to the UK after getting admission to British educational institutions because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was done due to the continuing disruption in international travel.Students who started their studies in autumn 2020 will now need to be in the UK by June 21 to be eligible to apply for the graduate route, while those starting their courses in January or February this year will now be required to be in the UK by September 27.UK’s immigration minister Kevin Foster said: “The launch of this new route will ensure those who graduate from our world leading institutions will easily be able to secure the status they deserve to continue living and working as they make our United Kingdom their home.”British high commissioner Alex Ellis added, “The flow of students between India and the UK makes the human connection between our countries – the ‘living bridge’ – ever stronger. I’m delighted that increasing numbers of talented Indian students are choosing the UK to study, and even more so that the graduate route will allow them to work in the UK after their studies.”The UK is committed to supporting thousands of Indian students to pursue their education in the UK and post-study employment opportunities, said Barbara Wickham, director in India for British Council. “Given the pandemic travel restrictions, these new timelines to reach the UK will help ensure international students are able to benefit from the graduate route and gain coveted international work experience,” she said.The new graduate route will help the UK government achieve its target in the International Education Strategy to increase the number of international students in higher education to 600,000 by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-post-study-graduate-route-to-open-for-indian-students-in-july-101614868351434.html
04-03-2021||World||Wider Image: The man who saves forgotten cats in Fukushima's nuclear zone||A decade ago, Sakae Kato stayed behind to rescue cats abandoned by neighbours who fled the radiation clouds belching from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant. He won't leave."I want to make sure I am here to take care of the last one," he said from his home in the contaminated quarantine zone. "After that I want to die, whether that be a day or hour later."So far he has buried 23 cats in his garden, the most recent graves disturbed by wild boars that roam the depopulated community. He is looking after 41 others in his home and another empty building on his property.Kato leaves food for feral cats in a storage shed he heats with a paraffin stove. He has also rescued a dog, Pochi. With no running water, he has to fill bottles from a nearby mountain spring, and drive to public toilets.The 57-year-old, a small construction business owner in his former life, says his decision to stay as 160,000 other people evacuated the area was spurred in part by the shock of finding dead pets in abandoned houses he helped demolish.The cats also gave him a reason to stay on land that has been owned by his family for three generations."I don't want to leave, I like living in these mountains," he said standing in front of his house, which he is allowed to visit but, technically, not allowed to sleep in.The two-storey wooden structure is in poor condition.Rotten floorboards sag. It is peppered with holes where wall panels and roof tiles that kept the rain out were dislodged by a powerful earth tremor last month, stirring frightening memories of the devastating quake on March 11, 2011, that led to a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown."It might last another two or three years. The walls have started to lean," Kato said.Decontamination in fields near his house signal that other residents will soon be allowed to return.He estimates he spends $7,000 a month on his animals, part of it to buy dog food for wild boar that gather near his house at sunset. Farmers consider them pests, and also blame them for wrecking empty homes.On Feb. 25, Kato was arrested on suspicion of freeing wild boar caught in traps set up by Japan's government in November. At time this article was published, he was still being detained for questioning.Yumiko Konishi, a vet from Tokyo who helps Kato, said local volunteers were caring for the cats on his property, but at least one had died since he was detained.FEAR LINGERSAbout 30 km (19 miles) southeast, still in the restricted zone, Hisae Unuma is also surveying the state of her home, which withstood the earthquake a decade ago but is now close to collapsing after years of being battered by wind, rain and snow."I'm surprised it's still standing," the 67-year-old farmer said, a week after the tremor that damaged Kato's house."I could see my cattle in the field from there," she said pointing to the living room, a view now blocked by a tangle of bamboo.Unuma fled as the cooling system at Tokyo Electric Power Co's nuclear plant 2.5 km away failed and its reactors began to melt down.The government, which has adopted Fukushima as a symbol of national revival amid preparations for Tokyo Olympic Games, is encouraging residents to return to decontaminated land.Lingering fears about the nuclear plant, jobs and poor infrastructure are keeping many away, though.Unuma, now a vegetable farmer in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, where her husband died three years ago, won't return even if the government scrapes the radioactive soil off her fields.Radiation levels around her house are around 20 times the background level in Tokyo, according to a dosimeter reading carried out by Reuters.Only the removal of Fukushima's radioactive cores will make her feel safe, a task that will take decades to complete."Never mind the threat from earthquakes, those reactors could blow if someone dropped a tool in the wrong place," she said.Before making the four-hour drive back to her new home, Unuma visits the Ranch of Hope, a cattle farm owned by Masami Yoshizawa, who defied an order to cull his irradiated livestock in protest against the government and Tokyo Electric Power.Among the 233 bullocks still there is the last surviving bullock from the 50-strong herd Unuma used to tend, and one of her last living links to the life she had before the disaster.Her bullock ignores her when she tries to lure him over, so Yoshizawa gives her a handful of cabbage to try to tempt him."The thing about cattle, is that they really only think about food," Yoshizawa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wider-image-the-man-who-saves-forgotten-cats-in-fukushima-s-nuclear-zone-101614868289956.html
04-03-2021||World||French President Macron could still squeeze in a pension reform: Le Maire||French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire is keeping pressure on President Emmanuel Macron to push on with contentious overhauls, despite the elections only a year from now.According to Le Maire, a pension reform to address the financial imbalances in the country’s system is still possible before voters head to the polls in April 2022.“When the time comes there will be a pension reform so that France catches up in terms of the amount of work people do throughout their lives,” Le Maire said at a conference organized by Politico in Paris. “It’s up to the president and him alone to decide. I think it’s perfectly possible in this five-year term to take measure to improve the financial situation of pensions.”Macron dropped a planned overhaul of pensions when the pandemic struck France last year, and after prolonged strikes and protests against his plans. Le Maire has repeatedly said changes to pensions will still be needed one day and France should not give up on structural reforms, even if he hasn’t set an exact time-line.The timing, however, is tricky. The French economy is not expected to pick up until the second half of this year, leaving a small window for more reforms before the presidential elections. Still, earlier this week, Macron went ahead with an overhaul of unemployment welfare, which also faces broad opposition from labor and business unions.Le Maire said it is necessary to address the deficits in France’s pension system in order to guarantee solidarity between generations and future living standards.“We need to be able to work longer, and we need to ensure people over 50 are encouraged to keep working and young people can get into the job market more easily,” Le Maire said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-sould-still-squeeze-in-a-pension-reform-le-maire-101614869522031.html
04-03-2021||World||Thai military denies involvement in network removed by Facebook||Thailand's military on Thursday said it was not behind a network of Facebook accounts that the social media giant took down on the grounds they were using deceptive behaviour to influence public debate.Marking the first time it had taken down Thai accounts alleged to be linked to the government, Facebook said on Wednesday it had removed a Thailand-based network that included 77 accounts, 72 pages and 18 groups on Facebook and 18 accounts on Instagram, citing "coordinated inauthentic behaviour".Facebook said in a report the operation was linked to the Thai military's Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) and targeted audiences in Thailand's southern provinces, where conflict has flared on and off for decades as insurgent groups continue a guerrilla war to demand independence.ISOC spokesman Thanathip Sawangsang on Thursday denied the military was involved."ISOC is not aware of the takedown of the Facebook accounts as reported in the news. Those were personal accounts not related to ISOC," Thanathip said in a statement."ISOC also doesn't engage in operations as reported in the news. We act as a centre for coordination to provide relief and refuge to the people."The network used both fake accounts to pose as individuals from the area and authentic ones to manage groups and pages, including overt military pages and those that did not disclose their affiliations with the military, Facebook said.The company said it took action based on the network's deceptive behaviour, which violated its policy against government interference.It said the action was not based on the content, which included support for the military and the monarchy as well as allegations of violence and criticism of insurgent groups in southern Thailand.In October, Twitter took down 926 accounts it said were linked to the Thai army that promoted pro-army and pro-government content.The army at the time also denied links to the accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-military-denies-involvement-in-network-removed-by-facebook-101614865501798.html

Most goods vehicles and buses in the city-state run on diesel and won’t be affected by the new rule, announced Thursday by the government.Singapore plans to install 60,000 EV charging stations by 2030, two-thirds of which will be in public car parks and the remainder on private premises, the LTA said in a statement. A new government body is being established to spearhead EV-related policy and consultations will be held later in March over private sector participation.“These measures will support Singapore’s targets to cease new diesel car and taxi registrations from 2025, require all new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030, and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040,” the LTA said.New public housing developments will have capacity to support EV charging for 15% of their parking lots, it said. The government has announced a series of other measures to reduce carbon emissions, including greater emphasis on solar energy, planting 1 million more trees, expanding rail and cycling networks, and reducing waste sent to landfill by 20% over the next five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-won-t-allow-new-diesel-cars-and-cabs-from-2025-101614846525191.html

Meanwhile, rotting food in landfills releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere."If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste," said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-report-says-17-of-food-wasted-at-consumer-level-101614870238210.html
04-03-2021||World||India calls on Canada to ensure safety of Indo-Canadians||India on Thursday has formally called on Canadian authorities to “take all possible measures to ensure the continued safety and security of Indian nationals” after several Indo-Canadians were reported to have received threats from extremist elements in the country. The Indian High Commission in Ottawa has raised this matter in an official communique that was sent to Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry. The communique acknowledges that while the incidents may be an internal matter for Canada, concern among people in India for their family and friends in Canada had pushed the high commission to request the relevant authorities “to immediately investigate these incidents”.“These graphic and disturbing images of assault have caused grave concern in India and people in India are concerned about the safety of their families and friends in Canada,” the communique said.“Such incidents, if left unchecked, can cause friction within the Indian community in Canada and create law and order issues while negatively impacting the warm and friendly relations between Canada and India,” it added.The high commission also asked the ministry to it “keep it apprised of the investigations and actions taken into the identification and prosecution of the extremist elements responsible for such assaults”.This communication comes in the wake of reports of threat and intimidation against Indo-Canadians by pro-Khalistani elements in Canada, a development which was first reported on February 8 by the Hindustan Times.The latest flashpoint came after a video of unprovoked assault of a participant in the Tiranga-Maple Car Rally, organised on Sunday by the Indian community to celebrate the imminent arrival of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines in Canada, went viral. In the video, the two men are seen arguing after which, the assailant violently pushes the victim to the ground. Neither the victim nor the assailants have been identified yet.“There must be zero tolerance for violence and threats at protests. I was disappointed this weekend to see a video circulating of violence at the Tiranga and Maple car rally,” Patrick Brown, the mayor of Brampton, where the incident occurred, told reporters on Wednesday.“The notion anyone would face violence or intimidation, or threats is abhorrent,” he said in a separate interaction with the media. Brown also connected with worried community members on social media to reassure them, including Brampton-based Dharma Jain. “Response looks positive, but action has to be prompt.” Jain told Hindustan Times after interacting with the mayor. Peel police is investigating the incident, a member of Brown’s office told Hindustan Times on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-calls-on-canada-to-ensure-safety-of-indocanadians-101614870344242.html

04-03-2021||World||EU wants employers to report pay levels to fix gender gap||The European Union executive wants to force employers to be much more open about how much their staff earn to make it easier for women to challenge wage imbalances and close the gender pay gap.Even though the gender pay gap across the 27-nation bloc has been reduced to 14% for people doing exactly the same work, the European Commission wants to eliminate the disparity by imposing specific rules to make pay levels public.“For equal pay, you need transparency. Women must know whether their employers treat them fairly," said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.Since its inception in 1957, the European Union has sought to end such gender bias, but progress has been slow over the decades. When it comes to pension rights, reflecting working conditions of the past 30 to 40 years, the gender gap still stands at 30%.Wage conditions and scales in Europe have long been shrouded in secrecy, which has helped extend inequality and proved to be a big hurdle for those demanding pay justice.And companies have fallen far short in helping bridge the gap, said EU Vice President Vera Jourova. “We have sufficiently strong evidence that we need to have binding rules and not only to rely on social responsibility of the companies because we see that it doesn’t lead anywhere," she said.She said that over the past 7 years, the gap had closed only by little over 2 percentage points. “You can imagine if we continue like that, we will achieve pay fairness some time in several decades. So we cannot continue like that."Under the commission's proposals, employers would have to give information about initial pay levels in the vacancy announcement and ahead of the job interview, during which employers will not be allowed to ask about applicants' previous pay grades.Employees will be allowed to ask employers the average pay levels by gender for people doing the same work.And to put more pressure on big companies, the proposal forces firms with more than 250 employees to publish information about any gender pay gap.If women remain underpaid, the commission wants them to be able to get back pay and it wants the burden of proof to be on employers, not the women challenging them.The European Trade Union Confederation lauded the intent but said the proposals lacked teeth to force companies into decisive action. It complained that small- and medium-size companies, where such discrimination often happens, were excluded from key elements of the enforcement.The proposal now goes to the European Parliament and EU countries for further discussion before it can be approved.The announcement came ahead of International Women's Day next Monday.The EU noted that women had been disproportionally affected by the pandemic, many having to add more home tasks to their work schedule because of the closure of schools and day care centers.“The COVID-19 pandemic has not only consolidated injustices and inequalities that already existed in our societies, it is also likely to wipe out decades of achievements by women, on progresses in the labor market," said European Parliament President David Sassoli.Jourova said women were vulnerable because most were still at the bottom of the pay scale.“That over-representation in lower-paid sectors and occupations such as, for instance, hospitality, retail or personal services has made them particularly vulnerable in the labor market struck by the COVID-19 crisis," Jourova said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-employers-to-report-pay-levels-to-fix-gender-gap-101614865523894.html
04-03-2021||World||US jobless claims tick up to 745,000 as layoffs remain high||The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits edged higher last week to 745,000, a sign that many employers continue to cut jobs despite a drop in confirmed viral infections and evidence that the overall economy is improving.Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims rose by 9,000 from the previous week. Though the pace of layoffs has eased since the year began, they remain high by historical standards. Before the virus flattened the U.S. economy a year ago, applications for unemployment aid had never topped 700,000 in any week, even during the Great Recession.All told, 4.3 million Americans are receiving traditional state unemployment benefits. Counting supplemental federal unemployment programs that were established to soften the economic damage from the virus, an estimated 18 million people are collecting some form of jobless aid.Restrictions on businesses and the reluctance of many Americans to shop, travel, dine out or attend mass events have weighed persistently on the job market. Job growth averaged a meager 29,000 a month from November through January, and the nation still has nearly 10 million fewer jobs than it did in February 2020. Though the unemployment rate was 6.3% in January, a broader measure that includes people who have given up on their job searches is closer to 10%.The data firm Womply reports that 64% of movie theaters and other entertainment venues, 40% of bars and 34% of hair salons and beauty shops are closed. And on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that across the country, “overall conditions in the leisure and hospitality sector continued to be restrained by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.”On Friday, though, economists have forecast that the government will report a strong job gain for February of near 200,000, which would raise hopes that layoffs will slow. Optimism is rising that increasing vaccinations and a new federal rescue aid package that will likely be enacted soon will spur growth and hiring in the coming months. Many analysts foresee the economy expanding at an annual rate of at least 5 percent in the current quarter and 7 percent for all of 2021.Already, crucial sectors of the economy are showing signs of picking up as vaccinations increase, federal aid spreads through the economy and the Fed’s low-rate policies fuel borrowing and spending. Last month, America’s consumers bounced back from months of retrenchment to step up their spending by 2.4% — the sharpest increase in seven months and a sign that the economy may be poised to sustain a recovery.The solid gain suggested that many people were growing more confident about spending, especially after receiving $600 checks that went to most adults early this year in a federal economic aid package. Additional relief is likely for American households and businesses as Congress considers President Joe Biden’s proposal for a new aid package amounting to $1.9 trillion.At the same time, rising bond yields in the financial markets are pointing to worries that higher inflation could be on the way as the economy recovers. This week, Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, sought to calm investors by stressing that the Fed, while generally optimistic in its outlook, is still a long way off from raising interest rates or otherwise lessening its support for the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-tick-up-to-745-000-as-layoffs-remain-high-101614865564929.html

04-03-2021||World||GOP state lawmakers seek to nullify federal gun limits||With Democrats controlling the presidency and Congress, Republican state lawmakers concerned about the possibility of new federal gun control laws aren't waiting to react.Legislation in at least a dozen states seeks to nullify any new restrictions, such as ammunition limits or a ban on certain types of weapons. Some bills would make it a crime for local police officers to enforce federal gun laws.That can create confusion for officers who often work with federal law enforcement, said Daniel Isom, a former chief of the St. Louis Police Department who is now a senior advisor for Everytown for Gun Safety. Federal law plays a big role in some areas, such as keeping guns away from domestic violence offenders.Putting local officers in a position to decide which laws to enforce is the last thing police need at a time when cities such as St. Louis are experiencing a rise in violent crime, Isom said.“This has been an extremely challenging year for both communities and law enforcement, and to ask any more mental strain on officers at this point in time seems to be quite displaced," he said. Gun sales also have set monthly records nationwide since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.Isom is concerned about a Missouri measure passed by the state House that would allow police departments with officers who enforce federal gun laws to be sued and face a $50,000 fine. It's not the first time Missouri has considered such a bill, but supporters pointed to President Joe Biden taking office as a reason to pass it now.In Utah, Republican Rep. Cory Maloy also referenced the incoming administration after the state House passed his bill with a similar provision forbidding the enforcement of federal gun laws. Many Republican state lawmakers see attempts to pass federal firearms restrictions as a threat to the Second Amendment.“We really feel the need to protect those rights,” he said.Several states passed similar laws under then-president Barack Obama, although judges have ruled against them in court. Most of the latest crop of federal nullification proposals focus on police officers inside their states who primarily enforce state rather than federal laws.While Biden has called for a ban on assault weapons, any new gun legislation will likely face an uphill climb given the political polarization that has tripped up past administrations. Democratic lawmakers from conservative-leaning states also could join Republicans in opposing new gun restrictions. Any measures likely to pass would have broad support, like background checks on all gun sales, said Everytown President John Feinblatt.Those dynamics haven't stopped state lawmakers who want to make the first move to protect gun rights in their states. Federal nullification bills have been introduced in more than a dozen other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wyoming, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia and Iowa. In Texas, the governor has called for the state to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.In Arizona, a Senate proposal that passed the chamber on Wednesday would allow officers to be sued for enforcing federal gun restrictions that the state considers violations of the Second Amendment. They potentially could face criminal charges. A bill in the House doesn't include those punishments, but its sponsor, Republican Rep. Leo Biasiucci, said it would be a clear rejection of federal restrictions on assault-style weapons, high-capacity magazines or other firearms."They can do that at a federal level, but in Arizona it’s not going to fly,” he said.His proposal passed the state House last week over the objections of Democrats such as Rep. Daniel Hernandez of Tucson, who was present at the 2011 shooting that severely injured former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. If signed into law, the measure would be unconstitutional and lead to an expensive court fight, he said.Biasiucci compares his plan to Arizona voters' move to legalize recreational marijuana even though it remains against federal law. Gun-control groups see it differently.“Guns kill people and are used to create a public safety issue, whereas marijuana is really not,” said Allison Anderman, senior counsel with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “What is likely to happen if gun laws are not followed is people get killed as a result.”Similar measures passed by the Republican Legislature in Montana were vetoed in previous years by the former Democratic governor. Now working with a Republican governor, the state House passed a bill last week to bar state officials from enforcing federal bans on certain firearms, ammunition or magazines.Under Obama's presidency, the Legislature passed a law in 2009 that made guns and ammunition manufactured in Montana exempt from federal law. It eventually was struck down in court, but several states still followed with their own nullification measures. In 2013, two Kansas men tried to use that state's nullification law to overturn their federal convictions for possessing unregistered firearms, but the challenge was rejected.“The main issue there is the Supremacy Clause," the part of the Constitution that says federal law supersedes state law, said Jacob Charles, executive director of the Center for Firearms Law at Duke Law School. Even so, the bills focused on what local police can and can't do could pass legal muster.“States have no obligation to enforce federal law," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-state-lawmakers-seek-to-nullify-federal-gun-limits-101614867596565.html

Most others described it as light.The closest major city to the epicentre is Gisborne with a population of about 35,500 residents. People near the coast from Cape Runaway to Tolaga Bay were told to evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-of-7-3-magnitude-strikes-new-zealand-tsunami-warnings-possible-101614866721029.html
04-03-2021||World||China's parliament to discuss Hong Kong electoral reform||China's top legislature will discuss electoral reform in Hong Kong when it meets this week, state media said Thursday, as speculation grows that Beijing will use the event to further tighten control over the financial hub.Official news agency Xinhua said the National People's Congress (NPC) would deliberate a draft decision on "improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region".Chinese state media has run editorials in recent weeks saying "electoral loopholes" will be plugged, and officials have said only "staunch patriots" -- those loyal to the ruling Communist Party -- should be involved in governing Hong Kong.The city dominated headlines during last year's NPC session when delegates endorsed a tough security law designed to stamp out dissent in the semi-autonomous trading hub after months of violent unrest in 2019.The exact shape of any changes is unclear, but they could include removing some seats from local-level district councils.Hong Kong's lack of full democracy has been a regular source of political instability and public anger in the territory.The city's leader -- the chief executive -- is chosen by a 1,200-member committee that is deliberately stacked with Beijing loyalists.Hong Kong's 70-seat legislature is deliberately designed to return a government majority and only half of the seats are chosen by popular vote.But opposition candidates scored a landslide win in district council elections in late 2019, in a clear popular rebuke to Beijing.The NPC's roughly 3,000 members will fill Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People for a week of meetings choreographed to tout the achievements and power of the party.It is also an important occasion for the party to lay out priorities, economic expectations, and foreign policy for the coming year.The session will open less than a week after dozens of activists were arrested for subversion in Hong Kong after organising a primary election that was intended to offer a united opposition to establishment parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-parliament-to-discuss-hong-kong-electoral-reform-101614866593833.html
04-03-2021||World||Huawei CFO lawyer says Donald Trump comments a 'salvo' in trade war||Comments made by former US President Donald Trump turned a senior executive for Chinese communications giant Huawei Technologies, into a “bargaining chip” and “co-opted the extradition process,” her lawyers argued in a Canadian court Wednesday as they fought efforts to send her to the US in which Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder and the company's chief financial officer, at Vancouver's airport in late 2018.The US wants her extradited to face fraud charges. Her arrest infuriated Beijing, which sees her case as a political move designed to prevent China's rise.The US accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of US sanctions.It says Meng, 49, committed fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran.Defense lawyer Richard Peck pointed to a 2018 interview in which Trump was asked if he would be willing to intervene in Meng's case if it would help secure a trade deal with China or aid US security interests.“If I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made – which is a very important thing – what's good for national security – I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,” Trump said at the time.Peck said Trump's comments make it clear he hoped to use Meng as leverage in trade negotiations with China.“These words cast a pall over these proceedings,” said Peck. “They reduce Ms. Meng from a human being to chattel. His words amount to an abuse of process.”Peck said the “abhorrent nature of the president's words” put a stain on the extradition proceedings and the Canadian justice system.“The requesting state's conduct ... has subverted this process, has destroyed the integrity of the process,” said Peck. “The requesting state has not acted in good faith. This is an affront to what is fair, right, and just."Peck told Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that the United States views Huawei as a threat and that attacks on China have come from both Republicans and Democrats.Peck also pointed to comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Justice Trudeau in December 2019, where he said the US should not sign a trade deal with China unless the case of Meng and two Canadians being held in China was settled.“The fact that he said it is problematic,” Peck said.Meng attended the hearing dressed in a short black dress and wearing an electronic tracking bracelet on her ankle.She listened to the proceedings through an interpreter, taking occasional drinks from a pink water bottle.Over the next several weeks Meng's defense team will present several justifications for halting the extradition proceedings.Later this month, they will claim an abuse of process, saying Canada Border Services Agency officers detained and questioned Meng without a lawyer, seized her electronic devices and compelled her to give up their passcodes before her official arrest.Her lawyers also contend the US is exceeding the limits of its jurisdiction by prosecuting a foreign citizen for actions that took place in Hong Kong and said Canada was misled by the US about the strength of its case.Meng's arrest has soured relations between Canada and China. In apparent retaliation, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor. China has also placed restrictions on various Canadian exports to China, including canola oil seed.China also handed death sentences to four Canadians convicted of drug smuggling.Meng remains free on bail in Vancouver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-cfo-lawyer-says-donald-trump-comments-a-salvo-in-trade-war-101614861982071.html
04-03-2021||World||European Union sets itself jobs, training and equality targets for 2030||The European Commission on Thursday announced goals for the 27-nation bloc to reduce poverty, inequality and boost training and jobs by 2030 as part of a post-pandemic economic overhaul financed by jointly borrowed funds.The EU executive arm said the European Union should boost employment to 78% in 2030 from 73% in 2019, halve the gap between the number of employed women and men and cut the number of young people neither working nor studying to 9% from 12.6%"With unemployment and inequalities expected to increase as a fallout of the pandemic, focusing our policy efforts on quality job creation, up- and reskilling and reducing poverty and exclusion is therefore essential to channel our resources where they are most needed," the commission said.The goals, which will have to be endorsed by EU leaders, also include an increase in the number of adults getting training every year to adapt to the EU's transition to a greener and more digitalised economy to 60% from 40% now.Finally, over the next 10 years, the EU should reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 15 million from 91 million in 2019."These three 2030 headline targets are deemed ambitious and realistic at the same time," the commission said.The goals are part of the EU's set of 20 social rights, agreed on in 2017, to make the EU more appealing to voters and counter eurosceptic sentiment across the bloc.They say everybody has the right to quality education throughout their lives and that men and women must have equal opportunities in all areas and be paid the same for work of equal value.The unemployed have the right to "personalised, continuous and consistent support", while workers have the right "to fair wages that provide for a decent standard of living".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-sets-itself-jobs-training-and-equality-targets-for-2030-101614853532332.html

They can now be vaccinated more quickly," the ministry said. "We will shortly issue a regulation implementing both recommendations."Germany declined initially to authorise AstraZeneca's vaccine for those aged above 65, saying there was a lack of evidence from clinical trials confirming its effectiveness on that age cohort.But growing data showing the AstraZeneca shot's efficacy among the elderly in Britain has led to a change of heart in Berlin, while France has also eased a ban on administering the shot to people over the age of 65.The German decision was in line with recommendations by the European Union's health regulator that the second shot of AstraZeneca's vaccine be administered between four and 12 weeks after the first.There was no mention in the health ministry statement of the other main vaccine being administered in Germany, from a partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech .Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for the gap between administering the two shots to be extended to six weeks to stretch supply.Current guidance from the European Union's health regulator is for the Pfizer shot to be administered at three-week intervals in line with the company's own guidance.Politicians have faced growing criticism for the slow pace of vaccination in Germany, which is lagging well behind pack leaders Britain, Israel and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-approves-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-people-over-65-years-of-age-101614862945268.html
04-03-2021||World||Hong Kong removed from annual index of the world's freest economies||Hong Kong has been removed from an annual index of the world's freest economies because the think-tank that compiles the league table said the city was now directly controlled by Beijing.The announcement is a reputational blow for Hong Kong and comes as Beijing ramps up its bid to quash dissent after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations in 2019.The Heritage Foundation, a conservative US think-tank, publishes an annual Index of Economic Freedom ranking countries and territories for how business-friendly their regulations and laws are.Over the last 26 years Hong Kong topped the table for all but one year -- a source of pride to the city's government which often used the accolade in its official press releases and investment brochures.But when the 2021 ranking is released later on Thursday, Hong Kong will not appear because the report's authors believe the city is no longer independent enough of Beijing to justify separate inclusion."The loss of political freedom and autonomy suffered by Hong Kong over the past two years has made that city almost indistinguishable in many respects from other major Chinese commercial centres like Shanghai and Beijing," Edwin J. Feulner, the founder of the Heritage Foundation, wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday."[Hong Kong's] ties to Beijing are increasingly forged in steel," Feulner added, while its pre-handover "traditions of English common law, freedom of speech, and democracy have weakened significantly".Also read: Hong Kong makes 100th pro-democracy arrest under national security lawThe Heritage Foundation is one of the major policy think-tanks that influences fiscal conservatives in the United States.Feulner is also a vocal critic of Beijing and chairman of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government embraced the think-tank's league table each year it came out.In 2019 -- when Hong Kong topped the table for the 25th consecutive year -- the government said it showed the city's "economic resilience, high-quality legal framework, low tolerance for corruption, high degree of government transparency, efficient regulatory framework and openness to global commerce".Last year the city fell from the top spot for the first time, replaced by rival Singapore, after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong.The city's commerce chief at the time brushed off concern and predicted Hong Kong would soon return to the top of the table.Instead it -- and neighbouring Macau -- will be counted as part of China which currently languishes in 107th place in the ranking, between Uganda and Uzbekistan, in a section where economies are rated as "mostly unfree."Beijing says the security law was needed to restore stability to Hong Kong.But it has also dramatically altered Hong Kong's legislative and judicial relationship with the authoritarian mainland.Chinese leaders have announced they want to ensure only "staunch patriots" run the city, including within the city's independent judiciary.That has created some jitters within the international business community, especially as Beijing falls out with a growing list of western power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-removed-from-annual-index-of-the-world-s-freest-economies-101614834533414.html
04-03-2021||World||US suspends tariffs on UK Goods in Airbus-Boeing dispute||The US will suspend retaliatory tariffs on UK products caught up in the longstanding dispute over illegal aid to Boeing Co. and Airbus SE in a boost for post-Brexit Britain’s trade agenda.The tariff suspension will last four months to “focus on negotiating a balanced settlement to the disputes”, the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. The decision means goods like Scotch whisky, biscuits and clotted cream can be imported to the US from Britain without being subject to an additional 25% duty.Removing tariffs on UK-US commerce has been a priority for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government as they seek a broader trade deal with President Joe Biden’s administration. Britain unilaterally dropped tariffs on some US products indefinitely in January in a bid to reduce trade tensions. The former Trump administration did not reciprocate the UK’s concession.The US’s temporary rollback could help resolve part of the World Trade Organization dispute over the aid to Boeing and Airbus, which has resulted in WTO-authorized tariffs targeting nearly $12 billion worth of transatlantic trade.The dispute, which has dragged on for 17 years, involves the US and the four European countries that manufacture Airbus aircraft and parts -- Germany, France, Spain and the UK.It was not immediately clear if the Biden administration would also agree to temporarily suspend its tariffs on EU goods that the Trump administration targeted for retaliation in the dispute.‘Bold’ MoveIn November, the EU announced tariffs targeting $4 billion worth of Boeing planes and US products including spirits, nuts and tractors as part of a tit-for-tat escalation against the US For its part, the US imposed levies on $7.5 billion of EU products starting in 2019.Though the European Commission had repeatedly asked the US for a six-month suspension of tariffs in order to negotiate a settlement, former US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer declined to do so and further increased tariffs against EU goods in one of his final acts in office.The UK said the latest move was a “bold, joint step” toward resolving one of the longest running issues at the WTO. The statement also said that the UK and US would focus on “addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-suspends-tariffs-on-uk-goods-in-airbus-boeing-dispute-101614860454109.html
04-03-2021||World||California SUV crash victims suspected of being smuggled across US-Mexico border||The 13 people killed in a Southern California highway crash were part of a group of nearly four dozen migrants suspected of slipping through a hole cut by human smugglers through a steel fence along the US-Mexico border, federal officials said on Wednesday.Besides the dead and injured among 25 people crammed into the sport utility vehicle that collided on Tuesday with a tractor-trailer, 19 others were found huddled near a second SUV that caught fire in the same area just north of the border, the officials said.The 19 were detained by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, CBP spokesman Macario Mora said. The dozen survivors from the collision were all taken to hospitals for treatment.Both the Ford Expedition involved in the crash and the Chevrolet Suburban that inexplicably burst into flames appeared to be the same vehicles seen in surveillance footage leaving the vicinity of the fence breach about 30 miles (48 km) to the east, Mora said.While Border Patrol agents regularly scout the area for illegal crossings, neither vehicle had been under pursuit by US authorities beforehand, according to the agency.Read | California crash kills 13 on route for illegal border crossingsNew details of Tuesday's fatal highway wreck near the remote farming community of Holtville, about 10 miles (16 km) north of the border, came to light as the CBP mounted an investigation into the suspected human smuggling operation believed to have led to the tragedy."Human smugglers have proven time and again they have little regard for human life," the agency said in a statement.Of the 13 people who died in the collision, at least 10 were Mexican nationals, and Mexicans were also among the injured, according to Mexico's foreign ministry.Guatemalan authorities said they had preliminary information that one Guatemalan national died and another was injured in the crash.Mora said investigators believe that both carloads of migrants crossed into California through a 10-foot-wide gap cut out of the border fence by smugglers in an area known for relatively frequent illegal border crossings.That section of the fence, consisting of steel bars 18 feet tall, was installed in 2009, some eight years before the Trump administration took office calling for a border wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-suv-crash-victims-suspected-of-being-smuggled-across-us-mexico-border-101614862211767.html

Duterte “really wants to” ease mobility restrictions as he’s “very happy” with the start of vaccine rollout, Nograles said.The Philippines, which has the region’s second-worst coronavirus outbreak, on Thursday night got more than 487,000 AstraZeneca Plc. vaccines from the Covax facility, which supplies shots to poor nations. It started inoculations this week using 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech Ltd. shots donated by China.The Southeast Asian nation is working to buy 1 million more doses from Sinovac for possible delivery later this month, government officials have said. Duterte earlier said he wants vaccine stockpile to reach 2 million before he eases virus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-may-shift-to-lowest-quarantine-level-as-coronavirus-vaccines-arrive-101614862050991.html

04-03-2021||World||US traffic deaths spike even as Covid-19 pandemic cuts miles travelled||Pandemic lockdowns and stay-at-home orders kept many drivers off US roads and highways last year. But those who did venture out found open lanes that only invited reckless driving, leading to a sharp increase in traffic-crash deaths across the country.The nonprofit National Safety Council estimates in a report issued Thursday that 42,060 people died in vehicle crashes in 2020, an 8% increase over 2019 and the first jump in four years.Plus, the fatality rate per 100 million miles driven spiked 24%, the largest annual percentage increase since the council began collecting data in 1923.And even though traffic is now getting close to pre-coronavirus levels, the bad behavior on the roads is continuing, authorities say.“It’s kind of terrifying what were seeing on our roads,” said Michael Hanson, director of the Minnesota Public Safety Department’s Office of Traffic Safety. “We’re seeing a huge increase in the amount of risk-taking behavior.”Last year's deaths were the most since 2007 when 43,945 people were killed in vehicle crashes. In addition, the safety council estimates that 4.8 million people were injured in crashes last year.Federal data shows that Americans drove 13% fewer miles last year, or roughly 2.8 trillion miles, said Ken Kolosh, the safety council's manager of statistics. Yet the number of deaths rose at an alarming rate, he said.“The pandemic appears to be taking our eyes off the ball when it comes to traffic safety," Kolosh said.Of the reckless behaviors, early data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show speed to be the top factor, Kolosh said. Also, tests of trauma center patients involved in traffic crashes show increased use of alcohol, marijuana and opiods, he said.In Minnesota, traffic volumes fell 60% when stay-home orders were issued early in the pandemic last spring. Hanson said state officials expected a corresponding drop in crashes and deaths, but while crashes declined, deaths increased.“Almost immediately the fatality rate started to go up, and go up significantly,” Hanson said, adding that his counterparts in other states saw similar increases. “It created less congestion and a lot more lane space for divers to use, and quite honestly, to abuse out there.”In late March and early April, the number of speed-related fatalities more than doubled over the same period in 2019 in the state, Hanson said. Last year, Minnesota recorded 395 traffic deaths, up nearly 9% from 364 in 2019.Drivers also used the empty roads to drive extreme speeds. In 2019, the Minnesota State Patrol’s 600 troopers handed out tickets to just over 500 drivers for going over 100 mph (160 kph). That number rose to 1,068 in 2020, Hanson said.Traveling over 100 mph makes crashes far more severe, the safety council said.The high number of speeding drivers is continuing even as traffic is starting to return to pre-pandemic levels, according to Hanson.The safety council is calling for equitable enforcement of traffic laws, infrastructure improvements, mandatory ignition switch locks for convicted drunken drivers, reducing speed limits to match roadway designs, and laws banning cellphone use while driving, among other recommendations to stem the deaths.The council collects fatal crash data from states on public and private roads. The numbers released on Thursday are preliminary, but every year are only slightly different from the final numbers, Kolosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-traffic-deaths-spike-even-as-covid-19-pandemic-cuts-miles-travelled-101614855997044.html
04-03-2021||World||EU's coast guard agency Frontex involved in dozen migrant pushback incidents||An inquiry into claims that the European Union’s border and coast guard agency was involved in illegally pushing back migrants has found no link to Frontex in any of the incidents but has been unable to establish what happened in five cases, according to the official report into the allegations.The report is by a special working group set up to investigate media allegations that staff, ships or aircraft working with Frontex took part in or were near more than a dozen pushback incidents at the border between Greece and Turkey last year, mostly in the Aegean Sea. Its findings will be the focus of an extraordinary meeting of the agency’s management board on Friday.Frontex, which is responsible for patrolling the external borders of the 27-nation EU, has rejected the pushback allegations and said that its own internal inquiry could find no evidence to substantiate the claims. Greece, which is in charge of operations involving coordinating Frontex on its territory, has also denied reports of pushbacks by its border officers.Pushbacks are forcibly preventing people from entering a country when they might want to apply for asylum. They are contrary to refugee protection agreements, which say people shouldn’t be returned to a country where their life and safety might be in danger due to their race, religion, nationality or political views. They also contravene EU law and policy.Also read: EU months away from issuing vaccine passports for travel, memo showsThe working group cleared Frontex of any wrongdoing in 8 cases, but said in five cases “it has not been possible to completely resolve the incidents beyond any reasonable doubt,” according to part of the restricted report, dated March 1 and seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.Investigators could not determine whether the people involved in the five incidents were picked up by Turkish authorities or made it safely onto Greek soil. “There is no indication of anybody injured, reported missing or having died in connection with the respective incidents,” the report said.The probe, by experts from seven European countries and the European Commission, was set up weeks after reports of collective migrant expulsions were revealed in an October joint investigation by media outlets Bellingcat, Lighthouse Reports, Der Spiegel, ARD and TV Asahi.The reports raised troubling questions about the actions of Frontex, whose mandate and budget has been massively boosted since the entry of well over a million people in 2015, most fleeing conflict in Syria, sparked one of the EU’s biggest ever political disputes over how to manage the influx.Last month, human rights lawyers called on the agency to immediately stop its activities in the Aegean Sea. They formally accused Frontex of violating the right to asylum, as well as other breaches of EU and international law. They gave Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri two months to respond or face action at the European Court of Justice.Some of the alleged incidents last year happened in chaotic times in the Aegean around March and April 2020, when Turkey, angered by the EU’s reluctance to support its invasion of northern Syria, allowed thousands of migrants to set out for the Greek border and islands unchecked.In one of the alleged “maritime pushback” cases on April 28-29, 2020, a group of refugees and migrants was said to have been returned to an unseaworthy life raft without a motor or paddles and towed toward Turkey from near the island of Samos, as a surveillance plane watched from the sky.But the working group could find no evidence that Frontex was involved or had been notified about it. None of the routings of the agency’s aircraft match the report, nor were any of its ships or vehicles in the area referred to in media reports.More broadly, the investigators insist that "serious incident reports” must be quickly drafted after any suspicious incident and fundamental rights officers immediately informed. Frontex was due to have hired 40 fundamental rights officers by this year. As of last month, none had taken up their posts.The investigators recommend that the actions of Frontex planes or ships be recorded on video, and that they remain after any incidents to observe the actions of national police and border agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-coast-guard-agency-frontex-involved-in-dozen-migrant-pushback-incidents-101614857619606.html
04-03-2021||World||Explained: Significance of March 4 behind ‘possible plot’ to breach US Capitol||Security has been beefed up around the US Capitol after police, citing intelligence, warned about a possible plot by a militia group to attack it on Thursday. The Capitol Police put out a statement on Wednesday, saying they are aware of potential threats towards members of Congress and the Capitol building and have already made significant security upgrades to ensure the protection of “Congress, the public and our police officers.”“We have obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group on Thursday, March 4,” the Capitol Police said.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had earlier released a bulletin to warn about an unidentified group of "militia violent extremists" who had discussed plans to “take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about March 4.” In the wake of a possible plot by extremists to breach the US Capitol, the House of Representatives moved a planned vote from Thursday to Wednesday night to avoid being in session on March 4.Read | US Police uncover ‘possible plot’ by militia to breach Capitol on March 4Significance of March 4Many members of the “sovereign citizens”, a group of people who believe that they are not subject to any government rules or proceedings, believe that the United States turned into a corporation after a law was enacted in 1871. According to them, Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th US president, was the last legal American commander-in-chief, and some followers of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory propagators, share those unfounded beliefs.Prior to 1937, US presidents were inaugurated in early March, so the date gained significance among “sovereign citizens" and subsequently among QAnon followers. Michele Anne Tittler, one of the most prominent voices of QAnon, had recently laid out the plan in a TikTok video, claiming Trump will be sworn in as the 19th president of the United States on March 4 “under the restored republic.”“This nation hasn’t existed since 1871 when this country ceased to be a nation and became a corporation belonging to the City of London. Every time you see an American flag with a gold fringe attached to it, it represents the corporation, not the country,” she said.The FBI has described the sovereign citizen movement as "domestic terrorism" in the US. They have often flagged such groups for holding illegal courts that issue warrants for judges and police officers and clogging up the court system with “frivolous lawsuits and liens against public officials to harass them.”(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-significance-of-march-4-behind-possible-plot-to-breach-us-capitol-101614859790764.html

March 4 is the date when US presidents were inaugurated until 1933.An unidentified group of "militia violent extremists" discussed plans in February to "take control of the US Capitol and remove Democratic lawmakers on or about March 4," according to a bulletin issued on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The police force that guards the US Capitol, seat of the legislature, said in a statement that it had "taken immediate steps to enhance our security posture and staffing for a number of days, to include March 4."Capitol Police also said that they were "aware of and prepared for any potential threats towards members of Congress or towards the Capitol complex," including the possible militia attack.The US House of Representatives will not be in session on Thursday, in part because of the threat of militia members attempting to invade the Capitol, according to a Democratic aide.Washington's police chief, Robert Contee, said on Wednesday his department was deploying more police around the city to ensure public safety.Federal prosecutors have charged more than 300 people for involvement in the storming of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 that led to five deaths, including a policeman.

No one will be able to leave town if not for business and health reasons. Milan citizens won’t be allowed to reach their holiday houses. Bars and restaurants will remain closed while shops can stay open.The Lombardy region around Milan will be put under the so-called “reinforced orange” alert from midnight, according to a statement. Italy has a three-tier system in place that classifies regions by low, medium and high-risk based on the numbers of cases.The decision follows a surge in cases in the original epicenter of the pandemic in Europe. Daily coronavirus infections in the country reached a two-month high Wednesday. Italy is nearing 3 million cases since the beginning of the outbreak last year as deaths may pass the grim milestone of 100,000 in the next few days.Prime Minister Mario Draghi this week appointed a new czar to coordinate the government’s action on the coronavirus pandemic as his government seeks to speed up the vaccination campaign in the country. Draghi is working on an overhaul of the country’s slow and uneven vaccination campaign, focusing on logistics and recruiting the military to help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/milan-shuts-down-schools-tightens-curbs-due-to-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101614860023134.html

The concept is that different short clips, which are taken from shows like 'Big Mouth' or stand-up specials from comedians like Jerry Seinfeld and Ali Wong, will play directly within the Netflix app.If any of the shows, films, or comedy specials sparks interest, people can add the said title to their saved list to watch later. Patrick Flemming, director of product innovation at Netflix, said, "We're always looking for new ways to entertain and make discovery easier for members."He added that Fast Laughs is a "new full-screen feed of funny clips from a wide variety of Netflix titles, ranging from films and series to our deep bench of stand-up specials."Considering the growth and prominence of TikTok in the market right now, Fast Laughs makes sense for Netflix. Netflix's last few earnings reports have specifically referenced TikTok as a major competitor. Though Netflix and TikTok make different types of content, people are spending more time on TikTok, which results in less time on Netflix.As per The Verge, to access Fast Laughs, subscribers can use the bottom navigation menu to click on the Fast Laughs tab. Netflix will start testing Fast Laughs on Android devices soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netflix-creates-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-clone-to-scroll-through-funny-clips-101614859630128.html

04-03-2021||World||#MeWho? Global firms lag on sex harassment, women-friendly policy: Report||Most big firms are failing to ban sex harassment at work or enact policies that let mothers work flexibly, a global workplace equality index found on Thursday, highlighting the obstacles women face at work.Fewer than half of firms' policies directly address sex harassment, despite years of #MeToo campaigns that show the extent of abuse at work, said the report by women's workplace equality organisation Equileap.The finding suggests legislation to force action is a "necessary evil", said its chief executive Diana van Maasdijk.The index data was drawn from 3,702 firms in 23 countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Australia."It's only when companies are forced to do something that it's going to happen," said van Maasdijk, citing progress in Spain after a law compelled firms to publish plans that addressed sexual harassment."Some studies have shown one in three women will experience sexual harassment in their lifetime, so it's really important that this is addressed and it is called exactly what it is."The #MeToo movement began in 2017 in the United States after accusations of sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood, and quickly spread to a worldwide campaign that sparked wider debate around harassment, pay and representation.Women went online to call out their male bosses - from tech to academia - and share stories of unwanted sexual approaches, harassment, coercion, discrimination in the office or poor pay.But three years on and 51% of companies assessed for the index did not publish an anti-sexual harassment policy last year, said Equileap, albeit an improvement on the 58% in 2019.Pandemic impactsThe report also highlighted the problems mothers routinely face juggling paid work and a rota of home duties, a struggle exacerbated by the pandemic.Setting aside temporary policies enacted for the crisis, it found a lack of permanent, flexible working policies at many firms, with less than four in 10 publishing a policy on flexible hours and just 24% offering one on location.Women made "modest" progress on cracking glass ceilings in the latest annual report, it said, with women making up 25% of company boards, 17% of executives, 24% of senior management, and 37% of the overall workforce last year.The pandemic may bring some wins for women at work: more firms are likely to make flexible working permanent and ethical investors increasingly focus on gender, said van Maasdijk.But there is a risk that Covid-19's outsized impact on women's jobs may slow or push back progress, she said."We will have to see if we will have the same number of women in the workforce after the pandemic," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a video call."I'm hoping that we will, but I'm a little worried."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mewho-global-firms-lag-on-sex-harassment-women-friendly-policy-report-101614855991042.html

Justice for Myanmar. Respect our votes."Weeks later, when the 19-year-old was gunned down Wednesday at a protest on the streets of Myanmar's second largest city Mandalay, her t-shirt read: "Everything will be ok".The slogan has become a poignant refrain echoing across social media, and thousands turned out for her funeral in Mandalay on Thursday.For Kyal Sin, nicknamed "Angel", restoring her country's fragile democracy trumped concerns about her own safety as she protested for an end to military rule.Also read: 'I will shoot whoever I see': Myanmar soldiers use TikTok to threaten protestersThe young dance enthusiast joined hundreds of thousands across the country calling for the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the military took over on February 1.Before going to a demonstration this week, she listed her blood type on her Facebook page, her phone number, and said her organs were available for donation if anything were to happen to her."If you need, you can contact me freely at this phone number any time," she wrote."I could donate (my organs) if I died. If someone needs urgent help, I can donate even if it causes my death."She was one of at least 38 people the United Nations said were killed on Wednesday, Myanmar's deadliest day since the coup.Footage posted on social media shows Kyal Sin's final moments during a demonstration that turned violent -- crawling along the road and running for cover amid the sounds of gunfire and a plume of tear gas.A doctor confirmed to AFP she had been shot in the head.- 'One vote from the heart' -In the hours following news of Kyal Sin's death, tributes flooded online, with artwork created of her striking a crouching pose on the day of her death.On her Facebook page, she showed a different side -- posting videos of her dance moves, selfies of her outfits, and showcasing her close relationship with her father.In a tender moment last month, he tied a red ribbon symbolising bravery around her wrist, according to photos she posted."I don't want to post too much about this -- just thank you, daddy," Kyal Sin wrote, along with the hashtag "Justice for Myanmar".Late last year, father and daughter took photographs of their purple ink-stained fingers after casting their votes at Myanmar's second democratic election, which Suu Kyi's party went on to win in a landslide."For the first time in my life, I have undertaken my responsibility as a citizen... one vote from the heart," Kyal Sin wrote on Facebook, posting a picture of her kissing her inked finger.On Thursday morning, mourners sang popular revolutionary song "We Won't Forget Until the End of the World" as they filed past her coffin carrying bouquets and floral wreaths.Leading the funeral procession to the cemetery was a truck covered in flowers with a "hero" poster on the front followed by an elaborate black and gold hearse.The outpouring of grief extended online with many calling her a martyr."My heart feels so much hurt," one of her friends posted on Facebook."Rest in peace my friend," another male friend wrote.

If you want to become a martyr, I will fulfil your wish."Reuters was unable to contact him or the other uniformed men who appear in the TikTok videos or to verify that they are in the armed forces.TikTok is the latest social media platform to suffer a proliferation of menacing content or hate speech in Myanmar.US tech giant Facebook has now banned all pages linked to Myanmar's army - and has itself been banned.TikTok said in a statement: "We have clear Community Guidelines that state we do not allow content that incites violence or misinformation that causes harm... As it relates to Myanmar, we have been and continue to promptly remove all content that incites violence or spreads misinformation, and are aggressively monitoring to remove any such content that violates our guidelines."TikTok's policies forbid displays of guns unless they are in "safe environments".Reuters reviewed over a dozen videos where uniformed men, sometimes brandishing guns, threatened to harm protesters who are calling for the reversal of the coup and the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Some videos had tens of thousands of views. Those reviewed by Reuters were taken down this week. Some used hashtags relating to U.S celebrities.Already growing fast in Myanmar, TikTok saw a strong rise in downloads after the military banned Facebook last month. It is in the top 20 most downloaded apps in Myanmar, according to industry data.Facebook, which remains popular in Myanmar despite the ban, has toughened its scrutiny of content since being accused of helping to fan atrocities against the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017.Researchers like Htaike say they believe the military is now attempting to grow its presence on other platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-will-shoot-whoever-i-see-myanmar-soldiers-use-tiktok-to-threaten-protesters-101614854431271.html

Here’s why||While top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has been urging eligible residents to take any authorised coronavirus vaccine available to them, some bishops have weighed in to discourage Catholics from getting Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccine. Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson to prevent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in individuals aged 18 or older.Citing the available trial data on the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA said that the “known and potential benefits outweigh its risks known and potential risks”. The federal agency further assured that the EUA was given to Janssen’s vaccine after conducting a thorough evaluation of the available information on its safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.“After a thorough analysis of the data, the FDA’s scientists and physicians have determined that the vaccine meets the FDA’s expectations for safety and effectiveness appropriate for the authorization of a vaccine for emergency use,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.However, the assurance from the FDA on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy isn’t enough for some bishops who are dissuading people from getting Johnson & Johnson vaccine when alternatives are available. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and other dioceses from across the United States have expressed “moral concerns” over the Covid-19 vaccine developed using adenovirus type 26 (Ad26).Read | UK, 4 other countries to fast-track modified Covid-19 vaccinesThe bishops have raised objection to the use of cell lines originating from the tissue of aborted fetuses to develop the vaccine. In January, the USCCB released an FAQ document that said Pfizer and Moderna used an “abortion-derived cell line” to test the efficacy of their Covid-19 vaccines but didn’t use it in the development or production. On the other hand, Janssen vaccines raise “additional moral concerns” because of the use of such a cell line in development and production, they added“If one can choose among equally safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines, the vaccine with the least connection to abortion-derived cell lines should be chosen. Therefore, if one has the ability to choose a vaccine, Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccines should be chosen over Johnson & Johnson’s,” US bishop chairmen for Doctrine and for Pro-Life said in a joint statement.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson, in a statement to CNN, said that the vaccine uses an inactivated non-infective adenovirus vector and there is no fetal tissue in the vaccine. In multiple reports, scientists and health experts have also noted that the cells used in the testing, development and production of vaccines are thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bishops-discouraging-catholics-from-getting-j-j-covid-19-shot-here-s-why-101614851773188.html

According to Icelandic Meteorological Office (ICO), over 18,000 tremors have been recorded in a week, compared to 1,000 normally for a whole year.1/2 Yesterday, about 2500 earthquakesmeasured, since midnight almost 800 earthquakes measured. In total, there have been over 18000 earthquakes since eruption began about a week ago. Most activity limited to Fagradalsfjall, slight movement to the SW compared to activity yesterdayThe meteorological office said that an "increase in seismic tremor" was detected throughout most of the country. "Magma movements are a likely cause for the ongoing signal, and it is possible that an effusive (lava-producing) eruption could occur close to Keilir," the department said in its bulletin on Wednesday."The magma is fracturing and it is so close to the surface... that we have to take it seriously," Freysteinn Sigmundsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland, told news agency AFP.Iceland is the most active volcanic region in Europe, with an eruption every five years on average. It has 30 volcanic systems and more than 600 hot springs, and straddles tectonic plates on the mid-Atlantic ridge.The residents of capital Reykjavik and in areas close to the city have been tokd that the volcanic area was expected to release lava slowly over the next few weeks. However, the weather scientists say there was no indication that the event would pose a threat to human life or property.The meteorological department, meanwhile, has elevated the alert for air travel from yellow to orange - the third-highest level. Red, the highest level of alert, is reserved for an imminent or ongoing volcanic eruption.The ICO analysed the satellite data of the area around Reykjanes, which is around 50 kilometre from the capital, to present some possible developments, including a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in the Fagradalsfjall area.The most powerful earthquake in recent days of magnitude 5.6 struck the region on February 24. Five more were recorded on the same day.Such intense seismic activity has not been recorded in the region since digital monitoring began in 1991.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iceland-records-over-16-000-earthquakes-in-8-days-101614853214789.html

The junta overthrew a democratically-elected government, and detained its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, having disputed her party's landslide victory in November.India is already home to thousands of refugees from Myanmar, including ethnic Chin people and Rohingya who fled the southeast Asian country during previous bouts of violence.A Chin community leader in New Delhi said police have rarely fled to India."This is something unusual,” said James Fanai, president of the India-based Chin Refugee Committee. "Because in the past, police and military just follow orders.”Myanmar's ruling military council has stressed the importance of police and soldiers doing their duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-myanmar-police-seek-refuge-in-india-rather-than-carry-out-junta-s-orders-101614853380025.html
04-03-2021||World||Myanmar protesters, undaunted by killings, march again||Demonstrators in Myanmar protesting last month's military coup returned to the streets Thursday, undaunted by the killing of at least 38 people the previous day by security forces.New protests were held in at least three areas of Yangon, the country's largest city, that have been scenes of violence for the past few days. Police again used force to try to disperse the crowds, according to social media accounts.Protests also continued In Mandalay, the second-biggest city. A formation of five fighter planes flew over the city on Thursday morning in what appeared to be a threatening show of force.The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said 38 people were killed Wednesday, a figure consistent with other reports.The death toll was the highest since the Feb. 1 takeover, when the military ousted the elected government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 50 civilians, mostly peaceful protesters, are confirmed to have been killed by police and soldiers since then.The U.N. Security Council has scheduled closed-door consultations on Friday on calls to reverse the coup — including from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres — and stop the escalating military crackdown.Any kind of coordinated action at the United Nations will be difficult since two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, are likely to veto it. Some countries have already imposed or are considering their own sanctions.U.N. envoy Schraner Burgener said she warned Myanmar’s army that the world’s nations and the Security Council “might take huge strong measures.”“And the answer was, ‘We are used to sanctions and we survived those sanctions in the past,’” she said. When she also warned the army that Myanmar would become isolated, she said, “the answer was, ‘We have to learn to walk with only a few friends.’”The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Suu Kyi’s rise to power after 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investing into the country.Schraner Burgener said the army has been taken aback by the strong opposition, which has been led by young people.“I think that the army is very surprised that it doesn’t work because in the past, in 1988 and 2007 and 2008, it worked,” she said, referring to previous violent crackdowns on uprisings against military rule.Demonstrators have flooded the streets of towns and cities across Myanmar since last month's coup, even though gatherings of five or more people are banned and security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.Wednesday's highest death toll was in Yangon, where an estimated 18 people died. Most if not all of the deaths occurred in the eastern neighborhood of North Okkalapa.Stark video shot Wednesday night at the main hospital there showed grieving relatives collecting the blood-soaked bodies of family members who were shot. Some relatives sobbed uncontrollably, while others looked in shock at the scene around them.Protesters in Mandalay flashed a three-fingered salute of resistance on Thursday as they rode their motorbikes to follow a funeral procession for Kyal Sin, also known by her Chinese name Deng Jia Xi, a university student who was killed as she attended a demonstration on Wednesday. The black hearse that carried her remains had a photo of her on the windshield, and the hearse was preceded by a truck full of floral bouquets. Many thousands of people attended.In the central city of Monywa, which has turned out huge crowds of protesters on an almost daily basis, a memorial service was held Thursday before a protest march began. At least eight people were reported to have been killed on Wednesday.According to multiple posts on social media, protests were also happening Thursday in Pyinmana, a satellite town of the capital Naypyitaw; Myingyan in central Myanmar, where there was one death Wednesday; Pathein, west of Yangon; and Myeik, near the country’s southern tip.As part of the crackdown, security forces have arrested well over a thousand people, including journalists, according to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. On Saturday, at least eight journalists, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, were detained. he and several other members of the media have been charged with violating a public safety law that could see them imprisoned for up to three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-undaunted-by-killings-march-again-101614853342052.html

She asked former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about how the tech giant uses third party seller data. She also questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on how the social networking giant harvests and monetises user data and then utilizes it to copy, acquire, and kill rivals, the media release said.Additionally, Jayapal asked Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai about the company’s total control of the ad market as the owner of the market, the ad buyer, and the ad seller, which has harmful effects on the local and independent journalism necessary for our democracy to thrive.The hearing was part of the Antitrust Subcommittee’s more than 16-month investigation into the state of competition in the digital economy.“I can say conclusively that self-regulation by Big Tech comes at the expense of our communities, small businesses, consumers, the free press, and innovation,” she said after the investigation’s findings were released in October.In December, Jayapal was elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers in the 117th Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pramila-jayapal-named-vice-chair-of-a-key-congressional-subcommittee-101614852639181.html

The guidelines build on the model already used to modify the flu vaccine in response to continual changes in that virus.Under the new rules, developers will be required to provide “robust evidence” that modified Covid-19 vaccines produce a strong immune response to the variant, as well as data showing they are safe and meet quality standards.“Our priority is to get effective vaccines to the public in as short a time as possible, without compromising on safety,” Dr. Christian Schneider, the MHRA's chief scientific officer said in a statement. “Should any modifications to authorized Covid-19 vaccines be necessary, this regulatory approach should do that.”The announcement comes amid concerns that a variant first discovered in Brazil may be more resistant to existing vaccines than other variants. The UK has banned direct flights from 33 countries in an effort to prevent variants of concern from becoming established in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-4-other-countries-to-fast-track-modified-covid-19-vaccines-to-fight-emerging-variants-101614846929524.html

That means some high schoolers could get in line for those shots whenever they become eligible in their area, either because of a medical condition or once availability opens up.Pfizer and Moderna both have completed enrollment for studies of children ages 12 and older, and expect to release the data over the summer. If regulators clear the results, younger teens likewise could start getting vaccinated once supply allows. The Moderna vaccine is currently cleared for people 18 and older.Researchers started with older children because they tend to respond to vaccines most similarly to adults. Testing even younger groups is more complex, because they may require a different dose or have differing responses.“Children are not just small adults,” said pediatrician Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “The younger you get, the higher the odds are that things could be different.”Children develop serious illness or die from Covid-19 at much lower rates than adults, but can still spread the virus.“There’s no question: we do want to immunize children,” said Drexel University pediatrics professor Dr. Sarah Long.Pfizer and Moderna expect to start studies in children 11 and younger later this year.“It’s unlikely we could get community protection without immunizing children,” Long added. “This is the lynchpin to getting everything back to some kind of normalcy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-children-be-able-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-101614847821149.html
04-03-2021||World||South Korea's top prosecutor resigns in clash with President Moon Jae-in||South Korea’s top prosecutor resigned in protest against President Moon Jae-in’s policy to strip the office of investigative powers, in a move could impact the country’s presidential election in a year’s time.Prosecutor General Yoon Seok-youl, whose public support has risen in the simmering battle with Moon over prosecutorial powers, told reporters on Thursday at the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office in Seoul that he was stepping down. Moon’s ruling party is pushing to form a new state agency that would strip prosecutors of much of their investigative powers.“The spirit of the constitution and rule of law is being destroyed,” Yoon said, referring to the plans. “It’s hard to see our value of justice being collapsed.” About an hour after Yoon spoke, the presidential office said Moon had accepted the resignation.The move could open a path for Yoon to run for president in the March 2022 elections to replace Moon when his single, five-year term ends. Current surveys show Yoon as a top choice for president, outpolling contenders in Moon’s progressive camp.Yoon last year said he was considering ways to serve the nation, not ruling out the possibility of running for the presidency. The fight between Moon and Yoon’s office has lasted for months and at times pushed the government’s support rate to record lows.Yoon was handpicked by Moon in 2019, with a mandate to make good on the president’s pledges to clean up government and go after the most powerful.

04-03-2021||World||Texas power grid operator ERCOT fires CEO after deadly blackouts||Texas' power grid operator ousted chief executive Bill Magness on Wednesday, as the fallout continues from a deadly blackout last month that left residents without heat, power or water for days.His departure followed fierce criticism by state lawmakers of the handling of the crisis by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which has led one large electricity provider to seek bankruptcy and put several others near to it.The mid-February storm temporarily knocked out up to half the state's generating plants, triggering outages that killed dozens and pushed power prices to 10 times the normal rate."ERCOT's decision to oust CEO Bill Magness signals accountability for the disaster that swept through our state two weeks ago," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement on Twitter."(This step) offers the opportunity for new leadership that can more efficiently prepare and direct our state's resources when dangerous weather strikes," he added.Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who earlier this week called for the heads of ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission to resign, also welcomed the move.The legislature now can begin "fixing what went wrong," Patrick said.ERCOT said in a statement cited by multiple media organizations that its board had directed that Magness be given a 60 days' termination notice. The board would begin an immediate search for a new CEO.Magness worked at ERCOT for more than a decade and became its CEO and president in 2016 after working as its general counsel, the Texas Tribune newspaper reported.Brad Jones, former head of New York's power grid, is the leading candidate to replace Magness as ERCOT's CEO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the board's thinking.Magness was grilled for hours last week for leaving power prices at up to 450 times the usual rate after the threat to the state's grid had ended.Seven of ERCOT's 15 directors have resigned in the last week and the head of the state's Public Utility Commission, which supervised ERCOT, resigned on Monday.The winter storm caused widespread blackouts across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, knocking out power to more than 4 million people at its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-power-grid-operator-ercot-fires-ceo-after-deadly-blackouts-101614847400423.html
04-03-2021||World||Thailand probes Facebook's removal of 185 army-linked accounts and groups||Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha says he has assigned the Royal Thai Army to investigate after Facebook Inc. removed 185 accounts and groups allegedly engaged in an information-influencing operation in Thailand run by the military.That followed Facebook’s announcement a day earlier that it had deleted 77 accounts, 72 pages, 18 groups and 18 Instagram accounts for violating its policy against government interference, which is defined as coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a government entity.“Facebook took action like this. It can be interpreted in many ways. We must make it clear,” said Prayuth.About 703,000 accounts followed one or more of these pages, about 100,000 accounts joined at least one of these groups and around 2,500 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts. Facebook said.Facebook says the network of accounts originated in Thailand and targeted domestic audiences in its southern provinces, where the army faces a longstanding insurgency movement. The people behind the network used both authentic and fake accounts, posting their content on multiple pages to make it look more popular than it was. The majority of page postings appear to have occurred in 2020.The Facebook report says the network posted primarily in Thai about news and current events, including content in support of the Thai military and the monarchy. The posts included calls for non-violence, regional Covid-19 updates, allegations of violence by the insurgent groups in southern Thailand and criticism of separatist and independence movements.“Although the people behind it attempted to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to the Thai military’s Internal Security Operations Command,” Facebook said.On Thursday, three activists including Yingcheep Atchanont, Sarinee Achavanuntakul and Winyu John Wongsurawat, filed a suit with the Administrative Court in Bangkok seeking an order to stop the Royal Thai Army’s information operation. The three said they have been targeted in such operations.They said they also planned to contact Facebook and the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression seeking an investigation into army’s information operations against Thai civilians.“The army has no authority to commit such information operations," Yingcheep told reporters. “The government should protect people who want to express their opinions, not create propaganda and attack those who have differing views."The issue of army information operations has surfaced during parliamentary debates.Nattacha Boonchaiinsawat, a lawmaker from the opposition Move Forward Party, accused the army of misusing funds to foment hatred toward critics of the government. The army responded by saying it just trains officers for public relations, to promote a positive image for the military.In October 2020, Twitter disclosed it had uncovered a network of 926 accounts allegedly involved in information operations linked to the army. It said the accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-Royal Thai Army and pro-government content and also targeting prominent political opposition figures.Apart from in Thailand, Facebook said last month that it had detected and removed attempts to reestablish a presence on the platform by military-linked networks in Myanmar, where the army took over in a Feb. 1 coup. Facebook had removed those accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-probes-facebook-s-removal-of-185-army-linked-accounts-and-groups-101614844321512.html
04-03-2021||World||China is training astronauts for space station crewed flights||China said Thursday a cohort of astronauts is training for four crewed missions this year as the country works to complete its first permanent orbiting space station.The station’s core module, christened Tianhe, could be launched as soon as next month, according to the China National Space Administration and foreign observers. The massive Long March-5B Y2 rocket and its payload were moved into place last month at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in tropical Hainan province for assembly and testing.That launch would be the first of 11 missions over the next two years to finish constructing the station by the end of 2022. Two other modules will be launched later, along with four Tianzhou cargo supply mission and the four Shenzhou crewed missions.CNSA listed 12 astronauts training for the crewed missions, including veterans of previous Shenzhou flights, newcomers and women, though it wasn't clear if there were others selected.Up to three crew members will reportedly live at a time in the the core module, which has docking ports to allow the attachment of scientific modules launched later.China has already launched two smaller experimental space stations to test measures for rendezvous, docking and life support aboard. Once completed, the permanent space station will allow for stays of up to six months, similar to the International Space Station.The Chinese station reportedly is intended to be used for 15 years and may outlast ISS, which is nearing the end of its functional lifespan.ISS is backed by the US, Russia, Japan, Europe, Canada and others, but China did not participate, partly at the insistence of the United States, which was wary of sharing technology with the secretive, military linked Chinese program.China’s space program, though, has chalked up steady progress since it first put an astronaut into orbit around Earth in 2003.A rover went to the little-explored far side of the moon in 2019.Another craft, the Tianwen-1, is in a parking orbit around Mars in anticipation of landing a rover on the surface in the coming months. If it succeeds, China would become only the second country after the US to put a spacecraft on Mars.China is also working on a reusable space plane and planning a crewed lunar mission and a possible permanent research base on the moon, though no dates have been proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-training-astronauts-for-space-station-crewed-flights-101614843710167.html

No charges have yet been laid, police said."Any messages of hate or people wanting to cause harm in our community will not be tolerated - it's not the Kiwi way," said John Price, Canterbury District Commander Superintendent in an emailed statement.New Zealand is heightened alert ahead of the March 15 anniversary of Christchurch attack. Armed with high-capacity semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people and injured dozens more after opening fire on worshippers at the two mosques, livestreaming the attacks on Facebook before being arrested.In August, Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole, the first time New Zealand confined anyone for the rest of their life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-police-arrest-2-for-threat-to-mosques-attacked-in-2019-101614841671920.html
04-03-2021||World||George Floyd Justice in Policing Act approved by US House; revamps policing||Cheered on by President Joe Biden, House Democrats hustled Wednesday to pass the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing nationwide, able to avoid clashing with moderates in their own party who are wary of reigniting a debate they say hurt them during last fall's election.The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was approved 220-212 late Wednesday.The sweeping legislation, which was first approved last summer but stalled in the Senate, was named in honour of Floyd, whose killing by police in Minnesota last Memorial Day sparked protests nationwide. The bill would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement and create national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability.“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents the Minneapolis area near where Floyd died. She asked her colleagues if they would "have the moral courage to pursue justice and secure meaningful change?”Democrats say they were determined to pass the bill a second time, to combat police brutality and institutional racism after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans following interactions with law enforcement — images of which were sometimes jarringly captured on video.Also watch: Biden official on situation in Jammu & Kashmir & US stand on issueFloyd’s family watched the emotional debate from a nearby House office building.But the debate over legislation has turned into a political liability for Democrats as Republicans seized on calls by some activists and progressives to “defund the police” to argue that Democrats were intent on slashing police force budgets. This bill doesn't do that.Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said it was a reason the party, after talking confidently of growing its majority in November, instead saw it shrink to just 10 seats, 221-211.“We played too much defence on ‘defund the police,’” Perez said.Moderate Democrats said the charge helped drive Democratic defeats in swing districts around the country.“No one ran on ‘defund the police,’ but all you have to do is make that a political weapon,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Texas Democrat who has pushed for more police funding in places like his city of Laredo, where the law enforcement presence is especially concentrated given the close proximity to the Mexican border.While Democrats used their then-larger majority to pass the police reform measure in the House last summer, it stalled in the then-Republican-controlled Senate, where GOP senators pushed an alternate plan that Democrats blocked from consideration, calling it inadequate. Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, but it seems unlikely the bill could pass the Senate without substantial changes to win GOP support.The bill had been set for a vote Thursday, but House leaders abruptly changed the schedule to wrap up their week's work after US Capitol Police warned of threats of violence at the Capitol two months after the Jan. 6 siege.Senior Democratic congressional aides said Wednesday they were eager to get the bill to the Senate, where negotiations will take longer.Republicans quickly revived the “defund the police” criticisms. “Our law enforcement officers need more funding not less,” Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., said during Wednesday's debate.Despite the political attacks by Republicans, even the House's more centrist lawmakers, some representing more conservative districts, backed the bill.“Black Americans have endured generations of systemic racism and discrimination for too long, and this has been painfully evident in their treatment by law enforcement," said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition.That endorsement came despite the bill's prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with the Senate.Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without such legal protections, fear of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers — even though the measure permits such suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.California Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the bill, understands the challenge some House members face in supporting it.“My colleagues, several of them, I do not make light of the difficulty they had getting re-elected because of the lie around defunding the police,” Bass said.She called provisions limiting qualified immunity and easing standards for prosecution “the only measures that hold police accountable — that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape.”Bass said she would not make concessions before the bill cleared the House. Changes would only serve to weaken it while failing to shield Democrats from the false “defund the police” narrative surrounding it, she said.“Even if they were to vote against the bill, even if they were to have a press conference denouncing the bill, they are still going to be hit with the same lie,” Bass said of Democrats.She also acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November — and may likely see again — when former President Donald Trump's re-election campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning. But Bass said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how “the scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police.”“That's as old as apple pie in our history,” she said. “So do you not act because of that?”Still, she conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Bass said she'd been in contact with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.Scott said this week that the legislation's sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, “We have to protect individual officers.”“That's a red line for me,” Scott said, adding, “Hopefully we'll come up with something that actually works.”That could prove a tall order, despite the White House's vocal support for police reform. Biden has promised to combat systemic racism and signed executive orders he says will begin doing that, though advocates are expecting the new administration to go further.Biden has tweeted that he hopes "to be able to sign into law a landmark police reform bill.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-approved-by-us-house-revamps-policing-101614829103703.html
04-03-2021||World||North Korea may be trying to extract plutonium to make more nuclear weapons||North Korea may be trying to extract plutonium to make more nuclear weapons at its main atomic complex, recent satellite photos indicated, weeks after leader Kim Jong Un vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal.The 38 North website, which specializes in North Korea studies, cited the imagery as indicating that a coal-fired steam plant at the North’s Yongbyon nuclear complex is in operation after about a two-year hiatus. Smoke was observed emanating from the plant’s smokestack at various times from late February and early March.This suggests “preparations for spent fuel reprocessing could be underway to extract plutonium needed for North Korea’s nuclear weapon,” the website said Wednesday. But it added that “this could also mean simply the facility is being prepped to handle radioactive waste.”Earlier this week, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said some nuclear facilities in North Korea continued to operate, citing the operation of the steam plant that serves the radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon. The laboratory is a facility where plutonium is extracted by reprocessing spent fuel rods removed from reactors.“The DPRK’s nuclear activities remain a cause for serious concern. The continuation of the DPRK’s nuclear program is a clear violation of relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions and is deeply regrettable,” Grossi told the IAEA's board of governors, according to IAEA's website. DPRK refers to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Plutonium is one of the two key ingredients to build nuclear weapons along with highly enriched uranium. The Yongbyon complex, north of the capital city of Pyongyang, has facilities to produce both ingredients. It’s not clear exactly how much weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium has been produced at Yonbyong and where North Korea stores it.Outside estimates on North Korea’s nuclear arsenal vary. In 2018, a South Korean official told Parliament the North may have 20 bombs to as many as 60.US-led diplomacy aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear program in return for economic and political benefits has been deadlocked since a summit between President Donald Trump and Kim collapsed in early 2019. Trump rejected Kim’s calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for dismantling the Yongbyon complex in what was seen as a limited denuclearization step because North Korea had already built nuclear weapons and is believed to be running other covert bomb-making facilities.In January, Kim vowed to enlarge nuclear arsenal and disclosed an array of high-tech weapons systems targeting the United States, saying the fate of bilateral ties depends on whether Washington withdraw its hostile policy on North Korea.Some experts say Kim is attempting to pressure President Joe Biden’s government to return to diplomacy and ease sanctions on the North.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-may-be-trying-to-extract-plutonium-to-make-more-nuclear-weapons-101614839972312.html
04-03-2021||World||Joe Biden pledges deeper ties in Indo-Pacific, India in national security plan||The Biden administration on Wednesday pledged to a “most robust” military presence in the Indo-Pacific as well as in Europe, asserting the “deepest connection” with the two globally significant regions in a guidance report that outlined for the first time President Joe Biden’s national security strategy.The 21-page paper — titled “Interim National Security Strategic Guidance” — also stated the Biden administration’s aim to “deepen” ties with India as a part of the strategy.The report portrayed an “increasingly assertive” China and “destabilising” Russia as main adversaries confronting the United States, but it clearly held the former as the more consequential of the two.China is “the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system”, the report said.The US pivot to Asia — in response to and as an acknowledgement of China as a growing threat — started under Barack Obama, and then gathered steam on Donald Trump’s watch with, among other things, the renaming of the US military’s Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command. It has been taken to a different level by the Biden administration, accorded the same significance as Europe, which has dominated US diplomatic and military thinking and spending for more than a century now, starting with World War I.The paper outlines President Biden’s approach to tackling a whole range of national security issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, economic recovery, climate change, immigration, racial injustice, challenges to democracy and the rise of extremism at home and their external manifestations abroad, and global issues such as proliferation, trade pacts and agreements, and multilateral forums such as the UN, the WHO and the WTO.The report is premised on, as it said, on “a basic truth: in today’s world, economic security is national security”.US secretary of state Antony Blinken summarised the Biden administration’s approach at some length in his first major foreign policy speech just hours before the release of the report, saying, “The interim guidance lays out the global landscape as the Biden administration sees it, explains the priorities of our foreign policy — and specifically how we will renew America’s strength to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of our time.”Ties with India came up in a section of the report that describes Biden’s commitment to reengaging the world, reversing predecessor Trump’s “America First” policy, and to rebuilding alliances and partnerships to leverage their collective negotiating clout to confront China and other challenges.As the US will seek to rebuild partnerships — clearly the second tier of relationships after treaty allies and alliances such as Japan, South Korea and Nato — the report said, “We will recognise that our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere.”The report went on to add, “We will deepen our partnership with India and work alongside New Zealand, as well as Singapore, Vietnam, and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states, to advance shared objectives.”The pitch for Indo-Pacific was significant, especially for an administration that came in looking, to critics, somewhat unsure and confused on this issue. “Asia-Pacific”, a phrase favoured by Beijing as an alternative to “Indo-Pacific”, had popped up frequently in remarks and speeches by top Biden appointees initially. Officials and commentators in India and the Indo-Pacific countries — especially in Japan and Australia, which are member countries of the Quad grouping, were worried.The Biden administration took note. And “Asia-Pacific” gradually fell out of use.The report also talks about sealing a strategic shift, adding, “We will recognise that our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere.”And it will translate into military terms. While addressing issues such as military interventions — as opposed to “forever wars” but keen to continue battling terrorists — the report said, “as we position ourselves to deter our adversaries and defend our interests, working alongside our partners, our presence will be most robust in the Indo-Pacific and Europe”.The Biden administration also pledged to take on China more aggressively, as detailed by the guidance, than indicated before: “We will support China’s neighbours and commercial partners in defending their rights to make independent political choices free of coercion or undue foreign influence.”That was a barely concealed reference to countries that China has entrapped into sovereignty-compromising debts through its predatory one-belt-one-road initiative. Pakistan is one of the victims though it will not acknowledge it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pledges-deeper-ties-with-indo-pacific-india-in-national-security-plan-101614833495516.html

04-03-2021||World||Australia PM Morrison supports his attorney-general's denial of rape accusations||Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday expressed support for his attorney-general, who this week denied accusations he raped a schoolgirl when he was a teenager.Morrison told reporters Australia must follow the rule of law and the presumption of innocence in the matter, after police concluded there was insufficient evidence to investigate lawmaker Christian Porter, a 50-year-old former prosecutor.The woman who accused Porter died by suicide last year after she had gone to police and then later withdrawn her complaint. Her accusation against Porter became public last week after being sent anonymously to Morrison and other lawmakers.The case has intensified scrutiny of the culture in Parliament, where a staff member two weeks ago made an unrelated claim that she was raped by a senior colleague.In the latest case, Morrison said his heart broke for the woman's family, who lost a loved one.“These are harrowing events," he said.But he said Porter had absolutely rejected the allegations and Australia must follow the law.“You will be aware of the terrible things that can happen in a country where the rule of law is not upheld and is not supported, in whatever the circumstances," Morrison said. "The rule of law is essential for liberal democracies, and we weaken it at our great peril.”Prominent lawyers and the woman’s friends have called for an independent inquiry to test the evidence against Porter, while some opposition lawmakers say the allegations are serious and credible.But Morrison said police were the authorized authorities to make judgments about the case, and “that's where the matter rests.”On Thursday, Porter held an emotional press conference in which he said he wouldn't quit his job."If I stand down from my position as attorney-general because of an allegation about something that simply did not happen, then any person in Australia can lose their career, their job, their life’s work based on nothing more than an accusation that appears in print,” Porter said.The allegations date back more than three decades, when Porter was 17 and his accuser was 16, and they competed alongside each other on a four-member school debate team.Porter said he remembered his accuser as intelligent, bright and happy — but that nothing sexual occurred between them.“It just didn’t happen,” he told reporters.Porter said he's planning to take a couple of weeks off “just for my own sanity” before returning to work.Morrison said he was pleased Porter was taking the break.“I’m looking forward to him returning to his duties once that period of leave is completed," the prime minister said.A new confidential complaints hotline for reporting serious workplace incidents has been set up for Parliament House staff, the government said this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-pm-morrison-supports-his-attorney-general-s-denial-of-rape-accusations-101614822043734.html
04-03-2021||World||Biden's approval rating declines in 2 months, maintains majority approval||US President Joe Biden is witnessing a downward trend in his approval rating in comparison to that in January. Monmouth University poll results announced on Wednesday shows a decline in the approval rating of the President. From 54 per cent in January, 51 per cent of Americans approve of the President in March. His disapproval rating has jumped from 30 per cent to 42 per cent."It’s probably not a surprise that Biden’s honeymoon period has closed quickly. He does maintain a net positive rating, but the Covid stimulus package will be the first significant test of how stable that support is," Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute said.The drop in the approval rating also comes with a shift in the people who now have an opinion on the President. The category of people with 'no opinion' on Biden in late January has dropped from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.The poll results also found that 6 in 10 or 62 per cent of Americans approve the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus package. The majority of the public (51 per cent) are satisfied with the $1,400 direct payments to individuals and families of certain income levels. Around 28 per cent hope for larger payments and just 14 per cent want smaller payments.Also Read | SpaceX’s biggest rocket manages first successful landing, then explodesAbout 53 per cent of Americans support the increase in the minimum wage and 67 per cent approve the additional jobless benefits and its extension through the summer included in the stimulus package. The hike in the minimum wage included in the bill is expected to be cut out in the Senate due to a previous parliamentary ruling.However, the poll results also show that 59 per cent of Americans do not approve of the job being done by the Congress and 61 per cent believes that the nation's trajectory is headed in the wrong direction. Only 30 per cent approve of the job done by the Congress and only 34 per cent feel that the nation is headed in the right direction.Biden enjoys around 91 per cent approval rating from the Democrats and 80 per cent disapproval from the Republicans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-approval-rating-declines-in-2-months-maintains-majority-approval-101614822266971.html
04-03-2021||World||SpaceX’s biggest rocket manages first successful landing, then explodes||Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s newest and biggest rocket pulled off its first successful landing, then exploded a brief time later and was engulfed by fire.The Starship SN-10 prototype lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at about 5:15 p.m. in Boca Chica, Texas, on Wednesday, based on a live video stream on SpaceX’s website. The rocket then flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) before turning its engines back on and settling on the landing pad with a slight lean.Shortly after that, the rocket was lifted into the air by an explosion and consumed by flames, possibly after a fire ignited fuel. Until that point, the rocket appeared to achieve a key milestone with its first stable landing in three attempts. After its ascent, Starship shut off its three Raptor engines and performed a controlled “belly flop” descent, then reignited its engines to make a vertical landing.Despite the mishap, the test is likely to signal progress for the massive vehicle. An earlier Starship rocket slammed to the ground on the program’s first high-altitude flight Dec. 9, igniting a fireball, followed by a similar outcome with a second prototype last month. No one was hurt in the mishaps, and there were no reports of injuries from the fire after the latest flight, which was the third high-altitude test.SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to use the Starship to shuttle as many as 12 people around the moon in 2023, land NASA astronauts on the lunar surface and eventually settle explorers on Mars. The company still has work to prepare the Starship for its first orbital flight, which could occur later this year.“I’m highly confident that we will have reached orbit many times with Starship before 2023, and that it will be safe enough for human transport by 2023,” Musk said Tuesday in a video released by Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, who has invited eight people to apply to join his “fun trip” around the moon. “It’s looking very, very promising.”SpaceX conceived the stainless steel Starship as a versatile, fully reusable craft that can carry 100 metric tons for deep-space missions to the moon and Mars. It’s also designed to serve as a hypersonic, point-to-point vehicle to reduce travel times across Earth.Excluding a heavy booster that creates a two-stage system, Starship is 160 feet (49 meters) high with a 30-foot diameter, and able to carry as many as 100 passengers.Musk said in October that he’s 80% to 90% confident that Starship will be ready for an orbital flight this year. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, California, plans to fly multiple Starship prototypes from its Texas launch site near the U.S.-Mexico border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-biggest-rocket-manages-first-successful-landing-then-explodes-101614819756543.html
04-03-2021||World||Facebook lifts ban on US political, social issue ads||Facebook says it is lifting its ban on political and social-issue ads put in place after the 2020 U.S. presidential election.Political candidates, groups and others will be able to place ads on Facebook and Instagram beginning on Thursday.Restricting political advertisements following the November election was among the host of measures Facebook put in place last year in an attempt to ensure its platform is not used to sow chaos and spread misinformation.Facebook halted U.S. political ads when the polls closed on Nov. 3, an extension of an earlier restriction on new political ads in the week leading up to Election Day.It said at the time that the ban would be temporary but did not give a clear end date.“We've heard a lot of feedback about this and learned more about political and electoral ads during this election cycle,” the company said in a blog post Wednesday.“As a result, we plan to use the coming months to take a closer look at how these ads work on our service to see where further changes may be merited.”Twitter has banned political ads permanently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-lifts-ban-on-us-political-social-issue-ads-101614819458787.html
04-03-2021||World||Nearly 40 killed in violent day of protests against Myanmar coup, says UN envoy||Thirty-eight people were killed in Myanmar as the military quelled protests in several towns and cities on Wednesday, the United Nations said, the most violent day since demonstrations against last month's military coup first broke out.Police and soldiers opened fire with live rounds with little warning, witnesses said.The bloodshed occurred one day after neighbouring countries had called for restraint in the aftermath of the military's overthrow of the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Also Read: As Myanmar turns violent, India can adopt a two-track approach"It's horrific, it's a massacre. No words can describe the situation and our feelings," youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters via a messaging app.The dead included four children, an aid agency said. Hundreds of protesters were arrested, local media reported."Today it was the bloodiest day since the coup happened on the 1st of February. We had today — only today — 38 people died. We have now more than over 50 people died since the coup started, and many are wounded," United Nations special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, said in New York.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.Schraner Burgener said that in conversations with Myanmar's deputy military chief Soe Win, she had warned him that the military was likely to face strong measures from some countries and isolation in retaliation for the coup."The answer was: 'We are used to sanctions, and we survived'," she told reporters in New York. "When I also warned they will go (into) isolation, the answer was: 'We have to learn to walk with only few friends'."The U.N. Security Council is due to discuss the situation on Friday in a closed meeting, diplomats said.SUSTAINED SHOOTINGKo Bo Kyi, joint secretary of Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners rights group, had said earlier the military killed at least 18. But the toll rose by the end of the day.In the main city Yangon, witnesses said at least eight people were killed, seven of them when security forces opened sustained fire in a neighbourhood in the north of the city in the early evening.Also Read: Concerned by loss of lives in Myanmar, India calls for restraint"I heard so much continuous firing. I lay down on the ground, they shot a lot," protester Kaung Pyae Sone Tun, 23, told Reuters.In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was "appalled" by the increase in violence. The administration of President Joe Biden was evaluating "appropriate" measures to respond and any actions would be targeted at Myanmar's military, he added.The United States has conveyed to China that it is looking for Beijing to play a constructive role in Myanmar, the spokesman said.The European Union said the shootings of unarmed civilians and medical workers were clear breaches of international law. It also said the military was stepping up repression of the media, with a growing number of journalists arrested and charged.In the central town of Monywa, six people were killed, the Monywa Gazette reported. Others were killed in the second-biggest city Mandalay, the northern town of Hpakant and the central town of Myingyan.Save the Children said in a statement four children were among the dead, including a 14-year-old boy who Radio Free Asia reported was shot dead by a soldier on a passing convoy of military trucks. The soldiers loaded his body onto a truck and left the scene, according to the report.'WE SHALL OVERCOME'Security forces breaking up protests in Yangon detained about 300 protesters, the Myanmar Now news agency reported.Video posted on social media showed lines of young men, hands on heads, filing into army trucks as police and soldiers stood guard. Reuters was unable to verify the footage.Images of a 19-year-old woman, one of two shot dead in Mandalay, showed her wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".Police in Yangon ordered three medics out of an ambulance, shot up the windscreen and then kicked and beat the workers with gun butts and batons, video broadcast by U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia showed. Reuters was unable to verify the video independently.Democracy activist Esther Ze Naw told Reuters that the sacrifices of those who died would not be in vain."We shall overcome this and win," she said.On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) failed to make a breakthrough in a virtual foreign ministers' meeting on Myanmar.While united in a call for restraint, only four members - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore - called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees."We expressed ASEAN's readiness to assist Myanmar in a positive, peaceful and constructive manner," the ASEAN chair, Brunei, said in a statement.Myanmar's state media said the military-appointed foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, attended and "apprised the meeting of voting irregularities" in the November election.The military justified the coup by saying its complaints of voter fraud in the Nov. 8 vote were ignored. Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, earning a second term.The election commission said the vote was fair.Junta leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has pledged to hold new elections but given no time frame. U.N. envoy Schraner Burgener said his deputy Soe Win told her that "after a year they want to have another election."Suu Kyi, 75, has been held incommunicado since the coup but appeared at a court hearing via video conferencing this week and looked in good health, a lawyer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-40-killed-in-violent-day-of-protests-against-myanmar-coup-un-envoy-says-101614819069754.html
04-03-2021||World||Rishi Sunak delays UK fiscal squeeze until year before next election||Rishi Sunak put off steps to tackle the UK’s record budget deficit for another two years, focusing on stimulus for a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.Tax and spending measures in the chancellor of the exchequer’s annual budget will add 73 billion pounds ($101 billion) to the economy by April 2023. In the three years after that, the Treasury will take back almost the same amount of money and drive the overall tax burden to its highest since the 1960s.It’s a political gamble for Sunak since the Conservative government will be campaigning for re-election in 2024 around the time when the tightening starts to bite. That would also be around the time that some economists expect the Bank of England to start unwinding its own stimulus after cutting interest rates to a record low and expanding its asset purchase program.“The debate will become at what point the bank will want to give some sort of hawkish signal about starting the process of normalization,” Jacob Nell, chief U.K. economist at Morgan Stanley and a former Treasury official, said in an interview after Sunak’s statement on Wednesday. “Previously we had the recovery lagging. Now it’s going to be level-pegging with Europe.”Sunak’s largesses brings to about 350 billion pounds the sum the Treasury is spending on the Covid crisis. With Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s rapid vaccination program opening the prospect of fewer restrictions by the middle of this year, Sunak is allowing time for a recovery to gather momentum before fixing the public finances.The looser fiscal stance added fuel to a rise in interest rates in financial markets, where investors increasingly anticipate both a quick bounce for the economy and higher borrowing. U.K. government bonds led a sell off across Europe on Wednesday, with yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt rising 9.3 basis points.What Our Economists Say ...“With Sunak giving the economy more chance to recover before removing the key pillar of fiscal support, the chances of a sharp rise in unemployment when the scheme ends have been dramatically reduced. By limiting the rise in unemployment Sunak has raised the possibility of the economy recovering more quickly.”--Dan Hanson, Bloomberg Economics. “The fiscal backdrop will be more favorable for growth this year and next,” said Allan Monks, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Plc. “We also think this has some implications for the BOE. This hints at an earlier start to monetary policy tightening.”The economy will return to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of next year, six months earlier than forecast in November, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The agency said Sunak’s decision to extend wage support for furloughed workers means unemployment is likely to peak at 6.5% rather than 7.5% -- a difference of about 340,000 people.Business investment, which stagnated following the 2016 Brexit referendum and plunged last year, is set to get a boost from Sunak’s announcement of a 12 billion-pound temporary tax break that encourages firms to bring forward investment from future years. The OBR sees investment jumping by almost 17% in 2022.The scale of those measures plans prompted some economists to lift their forecasts for growth. Others said it complicated the task facing the central bank.“This is tricky for the BOE because at the two-year horizon, where monetary policy has most effect, you’re going to see a large fiscal contraction,” said Robert Wood, chief U.K. economist at Bank of America. “You can’t have both the BOE hiking rates and the government consolidating to this degree at the same time.”Sunak plans to raise taxes from 2023 by lifting the main rate on corporate profits, freezing tax thresholds and reducing existing departmental spending plans by about 4 billion pounds a year. The chancellor said his aim is for Britain only to borrow for investment, not day-to-day spending, a goal the OBR said he may come close to meeting by the middle of the decade.Despite the brighter near-term outlook, the OBR was no more optimistic that the economy will escape the scarring effects of the pandemic. Five years from now, it said GDP may be 3% lower than it would have been had the crisis not happened.Some of the Treasury’s forecasts could be difficult to achieve. The government sees income from property-transaction taxes soaring 40% to 17.3 billion pounds in 2025-26 from 12.3 billion pounds in the coming fiscal year. That’s almost as much as was raised before the pandemic and without a tax holiday on purchases.“More may yet need to be done in forthcoming fiscal events in order toput the public finances back on an even keel,” said George Buckley, chief U.K. economist at Nomura International Plc in London.Even so, the macroeconomic outlook delivered by the Treasury is similar to the Bank of England’s expectation of a sharp rebound starting the the middle of the year.“The budget delivered a net, near-term fiscal loosening, which should buttress the economic recovery,” said Martin Beck at Oxford Economics. “The OBR’s forecast of 4% GDP growth this year looks far too pessimistic -- we are considering raising our current projection of 5.5%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-delays-uk-fiscal-squeeze-until-year-before-next-election-101614818648724.html

04-03-2021||World||Donald Trump weighs 2024 run without Mike Pence, say allies||Donald Trump is telling allies he’s strongly considering another run for president in 2024 -- and close advisers want him to choose someone other than former Vice President Mike Pence for his ticket, according to people familiar with the discussions.Trump publicly teased at the Conservative Political Action Conference last Sunday that he’s mulling another bid for president. Privately, he’s discussed alternatives to Pence as he takes stock of who he believes stood with him at the end of his term and who didn’t, according to two of the people.They requested anonymity because the conversations have been private.Trump’s advisers have discussed identifying a Black or female running mate for his next run, and three of the people familiar with the matter said Pence likely won’t be on the ticket.Two advisers have suggested Trump consider South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, the people said. Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, are hosting a fundraiser for Noem on Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and home in Palm Beach. The former president is planning to make an appearance, people familiar with the matter said.And on Tuesday, Trump issued a public endorsement for South Carolina Senator Tim Scott’s re-election. Scott is the only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate.Pence rejected his boss’s appeals to unilaterally overturn Trump’s re-election defeat when he presided over the congressional count of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6. The event turned into an insurrection by Trump’s supporters, who invaded the Capitol, disrupted the count and forced the vice president and members of Congress to flee. Five people died in the melee.The two men didn’t speak for days afterward. Pence hasn’t said whether he’d be interested in running with Trump again, according to person familiar with the situation, who believes it’s doubtful Pence would.Trump adviser Jason Miller said “no such conversations are happening” about picking someone other than Pence if he runs again, and that the former president “hasn’t made any decisions regarding a potential 2024 run.” A Pence spokesperson didn’t immediately comment.In Trump’s camp, there’s been no serious consideration of future vice presidential candidates yet, the people familiar with the matter said. If he runs, Trump likely won’t make a formal announcement until the summer of 2023, they said.If Trump runs in 2024, it would be good for him to pick a female running mate or someone who can appeal to voters that he lost in 2020 and for Pence to break out on his own and partner with someone who shares his core conservative values but doesn’t put off voters in the way that Trump’s rhetoric did at times, said Alyssa Farah, a former communications director for Trump.“It’s probably best for both of them,” Farah said on Bloomberg Radio’s “Sound On” program Wednesday.At a rally outside the White House before the deadly Jan. 6 riot, Trump said he would win the 2020 election if Pence did “the right thing” and rejected Electoral College votes for Joe Biden from several states where the former president had alleged, without evidence, that widespread fraud had cost him victory.After Pence refused, Trump tweeted that his vice president “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution.” At the time, the mob was swarming the Capitol, with some insurrectionists chanting “hang Mike Pence,” as the Secret Service spirited the vice president to safety.While Trump didn’t formally announce his candidacy at CPAC on Sunday, his first public appearance since leaving office on Jan. 20, he hinted at another bid. Trump rattled off the accomplishments of his term in the White House, repeated his false claim that he won the 2020 election and added, “Who knows? I may even decide to beat them a third time.”The former president’s public musing about another run may effectively freeze the 2024 Republican presidential field, as many other prominent GOP candidates are likely to wait on the former president’s decision before announcing their own campaigns.Trump is building a political structure that would serve as a campaign foundation should he decide to run again, including an existing political action committee, Save America, that accepts donations up to $5,000 per individual. A new super PAC, which would accept unlimited donations, is also planned.Pence was invited to speak at CPAC but informed organizers weeks ahead of the event that he and his family had decided to keep a low profile in the first half of the year. He has said he’s opening a transition office and plans to move back to Indiana this summer.The former vice president is himself considered a top-tier potential candidate in 2024. A Harvard-Harris poll conducted Feb. 23-25 found that 42% of Republican voters preferred Trump as their 2024 nominee, compared to 18% for Pence, who placed second.Without Trump, Pence led the field with the support of 36% of Republican voters, followed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz at 13%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-weighs-2024-run-without-mike-pence-say-allies-101614816670968.html
04-03-2021||World||SpaceX’s biggest rocket successfully lands in third try||Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s newest and biggest rocket successfully landed in its third test flight, a milestone for the futuristic spacecraft set to fly humans in 2023.The Starship SN-10 prototype lifted off from SpaceX’s seaside launch pad at about 5:15 p.m. in Boca Chica, Texas, on Wednesday, based on a live video stream on SpaceX’s website. The rocket then flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (around 6 miles) before reigniting its engines and touching down on the landing pad.The successful landing -- the craft’s first -- likely marks the start of a new development phase for the massive vehicle, which SpaceX founder Elon Musk plans to use to shuttle as many as 12 people around the moon in two years, land NASA astronauts on the lunar surface and eventually settle explorers on Mars. The company still has work to prepare the Starship for its first orbital flight, which could occur later this year.“I’m highly confident that we will have reached orbit many times with Starship before 2023, and that it will be safe enough for human transport by 2023,” Musk said Tuesday in a video released by Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa, who has invited eight people to apply to join his “fun trip” around the moon. “It’s looking very, very promising.”An earlier Starship rocket slammed to the ground on Dec. 9, igniting a fireball, followed by a similar outcome with a second prototype last month. No one was injured in the mishaps.SpaceX conceived the stainless steel Starship as a versatile, fully reusable craft that can carry 100 metric tons for deep-space missions to the moon and Mars. It’s also designed to serve as a hypersonic, point-to-point vehicle to reduce travel times across Earth.Excluding a heavy booster that creates a two-stage system, Starship is 160 feet (49 meters) high with a 30-foot diameter, and able to carry as many as 100 passengers.Musk said in October that he’s 80% to 90% confident that Starship will be ready for an orbital flight this year. SpaceX, based in Hawthorne, California, plans to fly multiple Starship prototypes from its Texas launch site near the US-Mexico border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacexs-biggest-rocket-successfully-lands-in-third-try-101614816166280.html
04-03-2021||World||Biden administration asks for more time on decision to release Trump taxes to Congress||The Biden administration said it needed more time to decide whether to turn over former president Donald Trump’s tax returns to Congress.In a court filing Wednesday, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department said they were still weighing how to respond to a subpoena by House Democrats seeking six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the government more time and ordered the parties to submit a status report on March 31.“Because the transition to new leadership at both agencies is still ongoing, Defendants require additional time to complete this process,” government lawyers said in the filing.Attorneys for House Democrats said any extension granted by the judge “should be limited, given how long the Committee’s request has been stymied.”The legal battle dates to 2019, when the House Ways and Means Committee sued to compel then-Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to hand over the tax records. Under Trump, the Justice Department fought subpoenas issued by the committee, which filed a lawsuit.Other lawsuits over the president’s tax records involving his accountants and bankers reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress could not compel disclosure, at least for the time being. Those cases were sent back to the lower courts to assess whether lawmakers should narrow the scope of the information they sought.Separately, the district attorney in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, has obtained Trump’s tax records as part of a criminal investigation into the former president’s business dealings. It’s unclear whether Vance will make those documents public.In September 2020, the New York Times cited previously undisclosed returns in reporting that Trump had claimed chronic losses for years as a way to avoid taxes. He paid $750 in federal income tax in 2016, and paid no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, the newspaper reported.The case is Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, 19-cv-1974, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-asks-for-more-time-on-decision-to-release-trump-taxes-to-congress-101614815561748.html

And on Monday, hairdressers opened after a 2 1/2-month break. Current lockdown rules were set to run through Sunday.On Wednesday, Merkel and the state governors -- who in highly decentralized Germany have the power to impose and lift restrictions -- set out a phased plan that allows for some further relaxation of restrictions. Regions where infection rates are relatively low -- though not as low as previously envisioned -- will be able to open nonessential stores, museums and other facilities on a limited basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-covid-19-lockdown-but-paves-way-to-relax-more-curbs-101614814826020.html

However, the FATF president Marcus Pleyer pointed out the deficiencies yet to be addressed are all “serious” as they related to terror financing.At the NEC meeting, it was decided that the additional legislation has to “cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them”, the report said.The Pakistan government will have to submit an updated report within 30 days to the FATF on progress in legislation and other steps to be taken to address outstanding concerns. The meeting concluded there shouldn’t be any hurdle in making two more legal amendments, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-needs-to-enact-laws-to-fulfil-fatf-targets-101614799176514.html

He also participated on Tuesday in the group’s conference call, which was off-limits to reporters.The public absence was more glaring after legislative leaders announced on Tuesday that they were limiting the governor’s broad powers to set state policy during the Covid-19 pandemic.The governor is also facing criticism for withholding, for months, a full account of the number of nursing home residents who died from Covid-19.Under the bill, Cuomo would still have the power to keep alive his existing Covid-19 rules or tweak them. But he’ll no longer be allowed to make decisions without any input from the legislature. He’ll have to notify legislative committees and local governments.Neither Cuomo nor his spokespeople have commented on the latest allegation made against him on Monday night. A woman told The New York Times that Cuomo touched her inappropriately and misbehaved with her at a September 2019 wedding event.Most leading Democrats have signalled they want to wait for the results of an investigation by New York attorney general Letitia James into claims that Cuomo sexually harassed at least two women in his administration. State Democratic Party chair Jay Jacobs said it’s “premature” to opine before the investigation concludes. Several members of the National Governors Association said they support the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scandalhit-cuomo-may-see-emergency-powers-taken-away-101614798804334.html

04-03-2021||World||38 killed on ‘bloodiest day’, says UN envoy||The United Nations envoy to Myanmar called Wednesday the “bloodiest day” since the Southeast Asian country’s military coup last month, with 38 people reported dead. “We have now more than over 50 people died since the coup started and many are wounded,” Christine Schraner Burgener told reporters.Earlier in the day, a human rights group said security forces opened fire on protests and killed at least 18 people on Wednesday, a day after neighbouring countries called for restraint and offered to help Myanmar resolve the crisis.The security forces resorted to live firing with little warning in several towns and cities, witnesses said, as the junta appeared more determined than ever to stamp out protests against the February 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.“It’s horrific, it’s a massacre. No words can describe the situation and our feelings,” youth activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters via a messaging app.A spokesman for the ruling military council did not answer telephone calls seeking comment. Ko Bo Kyi, joint secretary of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners rights group, said in a post on Twitter, “As of now, so called military killed at least 18.”In Yangon, witnesses said at least eight people were killed, one early in the day and seven others when forces opened sustained fire with automatic weapons in a neighbourhood in the north of the city in the evening.“I heard so much continuous firing. I lay down on the ground, they shot a lot,” protester Kaung Pyae Sone Tun, 23, told Reuters. A protest leader in the community, Htut Paing, said the hospital there had told him seven people had been killed. Hospital administrators were not immediately available for comment.Another heavy toll was in the central town of Monywa, where six people were killed, Monywa Gazette reported. Others were killed in various places including the second-biggest city Mandalay, the northern town of Hpakant and the central town of Myingyan.

He was killed but only slightly injured passers-by.In April 2017, a rejected and radicalised Uzbek asylum seeker mowed down pedestrians in Stockholm with a stolen truck, killing five people. He was sentenced to life in jail in June 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-injured-in-suspected-terrorist-attack-stabbing-in-sweden-101614794992749.html
04-03-2021||India||Four days into March, Mumbai sizzles at 38 degrees Celsius||Mumbai witnessed its hottest day of the season so far on Thursday, recording a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius at the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) automatic weather station in Santacruz, up from 37.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier.Thursday's reading was 5 degrees Celsius above normal, and surpassed last year's maximum temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius for the month (on March 17).Officials once again attributed rising temperature to dry, warm winds blowing at a low altitude over the city -- at about 900 metres above mean sea level -- coming from an anti-cyclonic circulation over central India. "Persistent influence of these winds over the last two days has caused the temperature to rise," said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist at IMD. She said a heat wave may be announced if temperatures remain 5 degrees above normal for a second day.The minimum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 20.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which was at normal, and only slightly higher than the previous day's reading of 20.4 degrees Celsius.In Colaba, on the other hand, maximum temperature was recorded at 33.8 degrees Celsius (down from 34.5 degrees a day prior), while minimum temperature was recorded at 23 degrees Celsius (up from Wednesday’s 22.3 degrees Celsius).According to the IMD's seven-day forecast for Santacruz, Friday and Saturday may see higher daytime temperatures that could rise to 39 degrees Celsius. The minimum reading is predicted to remain at least 21 degrees Celsius over the week. Mainly clear skies will prevail.Air quality on Thursday settled just short of the very poor category, with the air quality index (AQI) at 293, up from 208 on Wednesday, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The forecast for AQI for Friday is 259.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-days-into-march-mumbai-sizzles-at-38-degrees-celsius-101614881061427.html

In this case, he is not ready to provide details of the victim or her family. More importantly, the victim or her family has not made allegations so far,” the officer added.An unverified video of a man resembling the minister with an unnamed woman has gone viral with TV news channels in Karnataka playing the incident on loop. The social activist had claimed that the minister had sought sexual for favours from the victim.After the footage went viral, Ramesh Jarkihol resigned from the cabinet on Wednesday.The police’s inability to identify the woman in the sex tape involving Jarkiholi, could mean that he could be the fifth politician to get a clean-chit in a sex scandal in the state.In the last two decades, the state witnessed at least five politicians facing the heat over alleged sex tapes featuring them becoming public. While sex scandals have been instrumental in creating a controversy in the state, no political careers have been affected by them. Four politicians involved in such scandals before Jarkiholi got clean chits, continued in politics and returned to powerful positions.BJP legislator Arvind Limbavali (2019), HY Meti, then excise minister in the Congress government (2016), Hartal Halappa, a close aide of BS Yediyurappa (2010) and BJP MLA Renukachary (2007) had court controversy over leaked tapes. While in the case of Limbavali and HY Meti, the probe could not verify the authenticity of the tapes, Halappa was acquitted by a court in a sexual assault case. In the case of Renukacharya, the victim withdrew the complaint lodged against the legislator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complainant-fails-to-join-probe-against-karnataka-ex-minister-ramesh-jarkiholi-101614878403700.html

A smart city is about urban rejuvenation, governance, accountability, and ease of living,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The Union minister also hailed the smart cities project as one of the fastest implemented projects anywhere in the world. He, however, said, “there is some kind of perception deficit.” Also Read| Bengaluru, Shimla best cities to live: See top 10 in Ease of Living Index 2020Earlier in the day, the minister released the rankings under EoLI 2020 for cities with a population of more than a million and cities with less than a million people. A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020, the housing and urban affairs ministry said in a statement. Bengaluru ranked as the top performer followed by Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Surat, and Navi Mumbai. Coimbatore, Vadodara, Indore, and Greater Mumbai were next in line in the more than a million category. Of the 49 cities ranked on the liveability index in this category, Delhi figured at the 13th spot while Srinagar was ranked lowest.In the less than million category, Shimla was ranked the highest in ease of living, followed by Bhubaneswar, Silvassa, Kakinada, Salem, Vellore, Gandhinagar, Gurugram, Davanagere, and Tiruchirappalli.According to MPI 2020 ranking, municipalities with a population of over a million, Indore ranked the highest followed Surat and Bhopal. In the less than million category, New Delhi Municipal Council has emerged as the leader, followed by Tirupati and Gandhinagar. Puri earlier in the day said, “India’s steady economic growth is reflected in the rapid expansion of her cities.

Like all other essential services, media houses also remained open during the whole calamity," the press body said.It said that the Association has welcomed the "groundbreaking steps" of vaccinating all those who are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic".  "The Association took note and highly appreciated that for the first time the government has sanctioned ₹5 lakh each to the family members of journalists who died of COVID-19 during the pandemic all over the country," it said.During the meeting, the Press Association also urged the PIB to revive the railways concessions to the accredited journalists, which has been discontinued during the pandemic, and said that the journalists travel in trains while on professional duty.

ArcelorMittal, which is controlled by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, has previously tried to set up a steel plant in Odisha.It had to scrap that original plan for a 12 million-tonne-a-year steel plant after the company failed to acquire the requisite land for the facility and failed to secure approval for an iron ore mine that would provide raw materials.Other industrial ventures have struggled to take off due to bureaucratic delays that have undermined India's investment appeal and slowed growth in Asia's third-largest economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arcelormittal-nippon-steel-india-plans-6-88-billion-steel-plant-101614874796108.html
04-03-2021||India||SC suggests law to create more courts to clear pendency of cheque bounce cases||The Supreme Court on Thursday told the Centre that the backlog created by pendency of cheque bounce cases in the judicial system is “grotesque” and something must be done immediately to bring out a temporary law creating more courts or employ retired judges to handle the caseload.Dealing with a suo moto petition to expedite trial in cheque bounce cases arising out of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, a five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde felt that before introducing the law the Parliament ought to have done a judicial impact assessment.“The cases under Section 138 contribute to more than 30 per cent pendency in criminal cases before subordinate courts and High Courts….The backlog problem caused by Section 138 is grotesque. When this law was introduced an impact assessment was not made. Why can’t it be done now,” said the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna and S Ravindra Bhat.The apex court referred to Article 247 which clothes Parliament with the power to create additional courts for the better administration of laws. “We want you (Centre) to exercise your power (under Article 247). A temporary legislation can be made for creating additional courts or you may appoint retired judges,” the bench observed.On Wednesday, the Centre had submitted a note prepared by Department of Financial Services (DFS) which did not agree with the Court’s suggestion to create additional courts as a solution to curb high pendency of Section 138 cases. Instead, it argued that the backlog occurred due to delay in ensuring the presence of the accused for trial.The Court was not happy with the note. By an order, the Court sought the presence of the Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and observed, “Prima facie we are of the view that the aforesaid Article 247 (of Constitution of India) confers a power coupled with duty on the Union of India to establish additional courts, for better administration of laws made by Parliament. There is no doubt or dispute about the fact that matters under the N.I Act have posed what by now has become an intractable problem, accounting for close to 30 to 40 per cent of the pendency in the trial courts and a very high percentage in High Courts.”Mehta appeared on Thursday and agreed that the suggestions given by Court were welcome but would require wide-ranging consultations at the highest level. The Court posted the matter for hearing on March 10 giving time to Mehta to come back with a response.In October 2020, the Supreme Court received a preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar who delved deep into the issue and suggested systemic reforms in the judicial processes involved at the executive and judicial level. Setting up additional courts was one of the steps proposed for reforms. The Act prescribes a six-month deadline for completion of trial in Section 138 cases but such cases clog the judicial docket for more than three years, the amici curiae report suggested. The amici curiae suggested summary trial of cases, mediation and attachment of property to the extent of the cheque amount as other measures to expedite trial of cases under the N.I Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-suggests-law-to-create-more-courts-to-clear-pendency-of-cheque-bounce-cases-101614873835711.html

He claimed that there are more than 210 communities identified as SEBCs in Odisha.Pradhan said the state government should go ahead with the available data and implement the reservation for the SEBC in public employment and educational institutions.He said this is not a political issue, rather a mode of providing social justice and economic empowerment to a large population of people in the state.The Union minister also alleged that the state government has also not implemented the 10 per cent reservation for economically poor people belonging to the general category.Chairperson of OSCBC Raghunath Biswal on Monday held a meeting to assess the preparedness for undertaking the much- awaited survey. The final data of the survey is expected to be available on June 11, an official said.However, Odisha Law Minister Pratap Jena replied back asking the Union Minister as to who constituted the OBC commission in the state. "Please do not indulge in politics on the OBC reservation issue." Jena said.Senior BJD lawmaker S R Patnaik said the state government is committed to the welfare of the people under the OBC category. "The commission will soon start the survey and the findings will be known soon within 45 days. Let us wait for the completion of the survey," Patnaik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-has-data-on-number-of-people-under-obc-category-dharmendra-pradhan-101614870649967.html
04-03-2021||India||SII writes to PMO proposing reforms in drug regulatory system||The world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, Serum Institute of India, has written to the Prime Minister's Office proposing reforms in the existing drug regulatory system, including allowing manufacturing and stockpiling of non-Covid vaccines while undergoing clinical trial.In the letter, Prakash Kumar Singh, the Director of Government and Regulatory Affairs at the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) referred to the Health Ministry's May 18, 2020, gazette notification, saying it allowed manufacturing and stockpiling of Covid-19 vaccine under clinical trial for marketing authorization for sale or distribution."Because of this rule, it became possible for us to manufacture and stockpile the Covid-19 vaccine during the clinical trial and we could make the vaccine available in such a short span of time to protect millions of lives," he said in the letter dated March 2.By the end of 2020, SII has already produced around 50 million dosages of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine 'Covishield', even while it awaited the Drugs Controller General of India's (DCGI) nod for emergency use of its vaccine in the country.It got the nod in early January this year."In view of the successful result of this provision for Covid-19 vaccine, this provision should also be implemented for non-Covid-19 vaccines," Singh said.In the letter to the PMO, he also sought permission to use the remaining quantities of batches of Covid and non-Covid vaccines for commercial purpose which have been used in a clinical trial.In this context, he said the Health Ministry had issued draft rules dated April 12, 2018, to allow the remaining quantities of batches of vaccines which have been used in a clinical trial for commercial use after the grant of permission in Form 46 (now it is Form CT-23) and manufacturing licence in Form 28D."However, this draft rule has not been implemented till now. This draft rule should be implemented shortly to avoid wastage of life-saving vaccines," Singh pointed out.Singh also sought implementation of recommendations of a high-powered inter-ministerial committee for reforming the Drug Regulatory Systems in India.The letter stated that on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a high-powered inter-ministerial committee for reforming the Drug Regulatory Systems in India was constituted on May 11 last year under the chairmanship of then officer on special duty Rajesh Bhushan, who is presently the union health secretary."A series of meetings of this committee was held starting May 2020. Recommendations of this inter-ministerial committee should be implemented immediately in line with the ease of doing business" he said.Singh's letter highlighted a few other points also related to regulatory reforms and said, "We are putting forward the following points with relation to necessary regulatory reforms in the existing Drug Regulatory system for your kind reference and intervention, which will take the vaccine industry of our country to new heights in the world."Singh also lauded the prime minister's vision mentioning, "It is a matter of great pride for all of us that because of our Hon'ble Prime Minister's vision about the regulatory reforms, the vaccine industry of our country is growing very fast and under his global leadership, our country has proved that we are the world leader in vaccine sector."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-writes-to-pmo-proposing-reforms-in-drug-regulatory-system-101614869554266.html
04-03-2021||India||Military leaders will have to match political vision behind theaterisation: CDS||India’s military leadership will have to “more than match the political vision” that has mandated the creation of theatre commands to address future security threats, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat said on Thursday, while highlighting the need to stay prepared to counter threats from China and Pakistan, even as he stressed that the former seeks to “establish dominance” in the country’s neighbourhood and the Indian Ocean Region.Rawat said “service parochialism” will have to make way for “a combined services outlook” to take theaterisation forward, calling for the military’s transformation to “outthink and outfight” India’s adversaries.“It will not be easy and the transition to theatre commands will indeed be a challenging process. There is a need to create and propagate the narrative of strategic advantages that accrue at the national and armed forces levels (with theaterisation),” CDS said on the eve of a top commanders’ conference to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 6.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.The military is putting finishing touches to its theaterisation plan for the most advantageous utilisation of its resources to fight future wars, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May.Rawat said integrating operating concepts seeks to create the conditions to “outthink, outfight and outpace” India’s adversaries. He was speaking at a virtual event - Transformation: Imperatives for the Indian Armed Forces - organised by the Secunderabad-based College of Defence Management.“Such seminars are expected to generate ideas about evolving joint structures that will address voids at the strategic and operational levels that single-service commands at present fail to address,” Rawat said. He said the military currently has 17 single-service commands, none co-located with each other and with each of the three services discharging their operational and strategic roles in isolation -- "a marked lack of synergy in operations".The points raised by CDS are extremely relevant, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“We cannot continue with 17 individual commands while paying lip-service to integration and joint war fighting. The three services will have to look beyond their stovepipes and work with CDS to find the best model and optimum command and control arrangement for integrated commands that is suitable for India,” Hooda added.Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts - these will be rolled out by December 2022. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services.“Theatre commands will optimise resource utilisation and lead to savings that can be used for force modernisation,” Rawat said. The military is expected to make a presentation to the PM on the situation along the borders and progress made towards the creation of theatre commands at the Combined Commanders’ Conference being held at Kevadia in Gujarat on March 5-6.Rawat said the Indian armed forces face greater challenges than any other military in the world and India urgently needs to bring about structural reforms in higher defence and operational organisations.“Some important steps that we need to take include defining the national security strategy, higher defence strategic guidance, and structural reforms in higher defence and operational organisations.”Rawat also spoke about remodelling organisational structures to fight future battles.“The organisational structure for conventional wars or limited conflicts under nuclear overhang already exists. But it needs to be re-modelled, re-equipped and re-oriented to conduct joint battles in digitised battle space to have necessary flexibility for other types of operations,” he said.CDS said the main dimensions of the military’s transformation relate to doctrine, force structure, technology, sustenance and readiness. Referring to the border standoff in eastern Ladakh, he said, “We stood up to our belligerent neighbour on the northern borders and thwarted its nefarious design. Now, more than ever, military transformation is vital to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-leaders-will-have-to-match-political-vision-behind-theaterisation-cds-101614869810785.html

The SP chief cited last year’s US presidential elections, which happened on ballot paper, to claim that nobody trusts EVMs anymore."On EVMs, I still say that no one trusts them. Recently in the USA, the polls were conducted on ballot papers, and counting took several days. People trust only ballot papers, but this fight cannot be fought right now," he said at a press conference.Yadav also talked about the Bihar elections stating that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-Congress-Left grand alliance was going to win but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not let that happen, stating that things won’t work like that in UP where his party is confident of winning the elections with a huge majority."In UP, the situation will not be like Bihar assembly polls. In Bihar, the grand alliance government was going to be formed, but BJP did not let it happen. In UP, the BJP will taste defeat by a huge margin. The SP will win 350 seats (of a total 403 seats)," Yadav said at the press conference held in Jhansi.Yadav launched a similar attack against EVMs during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections citing news clippings on malfunctioning of EVMs. He alleged that EVMs were "malfunctioning or voting for the BJP" across the country, adding that poll officers are untrained to operate the machines.“EVMs across India malfunctioning or voting for the BJP. DMs say poll officials untrained to operate EVMs. 350+ being replaced. This is criminal negligence for a polling exercise that costs 50,000 crs,” Yadav had tweeted on April 23, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-abolish-evms-if-sp-comes-to-power-in-up-in-2022-says-akhilesh-yadav-101614868828639.html

However, the cities from West Bengal could not be incorporated due to data challenges,” the report stated.A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020.Even though this year’s report at least mentions the name of West Bengal while claiming that there was no data from the state and the report only carries a picture of a metro railway track, the previous reports of 2018 and 2019 didn’t even mention the name of Kolkata or West Bengal. No data was shared in 2018 and 2019 either.Among Indian cities with a population of over a million, the ease of living is the highest in Bengaluru, Pune and Ahmedabad. It was found to be the lowest in Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar. Shimla topped the category of cities with a population of less than million.Launched in 2018, the ranking has assumed importance over the years in shaping government policies and determining expenditure priorities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been emphasizing the ease of living along with the ease of doing business as a key policy priority.Calls to both the state urban development minister Firhad Hakim and the state urban development secretary Khalil Ahmed went unanswered. They didn’t respond to messages either.“This is not a path breaking or important survey. Hence the name of West Bengal not appearing in the survey is not a serious matter. The government may not have the time to send data,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.This is, however, not the first time that the name of West Bengal has surfaced for not sharing data with the Centre. The National Crime Record Bureau report released on September 30, 2020 said that West Bengal did not send the data to NCRB within the deadline.“Due to non-receipt of data from the state of West Bengal and Kolkata city in time for the year 2019, data furnished for the year 2018 has been used to arrive at national and city-wise figures,” the NCRB report had said.While a tussle has been going on between the BJP–led Union government and TMC-led state government, Union ministers, including Amit Shah, had on several occasions during election campaign attacked the TMC-led government in the state for not sharing data of farmers for the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi which would have allowed farmers in West Bengal to receive financial aid from the Centre.The TMC had, however, brushed aside the allegations saying that the Centre was not sending the names of farmers as a result of which data could not be shared.“We are fortunate that the TMC hasn’t claimed so far that West Bengal tops the list of ease of living. I am sure that with elections approaching they will do it any day, claiming that ease of living is highest in West Bengal. The Mamata Banerjee administration didn’t send any data to NCRB because it knew that law and order has deteriorated, and violence has shot up. It hasn’t sent any data to for ease of living index because the state government knows that it would come last,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.Earlier in May 2020, an inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) sent to assess West Bengal’s response to Covid-19 had alleged discrepancies in the data provided by the state, pointed to its high mortality rate, and questioned the state government’s claim of having surveyed five million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lack-of-data-makes-bengal-lone-state-which-didn-t-appear-in-ease-of-living-index-101614863297174.html

In the brief letter, Midhun Shah, who is also the state co-coordinator of the Kerala State Youth Commission, pointed out that the model code of conduct was already in force in the southern state, where Assembly election is scheduled on April 6. "The certificate, issued for receiving the free Covid-19 vaccine in the state, carries photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and excerpts of his speech. As it may influence the election procedure, I request you to take necessary steps to remove it," he said. Shah later said that the complaint was lodged based on the provisional certificate which he got after receiving the shot at a vaccination centre here this morning. "As the state-coordinator of the Youth Commission, I received the first dose of the vaccine this morning. I was surprised to see the Prime Minister's colour photo and wordings in it. I feel it is a violation of model code of conduct and so approached the EC seeking its removal," he told PTI. The EC had on Wednesday directed all petrol outlets and other agencies to remove hoardings advertising central government schemes and carrying images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from the premises within 72 hours, citing violation of the model code of conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-petitioned-to-remove-pm-s-photo-from-covid-19-vaccine-certificate-101614867756234.html

If the law will be presented with a specific term like ‘love jihad,’ then we will discuss it,” Chautala, the deputy chief minister of the northern state, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.If the law will be to check on forceful religious conversions, our party will definitely support it.

Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Punjab government, said criminal proceedings against Ansari have been going on the Uttar Pradesh for 15 years and the present writ petition of Uttar Pradesh is "not maintainable".Dave told the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy that Ansari is unwell and central government-run PGI Chandigarh has been giving medical certificates to him from time to time. He added that response of Punjab government has been based on medical records.He said that this matter is of very serious nature and would open the Pandora's Box if the plea of Uttar Pradesh is allowed as this would lead to a situation in future, when states would come to the apex court against each other.Ansari's lawyer Mukul Rohatgi said UP government has no "fundamental right" to seek Ansari's transfer from Ropar prison to a district jail in Banda.Rohatgi said that because of his political affiliation to a party in opposition, he is being targeted.“My co-accused in a case was encountered. Uttar Pradesh has an axe to grind against Punjab and the court should not allow its shoulders to be used to fire a gun. This should not be allowed,” Rohatgi said.The lawyer also said that Ansari has been appearing in all courts through video conferencing so the arguments that trials are being stalled are "bogus".Rohatgi also sought transfer of cases outside Uttar Pradesh citing political vendetta.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Uttar Pradesh government, said that the court can order Ansari's transfer to Banda jail under Article 142 as around 14 and 15 cases are at final stages.Mehta also said that Ansari has flouted the jail manual rules and right of the victim and the state at large cannot be overlooked and the accused cannot be allowed to jettison the fair trial.Ansari is lodged in district jail Ropar in Punjab in connection with an alleged extortion case since January 2019. He is also accused in several cases of heinous crimes lodged in Uttar Pradesh. He is a sitting member of the UP Legislative Assembly and has 10 cases ranging from murder, extortion, cheating and fraud to those under the Gangster Act against him in the state.During earlier hearing, the Uttar Pradesh government told the apex court that the Punjab government is "shamelessly" protecting Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-opposes-up-govt-plea-in-sc-seeking-mukhtar-ansari-s-transfer-101614866148148.html

It also wanted the EC to direct the police to register an FIR against him for "inciting the youth to another freedom struggle."BJP state in-charge, election liaison committee, V Balachandran, alleged that Gandhi's campaign in St.Joseph's Matric Higher Secondary School in Mulagumoodu in Kanyakumari district on March 1 was akin to an election campaign in school premises.In a memorandum submitted to chief electoral officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo on Thursday he said Gandhi's political campaign in the educational institution violated provisions of the model code of conduct for which strict action including "prohibitory orders for his poll campaign in Tamil Nadu is required." Further, the Congress leader committed offences under sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 124 A (sedition) of the IPC for his remarks that India now needs another freedom struggle, it said.Quoting Rahul Gandhi during his interaction with students, the memorandum said, "the Congress leaders comparison of the current situation with that of pre-Independence during the British rule and inciting the youth for another freedom struggle has been made with the intent to cause hatred, contempt and excite disaffection towards the government established by laws."While answering a question, Gandhi had replied, "there is lot of anger being spread in the country, lot of fear, and that is what we have to fight.We have to fight the division, anger, fear and once again make India happy, comfortable, fearless and united," it said.His statement violates sections 124 A of the IPC, Balachandran claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restrain-rahul-gandhi-from-campaigning-in-tamil-nadu-bjp-plea-to-eci-101614864996629.html

04-03-2021||India||'Discriminatory': Goa in Supreme Court on mining leases renewal cancellation||Goa not getting the benefit of second renewal in mining leases when other states have the same advantage will amount to discrimination, the coastal state has told the Supreme Court. The mining industry in the state came to a standstill in March 2018, after the top court quashed the second renewal of 88 iron ore mining leases.“There are second renewals granted although they were not renewed for a number of years. As far as the state of Goa is concerned, the benefit of 2nd renewal, which is available and granted to the rest of the country, is denied. This would amount to discrimination and a judgment of the court cannot be interpreted to give such absurd and unequal treatment to different states under the same law,” said the Goa government seeking review of the Supreme Court order.The state government has told the apex court that its mining leases are eligible for renewal till 2037. The mining leaseholders have also claimed that leases in Goa were eligible for a ‘second renewal’, an opportunity they claim they were not provided.In a February 2018 order, the top court cancelled 88 active mining leases in Goa that were 'hurriedly' issued and reiterated that the leases had 'expired' in 2007 and if mining is to restart, fresh leases need to be issued. It dealt a blow to mining as the grant of fresh leases now needs to be done via auction, something that the state government and Goa's mining leaseholders are reluctant to agree to.Mining leases in Goa granted by the erstwhile Portuguese regime were converted to leases under the MMDR Act via the Goa Daman and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Conversion Leases) Act, 1987 with effect from 1961, the year Goa was made part of India.The period from 1961 onwards was considered the grant of the lease whereas the period from 1987 was considered the ‘first renewal’ which was valid till 2007. Goa’s mining leaseholders applied for ‘second renewals’ in 2007 but the State government didn’t act on the applications instead allowing the leases to continue to operate on a ‘deemed extension’ basis which the Supreme Court in 2014 declared as illegal. The Supreme Court ruled that since the Goa government didn’t renew the leases in 2007 they were now ‘dead’ and were not eligible for belated renewals and instead fresh leases would have to be granted.Parallely, the state government has also claimed that the law as amended in 2015 provides that all active leases granted before the commencement of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 shall be deemed to have been granted for a period of fifty years. This, they say, would mean Goa’s mining leases which were converted to leases in 1987 should be “deemed to have been granted for a period of 50 years” which makes them valid till 2037.The mining Industry has been one of the major sources of revenue generation for the state and also a source of employment generation, the Goa government said.“More than 17% of the population of the state of Goa is directly or indirectly dependent on the mining industry... Direct revenue loss to the state is estimated to the extent of minimum ₹600 crore on an annual basis. The loss of income, employment and closure of other forms of peripheral economy which thrive on mining activity cannot be quantified at this stage, but can be expected to be annually in the range of Rs. 240 Crore,” the state government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discriminatory-goa-in-supreme-court-on-mining-leases-renewal-cancellation-101614862402389.html

It is for the first time that Kinnars are participating in the mahakumbh at Haridwar.Earlier, the transgender seers were not allowed to take part in royal procession or royal baths. This year's fair is setting a new precedent giving transgender seers an opportunity to take part in Kumbh rituals. They had participated in Ardh Kumbh at Prayagraj in 2019.A large number of transgender Akhada seers are arriving in Haridwar these days amid grand reception.Mahamandaleshwar Tina Maa said permission by Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada, one of the biggest akhadas, to allow Kinnar seers to take part in Peshwayi and subsequently next month in the sacred Ganga dip ritual along with them will shine a global spotlight on them.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, the highest pontiff of Kinnar Akhada, said that with changing times societal norms are also changing and so is the mass acceptability of transgenders.“Kinnars have centuries old tradition of being guardians of art and culture; we have been associated for thousands of years with society customs, traditions, rituals and history. Now, Mahakumbh fair is providing us global identity, respect and recognition. Transgenders are now taking up education and the government should provide us with more amenities. Transgender community also needs to explore avenues in politics,” said Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Laxmi Narayan, who is a trained Bharatnatyam danseuse also.Welcoming the Kinnar seers, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, said that its Sanatan Dharma which involves, imbibes and respects all sections of the society."We had pledged that Kinnar Akhada will take holy Ganga dip along with Juna Akhada seers and finally the time has come. Grand welcome to Kinnar seers in Peshwayi has proven that they are an integral part of our society,” said Mahant Hari Giri, associated with Juna Akhada.Eminent religious scholar Dr Pradeep Joshi said participation of transgenders in this Kumbh has shown the world that they too are religious, have culture, moral values, spiritual awakening, quest for enlightenment and wisdom.Notably, though there are 13 prominent akhadas that come under umbrella of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, Kinnar Akhada as a separate sub-entity of Juna Akhada was allowed by Akhada Parishad to carry out royal procession and take holy dip at Sangam-confluence of Ganga-Jamuna-Saraswati in Ardh Kumbh Prayagraj (Allahabad) two years ago.Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad national president Mahant Narendra Giri clarified that initially prior to Prayagraj Kumbh there were objections from some quarter within Akhada Parishad but as Kinnar Akhada had made a written agreement in prior to duly follow traditions and customs of Akhada, their inclusion has been granted by the Akhada Parishad.He added that Kinnar Akhada was not given separate Akhada identity or as 14th Akhada, they have been merged with Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transgender-seers-participate-in-mahakumbh-at-haridwar-for-first-time-101614861963261.html
04-03-2021||India||'Not utilising fully': Delhi high court asks Centre to explain control on who gets Covid-19 vaccine||The Delhi High Court Thursday asked the Centre to explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated against Covid-19 currently as under the present system those above the age of 60 years or with comorbidities can receive vaccination.The high court said the two institutes which have developed the vaccines Covishield and Covaxin -- Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech -- have more capacity to provide the vaccines but it seems that their full capacity is not being exploited."We are not utilising it fully. We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to them and are not vaccinating our own people. So there has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency," a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The high court directed the two institutes to file separate affidavits on their capacity to manufacture the vaccines on per day/ week/ month basis and also the current optic of the vaccines and how much unused capacity is lying.They also have to indicate if they can scale up their production capacities, it said.“Union of India (UoI) shall file an affidavit disclosing the capacity to transport the vaccines while maintaining the whole chain particularly to the NCT of Delhi. The Union of India shall also indicate the extent to which it is presently being used,” the high court said.“The UoI shall explain the rationale behind keeping strict control over class of persons who can be vaccinated as noticed in our last order. Under the present system, persons above 60 years of age and between 45 to 60 years with co-morbidities can receive vaccination.“An affidavit to be filed by the UoI disclosing the rationale for such classification,” it said.It also asked the Delhi government to carry out inspection of medical facilities available in court complexes here and to report if Covid-19 vaccination centres could be set up there and also the short comings in facilities.The high court asked all the authorities to file their affidavits by March 9 and listed the matter for further hearing on March 10.The high court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to examine the demand of Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers as “frontline workers” so that they could receive Covid-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.It also asked the Delhi High Court Bar Association and BCD to disclose the strength of members registered with them to get an idea of number of people to be vaccinated in the judicial system in the national capital.During the hearing, the counsel for Bharat Biotech sought to know the target audience for vaccination and whether the ambit was entire judiciary.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma and advocate Anil Soni, representing the Centre, informed the court that selection of class of people for vaccination was a policy decision which was taken by an expert body.Sharma informed the high court that a similar petition is pending before the Supreme Court and will come up for hearing on Monday.To this, the bench said the issue here is to find out if the whole judicial system, including judges, lawyers and court staff, can be prioritised without age and co-morbidities limitation.On Wednesday, the high court had taken suo motu cognisance and initiated on its own a public interest litigation on the basis of a communication received from the BCD.It had said there is a clear pattern emerging that the number of Covid-19 positive cases increases with greater intermingling and congregation of people.It had said premises and court rooms of the high court, which is scheduled to resume physical functioning from March 15, and some of the district courts are air-conditioned and with increased footfall, there is likelihood of the rate of infection amongst those who attend the courts spiking, once the full-fledged physical functioning of courts in Delhi resumes.It had noted that in the first round, frontline workers, particularly of the medical community were covered, and others such as the police force have already been covered.The court had referred to a communication sent to the chief justice by BCD Chairman Ramesh Gupta requesting that appropriate directions be issued to the concerned authorities to make available necessary infrastructure in court premises, particularly in dispensaries for vaccinating the members of the judicial system by treating them as frontline workers.The bench had said that the need of the hour is to vaccinate the masses, in view of the raging pandemic, on a war footing so as to secure the life and health of all those who step out of their homes to attend to their avocations and professions.It had added that since the cases listed on any given day are mostly different from those listed on the previous or the next day, the litigants are also different and this peculiarity exposes the judges, court staff and the lawyers to the risk of contracting the disease.The bench had observed that the comorbidities enlisted by the government to accommodate people of 45 to 60 years age are serious conditions from which the judges, staff and advocates may or may not be suffering with but this does not mean that the risk of their contracting the disease and suffering serious health issues, including fatality, does not exist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-utilising-fully-delhi-high-court-asks-centre-to-explain-control-on-who-gets-covid-19-vaccine-101614860885852.html

04-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index 2020: Srinagar at bottom of list of 49 cities||Once known for its gardens and clean water bodies, Srinagar has been placed at the bottom of the list in the Ease of Living Index 2020 among 49 cities with a million-plus population.The Ease of Living Index 2020 was released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on Thursday.“The Ease of Living Index (EoLI) is an assessment tool that evaluates the quality of life and the impact of various initiatives for urban development. It provides a comprehensive understanding of participating cities across India based on quality of life, economic-ability of a city, and its sustainability and resilience,” the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs said in a press release.Srinagar’s officers, however, say many projects are underway which could improve the city’s ranking later.Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said that many projects under the smart city project have been taken up which will restore the beauty of the city."The work has already started on various fronts and the projects. Also some parameters on which we worked have not been included in this survey which could have improved our rankings, " he said.While Bangalore has been ranked top among cities with population of more than a million followed by Pune and Ahmedabad Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar are ranked as the bottom three."Unfortunately political unrest and red tapism is one of the reasons for being at the bottom. Besides, policy makers are not among the people who can understand the needs and requirements of local people. So implementation of right policy for the right place keeping the demographics into consideration will help in improving the ease of living standards," said Dr. Umar Nazir Tibet Baqal, a prominent businessman of the city.Former SMC Commissioner, Dr Shafqat Khan said there has been mass lawlessness after the eruption of militancy in the 1990s and large scale violations of the Master Plan in the city."Unplanned urbanisation of Srinagar is a huge setback in land use issues. The other criteria are being taken up now in the Smart city and other central schemes of the Government of India and are now being taken aggressively by the LG Administration."The 15 evaluation criteria included in the ranking are governance, identity and culture, education, health, safety and security, economy, affordable housing, land use planning, public open spaces, transportation and mobility, assured water supply, waste-water management, solid waste management, power, and quality of environment."Unfortunately Srinagar is prone to water logging, flooding seems a permanent phenomenon and there is terrible civil sense among the people. Vehicle parking, shopping and recreational activities are missing here due to which the pressure is mounting on whatever space is available within the city. Hydrological system and solid waste management in the city are inadequate. The breathing space we had in the form of lakes and water bodies, grasslands and green cover is shrinking rapidly. Even the Zabarwan mountains have taken a huge hit and the flood basin of river Jhelum is over and there is hardly anything left to reclaim," said Jaleel Jeelani, an environmental filmmaker.Many people, however, say the survey has revealed the truth about the top city of J&K."The placing of Srinagar at the bottom completely contradicts the projection of Srinagar as a smart city by the officials. Irrespective of the officials’ claims, every common resident here knows that the city lacks even the basic parameters of proper roads, water and electricity. Conflict has often been used as an excuse by the authorities for unplanned development in the city but what is preventing now to plan systematically. We still see officials rushing to spend the money in the last month of the financial year while the same money is kept idle for 11 months," said Gowhar Ahmad who works with an NGO."We still lack proper parking spaces. Electricity and water supply are pathetic. New colonies are being established but why aren't officials using modern techniques to lay electric cables there? In terms of pollution we are still seeing 30-year-old vehicles running on the roads. What worse blunders can there be than open drains still emptying in Jhelum and the Dal,” Ahmad said.Srinagar’s mayor Junaid Mattu could not be contacted for comments on Srinagar ranking at the bottom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-living-index-2020-srinagar-at-bottom-of-list-of-49-cities-101614859429981.html

Since majority of the states such as Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Assam have more opposition MPs, they may find it difficult to campaign in these states, where polls are scheduled to held from March 27 to April 6. Noting that the party will seek rescheduling of the session on the first day itself, Yechury said main policies related to the budget or economy can be passed and other topics can be taken up in the next session, so that MPs can campaign in their states. As polls in West Bengal will be conducted in eight phases, the leaders will have enough time for campaigning, he told reporters here. On the election scenario, Yechury alleged that the Narendra Modi-led government has completely destroyed the foundation of Constitution and federal structure and almost all the sectors like industry, education were destroyed by its wrong policies. Accusing the Centre of formulating policies to further 'enrich' the cronies and friends of the PM, the left party leader said even the MSME sector, generating largest employment next to agriculture, was totally neglected. Alleging that the government was targetting voices of dissent by booking them under UAPA and filing sedition cases, he said the Supreme Court has finally ruled that dissenting was not sedition. However, there are many such sedition cases to be disposed of, he added. Yechury slammed the ruling AIADMK for supporting every single measure taken by the BJP led NDA government at the Centre, including the farm bills. "This is not acceptable. That is why CPI(M) is today taking all measures against these parties. We are working to ensure the defeat of BJP-AIADMK alliance in Tamil Nadu. We will cooperate with all the forces to achieve the goal," he said.Replying to a query whether the BJP was behind the decision of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's aide V K Sasikala to quit politics, he said, "The BJP has supported and it is quite obvious." Politburo members G Ramakrishnan who was also present said the seat-sharing deal with DMK will be finalised in another two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-to-seek-rescheduling-of-parliament-budget-session-due-to-assembly-polls-101614858942904.html

"Prima facie it seems that he is mentally unstable and is probably under treatment. We are probing why he made such a call. The Taj Mahal was reopened for visitors after about an hour and 45 minutes," he told PTI. The man, who hails from Kasganj, is living at his maternal grandmother's house in a Firozabad village, according to the police.After the threat call to 112 emergency response number of the Uttar Pradesh police at around 9am, nearly 1000 tourists were evacuated from the monument in Agra. Singh had claimed that the bomb placed at the Taj Mahal could go off at any moment.Security personnel soon took over the complex and later declared it safe for visitors after they carried out extensive search and screening operations and could not locate any explosives, officials said. Tourists were told that the Taj Mahal was being closed because of a VVIP visit to prevent panic and after their exit both eastern and western gates of the 17th-century monument were closed, said Ganesh. “Nothing objectionable was found inside the Taj Mahal premises in the search by field unit and thus the call about a bomb threat in Taj Mahal was deemed to be a hoax call,” he said.The monument, which is conserved by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and protected by the personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), was reopened to visitors at 11.15am, officials added.Officials told HT, on the condition of anonymity, that the caller alleged anomalies in the conduct of an ongoing army recruitment camp in Agra, which he claimed had led to his rejection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-detained-for-taj-mahal-hoax-bomb-call-seems-mentally-unstable-police-101614857011822.html

This categorisation was brought in the backdrop of these platforms coming under fire for broadcasting content that was seen as obscene and hurting the country’s religious sentiments on multiple occasions.Had a fruitful meeting with representatives from OTT industry and explained the provisions of the OTT rules.

04-03-2021||India||Defiant Kerala govt says KIIFB officials won’t appear for questioning by ED||A defiant Kerala government on Thursday made it clear that officials of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) will not appear for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a case registered under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).“Nobody can brow beat us like this. Our officials won’t appear before the ED because we met all norms. If it persists, we will organize a mass movement against these agencies that only toe their master’s line,” said finance minister Thomas Isaac, who is the brain behind KIIFB and its funding through masala bondsIsaac also attributed political motive to the ED’s notice ahead of the April 6 assembly election.“The ED top official in Kochi is the son of a senior BJP leader in Rajasthan and he was specially brought to Kerala to trouble the government,” he said.Isaac also said the timing of the ED’s notice was deliberate while the masala bonds were floated two years ago.The Left Front government is particularly riled that the ED notice came just two day after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman’s public meeting in Ernakulam in which she criticised the constitution of KIIFB and its budgetary provisions. “I don’t know what this organization is. All money is going to it. We also present budgets, but we never give all money to a body and say ‘we will see’. It seems quite weird,” she had said.The ED had sent notices to KIIFB CEO K M Abraham, also a retired additional chief secretary, officials of the Axis Bank (banking partner) and others to appear before it on Friday in connection with a case registered under the FEMA. The central agency said by raising external funds through ‘masala bonds’ KIFFB had violated FEMA provisions.On Wednesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to the Election Commission saying the latest action was a violation of the poll code of conduct. Kerala will vote on April 6 in the assembly election.The CM in his letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunl Arora said the ED was acting at the behest of the Union finance minister and her statement during recent visit proved it. He sought the intervention of the EC as it was a clear violation of the poll code.KIIFB and masala bondsThe KIIFB is a special purpose vehicle floated in 1999 on the lines of a corporate body for infrastructural development of the state. All development works in major sectors like education, health care, roads and bridges, power and water supply are being carried out through KIIFB. It was floated basically to cut red tape, fix responsibility and ensure better quality in works.After the 2018 floods that ravaged the state, the fund-starved government had decided to tap ‘masala bonds’ which are specialised debt instruments issued outside the country in Indian rupee denomination. In 2019 KIIFB had listed masala bonds worth ₹2150 crore with 9 per cent interest for five-year tenure in London Stock Exchange. KIIFB became the first sub-sovereign entity to tap these bonds and the CM and his officials attended the bell ringing ceremony in the UK with much fanfare. The fund raised through masala bonds was used for several ongoing projects.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was the first to question ‘masala bonds’ saying interest rate was quite high and it could result in loss to the exchequer. It also questioned whether the state government can undertake an external borrowing. Under Article 293 (1), the state can borrow within the territory of India but cannot raise any external loan without the consent of the government, it said. The ED had registered the case on similar ground.But advocates of KIIFB said it was registered as a company under the Companies Act of India and it can raise funds for key infrastructural works. They also cited that permission was obtained from the Reserve Bank of India.“Basically these people have no idea about KIIFB. They have mistaken it for an NBFC (non-banking financial companies). We have taken all necessary permissions,” said Isaac. He said it was weird to think that money sourced by a body corporate should be counted as a borrowing of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defiant-kerala-govt-says-kiifb-officials-won-t-appear-for-questioning-by-ed-101614854746106.html

For us, it was important that we are partnering with you in your health and economic recovery. The largest number of vaccines shipped by India to any foreign country so far - nine million - has been to Bangladesh,” Jaishankhar said during his day-long visit to Dhaka, according to news agency ANI. After meeting his Bangladesh counterpart AK Abdul Momen, the foreign minister tweeted that the two held comprehensive discussions on bilateral ties. “Noted our steady progress, even during COVID. Shared my thoughts on the relationship & its prospects with the press,” he added. Jaishankar also pushed for 'no crime no death border' objective over the issue of killings along the border with Bangladesh. “Many of the deaths are fairly deep inside India. We discussed it as neighbours and friends and agreed that our objective should be 'no crime no death border'. If we can get it right, we can address the problem effectively,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. The external affairs minister also discussed the issue of the Teesta river and said that the two nations’ water resources secretaries will meet soon over it, according to ANI. He asserted that India’s position on the issue has not changed. Jaishankar is in Bangladesh to prep for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the neighbouring country later this month. The Prime Minister will visit Bangladesh to participate in celebrations on March 26 marking 50 years of the country’s independence and the establishment of diplomatic relations. This will be his first foreign visit since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. His earlier trip to Bangladesh in March last year was cancelled due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-dhaka-jaishankar-stresses-india-s-help-during-coronavirus-pandemic-101614854271331.html

The day seeks to increase awareness about all guidelines, which includes road safety, workplace safety, the safety of human health as well as the environment. This year, the focus of National Safety Day is on road safety and the theme is ‘Sadak Suraksha’ (road safety). The celebrations this year have also been spread over a week and National Safety Week will be observed from March 4 to March 10, in order to highlight the importance of safety on the roads.History of National Safety DayThe Union ministry of labour and employment organised a conference on industrial safety for the first time from December 11 to 13, 1965. During the conference, a need was felt for safety councils on national and state levels and a proposal for a National Safety Council was then accepted in the 24th session of the standing labour committee. The campaign for the National Safety Day was born half a decade later, on March 4, 1972, to mark the National Safety Council’s day of formation.The National Safety Council is a non-profit, self-financing and tripartite apex body set up to generate, develop and sustain a voluntary movement on safety, health and environment at the national level.Road safety in IndiaData from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that 421,104 accidental human deaths occurred in the year 2019 out of which traffic accidents alone were 467,171 in number.Last month, while inaugurating the Road Safety Month, Union road, transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said that the government is working on its promise to ensure road safety and reduce accidental deaths as well. "We had promised to reduce road fatalities by 50 per cent. Tamil Nadu has done it, with a success rate of 53 per cent. If we wait till 2030, 6-7 lakh more people will die. So, we've made a commitment that before 2025, road accidents and deaths due to it will be brought down by 50 per cent with help of people's participation," Gadkari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-safety-day-2021-sadak-suraksha-theme-to-be-observed-this-year-101614852959414.html

The series premiered on Amazon Prime on January 15 and Purohit has been named in multiple FIRs over controversies around it.Also Read: Some OTT platforms showing pornographic content, observes SCAppearing for Purohit, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said that the cases against her are "shocking". He further said that Purohit is just an employee of Amazon; she is neither a producer nor an actor. Rohatgi said that Purohit has been made accused in around 10 cases related to 'Tandav'.The lawyer contended that OTT regulations have come and the Allahabad high court order was not based on these regulations. "It's about freedom of speech and expression," he added. Rohatgi also said that 'Tandav' is not available for free, it can be only watched by payment. He called those who has filed the FIRs as "publicity seekers".The Supreme Court bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy then asked the Centre to present before it the regulations put in place by the government on Over The Top (OTT) platforms and adjourned the hearing till Friday.Purohit was denied pre-arrest bail by the high court on February 25 in the ongoing investigation against 'Tandav' in connection with hurting religious sentiments and objectionable content. Dismissing her petition, the high court highlighted the offensive language used in the web series and said Purohit has scant respect for law and order.The Uttar Pradesh Police filed an FIR against the top Amazon Prime Video executive, and the actors and makers of the web series for the derogatory depiction of Hindu deities and promoting religious enmity."Such people make the revered figures of the religion of majority community the source of earning money in a most brazen manner taking benefit of the liberal and tolerant tradition of the country," the high court said.On January 27, the Supreme Court refused to grant interim protection from arrest to actors and makers of 'Tandav' and asked them to approach high courts for relief from arrest or quashing of FIRs.'Tandav', a nine-episode web series, premiered on Amazo Prime Video on January 15.

We are either donating it to foreign countries or selling it to foreign countries and are not vaccinating our own people. So there has to be that sense of responsibility and urgency," the bench said.It also asked the Delhi government to carry out inspection of medical facilities available in court complexes here and to report if COVID-19 vaccination centres could be set up there.The high court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to examine the demand of Bar Council of Delhi to declare all people associated with the judicial functioning, including judges, court staff and lawyers as “frontline workers” so that they could receive COVID-19 vaccination on priority and without limitations of their age or physical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-seeks-details-on-capacity-to-manufacture-covid-19-vaccines-101614848436514.html
04-03-2021||India||India proposes inclusion of Chabahar port in international north-south corridor||India on Thursday proposed the inclusion of Iran’s Chabahar port in the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a 7,200km multi-mode route spanning 13 countries, and also called for Uzbekistan and Afghanistan to be made part of the corridor. Chabahar port, where an Indian state-run firm operates a terminal, is a key part of India’s plans to enhance connectivity to Afghanistan and the Central Asian states. The port played an important role in shipping humanitarian aid to Afghanistan amid the Covid-19 pandemic and India recently supplied heavy cranes to boost its capabilities. Addressing the virtual “Chabahar Day” event organised on the margins of the Maritime India Summit 2021, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya spoke about plans to include the Iranian port in INSTC. Also Read | EAM Jaishankar to travel to Bangladesh tomorrow to prepare for PM Modi’s visitJaishankar welcomed the interest shown by Uzbekistan and Afghanistan in joining the multilateral corridor and said: “Establishing an eastern corridor through Afghanistan would maximise its potential.” He added, “I am hopeful that during the INSTC coordination council meeting, member states would agree to the expansion of the INSTC route to include the Chabahar port and also agree on expanding the membership of this project.” Mandaviya proposed the meeting of the INSTC coordination council meeting, which was to be held last year but was put off because of the pandemic, should be held virtually to take things forward. “Chabahar port is part of our shared commitment to the peace, stability and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan,” Mandaviya said, adding the port had helped Afghanistan diversity its export opportunities. The INSTC project, which includes India, Iran, Russia, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz republic, Tajikistan, Oman, Syria and Ukraine, was first proposed in 2000 to cut costs and time in moving cargo and to improve connectivity in the region between Russia and the Central Asian states and India. Though there were dry runs on some routes in 2014, the project has been slow to take off. Despite renewed focus on INSTC by India and Russia, work was again hit by the pandemic. Jaishankar highlighted Chabahar’s role in recent years in sending Indian humanitarian aid and emergency supplies to Afghanistan and Iran and in opening up trade opportunities. The Chabahar Day event reflects India’s commitment to work with regional stakeholders to enhance connectivity and provide unhindered access to the sea to the landlocked Central Asian states, he said. “The Chabahar port has not only emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region but also facilitated the delivery of humanitarian assistance, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic...India utilised the Chabahar port to ship 75,000 tonnes of wheat as humanitarian food assistance to Afghanistan in September 2020,” he said. India helped Iran to fight the worst locust invasion of the past 25 years by supplying 25 tonnes of the drug Malathion in June 2020 through Chabahar. The second batch of 25 tonnes of Malathion recently reached Chabahar, he added. Afghanistan, Iran and India signed a tripartite agreement on developing Chabahar port and setting up a trilateral transport and transit corridor in 2016. India then set up India Ports Global Limited to operate the Shahid Behesti terminal at Chabahar. Since the Indian firm began operations in December 2018, the port has handled 123 vessels, 13,752 containers and 1.8 million tonnes of cargo, Mandaviya said. There has also been an increase in the average monthly calls by merchant vessels, and 110,000 tonnes of wheat and 2,000 tonnes of pulses have been shipped to Afghanistan. Iran’s transport minister Mohammad Eslami called for more lines of credit from India to build and equip Chabahar port and to complete infrastructure for transport networks in the region. There are plans to expand the Shahid Behesti terminal’s capacity from 8.5 million tonnes to 13 million tonnes, he said. Ministers from Afghanistan, Armenia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia participated in the Chabahar Day event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-proposes-inclusion-of-chabahar-port-in-international-north-south-corridor-101614848496070.html

04-03-2021||India||Supreme Court rejects plea requesting extension of GST amnesty scheme||The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to issue directives on extending the Goods and Services Tax (GST) amnesty scheme, saying it was “a policy decision exclusively within the domain of the government”.A Supreme Court bench comprising justices Dhananjaya Y Chadrachud and MR Shah dismissed a petition by a trader from Chhattisgarh’s Bilaspur who had urged the court to direct the Central government and the GST council to extend the amnesty scheme, giving more time to small businesses and MSMEs to file their returns.The petition by Satyakam Arya had assailed the notification issued by the GST council on June 24, 2020 which had given time till September 30, 2020 for filing of returns between July 2017 and July 2020, capping the late fee at ₹500. For any subsequent delay, a late fee of ₹50 per day had been prescribed as penalty. It asked for an extension of the scheme by two months, besides reimbursement of the late fee already collected.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavyBut the bench said in its order:“In our view, these reliefs, as sought in the petition, pertain in the realm of policy decisions. It would be inappropriate for this court to entertain a petition of this nature, such as extension of the amnesty scheme; a cap on the late fee to be collected; exemption of late fee paid for a period between March 25, 2020 and June 30, 2020 and refund of the amount already collected towards late fee.”The court emphasised that the amnesty scheme was itself a “policy intervention” by the government of India and that “the terms on which the amnesty scheme was executed in the realm of a policy decision.”The petition, filed through advocate Aviral Saxena, had argued that small traders had not been able to avail of these schemes because they neither had the infrastructure like big business houses nor had they the liberty to step out and do the needful because of the lockdown last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The bench, however, remained disinclined to examine the matter. “The question is entirely of policy. How can a court interfere with this under Article 32 (writ jurisdiction)? These are even otherwise concessions granted as per a policy decision. These are not matters of rights. We cannot issue a mandamus to the government in an amnesty scheme,” it told the lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-rejects-plea-requesting-extension-of-gst-amnesty-scheme-101614846335700.html

The petition is yet to be listed before the court.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavyThe NGO has approached the court through advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging the decision taken by the Centre on February 3, 2021 to appoint Pravin Sinhas as an interim or acting director till the appointment of a new director or until further orders. This order was required as the two-year term of CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla came to an end on February 2. He was appointed by an order issued by the Department of Personnel and Training on February 2, 2019 for a two-year tenure, after the approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet.The petition said, “The director of the CBI is the final authority in the organisation. He supervises all the work in the CBI and is responsible for constitution of investigating teams for probing cases. Hence, this court and later even Parliament have made determined efforts to enhance the functional autonomy of the CBI director and limit the extent of executive discretion in the matter of appointment of this key functionary.”Bhushan, who drafted the petition, said that Section 4A of the DSPE Act provides for a high-powered committee headed by Prime Minister and comprising the leader of single largest Opposition Party and the Chief Justice of India (or any judge of the Supreme Court nominated by CJI) to recommend the name of the CBI director. This process was not followed by the Centre as the work on appointment of the new director ought to have begun two months before the previous director retired last month.The same NGO had approached the Supreme Court in the year 2016 for the appointment of a regular director of CBI after the government had attempted to appoint an interim director. “Now the same issue has cropped up again, which has to be dealt with utmost seriousness in view of the sheer power that vests with the important office of a CBI director,” the petition stated.Since the CBI is probing cases involving rampant corruption in high places in the country, the unwillingness of the government to institute a transparent and accountable system to ensure that the culprits are punished seriously impairs the right of the people to live in a corruption and crime free society which violates Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the citizens, added the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-supreme-court-seeks-appointment-of-regular-cbi-director-101614845376023.html

04-03-2021||India||New hope to unite Geeta with family, 5 years after repatriation from Pakistan||There is a possibility of speech and hearing impaired Geeta, repatriated from Pakistan in 2015, finding her family finally. An official of Madhya Pradesh's social justice department on Wednesday said the birthmark information provided by a woman from Marathwada in Maharashtra has matched with that of Geeta. However, the DNA test to ascertain the parentage is yet to be done.If the DNA test comes positive, Geeta, 29, would be known as Radha Waghmare, a resident of Jintur village of Parbhani district in Maharashtra, said Suchita Tirkey, joint director of MP’s social justice department.Geeta currently lives in an Anand Foundation’s home in Indore and its convenor, Gyanendra Purohit, said, “Now a resident of Naigaon, Meena Dinkar Pandhare, 71, is 100% sure that Geeta is her daughter from her first marriage.”“Everything Geeta shared from her childhood memories --- sugarcane fields, maternity home in front of a railway station, diesel engine and food habits --- matched with that of Pandhare's village," he said.He added that they believed Meena’s claim when she said Geeta must have a burn mark on her stomach. “Geeta was not keen to confirm the birthmark but when a woman police constable checked, she found the exact mark on her stomach,” he added.Purohit said they started searching for her parents in July last year with the help of her facial features, food habits and childhood memories.They got the clue that Geeta could possibly be from Maharashtra, when in October 2020, they rescued a girl from an ashram from MP’s Dewas district.“The girl also had a right nose piercing like Geeta. We asked for her whereabouts and the girl said she was from Marathwada. We got in touch with Pahal Foundation of Parbhani in Marathwada, which also works for speech and hearing-impaired people, and sought their help to find Geeta’s parents,” said Purohit.“In December, Meena, who is illiterate and knows only Marathi, contacted us, saying her daughter went missing in 1999-2000. Geeta also confirmed everything Meena said but when she came to know about her economic condition, she was reluctant to move with her. However, Mina visits the shelter frequently with food,” he added.Also Read:US welcomes steps taken to return J-K to full economic, political normalcyPahal foundation convener Aniket Salgaoncar, who is also hearing and speech impaired, said through sign language, “We are happy that Geeta found her mother. But she doesn’t want to move with her mother, and it is obvious because she has met her after 20 years. She wanted to do a job so we are providing skill training to her.”Geeta went missing 20 years ago and reached Pakistan in 2000. According to documents provided by Edhi foundation of Pakistan, who looked after her for 13 years, she was found sitting alone in Samjhauta express in Lahore in 2000.Former foreign affairs minister (late) Sushma Swaraj played an important role in her repatriation in 2015. More than 24 couples have claimed to be her parents in the past but failed to establish their parenthood due to DNA mismatch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-hope-to-unite-geeta-with-family-5-years-after-repatriation-from-pakistan-101614843111606.html

"We have been seeing this as happening often. Those who put forth facts are being pressurised in this way so that they don't speak up," he said.Union minister Prakash Javadekar, however, dismissed links between the I-T raids and the recent comments of Anurag and Taapsee and said this speculation is "too much". "Probe agencies undertake investigations based on credible information and the matter later goes to courts as well," he added.IT officials on Wednesday said all businesses, financial transactions, talent and event management contracts between Phantom and other entities are under scrutiny. The searches will now continue as I-T officials will look into the bank accounts and lockers of these personalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ungliyon-pe-nachana-rahul-gandhi-slams-i-t-raids-on-anurag-kashyap-taapsee-101614841063232.html

04-03-2021||India||Ease of Living Index 2020: Bengaluru, Shimla adjudged best cities||Among Indian cities with a population of over a million, the ease of living is the highest in Bengaluru, Pune and Ahmedabad while it is the lowest in Bareilly, Dhanbad and Srinagar, according to the Ease of Living Index 2020 prepared by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. In cities with population less than a million, Shimla was ranked the highest while Muzaffarpur in Bihar was had the lowest score. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasising the ease of living, along with the ease of doing business, as a key policy priority, the rankings of cities have assumed significance in shaping government policies and determining expenditure priorities. A total of 111 cities participated in the assessment exercise that was conducted in 2020. The first edition of the index was launched in 2018. It was based on indicators across 15 evaluation criteria, including governance, identity and culture, education, health, safety and security, economy, affordable housing, land use planning, public open spaces, transportation and mobility, assured water supply, waste-water management, solid waste management, power, and quality of environment. Also Read | Once a source of drinking water, Bengaluru river now filled with froth, stenchThe 2020 report, reviewed by HT, noted that the index was born out of the need to measure the outcomes of programmes and “verify whether these interventions were effective in ushering progress in urban India”. The index is also based on metrics that “align with sustainable development goals”. Union housing minister Hardeep Puri said, “India’s steady economic growth is reflected in the rapid expansion of her cities. India, today is one of the fastest-growing large economies in the world. With the current urbanisation rate, India is expected to have 50 percent of the country’s population residing in cities within the next 30 years.” Puri acknowledged that while rising urbanisation promises innovation and growth, it also puts “tremendous pressure on available resources”. The ministry also drafted a report on the “Municipal Performance Index 2020” in a bid to determine elements that prevent efficient local governance in service delivery mechanisms, planning, financial systems, and governance practice. In the million-plus category, Indore has emerged as the highest ranked municipality, followed by Surat and Bhopal while Guwahati, Kota and Srinagar ranked lowest. Among municipalities catering to a population of a less than a million, New Delhi Municipal Council has emerged as the leader, followed by Tirupati and Gandhinagar while Shillong, Imphal and Kohima municipalities were ranked lowest. The MPI examined the sectoral performance of 114 municipalities (with Delhi being assessed separately for NDMC, and the three Municipal Corporations) across five verticals which comprise of 20 sectors and 100 indicators in all totality. The five verticals under MPI include services, finance, policy, technology and governance, the report noted. The methodology and approach for the revised edition of EoLI and MPI were released by the ministry in February 2019. Essentially, the EoLI report aims to measure the well-being of Indian citizens in 111 cities, across the pillars of Quality of Life, Economic-ability, and Sustainability, with 49 indicators under 14 categories, the report noted. It also incorporates citizen perception of cities into the index through the Citizen Perception Survey that was conducted by the housing ministry. “The EoLI primarily seeks to accelerate India’s urban development outcomes, including the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings from the index can help guide evidence-based policymaking. It also promotes healthy competition among cities, encouraging them to learn from their peers and advance their development trajectory,” it added. The Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) was undertaken from January 16 March 20, 2020. A total of 3.22 million citizens from 111 cities participated in the survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ease-of-living-index-2020-bengaluru-shimla-adjudged-best-cities-101614842495627.html

Tourists were ordered to leave the premises, which were overtaken by security personnel, who later declared it safe for visitors after an extensive search and screening operation, which could not locate any explosives as claimed in the hoax call, said officials. The monument was reopened to visitors at 11.15 am, they added.“The police control room received a call from an unidentified caller on Thursday morning, informing that an explosion will take place in Taj Mahal premises.

04-03-2021||India||Mizoram prepares for possible influx of refugees fleeing Myanmar after coup||District authorities of Champhai in Mizoram bordering Myanmar are gearing up for a possible influx of refugees fleeing the neighbouring country after last month’s military coup there. The state shares a 510km-long border with Myanmar and there’s a possibility that those who fear political persecution could flee and enter India seeking refuge. In an order issued on Tuesday, the Champhai administration asked people in the district, especially those residing in border areas, to immediately notify them of any information about Myanmarese nationals entering India seeking shelter. “If somebody crosses over without the notice of the district administration or village councils in border areas, they have to be caught and the local authorities alerted. They have to record entries of people who are not Indian nationals,” Maria CT Zuali, deputy commissioner, Champhai, said over phone. Also Read | Mizoram CM presents budget for FY22 with outlay of ₹11 croreOnce village councils submit reports of any such entry of Myanmar nationals in their areas, the district administration will take action on them in consultation with the Centre. “We will try and find out if at all the lives of those entering India are threatened in Myanmar. We can decide on these people based on what the Centre says. They will be deported if we are not granted permission to take them in as refugees,” Zuali said. The DC stated that as of now, no Myanmarese nationals have entered the district following the military coup. But there have been some reports of people seeking refugee status. “We have heard some such reports from a few village councils. We will have a meeting on Thursday on how to treat these illegal migrants. We have to scrutinise each such person and the reason for their trying to enter India. We don’t want any militants trying to sneak in,” she said. The order stated that those who face danger of persecution by the present leadership in Myanmar due to their political beliefs should be regarded as refugees and given shelter in the district. It added that a large number of people might flee Myanmar and seek refuge in India as a result of the coup and the growing civil disobedience against it. Along with the order, the district authority also issued a proforma for the “identification of migrants/refugees entering Mizoram from Myanmar in connection with military coup”. Besides recording the personal details of each Myanmarese national, it would also enumerate information on whether that individual belongs to any political organisation targeted by the military in the neighbouring country, reasons for fleeing and if they face any “real and imminent threat”. The order by the Champhai administration is in line with standard operating procedures (SOPs) prepared earlier by the state’s home department regarding refugees from Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-prepares-for-possible-influx-of-refugees-fleeing-myanmar-after-coup-101614839075690.html

A bench comprising the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat passed the order on Wednesday on a petition filed by one Tahmina Khatun and 25 others. Advocate Jayshree Satpute, who appeared for the petitioners, informed the court that the women had approached the authorities in 2019 and filed a plea under the Right to Information Act to know why they were classified as D-voters or doubtful voters. The Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) in September 2019 responded by saying that the women were put in the D-voter category in 1997. However, the ERO said that there were no records stating why.

After being classified as D-voters, the petitioners alleged that they and their families have faced social stigma. It is not known whether their family members’ names are also in the doubtful voter list. The bench observed that the point raised in the petition required consideration and asked the EC and Centre to respond within four weeks. The petition prayed for a direction to remove their names from the doubtful voter list as this would bring their citizenship under a cloud. Placing an individual in this list denies a person basic rights and legal rights, which includes right to ration and right to vote, apart from constitutional guarantees. The petitioners claimed that they were neither heard nor allowed an opportunity to explain by the authorities before being placed in the doubtful voter category. The development is also significant since the election process for assembly polls in Assam has already begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-ec-response-on-listing-26-assam-women-in-doubtful-voters-list-101614837635342.html

04-03-2021||India||Stability of rocks, river flow in Rishi Ganga needs careful monitoring: Analysis||An analysis of the February 7 Uttarakhand glacier breach has cautioned that the stability of remaining rocks or ice masses and slopes around the rock that detached needs to be monitored carefully to prevent more disasters. The ice and rock mass detached at an elevation of 5,600 m from a north-facing slope northeast of Trisul peak in Nanda Devi mountain.The analysis by Glacier and Permafrost Hazards in Mountains (GAPHAZ), a scientific standing group of the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences and the International Permafrost Association, underlined large volumes of debris have been eroded and deposited along the river channel after the breach. In combination with water from rivers, snowmelt, heavy monsoon rain, or overflow of temporary lakes, debris flows can be triggered from these depositions and pose danger downstream.Also Read | Scientists warn of rebound after record 7% fall in global emissionsThe analysis said it is difficult to assess the state of the temporary lake at the confluence above Raini village from remote sensing data alone. Dam conditions need to be critically analysed and erosion by the flood has probably undercut some slopes. “Some high-resolution satellite images indicate tension cracks on and above slopes with signs for movements, but it is difficult to evaluate the evolution of these cracks and attribute them to the February 7 avalanche. Detailed evaluation and monitoring of the slopes along the entire stretch of the river are recommended. Such slope instabilities could affect roads, villages, and other infrastructure located far above the riverbed,” the analysis said.GAPHAZ cited early findings by geologists that a major rock/ice avalanche caused the massive floods in the Rishiganga river and left scores dead and missing. Analysis of satellite imagery from the area shows that the event occurred due to failure deep within the bedrock of the mountain, and the glacier ice was most probably entrained with the collapsing block of bedrock.The depth of the failure plane is more than 100 m below the surface, where no seasonal temperature variations are expected. The zone is in permafrost conditions where ground temperatures are below zero. Some have speculated that heat fluxes from the warmer south face of the mountain to the colder north face, where the avalanche detached, could have warmed the frozen bedrock, leading to the avalanche.According to estimates by GAPHAZ, the avalanche volume was 20 million m3 of rock (83%) and calcium; 4 million m3 of ice (17%). This puts the event into a category of the largest contemporary mass movements in mountains on a global scale, says the analysis.The very steep avalanche trajectory, dropping around 2000 m in elevation over a distance of about 3.3 km, indicates the release of high impact energy. Along with the entrainment, most of the ice of the avalanche may have melted. In addition, the area under snow may have also melted due to the frictional energy of the avalanche leading to run-off.Liquid water from snow and ice melting could have infiltrated the bedrock in cleft systems and destabilised the rock through freeze-thaw processes, the analysis has suggested.Satellite imagery also indicates that a similar event occurred in the neighbouring glacier in September 2016.Anil Kulkarni, distinguished scientist, Divecha Center for Climate Change at Indian Institute of Science, said it is true that there was a major ice or rock avalanche, and part of a hanging glacier came down with it. “We have calculated the ice volumes which is in millions of cubic metres. The slope was around 30 degrees. But what is not known is what triggered the melting of this ice. There is some speculation that it was in a soft, deglaciated valley which led to melting but that is crucial information which is still missing.”Carolina Adler, executive director, Mountain Research Institute, University of Bern, said in the longer term, it is inevitable that in such high, remote, steep, sensitive, rapidly warming, and deglaciating environments, large infrastructure projects can be exposed to considerable natural risks. “However, a paucity of long-term, informative data, the likelihood of climate change-induced non-stationarity, and the complex, cascading nature of such events make these risks extremely challenging to quantify reliably,” Adler said in a statement. “It may therefore be appropriate for the viability of such infrastructure projects to be reappraised. At the very least, in order to protect people and infrastructure who are inherently in harm’s way (e.g. hydro-electric power stations), ongoing multi-variate monitoring of upstream environments, coupled with early warning systems that exploit modern technology and associated mandatory drills, would seem imperative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stability-of-rocks-river-flow-in-rishi-ganga-needs-careful-monitoring-analysis-101614834995703.html

Here is all you need to know about the matter:• The court maintained that “dissent” is a form of free speech and expression.• It added these rights are protected under the Constitution.• The comments came at a time when governments and law enforcement agencies around the country have been quick to slap sedition charges against critics.• “Expression of views which are different from the opinion of the government cannot be termed as seditious. It cannot become sedition only because one has a different view,” said the bench comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Hemant Gupta.Also Read | Delhi riots: Court takes cognisance of sedition charges against 18• India’s sedition law was introduced by the British in 1870. • The word “sedition” did not appear in the Constitution when it was adopted on November 26, 1949, and Article 19(1)(a) gave absolute freedom of speech and expression. • However, section 124A stayed in the Indian Penal Code. In 1951, Jawaharlal Nehru brought in the first amendment of the Constitution to limit the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) and enacted Article 19(2) to empower the State to put curbs in the form of “reasonable restrictions” on right to free speech.• In 1962, in Kedar Nath Singh Vs State of Bihar, a constitution bench of the top court upheld the validity of the sedition law under the IPC and also defined the scope of sedition. • It held that Section 124A only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. • This definition has been taken as a precedent for all matters pertaining to Section 124A since.• “Just because you dissent from the views of the government, will it become sedition?” the bench asked the lawyer for the petitioners, Rajat Sharma and Neh Srivastava. • Vadodara-based Sharma is secretary and trustee of organisation “Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel” while Srivastava is a social activist from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad.• The court also imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on the petitioners for filing what it termed a “frivolous” petition.• “What kind of a petition is this? People must be penalised for filing such petitions,” said the bench after the petitioners’ counsel failed to substantiate the claim that Abdullah called for support from China and Pakistan against the negation of Article 370, which did away with the special status granted to J&K and its citizens.• The petition cited a statement by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as a chief ground. It relied upon some media reports to quote Patra as claiming that Abdullah had delivered a speech seeking China’s help in restoring Article 370.• But this averment could not be corroborated by the petitioners’ lawyer Shiv Sagar Tiwary even as the bench asked repeatedly as to when and where Abdullah issued the alleged statement.• On February 23, a Delhi court, while granting bail to climate activist Disha Ravi, raised serious questions about the Delhi Police’s invocation of the sedition charge.• According to the data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), cases of sedition and under the stringent UAPA for terror cases showed a rise in 2019, but only 3% of the sedition cases resulted in a conviction.• The year 2019 saw a 25% increase in the number of sedition cases and a 41% increase in arrests over the previous year. A total of 93 cases of sedition were reported in 2019, with 96 arrests and charge sheets filed in 76 cases, as against 70 cases, 56 arrests, and 27 charge sheets the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-sedition-plea-against-farooq-abdullah-all-you-need-to-know-101614834515411.html

Here is all you need to know about it and what it means:• The announcement based on preliminary results from Covaxin’s Phase 3 clinical trials is expected to come as a shot in the arm for India’s vaccination drive.• The vaccine was approved for an emergency roll-out on January 16 before it was established to be effective in preventing Covid-19.• Experts, as well as authorities, pointed to Phase 1 and 2 trials that showed that Covaxin was safe and produced an adequate immune response.• Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involved around 27,000 participants. Also Read | ‘People criticised us’: Bharat Biotech head on Covaxin’s journey from March 2020• Covaxin demonstrates a high clinical efficacy trend against Covid-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants, said Krishna Ella, chairman, and managing director, Bharat Biotech.• The detailed data is yet to be released or peer-reviewed. • The results are based on an interim analysis when 43 infections took place among the 25,800 people who were part of the trials.• Of these, 36 were among those given a placebo, while seven got the vaccine, translating to an efficacy rate of 80.6%, the company said.• The indigenous vaccine has met with severe hesitancy, particularly among health care workers, for want of the efficacy data.• Disaggregated data from Delhi, for example, showed in January that turnout at locations administering Covaxin was as low as 25%, while it was 75% for those using Covishield, the domestically produced version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.• As of Wednesday, 16.3 million doses of the two vaccines have been administered to people across the country.• Covaxin uses an inactivated virus paired with an adjuvant – a chemical that boosts immune response. • Covaxin is based on a tried-and-tested platform, the other vaccine India is giving to its people – Covishield – makes use of a newer Trojan horse-like technique known as the adenovirus platform. • An efficacy higher than 50% is considered acceptable, according to World Health Organization (WHO) norms.• Two other vaccines that are being used widely around the world use a breakthrough technology known as the mRNA platform and report an efficacy rate above 95%. But both of these require freezing temperatures to be stored or transported.• Covaxin is stable at 2°C to 8°C, temperatures that can be typically achieved by refrigerators, and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels.• The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18 and 98 years of age, including 2,433 over the age of 60 and 4,500 with comorbidities. • The primary endpoint of Phase 3 clinical trial is based on the first occurrence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic (mild, moderate, or severe) Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after the second dose is given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-has-81-efficacy-says-bharat-biotech-what-does-it-mean-101614833555283.html
04-03-2021||India||SC allows man to meet daughter who has accused him of killing her mother||The Supreme Court has allowed a man to meet his daughter, who has accused him of killing her mother, saying it would be “in the best interest” of the six-year-old to maintain her relationship with him, especially since the charges were yet to be proved.A bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, called the situation “difficult” as the child had recorded her statement as an eyewitness to her mother’s murder at their home in Haryana’s Bhiwani in January 2020. It added she later gave a different version to a judge in the Rajasthan high court where her maternal grandfather had gone for her custody. She told the high court that her father might not be responsible for her mother’s death.The bench also noted that even though the child had also accused her paternal grandparents of helping her father strangulate her mother, the trial court could not find any evidence against the grandparents and they were thus exonerated last year.The father has been charged with dowry death under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code because of the girl’s testimony. He was currently out on bail, said the court in its order last month.Also Read | SC to hear women officers’ petitions for permanent commission in Army, Navy“This thus throws some question marks on how much the child can be believed in the given situation. There are findings by the magistrate and in the impugned order which seek to suggest that both the sides, i.e., the maternal and the paternal side may be tutoring the child in their respective perspectives,” held the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.“However, we are concerned with protecting the interest of the child who has already suffered a trauma of the loss of the mother...it is appropriate for the proper upbringing of the child that interaction with the father be maintained in this period of time as the trial is yet to take place.”The bench then said that it would be appropriate if the interaction between the child and the father and her paternal grandparents could take place. It added the custody of the child should continue with her maternal grandfather and the maternal aunt in Rajasthan.“We thus remit the matter back to the Rajasthan high court on the limited issue of making appropriate arrangements for the visiting rights of the father and the paternal grandparents of the child while maintaining the impugned order of giving custody to the maternal side as it is.”The bench was hearing a petition by the father and his parents, who wanted custody of the child. The court concluded that it would not be prudent to disturb the custody but accepted that the girl must have an association with her father and the paternal grandparents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-man-to-meet-daughter-who-has-accused-him-of-killing-her-mother-101614832235276.html
04-03-2021||India||'People criticised us': Bharat Biotech head on Covaxin's journey from March 2020||As Bharat Biotech published the interim efficacy report of the phase 3 clinical trial on indigenous Covaxin, which was found to have 81 per cent efficacy, chairman and managing director Krishna Ella addressed the criticism that the vaccine faced since the trial report was awaited.In a video message issued by the company, he said, "Remembering people criticising us saying our data is not transparent, not in the public domain, I am today proud to say that our data are in the public domain in six publications. If people have got patience, they should read those articles."In March 2020, the National Institute of Virology successfully isolated the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) entered into a partnership with Bharat Biotech to develop the virus isolate into an effective vaccine candidate.Bharat Biotech got the strain in May and since then work has been going on. The phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials conducted in 755 participants demonstrated a high safety profile of the candidate vaccine with seroconversion rates of 98.3 per cent and 81.1 per cent on day 56 and 104, respectively.The phase 3 trial was started in the middle of November and was conducted on a total of 25,800 individuals across 21 sites. However, the interim result was based on 43 cases, of which 36 cases were observed in the placebo group and the other seven were observed in the Covaxin group, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 80.6 per cent.The vaccine got restricted emergency use approval in January in absence of the phase 3 data. Several ministers, doctors raised questions over administering Covaxin to healthcare workers and frontline workers. Questions were also raised on how in the second phase of vaccination people can be charged for a shot that is still under trial.Soon after the nod from the Drug Controller General of India, Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India issued a joint statement clearing the air that there is no competition over vaccines between the two vaccine-makers.Out of over 1 crore vaccines administered till last week, only 11 per cent was Covaxin. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan took Covaxin shots to dispel misconceptions about the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-criticised-us-bharat-biotech-head-on-covaxin-s-journey-from-march-2020-101614831057473.html
04-03-2021||India||Six states contribute 86% of daily new Covid cases: Govt data||Six states in India currently contribute nearly 86% of the new cases of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), government data shows. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka also continue to report a surge in the daily new cases.On Wednesday, 14,989 new cases were registered from across the country, of which Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 7,863. It is followed by Kerala with 2,938 cases, while Punjab reported 729 new cases.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka have shown the maximum increase in new cases on a week-on-week basis. “Maharashtra alone accounted for a weekly increase of 16,012 cases, in terms of the number of cases. In percentage terms, Punjab reported the weekly increase of 71.5% (1,783 cases),” said health ministry in a statement.Central teams that have been rushed to these states, to assist local authorities in managing the situation, are trying to get to the cause, and initial observation says large gatherings and drop in overall testing could have led to the surge.“It is a season of weddings, and people tend to gather in large numbers on such occasions and also there is somewhat laxity in observing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Another reason could be drop in overall testing as some of the states where there has been seen a surge, Covid-19 testing relatively went down. The teams have been directed to brief the state authorities in detail about the reasons so that the situation can be managed accordingly,” said a senior government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified.The three-member teams are headed by joint secretary level officers in the health ministry. The teams have been rushed to Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir.Apart from the teams on ground, the central government is constantly in touch with the state governments where high case load of active cases and the surge in new cases has been reported.“States/UTs have been advised to maintain a continued rigorous vigil for containing the spread of Covid-19 such the gains of collective efforts are not squandered away. Need for effective testing, comprehensive tracking, prompt isolation of positive cases and quick quarantine of close contacts are strongly emphasised,” said health ministry in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-states-contribute-86-of-daily-new-covid-cases-govt-data-101614830195364.html

04-03-2021||India||SC rules out immediate hearing on pleas challenging Tamil Nadu’s 69% quota law||The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that petitions challenging the Tamil Nadu quota law made in 1993, which provides 69% reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in educational institutes and government jobs will not be taken up till there is a decision by a Constitution bench on the validity of the Maratha quota law, which will be taken up on March 8.Ahead of the assembly elections in the state, the petitioners challenging the Tamil Nadu Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Act, 1993 moved an application to tag their petition with the cases challenging the Maharashtra State Reservation (of Seats for admission and educational institutions in the State and for appointments in the Public Services and posts under the State) for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018 (in short Maratha quota law).The Tamil Nadu government opposed this, suggesting that the matter could await an outcome of the decision in the Maratha quota case.Siding with the view of the state, the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy said, “We are of the view that these petitions need not be heard along with Civil Appeal No.3123 of 2020 (challenging the validity of Maratha quota law) and be listed after the judgment in Civil Appeal Nos.3123 of 2020.”The petitions challenging the Tamil Nadu quota law have been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012. The lead petitioner CV Gayathri and others stated that after the enactment of the Constitution 102nd Act, 2018, the Tamil Nadu law had to be tested based on this law. “Issues which have been raised in these writ petitions have bearing on the questions which have been referred to the larger Bench, hence, it is appropriate that these petitions be heard along with the challenge to the Maratha quota law,” said senior advocate Maninder Singh appearing for the petitioner.This stand was supported by senior advocate Kapil Sibal who submitted that the Tamil Nadu government had appointed a Commission in the year 2020, by which, the exercise of including SCs/STs within the ambit of the 1993 law was continuing. According to him, the issue pertaining to Constitution 102nd Act, 2018 was very much involved in these matters and the same ought to go to the Constitution Bench.Also Read: SC to hear women officers' petitions for permanent commission in Army, NavySenior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Tamil Nadu opposed the contention and submitted that as far as Tamil Nadu Act of 1993 is concerned, the same enjoyed special protection under Article 31B of the Constitution (Ninth Schedule) and the hearing on these writ petitions could await the outcome of the Constitution bench’s decision in Maratha quota case. He also pointed out that the TN quota law was enacted in 1993; whereas the Maharashtra Act, 2018 was enacted after the Constitution 102nd Amendment.The state pointed out to the Court that the Supreme Court in 1996 had allowed reservations under the 69% law to continue. Subsequently, the state had also produced quantifiable data to justify reservation under the 1993 law. But the petitioners were aggrieved that the reservation in admissions were being carried out without creating additional seats. This was seriously prejudicing open category candidates, the petitioners argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rules-out-immediate-hearing-on-pleas-challenging-tamil-nadu-s-69-quota-law-101614827197536.html

Thousands of cases are listed in any given court complex every day. Apart from judges, the court staff and advocates, a large number of litigants visit Courts in which their cases are listed, on a daily basis, the Delhi High Court said in its order.In fact, the number of persons visiting a Court complex -Tiz Hazari Courts on any given day, may well be in excess of the number of persons visiting and thronging the hospital for treatment of patients, the Court also noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weight-in-claim-for-declaring-persons-linked-with-judicial-functioning-as-frontline-workers-to-get-covid-vaccine-delhi-hc-101614825732509.html
04-03-2021||India||India downgraded from ‘free’ to ‘partly free’ in democracy report||India’s status as a democracy and free society has been downgraded to “partly free” in the latest annual report on global political rights and liberties by Freedom House, a US government-funded NGO that studies political freedom around the world.The report titled “Freedom in the World 2021 - Democracy under Siege” said India “appears to have abandoned its potential to serve as a global democratic leader”. It said India’s fall “from the upper ranks of free nations could have a particularly damaging impact on global democratic standards”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the report.India had been rated as “free” in Freedom House’s reports for 2018, 2019 and 2020, though its scores on a scale of 100 had declined during this period from 77 to 71. In the latest report, India had a score of 67 out of 100.In 1973, Freedom House launched the Freedom in the World report, which assessed the level of freedom in each country and ranked them with a numerical score and declared them as “free”, “partly free” or “not free”. The annual report is perceived as one of the oldest quantitative measures of democracy. The latest report said political rights and civil liberties in India had deteriorated since 2014 because of increased pressure on human rights organisations, rising intimidation of academics and journalists, and a “spate of bigoted attacks, including lynchings, aimed at Muslims”.The decline accelerated in 2019, and the central government and its state-level allies “continued to crack down on critics” during 2020, while the response to the Covid-19 pandemic “included a ham-fisted lockdown that resulted in the dangerous and unplanned displacement of millions of internal migrant workers”.Rather than serving as a champion of democratic practice and a “counterweight to authoritarian influence from countries such as China”, the government and the ruling party are “tragically driving India itself toward authoritarianism”, the report said.Freedom House cited other incidents and developments that had led to the downgrade for India in the latest report, including the government intensifying its crackdown on protesters opposed to a the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the arrest of dozens of journalists who aired criticism of the official pandemic response.“Judicial independence has also come under strain; in one case, a judge was transferred immediately after reprimanding the police for taking no action during riots in New Delhi that left over 50 people, mostly Muslims, dead,” the report said.While India remains a multiparty democracy, the government has “presided over discriminatory policies and increased violence affecting the Muslim population”, and the harassment of journalists, non-governmental organisations and other government critics has “increased significantly”.Freedom House gave high scores to India for the conduct of free and fair elections but expressed concern over the “opaque financing of political parties – notably through electoral bonds that allow donors to obscure their identities”. While political participation is “generally free”, Freedom House said “some political actors have sought to inflame communal tensions with the goal of energising their own supporters”.It also gave a low score to India over the ability of different segments of the population, including ethnic, racial and religious minorities, having full political rights and electoral opportunities.The report was extremely critical of China, describing it as the “world’s most populous dictatorship” and saying the “malign influence of the regime” in Beijing was “especially profound in 2020”. China “ramped up its global disinformation and censorship campaign to counter the fallout from its cover-up of the initial coronavirus outbreak, which severely hampered a rapid global response in the pandemic’s early days”, the report said.Beijing’s efforts “featured increased meddling in the domestic political discourse of foreign democracies, transnational extensions of rights abuses common in mainland China, and the demolition of Hong Kong’s liberties and legal autonomy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-downgraded-from-free-to-partly-free-in-democracy-report-101614810847391.html

As we've said before, Secretary (of State Tony) Blinken has had a couple opportunities to speak to his Indian counterpart, both bilaterally and in the context of the Quad," Price said.The Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a region that has witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in the recent years.The US has important relationships with India, as well as Pakistan, the spokesperson said, adding "these relationships stand on their own in our view.""They are not a zero-sum proposition when it comes to US foreign policy. We have productive, constructive relations, and productive and constructive relationships with one does not detract from the relationship we have at the other. It does not come at the expense of the relationship we have with the other," Price said."When it comes to India, we have a global comprehensive strategic partnership, and we've talked about that. When it comes to Pakistan, I addressed this the other week: We have important shared interests in the region. And we will continue to work closely with the Pakistani authorities on those shared interests," he said in response to a question.The US continues to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern, Price said.

"We have been seeing this as happening often. Those who put forth facts are being pressurised in this way so that they don't speak up.""They work with so much vengeance. They don't want anyone to enjoy the freedom a democracy gives. For them, it is an autocratic rule and whatever they say is right and whatever others want to say is wrong," Maharashtra women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur said.Bollywood that crawls when asked to bend given Y+ securityBollywood that stands straight with farmers raided by ITShiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi termed the I-T department's present status as "bonded slavery".

04-03-2021||India||SC to hear women officers' petitions for permanent commission in Army, Navy||The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday a batch of petitions filed by women officers for Permanent Commission in the Indian Army and Navy, seeking a direction that contempt proceedings be initiated against those who had allegedly failed in their duty to comply with the top court's earlier judgement.In their petitions, the women army officers have alleged that the directions were not being complied with in "letter and spirit", news agency PTI reported.One such petition, filed by Chitrangda Rastravara and Advocate on Record (AOR) Archana Pathak Dave, seeks SC's immediate direction to implement its earlier order.Also Read: Indian military sees threefold increase in women personnel in 6 yearsThe Army, however, claimed that out of 615 women officers, there are 422 who are eligible for permanent commission. But in reality, only 277 out of 422 have been granted permanent commission, 145 are those officers who are either non-optees or whose result is withheld due to medical or administrative reasons and 193 officers have been denied permanent commission, the petition said, according to ANI.In February 2020, the SC had ruled that all serving Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers should be entitled to permanent commission. It directed the army to give the permanent commission to its officers within three months, irrespective of the number of years they have spent in the armed forces.While SSC officers can stay in service for a specific period of 10-14 years, permanent commission allows them to work in the army till they retire. As part of the judgement, the SC had also ended the prohibition on women being considered for command appointments.Rejecting the army's argument that male soldiers, who mostly hailed from rural areas, were not “mentally schooled” to accept women officers in command of units, the two-judge SC bench comprising justices DY Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi had said that such arguments were an insult to not only women, but also the Indian army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-women-officers-petitions-for-permanent-commission-in-army-navy-101614822241169.html
04-03-2021||India||Disagreeing with govt is not sedition, says SC||It is not seditious to have views different from the government, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday as it junked a petition that sought action against former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah for his comments on the scrapping of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the state into two Union territories.The apex court maintained that “dissent” is a form of free speech and expression, and that these rights are protected under the Constitution — comments that come at a time when governments and law enforcement agencies around the country have been quick to slap sedition charges against critics.“Expression of views which are different from the opinion of the government cannot be termed as seditious. It cannot become sedition only because one has a different view,” emphasised the bench, comprising Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice Hemant Gupta.India’s sedition law has an interesting past — it was introduced by the British in 1870, decided to be dropped from the Constitution in 1948 after discussions of the Constituent Assembly. The word “sedition” disappeared from the Constitution when it was adopted on November 26, 1949 and Article 19(1)(a) gave absolute freedom of speech and expression. However, section 124A stayed in the Indian Penal Code. In 1951, Jawaharlal Nehru brought in the first amendment of the Constitution to limit the freedom under Article 19(1)(a) and enacted Article 19(2) to empower the State put curbs in the form of “reasonable restrictions” on right to free speech.In 1962, in Kedar Nath Singh Vs State of Bihar, a constitution bench of the top court upheld the validity of the sedition law under the IPC and also defined the scope of sedition. It held that Section 124A only penalised words that reveal an intent or tendency to disturb law and order or that seem to incite violence. This definition has been taken as precedent for all matters pertaining to Section 124A since.“Just because you dissent from the views of the government, will it become sedition?” the bench asked the lawyer for the petitioners, Rajat Sharma and Neh Srivastava. Vadodara-based Sharma is secretary and trustee of organisation “Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel” while Srivastava is a social activist from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad.The court also imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on the petitioners for filing what it termed a “frivolous” petition.“What kind of a petition is this? People must be penalised for filing such petitions,” commented the bench after the petitioners’ counsel failed to substantiate the claim that Abdullah called for support from China and Pakistan against negation of Article 370, which did away with the special status granted to J&K and its citizens.“Since the statement of Farooq Abdullah is anti-national and seditious, government of India should be directed to take appropriate action, declaring him an undeserving candidate as a member of parliament,” stated the petition, citing certain statements made by Abdullah on a national TV channel. The petition had cited a statement by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as a chief ground. It relied upon some media reports to quote Patra as claiming that Abdullah had delivered a speech seeking China’s help in restoring Article 370. But this averment could not be corroborated by the petitioners’ lawyer Shiv Sagar Tiwary even as the bench asked repeatedly as to when and where Abdullah issued the alleged statement.On February 23, a Delhi court, while granting bail to climate activist Disha Ravi raised serious questions about the Delhi Police’s invocation of the sedition charge.According to the data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), uploaded on its website, cases of sedition and under the stringent UAPA for terror cases showed a rise in 2019, but only 3% of the sedition cases resulted in conviction.The year 2019 saw a 25% increase in the number of sedition cases and a 41% increase in arrests over the previous year. A total of 93 cases of sedition were reported in 2019, with 96 arrests and charge sheets filed in 76 cases, as against 70 cases, 56 arrests and 27 charge sheets the previous year.The Ministry of Home Affairs, in a written reply on February 10, informed the Rajya Sabha that of the 96 people arrested for sedition in 2019, only two were convicted and 29 acquitted. Investigations and trials are ongoing in the rest.Former Supreme Court judge Justice Deepak Gupta told HT: “The law on sedition is widely misused... The law should either be abolished or be made non-cognizable, as it was prior to 1974, so that only the State should be competent to file such a complaint, that too after scrutiny or sanction by a senior officer.”Retired in May 2020, justice Gupta added: “In 1962, the Supreme Court in Kedar Nath Singh case read down Section 124A to say it applies only if there is incitement to violence. This is a necessary ingredient for applying sedition. But magistrates across the country seem to be unaware of this or are ignoring it. I hope the Supreme Court lays down guidelines soon in an appropriate case to prevent misuse of this provision.”Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi told HT: “It will lead to a dictatorship if sedition charges are slapped for criticising a government. I fully support the views of the bench. Mere criticism of government or its policy, howsoever strong it may be, cannot amount to sedition... A charge under sedition can be invoked only when certain acts incite violence or seeks overthrowing a democratically elected government through violent means.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disagreeing-with-govt-is-not-sedition-says-sc-101614809724448.html

According to a communication, seen by HT, the ministry will organise a promotion of defence museums and encourage the Indian diaspora to visit various cities under the Dekho Apna Desh campaign.All state governments are also slated to come up with incentives. “The event would be befitting way of celebrating India@75, considering it’s ancient and diverse heritage and culture, natural resources and arts and recent improvements in tourism infrastructure,” the document read.Officials from the tourism ministry said they were in the process of collating a list of all defence museums. “We have reached out to the ministry of defence and culture to see where all the museums located, we should know the details in a few days,” an official said.The tourism ministry document said the government will hold road shows, themed tours, webinars, interactive sessions and workshops. The ministry also plans to organise a nationwide event titled Paryatan Parv 2022 from January 26, 2022 to September 27, 2022, which is World Tourism Day. The event will comprise photography, essay and debate contests, illumination at key tourism sites, cultural programmes, tourism exhibitions and guided heritage walks.The ministry is also planning a series of webinars on various themes such as the Statue of Unity in Gujarat, the freedom movement and stories of places associated with freedom fighters.

04-03-2021||India||2 held for murder of sexual assault survivor’s father||Two more accused in the Hathras murder case were arrested on Wednesday, hours after the Uttar Pradesh police announced a cash reward for providing information on the accused.Confirming the development, Hathras superintendent of police Vineet Jaiswal said, “Two of the accused Rohtash Sharma and Nikhil Sharma were arrested on Wednesday after reward was declared of ₹25,000 on each.”Earlier in the day, Agra zone additional director general of police Rajeev Krishna announced a cash reward of ₹1 lakh for information on the mail accused. “A reward of ₹1 lakh has been declared on the main accused Gaurav Sharma, who is absconding after killing 50-year-old Amreesh Sharma at Nojarpur village under the Sasni police station limits of Hathras district,” the ADG said.Amreesh Sharma was shot dead in Hathras district by accused against whom the deceased lodged a police case in July 2018 for molesting his daughter, the police said on Tuesday. The accused was out on bail and was pressurizing the family of the woman to withdraw the case.The incident happened on Monday and made headlines after a video of the 20-year-old woman pleading for justice went viral.“Of the four accused, Lalit Sharma is in police custody,” the ADG said. Lalit was arrested on Tuesday and the police produced him in a Hathras court, which then sent him to jail.The ADG has constituted teams of police personnel from Aligarh to assist the Hathras police. “Aligarh police are also in action to assist the Hathras police and additional teams have been constituted to nab the absconding accused. We hope that soon we would nab the culprits involved in the killing,” the ADG said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered strict action in the case and directed officials to invoke provisions of the stringent National Security Act (NSA) against the accused.The video of the woman invoked strong reactions from the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav who questioned the law-and-order situation in the state.In 2019, UP reported the most number of crimes against women, roughly one every 10 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Experts say that uneven law enforcement, feudal attitudes and lack of education contribute to the lack of safety for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-held-for-murder-of-sexual-assault-survivor-s-father-101614803657198.html

04-03-2021||India||Only Centre can enforce new digital media rules: I&B ministry to states||The information and broadcasting ministry on Wednesday told all states and Union territories that no state official, district magistrate (DM) or police commissioner has the power to seek information from any media house under the new digital media rules unless information is sought by the central government.A district magistrate in Manipur on Tuesday withdrew a notice served by him to a talk show under the new rules framed and announced by the Centre last week. This came after the central government intervened and said that states did not have the power to issue such notices.The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, which means Let’s Talk in Manipuri. This was probably the first such action against digital news anywhere in the country — four days after a gazette notification on the new digital media rules were published — but the notice was later withdrawn.The provisions under the new rules relate to the code of ethics for digital news publishers, setting up of a grievance redressal system and the requirement of disclosure of information to Centre, the ministry said. “These powers have not been delegated to state governments/district magistrates/police commissioners,” it added. These rules have to be administered by the ministry of information and broadcasting, it clarified. The rules relate to publishers of digital news and current affairs and publishers of online curated content (Over the Top).On Monday, the Centre sent a letter to the chief secretary of Manipur, a day after Imphal West district magistrate Naorem Praveen Singh served a notice to Manipuri talk show Khanasi Neinasi under the new laws.The show was hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the present Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and who has been jailed three times.The DM directed the media outlet to furnish all relevant documents to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. The notice was withdrawn after the Centre’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-centre-can-enforce-new-digital-media-rules-i-b-ministry-to-states-101614802720823.html
04-03-2021||India||Spectrograph designed for Uttarakhand telescope||A team of scientists from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciences (ARIES), Nainital, with help from the Indian Space Research Organisation, have designed and developed a spectrograph, an instrument that separates incoming light by its wavelength or frequency and records the resulting spectrum.The instrument will support the 3.6 metre Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) in Uttarakhand, an official release from the department of science said on Wednesday.The instrument costs nearly ₹4 crores and has been named Aries-Devasthal Faint Object Spectrograph & Camera (ADFOSC), the release said. So far, such spectrographs were imported by the country and cost nearly 2.5 times more.The instrument can detect faint light sources from distant quasars and galaxies, regions around supermassive black holes, and cosmic explosions and forms.The instrument uses several lenses made of special glass that enable it to produce sharp images of the celestial objects, the release said. It can capture light sources with photon rate of less than one photon per second. A 100-watt bulb emits 10^20 photons in a second.Now, ARIES plans to commission more complex instruments such as spectro-polarimeter and high spectral resolution spectrograph on the telescope, the release said.Dr Amitesh Omar from the institute led this project with experts from various institutes including Isro.“The indigenous efforts to build complex instruments like ADFOSC in India is an important step to become ‘Aatmanirbhar’ in the field of astronomy and astrophysics,” said professor Dipankar Banerjee, Director, ARIES.A test set-up of the new instrument was used to study the Crab Pulsar, which is a relatively young neutron star (the collapsed core of supergiant stars), the release said.Inaugurated in 2016, the 3.6 metre DOT is the largest fully-steerable optical telescope in Asia, which was built in collaboration with Belgium. However, it is of global importance as it fills in the twelve-hour longitudinal gap between 4m class telescopes located at Canary Island in the West and Australia in the East. The observation time on the telescope is shared 60% on competitive basis to astronomers in any Indian institution, 33% to astronomers from ARIES, Nainital, and 7% to Belgian astronomers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spectrograph-designed-for-uttarakhand-telescope-101614802330304.html
04-03-2021||India||‘Ceasefire need of the hour... desirable for both India, Pak’: Lt-Gen BS Raju||Calling the cessation of ceasefire violations between India and Pakistan on the Line of Control and the international border in Jammu and Kashmir a good beginning, Lt Gen BS Raju, General Officer Commanding of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, says that it will help find ways to stop terrorism and look for durable ways to peace in the region. “We are committed to making it work in letter and in spirit and expect the same from Pakistan,” said the outgoing commander of the strategically situated army formation on the western border, days after India and Pakistan announced a surprise truce deal. In an exclusive interview with Ramesh Vinayak, Lt Gen Raju, who is set to take over as the Director General of Military Operations in New Delhi, spoke about the fallout of stopping of ceasefire violations on the militancy matrix in the Valley and army’s anti-terror operations. Edited excerpts:How will the ceasefire on the LoC impact the insurgency dynamics in Kashmir?This truce deal is desirable for both India and Pakistan and it is the need of the hour. The biggest beneficiaries will be the civilians living close to the LoC. It is a good start to look for ways to stop terrorism and look for durable ways to peace in the region. We are committed to making it work in letter and spirit and expect the same from Pakistan. The stopping of ceasefire violations will have an impact on the terror ‘tanzeems’ (outfits) in the hinterland. We take the ceasefire as an opportunity to form a potent anti-infiltration grid to deny any fresh attempts of terrorists to infiltrate from LoC. Denial of access to foreign terrorists, weapons and finance will help us create a better environment to control terrorism in the hinterland. A quiet LoC will allow us to address the challenge of terrorism in a focused manner; this involves focusing on the entire terrorism ecosystem that includes terrorists and their overground workers.What is your assessment of the current situation in Kashmir?It is stable and looking to get better. The security matrix has maintaining peace as the prime goal. Improving our ability to ensure better security is a work in progress where we are continuously reviewing and innovating to enhance our effectiveness. 2020 witnessed success in counterterror and counter-infiltration operations. Our estimates show that we are at lowest level of terrorist strength in Kashmir in a decade. The terrorists are also short of weapons and cash.What are the new trends/undercurrent in dynamics of Pakistan’s cross-border tactics to foment trouble in the Valley?Pakistan has been trying to infiltrate weapons, cash and cadres. Along with Kashmir, it is continuing efforts to use Jammu and even Punjab border. Regular recoveries, arrest of infiltrators and even tunnels on the international border are evidence of these attempts. Lately, even quadcopters (drones) are being used to drop in weapons. For cash, the narco-terror link is also now well-established. Effective policing and actions by the National Investigating Agency have been effective in targeting narco trade and controlling the cash flow for terror. Also, there are attempts to energise local recruitment in terror organisations. The figures are higher than 2019 but still at a manageable level. It is one area where we hope to make further impact. Our focus is , first, to prevent recruitment and second to provide options for those who have joined terror (outfits) to get a chance to get back to society. A beginning has been made and we have had a few successes. Pakistan’s desire to manifest terror in the Kashmir valley continues. It cannot accept a peaceful J&K. Since its ability to do kinetic or terrorist actions is being blunted, it is focusing more energies on propaganda all over the world. In part, the propaganda effort is to convince Pakistan’s own population that they are doing something while diverting attention from internal challenges.Second, conscious effort is on to create online proxies for Pakistan- based terrorist organisations such as LeT and JeM. Earlier it was The Resistance Front (TRF) and People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF). In the last few weeks, we are seeing some new names appearing on social media. It is all linked to the Financial Action Task Force pressures and the desire to show that there is indigenous terror in J&K. The fact is that no terrorist organisation or even separatist has survived in Kashmir unless he is totally aligned to Pakistan. The “azadi” slogan is a fig leaf to fool the citizens of J&K. All terror organisations work under direct control of Pakistani handlers. We are clear that we have to counter Pakistani efforts both in the kinetic and information space. ate online proxies for Pakistan- based terrorist organisations such as LeT and JeM. Earlier it was The Resistance Front ( TRF) and People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF). In the last few weeks, we are seeing some new names appearing on social media. It is all linked to the Financial Action Task Force pressures and the desire to show that there is indigenous terror in J&K. The fact is that no terrorist organisation or even separatist has survived in Kashmir unless he is totally aligned to Pakistan. The “azadi” slogan is a fig leaf to fool the citizens of J&K. All terror organisations work under direct control of Pakistani handlers. We are clear that we have to counter Pakistani efforts both in the kinetic and information space.What have been the key tangible outcomes of the anti-terrorist grid in the Kashmir hinterland in the last one year?The anti-terrorist grid is critical to all our actions to get J&K back to peace, stability and prosperity. It gives us the ability to deny space to the terrorists. It is our prime responsibility that the citizens feel safe in doing their daily livelihood activities. We can see gradual opening of this space, despite Covid challenges. We can see people getting back to economic, cultural, sports and other activities.What is the current status of active terrorists/terror outfits operating in J&K?Over the past year, the terrorist leadership of all terrorist groups has been effectively targeted and eliminated. There is now a definite leadership void. The number of terrorists presently operating in the Valley is also reduced to the lowest in a decade. But they continue to have the capability to strike at soft targets – specially civilians. Last year witnessed 35 terrorist attacks on civilians. We are working to counter that threat. Pakistan has been constantly trying to falsely project emergence of new terror outfits such as TRF and PAFF. However, on ground, these outfits do not exist and is merely the IT Cell, which is active only on social media with an intent to shield terror outfit LeT and now, under some new names, JeM, Hizbul Mujahideen has suffered major losses and is presently weaker than it was probably was in 2019. There was an attempt to reactivate Al Badr but that has lost steam.In terms of locals versus foreigners, how has the terrorist mix evolved?Yes, this is important. The Pakistani terrorists hold finances and control over weapons; local terrorists are more for cannon fodder. As many as 39 local terrorists killed last year were with pistols. In contrast we get a good weapons and equipment haul whenever a Pakistani terrorist is killed. The number of Pakistani terrorists has been generally static since they have chosen to remain in the background and avoid contact with security forces. They are our preferred targets. The local terrorists’ numbers have been to some extent made up by fresh recruitment. This is our current focus area. We want them back into the mainstream. In all operations, we extend every opportunity to local terrorists to return. During the operation, if we get confirmation that a local terrorist is holed up, we try and identify them and then get their parents or elders to convince them to surrender. We are confident that this policy will yield positive results in the long-term.What have been the latest trends in infiltration and weapon smuggling from LoC in Kashmir? Has it shifted to the Jammu and Punjab borders?Pakistan has been exploring all options for infiltration for a long time. This has included the entire border of J&K and the northern parts of Punjab. With improved LoC surveillance, weapons smuggling has become a challenge for the Pakistan Army, hence they have been trying variety of things from tunnels to quadcopter drops to use of villages which are ahead of the LoC fence. Once weapons are infiltrated south of Banihal, they use local couriers, mostly trucks to transport the weapons to the terrorists in Kashmir valley. Recent cases of recoveries during checks in Banihal and interrogation of arrested personnel prove this modus operandi. We have enhanced checks on transport coming across Banihal and even on Mughal Road. This has led to recoveries of arms, equipment and drugs – establishing the narco-terror link.What has been the army’s response to the rising use of drones from across the border to drop weapons and drugs into the Indian side?Drones are a known challenge, from surveillance to now weapon drops. So far, weapon drops using drones has happened on a few occasions south of Pir Panjal. We are also conscious of this threat. We are in the process of upgrading our abilities to pick and bring down such drones. You will see the impact soon.What needs to improve in our security approach in Kashmir, intelligence, or operational capabilities, or local outreach and connect?We are looking at Kashmir with a holistic approach, encompassing all facets. It’s a long battle for change and we are not leaving any stone unturned. Intelligence is probably the biggest factor for the conduct of effective kinetic operations. Concurrently, outreach or connect with citizens is critical both for intelligence and ensuring denial of support structure to the terrorists. In conduct of kinetic operations, we are continuously innovating and upgrading to first give a chance to surrender and then act to eliminate the terrorist with minimum risk of collateral damage or risk to the troops.Technology provides options that we are continuously adopting to improve our methods.The army has been pushing for a policy to rehabilitate local boys who gave up the gun. But the policy has been in the works for a while. Any update?The rehabilitation policy is something that is a need. Our recommendations are with the government and are under consideration.How will the successful conduct of the district development council elections, the first political exercise in J&K since the abrogation of Article 370, impact the ground situation in the Valley?Any democratic activity is seen as a threat by Pakistan and its proxies in J&K. Providing security for the DDC elections was a challenge that was handled well. The next step is for the elected members to do their duties well. I’m sure these elections augur well for the future.What is your assessment on the possible fallout of withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan on Kashmir?Withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan can open up possibilities of revival of some terrorist organisations. However, Af-Pak has always been tough to forecast. I would not hurry to read the future in Afghanistan. As far impact on J & K, this is not the 90s. There is limited influence that can be exercised by anyone from across the LoC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ceasefire-need-of-the-hour-desirable-for-both-india-pak-lt-gen-bs-raju-101614801729958.html

The six shut funds had an estimated ₹25,000 crore as assets under management.The ED will look into the money laundering aspect in the matter for which it will summon company executives.The story will be updated when comments from Franklin Templeton will be available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-begins-probe-against-franklin-templeton-101614800613275.html
04-03-2021||India||Experts slam claim that human activity not behind Chamoli disaster||Experts on Wednesday criticised a statement by a top official of a research body under the DRDO who said human activity was “not the immediate cause” for the glacial breach and the deadly floods in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district last month, and that there was a need to look at “demographic pressures”.Over 70 people died after the February 7 floods that occurred after a lake breached at Nanda Devi glacier in the upper reaches of Himalayas, triggering flash floods that hit Raini village and nearly washed away two hydropower plants downstream.The Defence Geo-Informatics Research Establishment – a premier research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) that is studying the reasons for the February floods – said the tragedy was not “immediately” a human-induced disaster.But global warming and heating up of the Himalayas, which scientists say are decisively caused by human actions, could be the main reasons for the glacial breach in Chamoli district, Lokesh Kumar Sinha, director of DGRE, told HT at the body’s headquarters in Chandigarh.“There is a need to look upon the demographic pressures in a systematic way but as far as this particular tragedy is concerned in our preliminary investigations the role of human activity is not the immediate cause,” said Sinha. “It [glacial breach] was far away from the area where several constructions [NTPC hydel power project in Tapovan and Rishi Ganga hydel plant] are taking place,” Sinha added.Experts have repeatedly pointed out that glacial retreat due to climate crisis along with infrastructure projects such as dams could lead to large-scale disasters in the ecologically sensitive regions, while the proximity of human settlements could exacerbate loss of life and damage to property in Uttarakhand.Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed expert body to study the environmental impact of hydropower projects after the deadly 2013 Kedarnath floods, questioned how the February disaster was not linked to human activity.“Tragedy happened because over 200 people were working in two dams quite close to the glacial region. Had these dams not been here, the flash floods would have subsided without any loss to life and property”, he said.Dhyani added that the burden on the ecology due to construction on Himalayan slopes made the region prone to disasters.“And our expert body had also said that these paraglacial zones (sediment hot spots in Himalayas close to the glaciers) are vulnerable areas and warned that such disasters can take place in these areas...” he said. The environmental activist was referring to another SC-appointed committee, of which he was a part and which had recommended against development projects in the Rishi Ganga catchment area in 2014. But all recommendations of the panel were not accepted by the government. “The Chamoli tragedy happened because they built dams so close to the glaciers. And this is the main human trigger in this tragedy,” said Anil Joshi, founder of Dehradun-based NGO Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization (HESCO).Experts echoed their views.“It’s a preposterous statement. The official is belittling the tragedy... How can one ignore the impact of human induced climate change on the Himalayas... Any more unplanned construction or anthropogenic pressure on Uttarakhand will be suicidal,” said Mallika Bhanot of the Ganga Ahvaan NGO.Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Divecha Center for Climate Change at the Indian Institute of Science also cautioned there was a need to study the issue first. “We need to study the issue very critically before passing any judgement on this disaster. What was the distance between the Rishi Ganga power plant and the ice or rock which fell? Whether during the construction phase the project caused any micro-tremors? We don’t know anything yet and there should be scientific rigour in investigation before concluding anything,” said Kulkarni.On Wednesday, Sinha also said, “There are certain indications before such disasters take place and for forecasting them we need to develop gadgets which can map such indications...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-slam-claim-that-human-activity-not-behind-recent-flood-101614799919874.html
04-03-2021||India||Supreme Court issues notice on Gautam Navlakha’s plea for default bail||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice on a petition filed by civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha seeking default bail in a case pertaining to the Bhima-Koregaon violence being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).A bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph issued notice to NIA and posted the matter for hearing on March 15. Navlakha claimed in his petition filed through advocate Shadan Farasat that the 90-day period for filing of charge sheet was over and he was entitled to default bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Earlier, the Bombay High Court had on February 8 rejected the plea of the activist, who is facing serious charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged links with banned Maoist organization – Communist Party of India (Maoist).Navlakha stated in his petition that the 34 days of detention under house arrest should also be calculated as part of the custody undergone by him for the purposes of Section 167(2) CrPC.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal who appeared for Navlakha submitted that the 34 days period from August 28, 2018 to October 1, 2018 was crucial to his custody, in addition to the 11 days police custody (April 14, 2020 to April 25, 2020) and 46 days of judicial custody (April 25, 2020 to June 10, 2020).The HC refused to accept this plea. It had said that the order of keeping Navlakha under house arrest was already declared “illegal” by the Delhi High Court and hence this unlawful detention cannot be added under the period of arrest.Navlakha was first arrested in connected with this case in August 2018 when the case was probed by the Maharashtra Police. After NIA took over the probe last year, Navlakha surrendered in April 2020.The HC said, “It is not possible for us to fathom a situation where detention of the appellant (Navlakha) though held to be illegal and unlawful rendering the authorization by the Magistrate untenable should still be construed as an authorized detention for the purpose of Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”During the period of house arrest, he was not allowed to meet anybody and even the NIA did not have access to him. Further, the HC observed that the period of house arrest from August 28-October 10, 2018 cannot be treated as detention for purposes of investigation that resulted in deprivation of his personal liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-gautam-navlakha-s-plea-for-default-bail-101614798844765.html

Lama runs a private school at Namchi in south Sikkim.Pravin Gurung, deputy inspector general of Sikkim Police said, “Lama was arrested on Wednesday from Namchi. A complaint was lodged against him on Wednesday under the POCSO Act. He will be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours.”The DIG did not divulge the details of the complaint.After the arrest, Lama was admitted in a district hospital since his blood pressure shot up.Lama was being considered as the GJM candidate for the Kalimpong assembly seat in the coming polls, party leaders, who described the arrest as a setback, said, “The arrest comes at a time when the GJM’s Gurung faction is struggling to rejuvenate its ranks in the Darjeeling hills.”Gurung, as well as Benoy Tamang, leader of the other faction of the GJM, are supporting Mamata Banerjee though the two hill leaders are political rivals.Gurung went into hiding in 2017 after he was charged under the anti-terror law by the state government because of the violence witnessed during the Gorkhaland stir. After coming out of hiding in October last year Gurung said he will no longer support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 with his support. The Bengal government has started withdrawing the criminal charges against him.Lama was at the helm of affairs in GJM when Gurung was on the run for almost three-and-a-half years. Lama was also the deputy chairman of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) for almost five years since 2012. He was elected to the GTA from the Rongo-Todaytangta area.Roshan Giri, general secretary of the GJM (Gurung faction) said, “I cannot comment on his attest without knowing the details of the case.”After Lama’s arrest, the Tamang faction targeted Gurung on social media. “The arrest is a big shock for the GJM (Gurung faction) before the assembly election,” said one of the posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gjm-leader-close-to-bimal-gurung-arrested-under-pocso-in-sikkim-101614797598594.html
04-03-2021||India||Centre differs with SC on additional courts for cheque bounce cases||The Centre on Wednesday refused to play ball with the Supreme Court on a crucial reform suggestion to set up additional courts for expeditious trial of cheque bounce cases.The top court which is examining measures to fast-track cheque bounce cases in a suo moto proceeding had on February 25 sought the view of the Centre to create additional courts for exclusive trial of offences under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments (N.I) Act. The Court cited Article 247 of the Constitution which empowers Parliament to create additional courts for better administration of laws.In response, the Centre presented a three-page document comprising an Office Memorandum dated March 2, 2021 issued by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) and a two-page note attached with it.The note altogether dismissed the suggestion for creating additional courts. It said, “One of the major factors for high pendency is delay in ensuring the presence of the accused before the Court for trial. It is understood that most cases are pending due to absence of the accused. Under such circumstances, it is not clear how additional specific courts would provide a solution to the problem of a large number of pending cases.”Not happy with the response, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to appear in the case along with Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, who presented the note to the Court.The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt recorded in its order, “Prima facie we are of the view that the aforesaid Article 247 (of Constitution of India) confers a power coupled with duty on the Union of India to establish additional courts, for better administration of laws made by Parliament. There is no doubt or dispute about the fact that matters under the N.I Act have posed what by now has become an intractable problem, accounting for close to 30 to 40 per cent of the pendency in the trial courts and a very high percentage in High Courts as well.”The note prepared by DFS said, “Instead of setting up additional special courts, certain measures may be considered to reform the existing processes…To address the concerns that many accused attempt to obtain stay and adjournment on flimsy grounds, Supreme Court may consider capping the maximum number of hearings, and if the accused does not appear despite the measures mentioned above, then the passing of ex-parte may be considered by the (trial) court.”The note said that the root cause of delay in deciding cheque bounce cases was delay tactics employed by accused that could be resolved by measures such as levying penalty on non-appearance of accused, using coercive methods to secure presence of accused by way of attachment of property, deemed appearance despite repeated service of summons.Reacting to these suggestions, the bench noted in its order, “Having gone through the measures and heard learned counsel on the said measures, we find that the measures are, to say the least, inadequate for the purpose.”The bench asked ASG Banerjee, “In 30 per cent of cheque bounce cases, trial is help up as the accused is not being served summons. If you have come up with this suggestion to secure the presence of accused and hearing the case ex-parte, what is the solution…In this country, is it possible to have a trial with the accused in absentia. Cases are pending in our courts for this reason for over 15 to 20 years.”As no solution was forthcoming, the bench proposed forming a Committee headed by a retired High Court judge having vast experience as a trial judge and asked Centre to suggest names of bureaucrats from the concerned Central Ministries to be part of the Committee. The Court posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.The suggestion to set up additional courts for trial of Section 138 of N.I Act cases formed part of a preliminary report prepared by Court-appointed amici curiae senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar in October 2020.Though the Act prescribes a six-month deadline for completion of trial in a cheque bounce offence, a case under Section 138 NI Act on an average takes three years and eight months to be decided, the report prepared by the amici curiae stated. Increase in institution of cheque bounce complaints and failure to serve summons on the accused were identified as the chief causes behind the backlog.Their report stated that as on January 1, 2020, out of over 2.31 crore (over 20 million) criminal cases pending in the country, cheque bounce cases accounted for almost 15 per cent. One of their suggestions to speed up disposal of cheque bounce cases included creation of additional exclusive courts.In addition, they pressed for a major overhaul in the court processes by way of electronic service of summons, summary trial of cheque bounce cases, compulsory mediation at the pre-trial stage, and attachment of property of accused to the extent of the amount presented in the cheque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-differs-with-sc-on-additional-courts-for-cheque-bounce-cases-101614796853190.html

However, he withdrew the letter on Wednesday after he was convinced that his plan would not help in getting rid of his physical problem.Satish Deshmukh, assistant account officer with the district collectorate had written to collector Vipin Itankar seeking the permission on Wednesday.“I have decided to buy a horse to come to the office, as I cannot ride my bike due to a spinal problem. Kindly grant me the permission to tie the horse on the office premises,” Deshmukh wrote in his letter.The letter went viral on social media within hours of its submission. But before the day was over, the officer was convinced by medical advice that his demand would rather cause him more problems.“We sought the opinion from the dean of the district medical college. We consulted an orthopaedic surgeon from the college. The report said that his demand was against the medical science and would not serve any purpose for which he wants to buy a horse. He was convinced with the report and sought permission to withdraw the request which was given to him,” said Pradeep Kulkarni, resident deputy collector, Nanded.Deshmukh was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-in-maharashtra-wanted-to-ride-horse-to-office-to-overcome-spinal-problem-101614796371065.html

It will also act as a “legal framework for the procurement under the government-to-government modality”, he said.There was no official word from the Indian side on the development.Hindustan Times had first reported last November that India and the Philippines are looking to sign an agreement on the BrahMos cruise missile this year, making the Southeast Asian country the first customer for the weapons system developed jointly by New Delhi and Moscow.At the time, the two sides were working to sort out a few remaining issues for the deal to supply the missiles to the Philippines Army’s first Land Based Missile System Battery, people familiar with developments had said on condition of anonymity.The actual agreement on the missiles is expected to be inked during a meeting of leaders of the two countries this year.Russian officials have also said India and Russia are working to gradually increase the range of the BrahMos and begin exporting the missile to third countries, starting with the Philippines.The Philippines Army zeroed in on the BrahMos after extensive trials and much of the negotiations have revolved around the cost of the system and financing for the deal. India has offered a $100-million line of credit to the Philippines for defence purchases.India has also been in talks with several Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, over the past few years to sell them land and sea-based versions of the BrahMos.The draft defence production policy of 2018 set an ambitious target of achieving defence exports worth $5 billion by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-signs-pact-with-philippines-for-supply-of-brahmos-missile-101614795752832.html

It makes sense to leave the slots open ended especially for working professionals who do not have any fixed timings and prefer early mornings or late nights,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals.The Union health ministry has been making modifications to the vaccination process since it was opened for the general public on March 1 to suit the needs of the elderly and those with comorbidities.“We made changes to the Co-WIN application to make it more convenient for general population as they can choose the hospital, date and even time slot for vaccination. As we progress, there will be more changes made based on the feedback to make it as easy for people to take the shot as possible,” said RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.The Union government has also allowed states to increase the number of private hospitals as Covid vaccination centres by including facilities outside of the network empanelled under Ayushman Bharat scheme, central government health insurance scheme, and other state insurance schemes.“There are at least four states that have not signed up for the Ayushman Bharat scheme. It is better if states see their requirement and expand the list of Covid vaccination centres to include those that fulfil the criteria,” said Sharma.At least 16 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered to people till Wednesday evening as per the government data. Government is urging eligible persons to come forward and get vaccinated as cases in some parts of the country are seeing a rise.Six states in India currently contribute nearly 86% of the new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), government data showed.The states, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Karnataka also continue to report a surge in the daily new cases.On Wednesday, 14,989 new cases were registered from across the country, of which Maharashtra has reported the highest daily new cases at 7,863. Maharashtra is followed by Kerala with 2,938 cases, while Punjab reported 729 new cases.According to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Karnataka have shown the maximum increase in new cases on a week on week basis.“Maharashtra alone accounted for a weekly increase of 16,012 cases, in terms of the number of cases. In percentage terms, Punjab reported the weekly increase of 71.5% (1,783 cases),” said health ministry in a statement.Central teams that have been rushed to these states, to assist local authorities in managing the situation, are trying to get to the cause, and initial observation says large gatherings and drop in overall testing could have led to the surge.“It is a season of weddings, and people tend to gather in large numbers on such occasions and also there is somewhat laxity in observing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Another reason could be drop in overall testing as some of the states where there has been seen a surge, Covid-19 testing relatively went down. The teams have been directed to brief the state authorities in detail about the reasons so that the situation can be managed accordingly,” said a senior government official in the know of things, who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-24x7-vaccination-as-surge-continues-in-six-states-101614795452793.html

It was received by its Canadian partner Verity Pharmaceuticals, located in the Greater Toronto Area town of Mississauga.Delivery of the first tranche of a total of two million doses scheduled by mid-May was announced by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.During a media interaction, he said, “Very early this morning, our first half a million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine from the Serum Institute arrived in Canada. Already, the national operations centre has worked with provinces and territories to coordinate shipments of these vaccines across the country. Our priority is to get doses into arms as soon as possible.”Canada’s minister of public services & procurement Anita Anand and India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria were present for the receipt of the batch of vaccine. “Thank you to all whose hard work made this happen. We look forward to future collaboration,” Anand tweeted. In a statement, Bisaria said, “India is proud to support Canada’s vaccination program. With more than 60 percent of global vaccine manufacturing capacity, India believes in vaccine internationalism and is providing a healing hand as the world recovers from this deadly pandemic.”  The shipment has an expiry date of about a month from now and Canadian public health authorities are accelerating the process of getting the doses distributed and administered across the country.Health Canada had given authorisation to the SII product last week. Canada is the first Western nation and the only G7 country to receive vaccines from India under the government’s Vaccine Maitri initiative.The AstraZeneca vaccine is the third shot to have been cleared by Canada after those made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Canada will receive a total of 22 million doses of the AstraZeneca inoculation, which includes the consignment from India.Trudeau had called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February with a request for vaccines and the Indian PM had then took to Twitter to say that he “was happy to receive a call from my friend, @JustinTrudeau”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-canada-receives-500-doses-of-made-in-india-covishield-vaccine-101614795096065.html
04-03-2021||India||Centre proposes to take over mine auction, some states oppose||The Union mines ministry has proposed amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, allowing captive mine owners to sell up to 50% of the approved capacity in the open market and also giving itself the power to auction mines that the states have failed to auction.The changes have been opposed by some states that see it as another attempt by the Centre to take over mining auctions and impose central rules on a matter in state domain. Except for coal, states are allowed to auction other mines in consultation with the mines ministry. Parliament in September 2020 approved an Ordinance promulgated in June to improve revenue from the mining sector and the Centre now wants states to carry out these changes too.In a note to amend the law circulated to all states, the mines ministry said the new amendments have been proposed in the law after consultation with Union ministries and state governments to improve revenue from the mining sector and to reduce dependence on imports.The ministry has proposed a new provision in the law to allow sale of 50% of minerals from captive mines in open market after meeting the need of the plant with which the mining block is attached.Under the captive mines scheme, the mineral can be mined only for the plant to which it is attached. No royalty is charged for minerals mined from captive mines.With the change in law, the government is looking at increasing production, especially from the captive coal mines. There are 194 captive coal blocks in India that were auctioned between 1993 and 2011, and which have coal reserves of 44 billion tonnes.“This (market sale) will help to increase production of coal from captive mines, increase coal availability in the market leading to reduction in import of coal. This will also ensure additional revenue to the states and lead to Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat,” the ministry’s proposal said.India has the world’s fifth-largest known coal reserves, or nearly 10% of global reserves, and is the world’s second-largest producer of the mineral. There has been increasing demand from climate change activists that India should declare a deadline year by which it will stop using coal. China has already said that it will stop doing so by 2050.To improve revenue, the ministry has fixed up to 2.5 times of the existing royalty for allowing commercial sales from the captive mines. A decision on how much mineral from each captive mine can be sold will be taken by the mines and coal ministries, the note says.Licence holders currently pay a royalty of ₹50 to ₹250 for a tonne of coal depending on its quality and ₹800 per tonne of asbestos. For several other minerals, the royalty is charged on ad valorem (percentage of the sale price) basis as per the rates published by Indian Bureau of Mines. The ad valorem royalty ranges from 0.4% per tonne for bauxite to 12% for copper.A mines ministry official said that streamlining of the auctions would help in better utilisation of mines and ensure flow of minerals for industries to improve production. “There are many indirect benefits as it improves overall tax collections for the Centre and states and also creates additional employment avenues,” he said.The ministry justified changes in the auction rules saying that it would “ensure continuous supply of minerals in the country and more number of mineral blocks are required to be brought under auction on a regular basis.” Any delay in auction will have substantial impact on the availability as well as prices of minerals, the note said.Another amendment proposed is to empower the Central government to auction mines, which the states have failed to auction. Of the 143 such mines listed for auctioning, states have auctioned only 7 since 2015, the amendment said. According to mines ministry officials, the states were getting about ₹10,000 crore as revenue from these mines.“Further, mining lease in relation to 334 blocks expired on 31 March 2020, out of which 46 are working mines. The Ministry of Mines is pursuing with the state governments since early 2019 for early auction of these blocks ensuring continuity in production of minerals. Only 28 blocks have been auctioned till date,” added the ministry.A ministry official who was not willing to be named said that the delay in auctioning by the states is causing a huge revenue loss to the states. “The Centre wants to help the states to get their money, especially in the time of pandemic when the revenue has gone down and expenditure has increased for state governments. The mining reforms are aimed at ease of doing business and improve foreign direct investment in the mineral sector,” the official added.Some states have opposed the proposal.A senior official of Chhattisgarh's mining department said there are various reasons, including the feasibility of a mine and the net mineable reserves as against the estimated resources in a mine and market conditions apart from the time needed for technical preparations, for delay in mine auctions. “Like Centre, every state is interested in auction of mines but limitations are there for both Centre and the state. Under cooperative federalism, the states should be allowed to exercise their right to bring their mines to auction after considering all the associated parameters,” he said.On the mines ministry’s proposal, Shankar Sinha, Jharkhand’s director, Mines, said, “The state government was finalising its own policy on the issues listed in the mines ministry’s proposal. Once that is done, we would send our suggestions to the Central government. Jharkhand government in June 2020 moved Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining in several states without taking states on board as it would have adverse impact on local population and price fetched may not be adequate.Odisha mines minister Prafulla Mallik said they have reservations on certain provisions of the proposed changes in the law as it takes away the state power to auction mines. “We have questions regarding why the Centre wants to take over auctions and have sought clarifications,” he said, while supporting the ministry’s proposal to hike rates for sale of minerals from captive mines. Odisha mines secretary Surendra Kumar said the state has already sent its reply to the mines ministry.Also Read: Goa ecologists, miners oppose Centre’s proposed amendments to mining actIn Goa, the Goa Mining People’s Front, a collective of Mine Worker Unions has also opposed the proposal. “The Centre taking over the auctioning could lead to legal hurdles in resuming mining in Goa, which is stuck since 2018 when the Supreme Court cancelled all mining leases,” said Puti Gaonkar, the president of the GMPF. The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), an association of mine owners, has also written to the ministry opposing the proposal giving powers to the Centre to auction mines.Reacting to the proposal, Goa Foundation Director Claude Alvares, said the Centre forcibly auctioning the mines at less than market value would amount to ‘cheating’, while referring to mineral resources as a shared inheritance, owned by state governments as a trustee for the people.“How would states then fulfil their duties as public trustees to conserve the shared inherited mineral wealth if they have no control over it. How would states meet intergenerational equity? These proposals violate the principle of subsidiary and the federal structure of our Constitution,” he said.(With inputs from Vishal Kant in Raipur, Debabrata Mohanty in Bhubaneswar and Ritesh Mishra in Raipur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-propose-to-take-over-mine-auction-some-states-oppose-101614757311685.html

But the health ministry has clarified that the registration process is going on smoothly. The initial hiccups were primarily because there was a huge load on the site and also because many people thought that an app will have to be downloaded.Here are five things that you must keep in mind while booking an appointment on Co-win> There is no app for self-registration. The process has to be done on cowin.gov.in website.> You can add three more people from one mobile number. So, four people can be added using one mobile number.> Once you book your appointment for vaccination, you will receive an SMS with the appointment details on your mobile number. Apart from that, confirmation details will flash on the screen, which can be downloaded. The confirmation details too should be saved.> Rescheduling of appointment can be done through Co-Win site, but it has to be done before the vaccination appointment day. Rescheduling can also be done to a vaccination centre in another city if one has to travel.> Many fraudulent apps, links are impersonating the official link. The health ministry has reiterated to not fall for these tricks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-things-to-keep-in-mind-while-registering-on-co-win-for-covid-19-vaccine-101614752501809.html
04-03-2021||Today's||In defence of rooted Indian nationalism||In his reply to the motion of thanks in the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of Indian nationalism, and argued that nationalism in India is neither narrow-minded nor aggressive. But he suggested that it has come under attack of late, with every occasion being used to mock and demean India. Referring to the threat of “foreign destructive ideology”, the PM was right in underlining that we remain far too much in awe of the theories and constructs flowing in from the West.The false parallels drawn between nationalism in western countries and nationalism in India exemplify it. Unlike the exclusivist nationalism in the West built around linguistic or ethnic supremacism, Indian nationalism emerged in opposition to imperialism. Since its inception, Indian nationalism endeavored to bring together people of different languages, religions, castes, classes, and ethnicities based on unity in diversity. And despite the setback caused by Muslim separatism and consequent Partition, it continues to champion the same values of democracy, liberty, diversity, and equality. To equate it with the western concept of nationalism and “de-construct” it in line with fashionable western intellectual trends is remarkable intellectual bankruptcy.Take, for instance, the grandiloquent talk about being a patriot and not a nationalist. Patriotism is a pre-industrial construct rooted in the patriarchal notions of “blood and soil”, i.e. defence of land and kinsmen. It served the same practical purpose as nationalism in an industrial society. But a faux debate is generated to make nationalism sound regressive and, in millennial slang, uncool and glorify the agrarian, patriarchal construct of patriotism.With intricate ties to the wider Anglosphere, India is precariously placed in the face of wokeness and social science theories emanating from American universities. For many years, there has been a concerted attempt to delegitimise not just India’s anti-imperialist struggle and Indian nationalism but also Hinduism and the existence of Hindus as a people too. In this academic discourse, each of these categories has been converted into an “oppressive identity”, whose destruction is crucial to attain the elusive “azadi”.This mirrors academic and intellectual trends within America itself. Just like the “preservation of slavery” has been sought to be placed at the heart of the American war of independence, the “preservation of the caste-system” has been attributed as the main motive behind India’s freedom struggle. Indian nationalism is painted as a conspiracy of the upper castes to deny the political aspirations of the Dalits, backward classes and minorities.But far from being a tool of oppression, Indian nationalism has been a force of integration and upliftment of the masses. The growth of nationalism enabled people to transcend the narrow confines of caste and community. It propelled them to create common platforms and advocate social reform and economic upliftment of the masses. Indian nationalism does not seek to conquer or colonise other countries. Instead, it supported national struggles in other countries under imperialist rule, emphasising sovereignty and democracy.Indian nationalism has always been inward-looking and focused on national development, which was always strongly imbued with welfare and social justice goals. The resolutions on fundamental rights and national economic programme in 1931 Karachi resolution of the Congress, an umbrella organisation of mostly Hindu nationalistic forces, amply demonstrate this. In India, nationalism resonates with the masses as a positive construct, unlike its western variant. Nationalism binds this diverse geography and demographics together, something that would have been otherwise unimaginable.But this critical distinction is often forgotten, and the idea that nationalism needs to be banished has taken hold in urban intellectual discourse. But such adventurism has proved costly even for America, where the deconstruction of a common narrative, banishment of nationalism and dethronement of religion has created a crisis of identity and polity. Instead of a nation, there are just different groups in silos such as Blacks, White males, LGBTQ+, women, and a range of ethnic categories, making agreement even on basic issues strenuous. With a far more complex society and social fault lines, India needs to academically, socially and politically contest attempts to push such theories and ideas in our context.The sanctity of the nation and territorial integrity of states should not be confused with grandiose constructs such as constitutional patriotism. A Constitution simply reflects the underlying working of the nation and demographics, and not the other way around. Without state power to enforce it, it is just another book. This is starkly reflected in how the Indian Constitution is weakest in regions where Indian nationalism is weak. Another charge of nationalism vs Hindu nationalism is an old one. Before Independence, the Congress was called a Hindu nationalist party and nationalism a Hindu supremacist construct. There is nothing new in these charges and the language now deployed against the BJP and Indian nationalism.India needs to strongly reassert nationalism in the realm of ideas and mass culture and push back against the attempt to confuse or delegitimise it. And the task starts with resisting the theories sweeping in from the Anglosphere while rejuvenating social sciences in India, rooted in Indian reality. The decoupling of social sciences in India and the wider Anglosphere must be the next decolonisation movement.Abhinav Prakash Singh is an assistant professor, economics, Sri Ram College of CommerceThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-defence-of-rooted-indian-nationalism-101614866928388.html
04-03-2021||Today's||Why the battle of Bengal matters||In West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has emerged as the chief challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), which has ruled West Bengal for 10 years. This, in and of itself, is a major change in Bengal’s politics, where the BJP had never been much of an electoral factor.Building on an astounding performance in the 2019 election, where it won 18 out of 42 seats, the BJP has a genuine opportunity to win in the upcoming state election. If it does win, it will have major reverberations across Indian politics. To date, the vast majority of the BJP’s electoral dominance has been built in areas where its chief opponent is the Congress, and in large Hindi-speaking states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. For the party, states such as Tamil Nadu or West Bengal ruled by “vernacular parties” — regional parties that use linguistic nationalism as part of their appeal — were once considered unattainable.A careful look at how the BJP has risen in Bengal, and how the ruling TMC has sought to counteract its growth, is instructive in understanding the new dimensions of the BJP’s appeal and possible templates to defeat it.If we calculate the 2019 Lok Sabha results by West Bengal’s 294 assembly constituency (AC) segments, the BJP led in 121 ACs with an average of 40.6% constituency-wise vote share. The TMC won 164 ACs on a 43.6% average of constituency-wise vote share. The Congress and the Left had a combined average constituency-wise vote share of just 13%, with the Congress winning nine ACs and the Left winning none.In addition to subsuming the vote share of the Left and the Congress, there were strong identity-based factors to the BJP’s rise. Unlike in other states, where the BJP has an upper-caste base, the BJP support has grown the fastest among West Bengal’s marginalised communities. The BJP led in 46 (55%) of the state’s 84 Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe reserved seats, while winning just 75 (36%) of the remaining 210 ACs. High levels of Hindu-Muslim polarisation were also observed. According to Lokniti’s 2019 National Election Survey, 57% of Hindu voters selected the BJP as compared to 32% of Hindu voters supporting the TMC. By contrast, the TMC won 70% of Muslim voters with the BJP winning a negligible amount (4%).This identity-based polarisation is visible on the ground today and is the key demographic heuristic one can use to analyse the BJP’s chances.Approximately 30% of West Bengal’s voters are Muslims and, as a rule of thumb, we can classify the remaining 70% of the state’s voters as Hindu. Given a negligible amount of Muslim support for the BJP, this implies that the BJP is likely to win if it can get about 60-65% support among the Hindu population. To tap this, the BJP has begun a poriborton yatra, one that looks strikingly similar to the rath yatra that yielded national electoral dividends for the BJP in 1990.The pattern of extreme Hindu-Muslim polarisation and campaign strategies that exacerbate the divide between these communities have been seen as a trump card for the BJP. To be sure, there are other concerns for the TMC, from a series of high-profile defections to concerns that its ground-level cadre is excessively dominant and violent. But the TMC’s core challenge is to prevent an “identity-based” vote along caste, tribe, and religious lines.In a similar position, Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sought to reduce polarisation by taking more ambiguous stands on Hindu-Muslim political issues. And one might have assumed that the TMC’s approach would be to “pander” to the Hindu vote given the situation. But the TMC, along with political strategist Prashant Kishor, who also advised AAP, has taken a different approach.The party has positioned itself as a “progressive” alternative to the BJP and its vision of India. In addition to linguistic nationalism, the TMC has projected itself as concerned with gender equity and social delivery. (This is all the more noticeable as the Left and Congress look to ally with controversial cleric Abbas Siddiqui). In one strikingly visual example, on Republic Day, when the vast majority of states opted for religious or tradition-themed tableaus, West Bengal featured a schoolgirl studying in front of a laptop (a latent advertisement for state government schemes targeting girls and women). In December 2020, the state government also initiated the duare sarkar (government at your doorstep) programme, in which people can avail of state government schemes by visiting local melas — the government claims this reached 22 million citizens between December 1, 2020 and January 18, 2021.This narrative fits well with the popularity of Mamata Banerjee as the only female chief minister (CM) in India, and one who has focused on delivery. Indeed a recent CVoter poll found that 55% of voters want her to continue as CM, and almost half of voters believe duare sarkar will help the TMC’s re-election.We do not yet know which way the wind will blow in Bengal. If the TMC achieves the unthinkable — a big victory amid large-scale attempts at polarisation and pressure from central agencies — it will set a template for how to fight the current dispensation and show that voters are willing to vote for a progressive alternative to the BJP.Neelanjan Sircar is an assistant professor, Ashoka University, and senior visiting fellow, Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-the-battle-of-bengal-matters-101614866929314.html
04-03-2021||Today's||BARC plays a valuable role. Preserve it||The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) continues to face criticism from multiple quarters, with powerful voices even going so far as to ask the broadcast industry to jettison it, once and for all. Is this reasonable?Ratings, of BARC type, are indispensable for the broadcast industry. Linear television is not ready for 100% customisation. Streaming services do it at great cost. Linear TV is, and will, for the foreseeable future, remain, the optimum pipe for live content. Public Service Broadcasting is often funded by the exchequer and must deliver the widest audience at the lowest cost. Given its focus on public service over profits, it hews toward linear, unencrypted, non-addressed, free-to-air (FTA) delivery. Conditionally accessed (CAS) content creates a trackable record of household consumption, since the distribution platform is theoretically able to see and store tune-in information, but unencrypted content does not. If an FTA unencrypted channel sells advertising, how will it price inventory? Most licensed channels are FTA, and only a handful of distribution platforms actually have return paths. What universally acceptable basis can they offer to transact advertising? This leads us to a deeper set of issues. First, a bit of history. Television audience measurement started with the BBC in the mid-1930s. As a broadcaster funded by the United Kingdom exchequer, BBC was accountable to the House of Commons. When questions were asked about the value of the TV channel to a television-owning Londoner, the Beeb established a research department that would conduct day-after-recall sampling to assess programme relevance. This question continues to bedevil broadcasters, and tune-in data, even where available, sheds no light on it.Second, advertising-funded platforms, whether Facebook or Google, have encyclopedic detail on registered users and their consumption behaviours. They produce little content — so they are best served when they carry the widest possible range from third parties to fulfil expectations of consumers on the farthest end of the “long tail”. While platforms know exactly who is consuming what, the actual content owners can only access aggregates and averages, but are content to leave the matter there as long as their advertising revenue is juicy enough. It is disingenuous to compare audience measurement for TV broadcasters with that for these platforms.It is a separate matter that advertisers are making their displeasure about the “census” measurements offered by these mega-platforms quite clear. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s global marketing czar, has been particularly scathing, making it clear that the numbers these platforms claim are massively inflated. A Netflix show, The Social Dilemma, has shone an unflattering light on the invasion of privacy by digital platforms. Growing awareness of privacy concerns and regulatory interventions now place limits on the collection, storage and use of user data on such platforms. The laissez-faire they enjoyed is over for the moment.Third, the term “census” connotes comprehensive, unlike “sample” which suggests only partial. As a result, it seems self-evident that census data is superior to sample data for its sheer scale. Return Path Data (RPD) is supposed to be “census” data in contrast to panel data, which BARC uses. But there is a fatal flaw in this contention. RPD is proprietary to distribution platform owners, and they would probably breach privacy statutes if they shared household demographics with a measurement body. In any case, they would treat their subscriber details as commercially invaluable, and be loathe to part with them. Samples are also better placed to accurately mirror the underlying population by reflecting its composition along multiple axes.And finally, assume, counterfactually, that reliable RPD was available from all commercial distribution platforms. You would still need an agnostic party to compile and weight it. And we would leave out DD-Direct, mortally impairing the measurement. BARC has its problems. But the solution is unlikely to lie in denouncing it. It is still the best bet for hundreds of broadcasters to remain viable, and hundreds of millions of viewers to enjoy the fruits of their exertion.Paritosh Joshi is a media professional with a keen interest in audience measurementThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/barc-plays-a-valuable-role-preserve-it-101614866924048.html
04-03-2021||Today's||Refine the Covid-19 vaccination strategy||Delhi had its first Covid-19 case this week, last year. Over this period, India has been able to keep the number of new cases, transmission rates as well as deaths at relatively lower levels, compared to many developed nations with better public health systems. Till recently, we have also seen a dip in infection rates in many parts of the country.Having said that, the pandemic is not over until it is actually over. In fact, we need to be extra cautious during the downward trend of number of new cases, just as we would during the descent after scaling peaks. Pandemics also behave in set patterns in terms of trajectory. I wrote last June, that Covid-19 is no exception and there will be multiple peaks and we need to prepare our health systems for these surges. Even as the brutal first wave of the pandemic waned, numbers have begun rising again. With the opening of borders and international travel, it is, also, almost impossible to stop newer variants from entering India.As we enter into the second year of Covid-19 pandemic, we do have reasons to be optimistic. The momentous scientific achievement of past 12 months has been the development, testing, scrutiny, and approval of vaccines in the shortest possible timeline. Vaccination is the single-most important strategy to end the Covid 19 pandemic. Despite the appearance of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as general vaccine hesitancy, vaccines provides a real measure of hope. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the rare but possible risks as per our present understanding.Though there has been steady progress with world’s largest vaccination campaign in India, which began in mid-January, there is still a long way before it achieves targets. Since the vaccination roll out drive began at a time of falling infection rates, it gave us a crucial window to get the better of the virus quickly. The experience from the West shows that the second, or subsequent, waves are usually more pronounced.The second phase of roll out, which began this week, is a welcome and commendable step towards expanding the availability of vaccine as well as making it available at affordable rates in the private sector. The rationale behind who we vaccinate, and in which order, is crucial to achieve the goal of vaccinating maximum number of people at risk and towards achieving vaccine-induced herd immunity. Since there is no issue of lack of intent, effort, or resources, an alternative approach should be explored which may turn out to be complementary to the existing strategy.One of these is vaccine deployment based on burden and severity of Covid-19 in different states in India. There have been major state-level differences in the burden and mortality from Covid-19 owing to the large size and the heterogeneous population of our country. As some of us reported in a recent paper “Macrolevel association of COVID-19 with non-communicable disease risk factors in India” published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews, the more urbanised states in India have greater a higher proportionate case burden and mortality from Covid-19 than rural ones. Greater Covid-19 related mortality has also been reported among persons with various non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Our paper was based on an analysis of cumulative and weekly national and state-level data on Covid-19 cases and deaths from a publicly available database. This was correlated with health care related factors and social variables.The study covered at least 9.5 million Covid-19 cases and 135,000 deaths reported in India from March 2 till the end of November 2020. While the national burden of cases and deaths is 6900/million and 100.4/ million respectively, there were wide disparities in rates of cases and deaths across states, with reported cases of more than 20,000/million in states of Delhi and Goa and 10,000-20,000/million in a number of states. Similarly deaths rates of more than 300/million are observed in Delhi (490), Goa (434) and Maharashtra (383). The case-fatality rate also showed significant differences, with less than 0.5% in Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and Assam to more than 2% in Punjab, Maharashtra and Sikkim.Data on various state-level demographic indices also showed wide variability. There was significant positive correlation of state-level Covid-19 cases and deaths per million, respectively, with epidemiological transition index (0.59, 0.44), literacy (0.46, 0.46), indices of health care availability (0.23, 0.18), health care accessibility and quality (0.71, 0.61), urbanisation (0.75, 0.73) and human development (0.61, 0.56). These figures reveal that just as our population is aging and the disease profile is changing from infectious diseases to lifestyle ones (which is the essence of the epidemiological transition index), the pandemic is also showing a similar trend with states with a high per capita income, and a high burden of these non communicable diseases, displaying a high burden of Covid-19.Our analysis conclusively shows that in India, the more urbanised and better developed states have greater burden and mortality from Covid-19 and need vaccinations earlier than other states. This study also reaffirms that the pandemic in India is still an urban phenomenon. In countries with a similar profile — a larger proportion of rural population — including China, Brazil, Iran, Mexico and South Africa, reports have highlighted a similar predominantly urban nature of the disease. This has important implications for implementation of population and individual level preventive measures and equitable vaccine deployment.A judicious strategy targeted at the urban population, especially the vulnerable, could be the most appropriate intervention. My suggestion is that such states, including Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu should get priority in the vaccination drive. This re-prioritisation of vaccine deployment may well be an alternative way out of the pandemic and help us return to a semblance of normalcy across the country soon.Rajinder K Dhamija is the head of neurology department, Lady Hardinge Medical College and SSK Hospital , New Delhi.

04-03-2021||Today's||Where are India’s women leaders?||With International Women’s Day approaching on March 8, the United Nation’s upcoming Generation Equality Forum aims to focus on feminist movements and leadership as an action agenda. However, in India, climbing the ladder of political leadership remains a deeply inequitable enterprise. While reservations have improved women’s participation, much of the day-to-day functioning of Indian politics remains a man’s game.At the national-level, while the 2019 Lok Sabha elections saw an increase in representation of women representatives, only 14% of the Members of Parliament (MPs) in India are women. At the state-level, women make up only nine per cent of the elected candidates of state legislative assemblies. Globally, India ranks 122 out of 153 countries when it comes to women’s representation in parliament, according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2020.Women’s representation in panchayats in India, on the other hand, is relatively better, thanks to the reservations brought in by the 73rd constitutional amendment that ensure one-third of leadership positions for women. However, this increased representation masks the barriers that women face in getting elected or while in office.Evidence suggests that women candidates in India differ from their male counterparts in a number of ways. First, women candidates are more likely to come from political or wealthy families. A frequent path to panchayat leadership for women is belonging to political families where men are unable to serve due to a reserved seat. This pattern is also reflected at the national level. 42% of women MPs come from political families compared to 15% of male MPs. This could be because campaign expenses required to run for office tend to favor more well-off families and being embedded in political families ensures greater resources. Women candidates are also assumed to have an added sense of electability when their family members are popularly known.Second, women candidates, unlike male candidates, are much more likely to run in SC/ST reserved seats than general seats. At the panchayat level, reservations for women can unintentionally make it difficult for women to contest general seats, which have come to be seen as seats for men.Third, political aspirations are notably different between men and women. In one study of panchayat chiefs in Karnataka, less than three per cent of women candidates contested for a second term. Studies also reveal a “backlash effect” in states with higher gender bias, where the election of women leads less women to run in future cycles.Much of the absence of women in political leadership stems from gender gaps in overall political participation. While female voter turnout has even surpassed men’s in some states, women’s political involvement in non-electoral activities lags behind.Women are less involved when it comes to participation in campaigns and contacts with public officials. Women candidates also have less education and experience, on average, compared to male candidates. There are also different societal expectations from political leaders of different genders. Some research has shown that people can be less satisfied with women leaders even though they are shown to produce equal or greater results.The gender gap in contestants collides with growing literature highlighting the benefits of women’s leadership. Evidence shows that having women leaders leads to improved provision of public goods and greater addressal of women’s issues, such as in health and education. There is also consensus that local-level reservations have increased bargaining power and improved the situation of women overall in India. This includes improving political participation — women have been shown to speak up more in village meetings when the panchayat head is a woman.These results align with the larger discourse on women leadership, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Recent research shows that countries with governments headed by women have arguably managed the pandemic better. In the United States too, research suggests that states with women governors had fewer Covid-19-related deaths. Yet, despite yielding improved outcomes, a recent study suggests that women are being left out of decision making at all levels of Covid-19 response structures.An often-ignored quality of women leaders, which may also explain their more empathetic Covid-19 response, is their “soft skills”. Women tend to outperform men in areas such as coaching others and building trusting relationships.It is not as though India is not ready for gender equality. In a recent international opinion survey, a large majority (76%) of respondents in India think the government “should do more” to promote gender equality. Interestingly, 49% of respondents want the government to “reform laws to promote equality between women and men and end discrimination against women”.Perhaps it is time that longstanding promises from political parties to pass the decades-in-waiting Women’s Reservation Bill be met. The idea may be radical, but if evidence on India’s reservation system for women in local panchayats is considered, then it may require affirmative action to give women the space they deserve in Indian policymaking.Soumya Kapoor Mehta is the head and Steven Walker is a consultant at the Initiative for What Works to Advance Women and Girls in the Economy (IWWAGE), Krea UniversityThe views expressed are personal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/where-are-india-s-women-leaders-101614781421864.html
04-03-2021||Today's||There is a looming epidemic — of loneliness. Take it seriously||Imagine a hypothetical scenario. Vibha Saxena, a 72-year-old professor of literature, has spent her life in Dehradun, where her children grew up and where her husband passed away a year ago. Though she lives alone, Saxena cannot think of a time she ever felt lonely. Why? Because her day has been curated by her relationship manager. At 8 am sharp, she calls Saxena to check in, sharing news headlines and reminding her to be ready for her online class in the evening.Saxena looks forward to these conversations, comforted in knowing that there is someone available at the click of a button. At 10 am, Saxena’s app alerts her to take her medications. By 10.30 am, her home is cleaned by a team arranged by the manager. At lunchtime, a professional meal service, organised by the same manager, arrives with the special diet necessary for her heart condition.In the afternoon, Saxena’s app reminds her it is time for her online English Literature class. She logs in and is excited to see a global audience for her class on Shakespeare, welcoming her with loud applause. After a busy day, Saxena looks forward to having dinner in peace while video-chatting with her newfound friend who she met online recently.This imaginary life represents the possibilities in the battle against loneliness, an epidemic running so deep and with such impact, that it dwarfs Covid-19.Japan’s prime minister Yoshihide Suga, announced a minister of loneliness to his cabinet last month, closely following a similar announcement in January 2018 by the United Kingdom (UK). Loneliness is rarely acknowledged, deeply misunderstood, and alongside anxiety and depression, presents a massive opportunity for rectification as India copes with Covid-19 and beyond.Considered a taboo subject, with most adults too scared to admit that they are lonely, the UK itself has close to 33% and the United States (US) close to 50% of its people who accept they are lonely. In India, as per the recently released Longitudinal Ageing Study of India, approximately 23% of elderly stay alone, without children. While loneliness can have an impact across ages and be relevant irrespective whether you stay alone or in a full house, it is most common among those above 60 and affects almost everyone at some point in time.The impact of loneliness on our physical and mental health is acute, with resultant challenges in blood pressure, increased likelihood of dementia and depression. Yet, as a result perhaps of our childhood socialisation, no one likes to admit that they are lonely. We are trained to grow up trying to show a false sense of connectivity, a false sense of happiness and independence, and this has been the underlying driver for the growth of social media. The impact of loneliness has been compared to having 15 cigarettes a day and, left unchecked, can cause severe mental wellness challenges. Loneliness, on the other hand, should not be mixed with solitude where one is at peace spiritually with one’s self and does not mind staying alone.Thankfully, the vaccine for loneliness exists, right in our midst. Our local communities, social support systems, family and friends, even social media, and online and offline-curated programming can help reduce the sense of emptiness that accompanies loneliness. It also helps to build on India’s expertise with hospitality and consumer services brands, which have created great concepts and models of engaging their customers through trained “relationship managers”. If we extend this same concept to people who are lonely and alone, we could perhaps bridge the gap that leads to feelings of loneliness.India has a real opportunity to showcase solutions to a global audience towards using the best of tech and expertise in reducing loneliness. While a dedicated ministry for loneliness may just be the impetus, all we need is to look for are basic ways and means to help people who are on the brink of feeling lonely. In our world, we have seen the magic of that one call every day. This shouldn’t be so difficult if you can make it your daily ritual to call at least one person who you know is alone. And see that transformation happen.Saumyajit Roy is a co-founder and CEO, Emoha EldercareThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/there-is-a-looming-epidemic-of-loneliness-take-it-seriously-101614779376468.html
04-03-2021||Editorials||In polls, don’t disturb social harmony | HT Editorial||This year’s elections for legislative assemblies are important not just in terms of determining the political balance of power nationally and the power configuration in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The polls are also important because they will shape social relations between Hindus and Muslims in key geographical regions, where both communities coexist but also have a history of volatile relations.In three states in particular, the religious dimension is important. Muslims constitute around a third of the population in Assam, and at least a fourth of the population in West Bengal and Kerala (which also has close to 20% Christians). In all three states, but particularly in the eastern states, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to consolidate the Hindu vote. Its campaign, in characteristic fashion, has elements of dog-whistle politics against minorities. At the same time, in all three states, there is a range of smaller Muslim formations, and bigger “secular” formations, which hope to consolidate the Muslim vote. Their campaign, too, in a characteristic manner, has elements which may deepen the already existing fears among the community about the rise of majoritarianism.It is tempting in an electoral democracy to leverage group identities, particularly on the contested axis of religion. But a polarised campaign which deepens the Hindu-Muslim divide goes against the spirit of the Constitution, leaves long-lasting political scars, creates conflicts, and makes the task of governance — irrespective of who wins — more challenging. The BJP, as well as parties which claim to be secular or represent minority interests, must exercise responsibility in their campaign, for Hindu-Muslim harmony is essential for national unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-polls-don-t-disturb-social-harmony-hteditorial-101614866926700.html
04-03-2021||Editorials||Scrap the sedition law | HT Editorial||Rejecting a petition that sought action against former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) chief minister and one of the country’s senior-most leaders, Farooq Abdullah, for his comments opposing the Centre’s changes in the erstwhile state, a two-judge Supreme Court (SC) bench on Wednesday said that dissent cannot be considered sedition. The bench said that “the expression of a view which is a dissent from a decision taken by the Central government itself cannot be said to be seditious”. This is an important judicial intervention and merits unequivocal support. And it comes soon after a Delhi court, while granting bail to activist Disha Ravi, who too was charged with sedition, had said that offence of sedition could not be invoked to minister to “the wounded vanity of governments”.Any State must carefully defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security interests. But this cannot be the basis to undermine the equally cherished constitutional tenets of freedom and the political structure of democracy and deny citizens their fundamental rights. Unfortunately, the executive has shown an increasing tendency to use the framework of sedition in recent years. The ministry of home affairs informed the Rajya Sabha that out of the 96 people arrested for sedition in 2019, only two were convicted. There was a 25% increase in sedition cases in 2019, which resulted in a spike in arrests, but the abysmal conviction record suggests that the cases are often not grounded in adequate evidence.There is a larger principle involved here. India’s legal architecture has enough room to charge those whose statements or actions are meant to stir up violence against the State. Sedition, a colonial-era law, often used to implicate citizens who are exercising democratic rights of dissent, should have no space in the Constitution. In fact, the Constituent Assembly itself explicitly discussed, and rejected the idea of including sedition as a part of restrictions to free speech. But it stayed as a part of the Indian Penal Code (Section 124A), which a Constitution bench of the SC upheld in 1962, while also defining the scope of sedition. As India approaches the 75th year of its Independence, it is time to rethink the sedition law, which continues to be a reminder of colonialism and is, way too often, used to curtail the rights of free Indian citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/scrap-the-sedition-law-hteditorial-101614866925400.html
04-03-2021||Editorials||The dangers of populism||On Tuesday, the Haryana governor gave his assent to a bill that provides 75% reservation for locals in all private sector jobs that offer a salary of less than ₹50,000 a month. This was an election promise of Dushyant Chautala, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s key ally in the state. Under pressure from his largely Jat base, which is currently at the forefront of the farm protests, Mr Chautala is understood to have convinced his senior ally that this was the only way for him to stick to the alliance. The political calculation aside, the law is based on the logic that reservations would boost local employment for the young and discourage migration — which the government claimed was leading to pressure on infrastructure and “proliferation of slums”. Reservations have been introduced for 10 years — but as India’s experience with reservations shows, once introduced, it is impossible to roll them back.Haryana’s move is constitutionally suspect. A range of fundamental rights enables citizens to move freely, work anywhere in the country, and be entitled to be treated with equality and without discrimination. The trend of promising reservations for locals — this extends beyond Harayana to a range of other states which have made similar promises — is also politically and economically unwise. Taking a narrow view of electoral politics, leaders are tempted by this populist trap of offering reservations to locals, but this undermines the often neglected constitutional ideal of fraternity, which can only come from citizens from different regions engaging with each other, including in workplaces. The move will also deepen the insider versus outsider form of parochial politics. Economically, it sends a negative signal to investors, who place high premium on the ability to hire talent, at all positions, irrespective of their geographical origins.The core problem in India’s political economy remains the lack of jobs. A secondary problem is the long-term distress in agriculture, which has reduced the social and economic status of once-dominant land-owning communities such as the Jats (and the Patidars in Gujarat). This has resulted in two trends. The first is a demand for greater reservation in state jobs. The second is a demand for locals in private sector jobs. Haryana is clearly responding to this. But like the rest of India’s political class, Haryana’s leaders are evading the real crisis of jobs to offer prescriptions which may only make the problem worse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-dangers-of-populism-101614778773058.html
