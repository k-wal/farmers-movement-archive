It is one of the vital precautions for anyone going outside the home. It is really necessary, but, people are not following it. Therefore, the government has imposed a fine. Despite that, people are ignoring it. Punekars are treating masks like the helmet campaign.“Another thing which I have to highlight is that political leaders and party workers are not wearing masks during agitations and political gatherings, which we see on the television. It is sending the wrong message to the public. Police should impose a fine on them too, but, it is not happening. The government machinery is collecting fines from common citizens. The law should be equal for all.Sneha Kamble, primary school teacher “Though vaccination has started in the country, everyone should take precautions. Wearing a mask is a basic rule which everyone should follow. Government agencies are appealing to everyone from day one to wear a mask, but very few people responded. Now, the government has made it compulsory to wear a mask. It is everyone’s duty to wear it. It becomes a new social ritual to fight against Covid-19.”Dr Vaishali Jadhav, PMC assistant medical officer “It is necessary for everyone to wear a mask, especially those who are going to college and office. It is a general perception that youngsters are at the forefront of breaking the rules. This is not true. Most he youngsters are obeying the law, especially related to masks. College students should use masks as a fashion, so it becomes easy to follow the rule. The fine is okay, but, the government should make it half for students, as they have to depend on pocket money.”Isha Adsul, college student “People are still not serious about wearing masks. So, the fine amount must increase. People are very keen on their rights, but careless about their duty. People should consider social responsibility and wear masks to stop spreading Covid-19.”- Aarti Potphode, working woman“The government administration should take strict action against offenders. Breaking the rule of wearing a mask must be considered a criminal act. Otherwise, people, especially Punekars, will treat it like the helmet rule. People will pay the fine and police will consider it as one of the ways of revenue generation. Aparna Kirve, housewife “People are blaming the police for imposing fines without considering fact and situation. This is not true. Our intention is not to fine people and collect money. We care for them. The government made the rule of fines and when the public failed to respond the country faced the worst situation. If we want to avoid it, we should follow the rule.”Satish Shinde, police constable “We suffered last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic. We should learn something from that. We should follow very basic things, like wearing a mask. I have observed that people are ready to spend lakhs of rupees for hospitalisation, but are not ready to wear a mask costing Rs50. At least for our families, people should wear masks. Then there is no need to pay a fine.Prashant Kulkarni, employee at a private company “Instead of properly sensitising people and convincing them of the need to wear masks, the government has resorted to imposing a fine of ₹500. Before the second wave, we observed police targeting people and collecting money. It became one of the main agenda, to collect fines for not wearing a mask. After too much criticism, the government gave some relaxation for four-wheelers. On the other hand, the public should also follow the rule.Sudhir Kulkarni, civic activist“People are not following rules. Therefore, the government imposed a fine. It is for the people to take care of their health. People are not taking precautions. Actually, the government wants to control Covid-19, but people are not cooperating. We faced a problem last year. To overcome these problems in our day-to-day life, we should have to follow the rule seriously. It is social commitment. I think the fine of Rs500 is a reasonable amount.”Fakkad Sakore, advocate“It is necessary to use a mask to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Last year, I had to pay a fine for not wearing a mask. In the evening, I left the office had a mask but it was not on the nose. Police stopped me at a signal and imposed a fine of Rs500. Actually, police and Pune corporation officials should instruct people who wear masks to do so properly. Fine those who don’t wear masks at all. For common people, the amount is heavy. Some people earn ₹500 in day. How can they pay a fine? I think, the amount should be Rs200 and officials should provide a mask along with the fine.Political leaders and top officials are not wearing masks. These actions misguide the common public and encourage the public to break the rule. It should be avoided.Vijay Damale, citizen||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yourspace-punekars-treat-mask-rule-like-helmet-campaign-wearable-when-able-hence-fines-are-a-must-101615141573381.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali’s public libraries closed for over a year||For more than a year, six libraries under the Mohali municipal corporation located in various green belts of the city, have been closed due to staff shortage. Five of these don’t even have books. Even though MC officials claim they have been shut due to pandemic, they also say that they are waiting for approval of the staff from the state government.On the other hand, residents say the libraries are not being opened on the pretext of the pandemic, but in reality, there is no staff to maintain them. Around four years back, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had spent ₹20 lakh on each library and handed it over to MC. In May 2019, MC had made them functional and open to public. But, they have been closed since March last year.These libraries are in Phases 4, 6, 3B1 and 9; and Sectors 69 and 70. There were around 18 people employed in these libraries on ad-hoc basis, but all of them have been sacked, without being paid their salaries.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said one reason for keeping the libraries closed is the pandemic. “Also, we have taken up the matter with state government for approval of recruiting the staff. We are hopeful of opening the libraries in a month’s time.”The libraries are not well-stocked as the books have been donated by residents and not bought by the civic body. There is also no policy in place for membership or issuing of books. Due to this, students and scholars have limited options and are forced to go to the public libraries in Sectors 17 or 34 in Chandigarh .Some of them even lack basic facilities such as furniture and drinking water. There are no sign boards to indicate that a building is indeed a library.MC councillor Sukhdev Singh Patwari, said, “The sad part is, it has been more than one year since the libraries were closed in the name of pandemic. When the state government has opened all schools and colleges, why can’t they open libraries. Even after two years of inauguration, the civic body has not floated tenders for procuring new books. The employees are feeling cheated as they haven’t received salaries and now been sacked. In the Sector 70 library, there are only 1,500 books, which have been donated by residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohalis-public-libraries-closed-for-over-a-year-101615140734375.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tribunal awards ₹83L to kin of banker killed in mishap||The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), Chandigarh, has awarded a compensation of ₹82.97 lakh to a city family in a 2017 accident case in which a banker had lost his life.The claim petition was filed by Anu Bala, the widow of the 40-year-old victim, Sushil Kumar; his 19-year-old daughter Aanchal; and 10-year-old son Anshul of Sector 19D.The petition was filed on March 5, 2018, against Pankaj Kumar of Kangra, who was driving the vehicle; Sumit Mehta of Delhi, who owned the car, and insurer TATA AIG General Insurance Company Limited, Chandigarh.It was mentioned in the petition that on December 11, 2017, Kumar, who was posted as assistant manager with Oriental Bank of Commerce in Palampur, Kangra, was returning to his house in Mashrer village.Family had sought ₹2 crore“He was driving his motorcycle at a moderate speed. However at about 7pm, when he reached near Bhadwal village, one Maruti SX4, which was being driven in rash and negligent manner,came from the opposite side. It hit Sushil’s motorcycle who later succumbed to injuries,” the petition mentioned.Stating that Kumar was earning ₹70,000 per month, the family sought a grant of ₹2 crore as compensation.None appeared on behalf of the owner and the driver of the car, and they were “proceeded against ex parte”. The insurer stated in its reply that the amount claimed was highly exaggerated. “The driver was not holding a valid driving licence. The claimant has filed a false claim petition,” it pleaded.After hearing the arguments, judge Sajiv Joshi, MACT, awarded a compensation of ₹82.97 lakh to the family. While 50% of the amount is for the widow, 25% each are for the two children.“In view of the findings on the above issues, the claim petition is partly allowed with cost and the three respondents are jointly and severally directed to pay the compensation amounting to ₹82,97,659 along with 6% interest per annum from the date of filing of the petition,” the order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tribunal-awards-83l-to-kin-of-banker-killed-in-mishap-101615140613876.html
07-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation to bring 60,000 properties under tax ambit||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has decided in-principle that clusters in the city which had been left out from the ambit of property tax will now be levied the same. Officials said that this proposal, among some others, were taken up during the corporation’s executive committee meeting held March 3 and the decisions will further proceed to the corporation’s board.According to officials, several clusters have not been charged property tax by the municipal corporation since years as they were brought under its jurisdiction either very late or faced issues in handover by respective development agencies.For residential properties, tax will be levied from the 2020-21 financial year, while commercial properties will be taxed from the 2019-20 fiscal.As of now, the Ghaziabad corporation has about 363,000 properties under its jurisdiction.Officials estimate that with this decision, about 50,000 residential properties and another 10,000 commercial properties will be brought under the corporation’s tax net.Officials said that the corporation had been mulling over bringing all excluded properties located under its jurisdiction areas under the tax net since past several years.“We have decided that all clusters which had been left out from the tax net will now be charged tax from financial year 2020-21 for residential properties. Commercial properties will be charged starting from financial year 2019-20. However, this tax structure will not be applicable for clusters where some properties were left out or in case notices have already been served for tax collection,” said MS Tanwar, municipal-commissioner.Officials said Geographic information system (GIS) mapping is being conducted to assess construction of new houses in Ghaziabad. GIS mapping is a framework for gathering and analyzing data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes and helps reveal patterns, relationships, and situations for smart decision-making.“We are surveying such clusters in all the five corporation zones,” Tanwar added.HT had reported last month that draft GIS-based Master Plan-2031 for Ghaziabad city will include a new feature that proposes to offer all official details of each housing unit in the district at the click of a button.“Under the new feature every housing unit in Ghaziabad will be identified and all details of the property will be made available online under one head. The details will be available on the GDA website. It will also help us manage real estate, manage land use and check illegal activities in different areas. The feature will also help us readily share relevant details with the municipal corporation, discom etc.,” Ghaziabad Development Authority’s chief architect and town planner Asheesh Shivpuri had told HT last month.“The corporation is also carrying on a GIS survey which is likely to identify new properties, so as to bring them under the tax net. The survey is likely to be finished by April 15. It is estimated that once all modalities are chalked out and the survey is complete, we will have about five lakh properties under the tax net, including those previously left out,” said Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, the corporation’s chief tax assessment officer told HT last week.Property tax has three components – house tax, water tax, and sewage & drainage tax. As of now, the corporation’s annual income from tax collection is about ₹125 crore.Under a proposed structure of taxation, localities in about 100 residential wards will be categorised under three heads based on rental values which are proposed to be linked to the circle rates set by the district magistrate’s office. While category ‘A’ comprises prime localities of the highest rental value, category ‘B’ is for lower rental value while category ‘C’ will comprise localities which are least developed and have the least rental value.Categories of properties based on their location on roads of varying width – less than 12 metres; between 12 metres and 24 metres; and over 24 metres - will have a proportional impact on the tax.“We received about 318 objections in response to our earlier proposal for categorising properties for the purpose of levying tax. A committee of officers will soon start to take calls on the objections,” he added.SERVICE CHARGESIn another decision, officials said the corporation also decided not to levy user charges from houses where door-to-door garbage collection vehicles have not provided services due to the lanes being too narrow, or any other reason.The corporation charges anything between ₹30 to ₹70 per month for door-to-door collection of solid-waste in the 100 residential wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-to-bring-60-000-properties-under-tax-ambit-101615140493219.html
07-03-2021||City||Gujarat Congress did not seek my opinion regarding local body polls: Patel||Gujarat Congress working president Hardik Patel on Sunday slammed the functioning of the state unit after the party's humiliating defeat in the local body elections, claiming that no work was given to him in the polls and his opinion was also not sought for ticket distribution.He, however, also dismissed speculation about leaving the Congress in the future and said he would remain in the party and carry out whatever responsibility he is given.In an interview with PTI, Patel also raised questions over the understanding of the party's central leadership of Gujarat and said the Congress has failed to struggle as an opposition in the state.In order to strengthen the party, the high command has to understand Gujarat, he said.Patel also argued that the legislators have to be kept away from the work of the organisation.The comments by Patel, who was the face of the Patidar quota agitation in 2015, came days after the BJP won all 31 district panchayats, 74 out of 81 municipalities and also trounced its main rival Congress in 231 taluka panchayats.The success followed the BJP's clean sweep in elections for six municipal corporations in the first phase last month. The Congress could not even open its account in the Surat Municipal Corporation.Following the party's debacle, Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda and leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani sent their resignations to the party leadership.When asked about the reasons for the party's defeat, Patel said, "We have failed to win the public's trust. The struggle which we should have undertaken as an opposition, we have failed in that. The public feels that the Congress did not do its job as an opposition and that is why the Aam Aadmi Party got votes in many places." "In Surat, people from our movement had asked for only two tickets. The party did not even give that. Just because of those two seats we lost all the 36 seats there," he said.It is worth noting that in the last civic elections, the Congress had won more than 30 seats in the Patidar-dominated areas of Surat.Without naming any leader, Patel claimed, "I am the working president and I had no role in ticket distribution. I was told that the working president has no role in it. Nevertheless, I held several meetings on my own. I was not given any programme or work by the Pradesh Congress Committee." "Preparations for the local body elections had been going on for three months. Not even once in three months have I been told that you have to do this work. Tickets were distributed in more than 5,000 seats, but not even for one seat, I was asked to give my opinion. Even in Patidar-dominated areas, my opinion was not taken," he said.Asked about the resignation of Amit Chavda from the post of state president and Paresh Dhanani from the post of the leader of opposition, Patel said, "If I were also the president, I would have taken responsibility. They have resigned, but the responsibility lies with everyone." "Now everyone has to work hard," he added. Asked if the Congress high command did not take necessary steps in time, Patel said they have to understand Gujarat, and give importance to it. "We have not been in power in the state for 30 years. If we do not understand Gujarat, young workers like us will be left disappointed. The party is slumping day by day and no one is paying attention," Patel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gujarat-congress-did-not-seek-my-opinion-regarding-local-body-polls-patel-101615139984881.html

This move comes following the instructions of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who said “issues of the homebuyers be addressed on a priority basis”. UP chief secretary RK Tiwari reviewed the matter on March 3 via a video call. Residents have been facing issues in registering around 20,000 such units.CS RK Tiwari met Noida authority officials on Saturday (March 6), and directed them to make sure that the homebuyers do not face any issue. “Buyers, builders and the GHD will be present during the special drive,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.There are around 30,000 flats that are yet to be transferred via execution of registration. The homebuyers have been living in their flats for four to five years, without an execution of registry, said officials. According to the rules, the authority clerk, the buyer and the builder’s representative need to be present at the office to carry out the registration. After this, the flat will be transferred in the name of the buyer. The buyer has to approach both the builder and the authority for the registry, and the “process is troublesome”. “We are happy that the authority has planned the special drive. It will become easier to get the registration done,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (NEFOWA).Realtors are also planning to take part in the drive. “We welcome the Greater Noida authority’s move. The buyers would not have to go places to get the registration done,” said RK Arora, president, UP National Real Estate Development Council (NREDC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/greater-noida-authority-to-hold-camps-for-registering-flats-101615139953187.html

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will inaugurate the initiative on the Women’s Day on March 8, officials said, adding that the women cell will have one sub-inspector and two constables.“The cases of online stalking and bullying have increased in recent times. The women cyber cell will specifically deal with women-related cybercrime. The team will be trained in dealing with cybercrimes. We will also provide required tools and equipment to deal with such cases,” said Ram Kumar, UP’s additional director general of police (cybercrime). There are 18 cyber police stations in various cities, including Noida, Lucknow, Agra, Aligarh, Saharanpur, Prayagraj, Bareilly, Moradabad, and Gorakhpur. The cyber police stations in Lucknow and Noida started in 2018, while others were inaugurated in August last year. These cyber police stations directly report to Lucknow, and do not come under the respective district police. Noida has a cyber police station in Sector 36.Besides, there are also cyber cells in each district’s police department, the officials said. Awanish Kumar Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary, on March 4 had issued a letter to the UP police to develop women cyber cell at all the cyber police stations in the state.

However, as many as 540 new cases have been detected in the district between January 6 and March 6, the data shows.The last time GB Nagar had witnessed a Covid-19 death was on January 5 this year. So far, the virus has claimed 91 deaths in the district which had reported its first Covid-19 positive case on March 8. At present, the district has 84 active cases, as per the state data.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the district’s low fatality rate is due to the administration’s emphasis on early detection of Covid-19 cases. “Due to the continuous efforts of doctors, paramedical staff and personnel from other departments, we tested over 10 lakh persons so far. It was the result of the increased testing that the district started witnessing a continuous reduction in positivity rate and cases of new infection since mid-October last year,” he said. The DM further said that the integrated Covid-19 control room in sector 59 worked well in fight with the Covid-19 in the district. “It helped improve our surveillance and contact tracing as early detection of cases and containing the pandemic was the most important job in the beginning. And, now the same control room serves as a counselling centre for the vaccinated beneficiaries,” he said. “Earlier, we focussed on non-pharmaceutical interventions like enforcement of social distancing norms and wearing of masks. And, now when the vaccination has started, we’ve started to clear people’s apprehension about the vaccine. As a result, the vaccination cover in the district is increasing day by day. Till date, over 30,000 doses have been given to the beneficiaries in the district, ” Suhas said. GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that it was the ‘tracking, testing and treating’ methodology of the district administration that we crossed the worst phase of infection from May to December last year, during which 90 people lost their lives battling Covid-19. “The current year is much better for the district as except the death of a 62-year-old Covid-19 infected cancer patient on January 5, no other death due to the viral infection has been reported. Even the number of the daily average cases – which were never below 80 between August and December last year, was reduced to 12.41 and 6.39 cases per day in January and February, respectively. This month so far, the average daily cases are less than 8,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-covid-19-death-in-last-two-months-in-noida-101615139713233.html

Coinciding with Raje’s religious yatra, state BJP chief Satish Poonia launched a ‘Halla Bol’ programme through social media against the state government on loan waiver, law and order, and women’s safety, a development that experts see as a divide in the party.“The development of the state has stopped. I have come to pray to Giriraj Maharaj to bless and give strength to all of us so that we can uproot this anti-development Ashok Gehlot government, which is divided into two, and bring out development to the state again,” Raje said, addressing a gathering in Bharatpur.Also read: ‘Pure cobra...’ - Mithun Chakraborty after joining BJP ahead of West Bengal polls“I am deeply grateful to everyone for the love and blessings that the people of the state gave me on my birthday.” Raje celebrated her birthday with her supporters in Bharatpur.She said, “I have a strong faith in this area. That is why our government got the development of Sapta Kosi and Braj Chaurasi Kos Parikrama Marg at a cost of ₹200 crore and worked for the conservation and development of the famous Vimal Kund at a cost of ₹3.60 lakh. Pahari Distributary Gurgaon Main Canal was developed at a cost of ₹11.12 crore. To quench the thirst of Bharatpur, Dholpur, Alwar, Jhalawar, Baran, Kota, Bundi, Sawai Madhopur, Ajmer, Tonk, Jaipur, Dausa and Karoli districts, our government had started work on the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP) project after getting a detailed project report done.”Raje said her government had sanctioned ₹1,600 crore for the construction of Navnera Barrage in Kota district. The work on Navnera Barrage is in progress.“The state government should not do politics on the ERCP, a lifeline for 13 districts, because it is the religion of the state government to fulfil the basic needs of the people. They should carry forward this project of ours. Not only in this region but development has stopped in the entire state,” she said.Raje thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.Referring to Bharatpur, which is an important Krishna circuit, she said, “It is a happy coincidence that a grand Ram temple is being built in Ram Janmabhoomi from the sacred stones of this holy Krishna Janmabhoomi area. I have a deep connection with this religious area, so this time I have decided to pay homage to the holy places of worship here and celebrate my birthday.”Sandstones from the Bansi Pahadpur hills of Bharatpur are bring used for constructing the Ram temple.Raje said, “Today, all I can say is that my mother (late Vijaya Raje Scindia) has lit the ‘deepak’ (political symbol of Jan Sangh) and has nourished the lotus. She neither allowed the flame of the lamp to subside nor did she let the lotus fade. BJP and nationalism were in her veins and I am her daughter.”After a night halt, Raje will attend the early morning arti at Adi Badrinath temple in Bharatpur on Monday and will then go to Kedarnath temple at 12.30 pm. She will leave for Dholpur in a helicopter.According to reports, over 100 senior BJP leaders, including MLAs, MPs, former ministers, and party post holders, have reached Bharatpur to join Raje in her yatra. Most of the hotels in the city of Bharatpur are booked.Those who are in Bharatpur include Ranjita Koli, BJP MP from Bharatpur, Dr Manoj Rajoria, MP from Karauli-Dholpur; Sukhvir Singh Jonpuria, MP from Sawai Madhopur; and Ram Charan Bohra, MP from Jaipur.Senior leaders like Bhawani Singh Rajawat, along with former minister Yunus Khan, former state BJP chief Ashok Parnami, former women’s commission chief Suman Sharma and Babaulal Verma were also present in Bharatpur.Meanwhile, Poonia, while addressing the ‘Halla Bol’ programme via social media, said, “BJP has launched the programme on misrule, anarchy, corruption, inaction, crime and vandalism that have taken place across the state in the 27 months of the Congress rule.”Political experts say the divide between the senior BJP leaders is visible.“BJP national president JP Nadda had come to Jaipur a few days ago to unite the party leaders but his efforts are not converting into results. Before her last tenure also, Raje had carried out a religious yatra and the poll results went in her favour,” said Om Saini, senior political journalist.“However, this time the situation is different, and factionalism will not bring fruitful results for them,” he added.Another political analyst Tribhuvan said Raje had made it clear about her strength. “By mentioning 'deepak' and 'lotus' in her address, she clearly stated she has a rich political legacy of not only BJP but also Jan Sangh,” he said.“This time, Raje’s approach is not casual. Poonia holding the programme today indicates the uneasiness in the other faction,” he added.Factionalism within Rajasthan BJP has become more evident recently, with MLAs close to Raje writing to state party chief Poonia, complaining of being ignored in the state assembly. Earlier, her supporters held a meeting in the name of a ‘chintan baithak’ in Kota city and pitched for her to be the chief ministerial candidate in the next assembly polls.Reacting to allegations of Raje and Poonia, state Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said, “There is a clash going on in the BJP for their survival. As both leaders cannot target each other publicly, they are taking the name of our party leaders.”State BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said, “Our respected leader Raje regularly visited religious places even when she was CM. Today’s programme of Raje was religious while ‘Halla Bol’ was completely political. Seeing both the events in the same light is not justifiable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/raje-kicks-off-religious-yatra-vows-to-oust-gehlot-govt-101615138993390.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||96 liquor vends to be auctioned in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh excise and taxation department is putting 96 liquor vends on auction for the next fiscal, up from 94 in 2020-21.The e-auction will begin on March 10 and bids can be submitted till March 18. The results will be declared on March 19. The highest reserve price of ₹7.95 crore has been set for a liquor vend in Dhanas. In 2019-2020, it had fetched the department ₹10.78 crore, highest among all vends. Last year, too, it went for ₹7.05 crore, the second-highest bid.Other vends with the highest reserve price this year are at Khuda Lahora/ Khuda Jassu ( ₹6.75 crore) and Sector 30 ( ₹6.4 crore). Vends near Chandigarh’s border with neighbouring states generally fetch high bids as liquor in the city is cheaper than in Mohali and Panchkula. Meanwhile, the reserve price of a vend in Sector 9, which had fetched the highest bid of ₹7.56 crore last year, is ₹6.1 crore. To curb the menace of cartelisation and monopolistic practices, a single entity of firms/companies/individuals will be entitled to allotment of up to a maximum of 10 vends.In the Chandigarh Excise Policy 2021-2022 announced on Wednesday, the administration has decided to keep the licence fee and excise duty on beer and wine unchanged. On the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), the duty has been increased by 6%, which is expected to increase the prices of popular liquor brands by 10-12%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/96-liquor-vends-to-be-auctioned-in-chandigarh-101615138994044.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Women-led ventures to get a boost in Chandigarh Startup Policy 2021||To promote budding entrepreneurs, the UT administration will soon unveil the Chandigarh Startup Policy 2021, with “special emphasis” on women-led ventures.The policy also envisages a Chandigarh Seed Fund Scheme to provide early-stage startup financing, interest-free loans, empanelment of startup mentors, development of co-working spaces, and setting up of incubators.Once being promoted as an IT hub, Chandigarh has been lagging behind neighbouring cities, particularly Mohali, in terms of attracting new talent and setting up industrial units.“The aim of the new policy will be to invite the best entrepreneurial minds to make Chandigarh their professional base, and thereby build a robust startup ecosystem in the city. It will help reduce the regulatory burden on startups, thereby allowing them to focus on their core business and keep compliance cost low,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.The policy will provide for incentives over and above the Startup India Action Plan of the Government of India. “In case the same benefit is enlisted in another policy of the UT administration, it may be availed under only one policy,” said the official. A startup portal (website) will also be created, which will be a one-stop platform for startups and ecosystem stakeholders containing all relevant information and resources. At least 10% of all goods and services will be procured by the administration from UT-registered startups, states the draft policy.Entrepreneurship CentreThe administration will set up a dedicated Entrepreneurship Centre for Women (ECW), which is envisaged as a hub for aspiring and seasoned women entrepreneurs providing access to mentorship, capacity building exercises, and other programs beneficial for women-led startups. The ECW shall run dedicated incubation and acceleration program for women on an annual or biannual basis.“A minimum of 33% of the Seed Fund interest-free loans will be dedicated to women-led startups meeting the eligibility criteria for availing the same,” said the official.A woman-led startup will be defined as the one with a woman as founder or co-Founder or chief experience officer.Seed fund for startupsThe Chandigarh Seed Fund will be a grant-in-aid based seed fund with an initial corpus of ₹10 crore and a total corpus of ₹50 crore over a period of five years to support over 500 entrepreneurs in the UT.The administration will provide collateral free loans of up to ₹10 lakh to UT-registered startups. These loans shall be interest-free for the first one year, following which the interest rate is likely to be fixed.Panel of mentorsA number of “startup mentors” with expertise in domains such as business model development, funding strategies, company registration, accounting and taxation, legal, and digital marketing will be empanelled.The mentor profiles will be hosted on the Startup Portal which will also contain a pathway for startups to reach out to these mentors for free. These mentors will also provide support to aspiring entrepreneurs, especially students, through ideation workshops.Incubators, co-working spacesThe administration will partner with higher education institutions and private players to set up state-of-the-art incubators or upgrade existing incubators in the UT.“An incubation centre for IT sector is operating since 2001. The new policy will focus on accommodating non-IT startups and expand the scope of incentivising private and institutional incubators, co-working spaces and startups,” the official said.The administration will create co-working facilities offering seats on rent for startups and innovators on a pay per use basis. The startups at co-working spaces would be able to access facilities such as high-speed internet, power backup secured access and 24X7 security with CCTV surveillance.Incentives for studentsEntrepreneurship Cells will be set up at all colleges as student-driven initiatives. Students who wish to pursue entrepreneurship will also be allowed to take a break of one year.Student entrepreneurs from UT-based institutes working on a startup idea in their graduation year may receive allowances, such as attendance relaxation, grace marks, and permission to convert their startup project into a final-year project counted towards their degree completion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/womenled-ventures-to-get-a-boost-in-chandigarh-startup-policy-2021-101615138873761.html
07-03-2021||Other||Check the oil your jalebis are being fried in||Have you ever watched samosas, puris, bhaturas, bread pakoras and jalebis being deep fried at a roadside eatery? The cooking oil often looks dark and murky from constant frying and repeated use of the same oil again and again. What the food seller probably does not know is that by continuously reheating the same oil, he is turning that viscous fluid into a toxic broth and putting at risk the health of his customers who eat food that has absorbed that oil and with it, the toxins.Scientists have for many years been expressing concern over the deleterious effects of consumption of re-heated cooking oil on our vital organs and advocating strict regulations to prevent the use of such oil. The worry over such consumption comes from studies that have not only shown the deterioration in the quality of edible oil on heating and reheating and the accumulation of various toxins in the oil, but also the ill-effects of consumption of foods fried in such oil. Many studies, several of them done in India , have shown the damage to liver, heart, kidney and the intestine caused by re-used oil in experimental rats. Similarly analysis of their blood samples have shown elevated levels of glucose, cholesterol and creatinine. To put it simply, consumption of such oil could cause cancer, besides hypertension, diabetes, vascular inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Taking note of all this, the food safety regulator first advocated in the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulation that food business operators avoid re-use of cooking oil. “Reheating and reuse of oil should be avoided as far as possible. Avoid using leftover oil wherever possible” the regulation said. Obviously, such general provisions did not have the desired effect. Since the presence of polar compounds in oil is one of the best indicators of heated oil quality, the FSSAI in 2017 amended the regulation to prohibit the use of vegetable oils with more than 25% of Total Polar Compound and directed state food commissioners to enforce it. Subsequently in October 2020, it further tightened the regulation on the safety of edible oils by amending the FSS (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations and said the TPC in unused or fresh vegetable oil or fat shall not be more than 15% and used vegetable oil or fat with a TPC of over 25% shall not be used. The regulator also took several steps to prevent the sale of re-used oil from large food businesses to dhabas and roadside vendors and also ensure safe disposal of used oil. One of them was to direct all large FBOS whose consumption of edible oil was more than 50 litres per day, to maintain records of disposal of the oil. The other was to launch the “Repurpose Used Cooking Oil Project’ to facilitate collection of used edible oil from food industries, fast food chains and large hotels through authorized agents or aggregators for transportation to biodiesel plants for production of biodiesel.Since roadside food vendors may not be able to afford hand held devices to check the TPC percentage of the oil, FSSAI is advising them not to use the same oil more than thrice. However, repeated heating and re-use of cooking oil is so rampant among them that forcing compliance requires persistent efforts by the state food regulators, including education of vendors , regular checks on the TPC percentage and a system of incentives and disincentives.In fact, a pilot study undertaken in 2018 by the enforcement agency in Ahmedabad indicated that 40% of the eateries across the city re-used oil whose TPC value was over 25%.! A media report quoting municipal authorities there said among street vendors this percentage might well be around 80%.So consumers need to remain alert and question the state food safety commissioners on the enforcement of the law. Of course at home too, consumers need to ensure the safety of the oil that they use. More on that in my next column.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/check-the-oil-your-jalebis-are-being-fried-in-101615138333062.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||MMRDA seeks green nod for Metro project in Aarey, department defers proposal||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has tabled a proposal before the Maharashtra environment department to obtain an environmental clearance (EC) for its contentious Metro Bhavan project in Aarey Colony, a site already at the centre of a few political rows for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The government —comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — has been vocal in its support towards protecting the city’s prime green lung, even shifting a proposed Metro car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg.The MMRDA proposal, seeking an EC for a 32-storey building named Metro Bhavan at Survey No. 589A, Village Pahadi, Goregaon East, was tabled on December 17, 2020, via an MMRDA letter to the environment department, attached with requisite paperwork. The matter was then recommended for clearance by a State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) on Feb 17, “subject to compliances”. The proposal was further considered by the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) on Feb 26, when it was “deferred for compliance of change of land use,” as per publicly available documents accessed by the Hindustan Times.The MMRDA’s proposal is listed as application number SIA/MH/MIS/188820/2020 on PARIVESH, a single-window online portal for processing environmental and CRZ clearances. Confirming that the authority has received MMRDA’s proposal, Vijay Shantilal Nahata, chairman of the SEIAA, said, “The project has presently not been given EC.” After assuming office in November 2019, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, responding to public outcry, had stalled construction of the Metro-3 car shed and stated that there will be no more felling of trees in the area. Despite declaring over 600 acres of Aarey Colony as a reserved forest since then, the government has not publicly cleared its stance on the Metro Bhavan, which is also located within Aarey. However, Dr Sonia Sethi, additional metropolitan commissioner and project director, MUTP, MMRDA, confirmed that the project is currently in the works and that a site office has already been established at the proposed location.“Metro Bhavan for centralised integrated operation, command and control of all 14 metro lines is proposed at Pahari Goregaon CTS No. 589 (A), Mumbai. In addition, it will have a metro training academy, simulation centre, central surveillance system, etc.,” Sethi said in a note to HT on Sunday.Of the 205 trees present on site, 85 are proposed to be felled and 73 are proposed to be transplanted, in order to make room for Metro Bhavan. The remaining trees will be retained on site.Moreover, 20,387 sq m of Aarey land are proposed to be converted from a “No Development Zone” to a “residential zone”, for the project as per the MMDRA’s application Form 1 (which has been reviewed by HT).The state had invited suggestions and objections from citizens on this change in land use, in August 2019. It received 2,563 responses by March 2020. Virtual public hearings to address citizens’ concerns commenced in July last year, but the minutes of these are not publicly available.A senior government official who is privy to the matter, but did not wish to be identified by their name or department, said, “The EC cannot be granted at this point because the change of land use has not been executed yet. The SEIAA will decide on the matter only after the conversion of ‘No Development Zone’ has been notified. Once that condition has been complied with, other aspects of the project will be scrutinised.” Environmentalists’ responses to these developments were critical. “We are shocked to learn that the very same government which committed to protecting Aarey in entirety are now themselves planning to construct a 32-storey office building inside Aarey,” said Zoru Bhathena, an environmentalist who has filed two petitions regarding the Aarey dispute in the Bombay High Court.This view was echoed by Stalin Dayanand, director of NGO Vanashakti, who has filed another three petitions related to the Aarey matter in the Supreme Court. “The Metro car shed and the Metro Bhavan were very strategically introduced from different directions to facilitate faster constructions inside Aarey. The way events are unfolding it seems like the govt. bodies are acting like free radicals who disregard the opinion of the chief minister and the people. Instead of securing the ecology of Aarey, they are giving sanctity to upcoming projects which can easily be located in non-ecologically sensitive zones,” Dayanand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-seeks-green-nod-for-metro-project-in-aarey-department-defers-proposal-101615137853705.html

Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are sitting in the national capital seeking a solution to their problems. The Prime Minister has time to go to Kolkata today and rally against the government there but he has no time to meet the agitating farmers hardly 20 kilometres from his residence in the national capital”.Pawar was in Ranchi in a bid to strengthen the party base in Jharkhand. The NCP has a single legislator, Kamlesh Kumar Singh, in Jharkhand.Also read: 'If Mamata's scooty falls...' - PM Modi's jibe as CM protests fuel price hikeHitting at the BJP government, Pawar said, “The party, which is in power, has the responsibility to ensure brotherhood among every class of the society but the BJP is spreading communal poison and disharmony in the country.”Addressing the gathering, Pawar said, “I was told that a large number of people from different districts of the state wanted to participate in the rally but they were requested to gather in limited number amid fears of the pandemic".Taking a dig at the prime minister's 'Thaali Bajao' appeal, he said, “People from Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal come to Maharashtra for work and have played a big role in state’s development. During the Covid outbreak, we have seen their pain. NCP workers took to the street to help them. But, what did the BJP government do? It asked people to beat thaali. I would like to say only beating thaali would not work, food is also needed on the plate.”Lauding the contribution of former team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the world of cricket, former BCCI chairperson Pawar said he felt proud to stand in Dhoni’s hometown and address his party workers.NCP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Prafulla Patel said, “Jharkhand is a land of tribals. Pawar ji has done many things for the upliftment and developments of tribals in Maharashtra. We want to do the same development here.”State NCP president Kamlesh Kumar Singh, who is also the legislator from Hussainabad, said, “We will make our presence felt across 24 districts of the state very soon, as the arrival of national leaders has infused a new enthusiasm among party workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/pm-has-time-for-kolkata-but-not-for-farmers-in-delhi-sharad-pawar-101615137004751.html

07-03-2021||Patna||Gandhians recall Bapu's visit to PMCH in 1947, appeal to not demolish heritage buildings||Three months before India's independence, Mahatma Gandhi had visited the Patna Medical College and Hospital for an appendicitis surgery of his grand-niece Manu, and so worried Bapu was that he sat next to her, wearing a surgical mask and watched the entire procedure in the operation theatre.Seventy-four years later, Gandhian scholars and his admirers are now concerned over the fate of the over 100-year-old Bankipore General Hospital building in which the operation took place on May 15, 1947, and other heritage structures of the PMCH -- Bihar and Odisha's first medical college -- which are set to be demolished as part of a mega redevelopment project.The state government's move has upset a large number of alumni members, heritage lovers and scholars, who have already appealed to not dismantle these iconic structures and "restore and preserve some of the key landmark buildings for the posterity".Manu Gandhi, in whose arms Mahatma Gandhi had collapsed after falling to bullets of an assassin on January 30, 1948, in Delhi's Birla House, was his dutiful companion in the crusade for Independence and a chronicler of his life."Seen, always by Bapu's side, whom she considered as her 'mother', Manu had come along with Gandhi to Bihar several times. Together they had come to Patna again after visiting parts of Bengal post the communal riots. Manu had a tremendous pain in her stomach and she was taken to the PMCH for appendicitis operation," said octogenarian Razi Ahmad, secretary of the Gandhi Sanghralaya in Patna.References to this medical operation, are there in Mahatma Gandhi's own chronicles and diaries of Manu Gandhi, translated from Gujarati a few years ago, who was a very young freedom fighter herself, standing literally by her grandfather and even went to jail with him, he said.Ahmad, 82, an avowed Gandhian, said, he was “shocked” that instead of preserving the old buildings, that too when Gandhi's legacy is attached to it, the government has planned to raze the heritage structures which were built as part of the evolution of this famed medical institution, and asked “if there could be a smart city without Gandhi's legacy at its core”.“The old Bankipore station in Patna where Gandhi had arrived via a train on the way to Champaran in 1917, is gone. Sikander Manzil, where he had stayed during his first visit to Patna that year, is practically demolished. Now the PMCH building. What do centenary and anniversary celebrations mean, if we cannot preserve the actual, tangible legacy of Gandhi," he rued.A Annamalai, director of Delhi-based National Gandhi Museum, said Bapu in his diary on May 15, 1947, when he was in Patna noted: "Manu has a severe stomach-ache, she also had vomiting and is running temperature. I therefore called in the doctors who examined her. Manu's complaint was diagnosed as appendicitis. I had her removed to the hospital immediately. She will be operated upon at night”.The Mahatma, who had already lost his wife Kasturba in Pune, a few years ago, goes on to describe in his diary – “I had put on a surgical mask and watched the whole operation”.“Gandhiji insisted to be present in the OT and doctors eventually obliged him. He sat next to the operation table, in his trademark 'dhoti' and a mask on his face. Unfortunately, not many people know about this episode. The Bihar government should preserve this legacy of Gandhi by preserving the PMCH's old hospital building. Demolishing it would be loss of an institutional heritage and Bapu's legacy,” Annamalai said.Annamalai, who authored, 'Gandhi's Experiment with Health' for Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2019 to mark his 150th anniversary, said Mahatma Gandhi himself was operated for appendicitis in January 1924 at Sassoon Hospital in Pune, under a hurricane lamp, as there was a power outage. That old OT is now a memorial, and Patna should also save this historic building, he said.“He was a part of the Natal Indian Ambulance Corps in South Africa during the Second Boer War and so, he had a fair understanding of medical care. At PMCH, during Manu's surgery, he wanted to actually see the operation. Isn't it a fascinating story of Gandhi as a man of science,” Annamalai said.According to his diary entry, part of the Collected Works of Gandhi, on May 16, 1947, he wrote to Jaisukhlal Gandhi: “My pride has been humbled,” said a senior official of the Gandhi Smriti, situated in Birla House, where he spent the last 144 days of his life.He also appealed to the Bihar government to preserve and celebrate this architectural and cultural legacy, and not raze the hospital building and other heritage structures of the PMCH.The institution, originally christened as the Prince of Wales Medical College, was established in 1925. It was renamed to PMCH, a few years after Independence.The college had evolved out of the Temple Medical School, set up in 1874 in Patna. The double-storied old Bankipore General Hospital, more than a century-old, is endowed with a huge staircase and a Brirtish-era lift, and houses the old Hathwa Ward and Guzri Ward. It is fronted with a handsome structure with tall, magnificent Doric pillars on two sides. The old operation theatre where Manu Gandhi was operated is located on the first floor.Rare, old black and white photos of the May 15, 1947 surgery, showing Gandhi sitting on a chair inside the OT, are preserved in old photo libraries. The PMCH website also mentions about Manu Gandhi's surgery.The PMCH Alumni Association had recently appealed to preserve and restore at least the administrative building which houses the Principal's Office; and the iconic old Bankipore General Hospital Building, whose image had also adorned the postal stamp released on its platinum jubilee in 2000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/gandhians-plead-to-bihar-govt-to-not-demolish-pmch-other-heritage-structures-101615133654338.html

Two shops in Hanumangarh district were also sold for ₹11 crores each, although the base price of most of these shops was between ₹1-2 crores only, said Dewasi.“E-auction of the wine shops is the reason behind high bidding for wine shops,” he said.On being asked about the average bid in the e-auction, CR Dewasi said, "The average bid is around 30 per cent higher than the base price. The base price has been calculated by adding 10 per cent in previous year's reserve price".He said that the department got revenue of ₹700-800 crores on the set reserve price and later earned revenue of ₹10,500 crores in the last financial year, even when the liquor shops remain closed for a month due to Covid-19. He said now they are expecting ₹13,000 crores revenue."Out of the 7,665 wine shops in the state, e-auction of 3,572 wine shops have been done in the first phase which will continue till March 10," he said.However, some wine traders are citing competition for the high bidding for getting wine shops.As per the new excise policy of the government of Rajasthan, now liquor shop allotment will be done through e-auction instead of the earlier system of a lottery.Earlier, there was a minimum reserve price in the liquor shop allotment in the lottery system whereby the government used to get fixed reserve price of the shops.The aspirants will have to deposit non-refundable application fees between ₹40,000 to ₹2 lakh depending on the reserve price of liquor shops which is between ₹50 lakh to ₹2 crores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/eauction-of-wine-shops-draws-bids-worth-rs-510-cr-for-rajasthan-shop-101615128842822.html

Hindustan Times caught up with these exemplary women who made a difference even in difficult circumstances.At Mylabs Discovery Solutions, three women have been involved in creating a solution for screening kits for Covid.Shefali Desai, general manager, applications support; Minal Dakhave Bhosale, general manager- research and development and Mitali Patil, general manager - production and compliance, together with seven others in the team created a solution for screening kits for Covid.Bhosale and her team provided India’s first testing kit a day before she delivered her daughter.“The efforts of my team helped us develop the Covid test kit in a record time,” she said.“Initially I was going to the facility, but due to pregnancy complications, I was not able to visit the office, so I started working from home. It was difficult for me to sit for long hours, but I took this as a challenge. The efforts paid off as our team delivered the kit in a record time of six weeks,” she said.Desai said, “I wore multiple hats at the same time working with cross-functional teams. This could be achieved because of the support I got from family and colleagues.”“During the lockdown travelling from home to work place and back home was a challenge. We scaled up from 2,000 test kits a day to two lakh a day in six weeks. I feel proud of the efforts that our team has put in,” said Patil.Similarly, Jayashree (Rekha) Deshpande (56), a resident of Sadashiv peth and a mother of three girls, recalls the day when the lockdown was announced. “I am a counsellor and run a tiffin service from home for an old age home nearby. On March 25, 2020, I had prepared tiffins to be delivered to the old age home, but the police bandobast stopped us, which got me thinking of how will other senior citizens and others living in my area survive,” said Deshpande.“My concern was getting food to those senior citizens who were alone, single or with their partners bedridden. Hence I approached the police and applied for an essential services pass and began by delivering home-cooked meals twice a day to nearby senior citizens,” she said.Deshpande supplied tiffins to at least 120 senior citizens who were physically disabled and stranded students in the area for almost three and a half months free of cost.“My youngest daughter Aishwariya, who was to get married in May 2020, had taken a wedding loan, suggested that we use that money to prepare meals for others,” she added.Deshpande’s daily routine during the lockdown period was to wake up at 3 am and prepare 200 chapatis and cook vegetables and keep them ready by 7.30 am, whereupon the students stuck at the hostel nearby would come to help pack the tiffins against free meals.“My husband passed away 14 years back, I know the value of a meal,” she said.In Navi peth, Rekha Dalat (30), originally from Latur, who works with an NGO while studying for MPSC exams, took up the mammoth task of preparing and feeding the stranded students in the city. During the lockdown, she along with her group of 50 volunteers fed at least 5,000 students every day.“I stay with my brother here. He is studying for UPSC while I am studying for MPSC exams. When the lockdown was announced several outstation students were stuck in lodges or hostels without proper mess service or means to cook food. So we began cooking meals for our friends, who were living in the peth areas,” she said.“Later we began to cook meals for at least 5,000 students and distributed it in 22 locations across the city,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/international-women-s-day-good-samaritans-made-sure-no-one-slept-hungry-during-lockdown-period-101615133412870.html

And the elderly woman gives the credit to the special camp organised by the Youth Foundation organisation in the city on Sunday. After the vaccination exercise for senior citizens (above 60 age) started from last week, it was found that most of the beneficiaries do not know how to register themselves online. The youth group stepped in to fill the gap by holding two camps at different places in the city to help the needy senior citizens. “I was worried about how to register myself for Covid vaccination. I tried to seek help from some of my neighbours, but it didn’t work out. I do have a smartphone, but does not know how to use it and do online registration. When I got to know about this camp, I immediately came here and got myself registered and got an appointment for March 31. I am eagerly waiting to get vaccinated,” said Meenal. The social organisation conducted two camps in Pune for registration of Covid-19 vaccination for senior citizens, one at Subhashnagar area in Shukrawar peth and another at Bibwewadi-Kondhwa road. At each of these centres, five-six volunteers with the help of laptops and smartphones helped senior citizens carry out online registration for vaccination. “Since the vaccination drive for senior citizens started last week, we were getting calls for help from many parts of the city for registration. So, we decided to hold camps for registration. Today, it was held at two places and more than 200 people were registered in one day. We will hold similar registration camps at other places across city also,” said Rohan Shetty, an advocate and president of Youth Foundation. Kalpana B, president of Subhashnagar senior citizens group, said, “There are around 200 members in our senior citizen group and most of them live alone as their children are abroad. Most of them cannot do the online registration easily and some even do not have smartphones or laptops. Considering their problems, we decided to arrange the camp and took help from Youth foundation volunteers. We are planning to organise such camps once again for remaining members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-youth-group-holds-special-camp-for-senior-citizen-covid-19-vaccine-registration-101615132572805.html
07-03-2021||Other||Pune dist accounts for 9.41% of India’s new Covid cases||PUNE A year after Pune reported Maharashtra’s first Covid-19 case, the virus is back to haunt the district. After a downward graph since October 2020, Pune district’s virus tally is surging upward faster than the first wave. In the past week, the country has reported 98,558 new cases out of which 9.41 per cent or 9,278 new cases have been reported from the Pune district. On Sunday (March 7) the country reported 18,754 new virus cases while the district reported 1,925 new cases, so for every ten new cases reported in the country, one is from Pune. As of March 6, Maharashtra accounts for 54.31% of the total new cases reported in the country, while Pune accounts for 10.26 per cent of the new cases. Pune district also has the highest number of active cases in the country with 19, 615 cases, followed by Nagpur with 11,480 cases, Thane with 10,044 active cases, Mumbai with 8,984 cases and Ernakulam with 7,212 active cases. Of the top five districts with the most active cases, Covid-infected people undergoing treatment in hospitals or in-home isolation, in the country, four are from Maharashtra.The sudden surge in the number of positive cases could be because of the super spreader events and careless behaviour of the people and not because of possible mutations, say officials. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “As per the discussion with National Institute of Virology (NIV) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) there have been no worrisome mutations in the samples being tested from the district. The reason for the spread could be the super spreader events like reopening of schools and colleges, rural elections and such events could have caused the spike.”“As per our understanding as of now the reason for the spike in the district is because of the careless behaviour and also because the administration has massively increased testing which is why more cases are being detected. In a pandemic situation or in case of an outbreak, ups and lows are normal. The fact remains that this surge is not unusual,” he said.Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector, said, “We are testing more compared to any city and so we are seeing more cases. We have increased testing from 4,000 earlier to 13,000 now, but the positivity rate has also gone up. One sign of relief is that the mortality rate has not gone up as much as the number of cases. According to health experts, the newer cases are milder cases of infection. At least 80-90 per cent of the new cases are asymptomatic and they are contacts of positive patients.”“As per the standard operating procedure (SOP), we are taking action against those not wearing masks. Also, we have certain restrictions already in place like the schools are shut and also night movement is restricted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-dist-accounts-for-9-41-of-india-s-new-covid-cases-101615132332786.html

The announcement assumes significance as at present all Gram Panchayats in the state have been dissolved and elections are due. “Due to the pandemic, the excise policy came into force from May 19, 2020 instead of April 1, which is why the new excise policy will start from May 20.” Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of the excise and taxation department, said panchayats had sent 3,048 such proposals in 2019-20, of which only 57 proposals were accepted and 48 were rejected, while the remaining were left out due to some objections. He said in 2020-21, 898 proposals were received through DCs, of which 430 villages were such where there was a complete ban on opening of liquor vends. There were 468 cases in which multiple FIRs had been lodged relating to sale of illicit liquor, due to which there was a ban on the sale of liquor. He said by the end of the financial year, revenue collection from excise is expected to be more than the target. He said ₹978 crore has been received as additional revenue in the last three quarters, which is an increase of around 19.85% against last year. He said ₹6,361 crore was collected last year while this year a revenue of ₹6,214 crore had been collected till March 4 even as the excise year will be till May 19. “Thus, this year’s excise revenue is likely to be higher than the previous year,” he added.‘Panchayats will be functional again from March 8’ Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said that from March 8 the panchayats across the state will become functional again. He said ban on all the financial transactions of Gram Panchayats and other Panchayati Raj Institutions imposed on February 15 will be removed from March 8, provided they function under the supervision of their administrator. He said tenders of over ₹5 lakh will be processed online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-gram-sabhas-can-pass-proposal-to-ban-liquor-vends-till-march-15-101615132213376.html

Karnataka also has witnessed a surge in the number of daily cases and has been asked to increase the number of tests and pace of vaccination by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the six states which have reported a surge in the number of cases and account for more than 84% of the daily recorded cases reported across the country in the last 24 hours.India has reported 18,711 cases in the last 24 hours and 100 fresh fatalities due to Covid-19. Maharashtra’s surge in cases has also become a cause of alarm for health authorities as the state recorded more than 10,000 cases for 3 days in a row. Kerala on Sunday recorded 2,100 cases and 13 deaths taking its tally of infected to 10.77 lakh. More than 4,300 people have died from Covid-19 in the state.The Karnataka government had earlier imposed similar measures in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 across districts which border Maharashtra and Kerala. Dakshina Kannada district administration in February had set up mobile testing units to collect samples at border checkpoints as several people including daily wage workers as well as students travel from Kasaragod to Mangaluru. People going to Kerala from Kasaragod were being tested for Covid-19 before entering Bengaluru. Towards the end of February, the district administration put an end to the practice citing inconvenience to people. The decision by the Dakshina Kannada district administration had also met resistance from the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/commercial-vehicles-drivers-conductors-from-kerala-maharashtra-to-produce-neg-101615130443273.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Open to inputs from industry in framing rules on pvt sector job quota: Dushyant||The Haryana government is open to including suggestions from industry bodies while framing rules for the law that provides 75% reservation in the private sector to job seekers from the state, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said on Sunday. The first meeting for framing the rules will be held here on Monday, he said. Last week, governor Satydeo Narain Arya gave his assent to the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, providing 75% reservation for those who have a domicile certificate and are seeking private-sector jobs that a monthly salary of less than ₹50,000. “It will be our endeavour to frame the rules by the end of this month. Next month, we will run employment drives in all 22 districts and 67 employment exchanges in the state,” Chautala, who holds the industries portfolio, said at a news conference here. Responding to criticism from various quarters, including some members of the industry, he alleged that many people have ‘misconception’ about the law and pointed out that Haryana was not the only state where such a provision had been made. Chautala said the state government held eight rounds of meeting with industry associations before this law was made “and even now we will hold consultations with them”. “After consultations, if we have to incorporate some technical things in the rules, will do that so that industry comes to our state in an even bigger way,” the deputy chief minister said. “Earlier, too we had sought suggestions from them. We will now seek suggestions from industry associations of our state and chambers of industry bodies. We will write to them with copies of the bill and seek suggestions for framing the rules,” he said. In reply to a question, Chautala said Haryana remains a favourite destination for the industry and added that a leading lithium battery manufacturing company was setting up a plant at an investment of ₹7,500 crore. “Top companies, including Amazon, are ready to invest in Haryana,” he said. Hitting out at the Opposition, he said not even one factory has moved out of the state even during the coronavirus pandemic. Asked why a section of the industry was opposing the state government’s reservation move, the deputy chief minister said, “If there are objections, observations of industry, we will hold consultations and resolve it. That is the job of the state government.” On the issue of crop procurement, he said Haryana will start procurement of six crops, including wheat, at minimum support price next month. “Wheat procurement will begin from April 1 in nearly 400 mandis,” Chautala said, adding the farmers will have the option to get the payment for their crops procured directly into their accounts within 48 hours or through ‘Arhitiyas’ (commission agents). Chautala said a majority of the 67.48 per cent farmers from the state have expressed their wish to take payment directly into their bank accounts. On the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders against the three Central farm laws, he said the leaders should hold dialogue with the Union government to resolve the issue||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/open-to-inputs-from-industry-in-framing-rules-on-pvt-sector-job-quota-dushyant-101615130833430.html

The appeal by the umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the stir against the Centre’s farm laws has come as the Congress is set to move a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government on Wednesday. In a video appeal to Haryana farmers and state residents, Darshan Pal, a senior farmer leader from Punjab and a key member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), on Sunday said farmers and other residents should approach the BJP, JJP legislators in their homes and offices. “You should specially put pressure on the BJP-JJP legislators because the Centre is not agreeing to farmers’ demands and for over a month, they have been silent,” he said, adding that a no-confidence motion is being brought against the Haryana government in the state assembly on March 10. “We will be sending a letter, which you should carry, and tell these legislators that they should vote in favour of the no-confidence motion so that the Khattar government comes to know that people stand with this agitation and the government which opposes it will be taught a lesson and that on March 10, they will play their role in bringing down this government,” said Pal. Meanwhile, when asked to comment on the SKM’s move, Haryana’s deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said the farmer leaders should hold a dialogue with the government to resolve the issue. Referring to a series of ‘kisan mahapanchayats’ held by farmers leaders in the past one month, Chautala said, “It seems their leadership is seen less on the borders (protest sites) and more on other platforms in the country.” Claiming that “voices of dissent” are being heard among the MLAs supporting the government, the Congress had last month decided to bring the motion against the state government in the Budget session of the Assembly that began on Friday. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda had said, “The no-confidence motion will let people know which MLA stands with the government and which MLA stands with farmers.” Initially, the Congress wanted to move the no-confidence on March 5, the first day of the Budget session, but its request was turned down by the Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who had fixed March 10 for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pressure-bjp-jjp-mlas-to-back-no-trust-motion-against-haryana-govt-farmers-body-101615130053812.html

The farmer, Rajbir Singh, a resident of Sisai village in Hisar hung himself from a tree. Bahadurgarh city police station house officer Vijay Kumar said, “The farmer left a suicide note. The body has been sent for postmortem examination.”In his suicide note, the farmer said his sacrifice to ensure the three laws are repealed will not go in vain. “ If required, you (farmers) can put my body on the road but you should go home only after the government repeals the three farm laws and gives a legal guarantee of minimum support price. This government wants farmers’ blood and I am giving the same. I appeal to my brothers of Sisai village to return home only after getting their rights. My last wish is that the government should take back these three laws, form a law on the MSP and send farmers home happily. Modi ji you think farmers are so powerful but they were let down by the prices of diesel and pesticide. I am a big fan of Balraj Kundu and Deepender Singh Hooda, who are fighting for the farmers,” wrote the victim.In February, a farmer from Jind had also hung himself from a tree, two kilometres from the protest site in Tikri. Earlier, a farmer from Rohtak had consumed poison at the border and had died during treatment at a hospital in Delhi. In December 2020, a lawyer from Punjab’s Jalalabad had also died by suicide after consuming poison a few kilometres away from the main protest site.

A retest, however, found him negative for the virus.Officials said S Suleiman, who worked in Rourkela Government Hospital as a contractual doctor, was found positive for Covid-19 through RT-PCR testing even after receiving two doses of the Covishield vaccine. On March 3, Suleiman had developed a bad cough and went for a rapid antigen test which came out positive for the disease. He then went for an RT-PCR test, which also confirmed his Covid-19 positive status on Thursday evening.The 71-year-old doctor was surprised as he had taken the first dose of Covishield on January 16 and the second dose on February 15.“I thought I had got the infection at the OPD, where I used to be surrounded by patients who would not adhere to the safety guidelines,” he said.Also read: Covid vaccine rollout 'India’s gift' to world in combating pandemic: ScientistHealth department officials said a repeat RT-PCR test on the doctor was conducted at Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar on Saturday and the result came out negative. His antibody test at the RMRC also showed the presence of a very high amount of antibodies.Additional chief secretary of health department PK Mohapatra ordered a re-test of the original sample which came positive for the virus. Mohapatra said that the RMRC confirmed that Dr Suleiman's original sample has also tested negative. "The initial positive result may have been due to contamination," he said.Last week, the Odisha government had asked a company to explain how its rapid antigen test kits tested samples of 25 engineering students of Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology in Sambalpur district as all of them tested positive for the virus without showing any symptoms of Covid-19. Subsequently, an RT-PCR test was ordered which showed all of them to be negative for the infection.But the Delhi-based company that supplied the kits continued to maintain that the test kits worked fine. Oscar Medicare Pvt Ltd, which had supplied the kits, performed a live demo of the kits in the presence of the nodal officer of Covid-19 at VIMSAR, Burla, and declared that the kits were fine and met all the parameters as per the ICMR and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/odisha-doctor-tests-covid-19-positive-after-vaccination-again-tests-negative-101615127374718.html

There were 11,141 cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in the western state. It had logged 11,447 infections in a single day on October 16 last year. The state’s capital city of Mumbai also witnessed the highest number of daily cases at 1,361 since October 28 last year when it had recorded 1,354 cases in one day. Maharashtra’s positive cases have reached 2,219,727. Of these, 2,068,044 people have recovered from the viral infection while 52,478 people have died with 38 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. Of the total cases, Mumbai contributes 333,569 infections and 11,504 have died in the metropolitan city due to the coronavirus disease. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereAmid the worrisome figures, that have been rising almost every day since the last month, the central government has sent a high-level team to the western state led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The panel was sent on Saturday to Maharashtra and Punjab to assist their health departments and review the prevailing surveillance, control and containment measures. Another team of experts which was in Maharashtra on March 1 and 2 has cited local body elections, crowding in public transports, opening of schools and increased gatherings as the possible reasons for the Covid-19 upsurge in the state. "While the exact causes of the surge are not known— since laxity in Covid-19 behaviour is not specific to the state — the possible factors are Covid-inappropriate behaviour due to lack of fear of disease, pandemic fatigue; miss outs and super spreaders,” the report stated. As cases had begun to rise in the state last month, starting from the Vidarbha region, the chief minister had warned of another lockdown. While shutdowns and night curfews have been imposed in districts reporting a high number of cases, there is so far no word on the statewide lockdown even though Thackeray has said he was not in favour of it. Maharashtra is among the five states that are currently reporting the maximum number of daily cases of the coronavirus disease. Along with it, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu accounted for 84.71% of the 18,711 new daily cases reported in a day by Sunday morning, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-over-11-000-covid-19-cases-first-time-in-nearly-5-months-101615126475283.html
07-03-2021||Pune||How political leadership and bureaucrats handled Pune’s Covid crisis||Pune: On July 27 last year, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting in Pune to review the Covid situation in the city. During the meeting, a decision was taken to set up two jumbo hospitals in Pune to deal with the rising cases of infection. The day saw 1,160 fresh cases, taking the active case tally to 18,546, of which 744 were in a critical condition and 97 were on ventilators. The city’s positivity rate of that week was 19.80%. Already late on announcement, the two facilities – one at the College of Engineering in Pune (CoEP) and another at Annasaheb Magar ground in Pimpri-Chinchwad – were to come up by August 20. However, the delay in erecting these Covid care centres and subsequent issues about management of CoEP hospital only deteriorated patients’ confidence in the facility. The result was additional burden on already strained network of private and public hospitals. During July, August and September, Pune faced severe shortage of beds, and as the caseload began to rise, patients began to be turned away from hospitals and many couldn’t receive adequate care on time. Even the city’s fatalities also grew sharply – at one point it crossed the 100- mark. If the virus situation was getting worse every passing day, political leadership was not much visible on the ground unlike in Mumbai. While Pawar was regularly monitoring the situation by spending weekends, instructing officials to tighten the prevention norms, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray preferred to observe it through video conferencing. He made a brief visit to the city only once following criticism, though it failed to convince his political detractors. Realising the looming crisis, the state health department activated the recently constructed Sassoon building with additional beds in the initial phase. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) also turned one of its buildings in Baner into a 300- bed hospital. As the city stands at the door of another wave with the daily caseload crossing 1,900 on Saturday (March 6), authorities are more proactive as they have already kept jumbo hospital ready while instructing to restart Covid care centres All this while, Pune, like the rest of the country, was witnessing several restrictions as well as unlocking. Pune was among the first cities that faced restrictions after the first case was reported on March 9. The then divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar monitored the situation with PMC machinery also stepping in. Sinhgad road where the first Covid positive couple stay was sealed while contact tracing was ordered. After Mhaisekar’s retirement, Saurabh Rao has been dealing with the situation in the district. The initial aggression in tracing contacts was missing post September when the state government announced the “My Family My Responsibility” campaign. Pune’s public transport buses were off the road since March 24 for over 150 days for common citizens when the lockdown began. Trains and state transport buses too stopped plying while gates of gardens were closed. Roads were deserted and residents remained locked inside their houses. This was unprecedented. However, stricter lockdowns in two phases – first between March and June and another for 10 days during July – slowed the spread of virus. If the orders for lockdown came straight from the Centre and state, its lifting created confusion in Pune as multiple officials asserted their authority. For Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, two municipal corporations were given responsibility while in rural parts of district, the collector decided about unlocking based on orders from Maharashtra chief secretary. Multiple orders in adjoining areas created confusion, which was later sorted out as things settled. One of the much appreciated part during the crisis was the war room started by PMC. It maintained area wise data in real time, which helped authorities concentrate on hotspot during the rapidly changing situation. However, the number of samples tested on daily basis was not as high as Mumbai despite caseload being almost equal. During the pandemic, Pune earned the distinction of being India’s highest infected city. For this, people too were responsible as compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour was missing. As city looks at another Covid wave, authorities and people need to be proactive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/how-political-leadership-and-bureaucrats-handled-pune-s-covid-crisis-101615126572542.html

Next month, we will run employment drives in all 22 districts and 67 employment exchanges in the state," Chautala, who holds the industries portfolio, said at a news conference here.Responding to criticism from various quarters, including some members of the industry, he alleged that many people have "misconception" about the law and pointed out that Haryana was not the only state where such a provision had been made.Chautala said the state government held eight rounds of meeting with industry associations before this law was made "and even now we will hold consultations with them"."After consultations, if we have to incorporate some technical things in the rules, will do that so that industry comes to our state in an even bigger way," the deputy chief minister said."Earlier too we had sought suggestions from them. We will now seek suggestions from industry associations of our state and chambers of industry bodies. We will write to them with copies of the bill and seek suggestions for framing the rules," he said.In reply to a question, Chautala said Haryana remains a favourite destination for the industry and added that a leading lithium battery manufacturing company was setting up a plant at an investment of ₹7,500 crore."Top companies, including Amazon, are ready to invest in Haryana," he said.Hitting out at the opposition, he said not even one factory has moved out of the state even during the coronavirus pandemic.Asked why a section of the industry was opposing the state government's reservation move, the deputy chief minister said, "If there are objections, observations of industry, we will hold consultations and resolve it. That is the job of the state government."On the issue of crop procurement, he said Haryana will start procurement of six crops, including wheat, at minimum support price next month."Wheat procurement will begin from April 1 in nearly 400 mandis," Chautala said, adding the farmers will have the option to get the payment for their crops procured directly into their accounts within 48 hours or through 'Arhitiyas' (commission agents).Chautala said a majority of the 67.48 per cent farmers from the state have expressed their wish to take payment directly into their bank accounts.On the farmers' protest at Delhi's borders against the three Central farm laws, he said the leaders should hold dialogue with the Union government to resolve the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-deputy-cm-says-open-to-suggestions-from-industry-bodies-on-rules-for-private-sector-reservation-law-101615124139639.html

The Bengali icon was welcomed into the BJP’s fold just weeks before the state polls by the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and state president Dilip Ghosh ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s massive rally in Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground.“The campaign will begin on March 12. I will join. If you have watched Fatakeshto, you would know,” the National Award-winning actor said, while making a vague reference to his film series when asked about his role in the BJP, according to news agency ANI.Chakraborty played the lead role in the movie MLA Fatakesto where he was cast as an anti-social who takes up the challenge of becoming a legislator and brings about changes in seven days. In the sequel of the movie, he is elevated to the position of a minister but finds himself in a similar situation where he has to fight corrupt colleagues to give back power to the people.Reference to the Fatakesto film series were made before and after Chakraborty’s formal induction into the BJP.

I am a pure gokhro. Ek chobolei chhobi (one bite would turn you into a photograph).”Chakraborty said that it is a dream come true moment for him as he has now become a part of the BJP.

07-03-2021||Other||Women’s T20 cricket league has NextGen female cricketers playing for keeps||Pune: The Girls Sadu Shinde Cricket League (T20), being played at the Law college ground has little fanfare, hype or buzz associated with the shortest form of international cricket. That is, until, during a drinks break or after the game, you have a word with the cricketers on the field. The grassroots and the future of Indian women’s cricket is here, being played out by straight driving batswomen; devilishly quick (even by women’s cricket standards) fast bowlers; and “field first, talk later” cricket coaches. Mithali Raj, Smriti Mandhana and Harmanpreet Kaur are the names spoken of in inspirational tones and the Indian women’s cricket team’s two runner-up finishes in the previous T20 world cups is the key driving factor. “I have watched both the finals, and played cricket for the last three years. We all are from Kolhapur and we follow women’s cricket. We have 34 girls from our school who play cricket every day,” is how Saumyalata Birajdar, captain of the Stadium Cricket Club, describes her passion. At the Law college ground, Stadium Cricket Club defeated Sahamat Cricket Club by 24 runs in a group stage match. In the 2017 T20 World Cup final, the Indian women’s team lost to England, and in 2020, India went down against Australia, again in the final. At the Law college ground, player of the match, Sneha Sale took four wickets for 17 runs for Stadium Cricket Club. “I have only watched the final of the 2020. The performance by the Indian team, gave us all the belief that women can make a career in cricket. Now parents don’t object when we go and play cricket,” says Sale. Currently there are 40 cricket clubs in Pune where women are training. The Pune District Cricket Association (PDCA) has been organising the cricket league for women for the last six years. “This year, 20 teams are participating and it is the highest number so far,” said Arvind Shivale, president, PDCA. PDCA also has plans of conducting 50-over tournaments in future. Kirti Ghatge, a big fan of Shoaib Akthar, wants to bowl fast like him. “I love taking long run-ups, but I still don’t have much pace; I am working on it,” said Ghatge, a 16-year-old bowler from Sahamat Cricket Club. “Women cricketers not only in Pune city but around the state have a busy schedule these days as local tournaments have increased in the last three years. Since cricket restarted, after the Covid break, we have been having back-to-back tournaments; sometimes even two matches on the same day. More girls now want to take up cricket professionally,” says Tejal Hasabnis, an India ‘A’ player. Indian player Mona Meshram, who visited Pune to play a local tournament last month, adds, “The dimension of women cricket has changed in the last few years. All talk is about women cricket and the number of girls training in clubs has also increased.” Mohan Jadhav, coach, Vengsarkar Cricket Academy, says, “I remember 5 years before there were only five entries for the Girls Sadu Shinde Cricket League (T20), but the number now is 20. Even at the Vengsarkar Cricket Academy we now have a complete team.”The women are showing interest in maintaining their fitness and quality of their game has also improved.Vikram Deshmukh, founder of Cricket Next Academy, says, “From the age of 10 girls have started playing cricket and they have developed sharp knowledge about the game. Parents are also coming forward and allowing them to play.”Tournament details Girls Sadu Shinde Cricket League (T20) Total teams: 20 Teams divided in four groups; teams play 3 matches in league round Teams: Group A: ATS, Clubs of Club, AK Black Panthers, Gaikwad CA, Group B: PDCA, PYC, PMP, Shirur Sports, Group C: Vengsarkar Cricket Academy, AK Thunderbolt, Charandros, Nanaware (SA Girls) Group D: Sahamat Cricket Club, Surya Education Trust, Stadium CC, Rising Sports Group E: Warriors CA, RK Cricket, Azam Sports, Holy Spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/womens-t20-cricket-league-has-nextgen-female-cricketers-playing-for-keeps-101615116552726.html
07-03-2021||West||PM Modi schools TMC on its ‘outsider’ narrative, says Bengal is in BJP’s DNA||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee should correct herself before calling the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) an ‘outsider’ and pointed out that her Trinamool Congress was formed after breaking away from the Congress.“Didi says things which are against the idea of Bengal. Tagore, Vivekananda and Netaji, who are guiding lights of our nation, are hurt by the ‘outsider’ narrative peddled by the TMC. Few people invoke the name of the Indian National Congress but are the founders of the INC outsiders or insiders?” PM Modi asked while addressing a mega rally in Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground.“The Left Front who ruled Bengal for a long time and whose ideas of governance are based on the teachings of Mao Zedong, Karl Marx or Lenin, are these people outsiders or not? Similarly, the Trinamool Congress is an offshoot of the Congress. They left the Congress because of political gains,” PM Modi added.The Prime Minister went on to explain to the massive gathering the reason why the BJP is the only party in the country which was formed keeping Bengal’s culture and thinking at its core. “The idea of the BJP came from Bengal’s great son Syama Prasad Mookerjee. The BJP is a party whose existence is interwoven with Bengal’s existence. The BJP smells of Bengal and Bengal is in the BJP’s DNA. We are indebted to Bengal, we cannot pay this debt but we will usher in an era of development,” PM Modi said.PM Modi then challenged the Trinamool Congress by saying that the BJP ensured the state’s ruling party was routed in West Bengal during the Lok Sabha elections and said this time the party will ensure that they are fully ousted from West Bengal. “During the Lok Sabha elections, the TMC’s (vote share) was cut into half, this time (their vote share) will be saaf (cleared).”During the rally, the Prime Minister promised that it is the BJP who will bring ‘ashol poriborton’ (real change) to Bengal and asked people to fearlessly vote for his party. He also said that Banerjee he once knew has now disappeared. PM Modi said that he does not remember the person who fought against the Left Front government a decade earlier. He alleged that she now herself practices the politics of nepotism which she had once decried.“You are Bengal’s Didi (an honorific term used to address an elder sister) yet you choose to take care of one nephew. Endless nephews and nieces of Bengal are yearning for your ‘Mamata’, what about them?” PM Modi asked taking a jibe at Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee who is also Mamata Banerjee’s nephew.Assembly elections in West Bengal will be held in eight phases from March 27 and the last round of polling will take place on April 29. Votes will be counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/pm-modi-schools-tmc-on-its-outsider-narrative-says-bengal-is-in-bjp-s-dna-101615116051400.html

How Pune civic hospital infra revved up||When Pune reported its first Covid case in Maharashtra on March 9, 2020, all it had was the Naidu hospital equipped to deal with the pandemic-infected.As numbers started growing the administration took necessary measures to control the spread.At the same time, the civic body also realised the importance of critical care for a city the size of Pune.Surprisingly until the pandemic hit, not one PMC-run hospital had a single ventilator. This caused the civic body to go on a spree investing in ICU facilities centralised oxygen tanks at its hospitals.In just a few months, the city’s government hospitals had 30 ventilators, all courtesy CSR donations or via the PM Cares fund. The pandemic forced the civic body to ramp up its health infrastructure in record time. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the city’s only infection- control hospital Naidu hospital, also one of its kind in the state, did not have a ventilator. Naidu hospital was the first-response hospital against Covid-19, but had to depend on Sassoon hospital for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients, as it did not have a critical care unit. Dr Sudhir Patsute, medical superintendent, Dr Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital, Pune, said, “The challenge was not in upgrading the facilities, which happened immediately as an when required. The major challenge was crowd and staff management. During such an extraordinary situation there is always a staff crunch; staff is infected, they are exhausted working continuously for days, and then there is a shortage of experts.”“However, Naidu hospital had an advantage, as we handled the H1N1 pandemic. The lessons we learnt during that period helped me and the staff to cope with the challenge. We also treated the first patient using the training we were imparted back in November 2019, when the pandemic had not yet broken out in the state,” Dr Patsute added.The civic body also constructed the Baner hospital with 312 beds for critical care, including 270 oxygenated beds, 26 ICU beds and 16 ventilators. The hospital is currently dedicated for Covid-19 patients, but will eventually be opened for other ailments once the pandemic comes to an end. The Baner hospital was completely built on CSR funds and the hospital was “gifted” to the city to meet the pandemic needs, which will, in future, cater to the non-Covid-19 needs of the city. A senior health official said, “Prior to the pandemic, the PMC had only one ventilator at the Kamala Nehru hospital for the NICU unit. We had no ICU units, ventilators or even central oxygenated systems at any of our hospitals. Due to the pandemic we got 30 ventilators, all of which were either allocated to us through the PM Cares funds or through CSR. These ventilators have been temporarily shifted for non-Covid-19 use, but can be re-allocated if needed. However, we have those with us now. In addition to this the ventilators at the COEP Jumbo facility will be allocated to PMC, PCMC and Pune rural outlets, so we will get those extra ventilators too.”The official also added that Naidu hospital now has 20 ICU beds, and Dalvi hospital has 10 ICU beds. “In terms of oxygenated beds, we built central oxygen tanks at four of our hospitals, namely Dlavi hospital, PMC’s Bopodi hospital, Laygude Hospital and Naidu hospital,” the official added.Sassoon upgradeSassoon General Hospitals, the oldest government hospital, also saw a major upgrade, first proposed following the 2009 Swine flu pandemic in the city. Finally, after a 12-year long wait, within months of the Covid-19 pandemic, the requirements of the city forced the administration to upgrade the much-needed facility.Sassoon is the oldest government hospital in the district and also caters to the needs of the neighbouring districts, including Satara, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Kolhapur. The new building added 100 rooms, 50 with attached bathrooms and toilets, while the remaining 50 with common bathroom and toilets. The extended portion will be a state-of-the-art hospital with organ transplant units. The new building will also have departments of TB, skin care, orthopaedics, ophthalmology and ENT. The entire project cost is ₹250 crore and was put in to action only to meet the emergency needs of the district.Data collectionThe pandemic also helped the civic body collect a huge database, which it did not have prior to Covid-19, regarding the comorbid population in the city. The database, which was undertaken following the state government’s directives under the ‘My family, My responsibility’ initiative. The door-to-door survey registered the number of comorbid people who may be suffering from the most common ailments, including diabetes and hypertension. The survey also classified the population as per the health requirements by registering the most vulnerable population, as per age.It was found that Pune city has 12 lakh people who are “high risk”, which includes those above 50-years of age and those below 50-years of age, but with associated comorbidities. The same data will now help the city prioritise its most vulnerable population that needs to be vaccinated against Covid-19 first. This database, if regularly updated, can also help in developing the city’s healthcare infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/030-in-no-time-ventilators-that-is-how-pune-civic-hospital-infra-revved-up-101615115232978.html

07-03-2021||Delhi||Rich, rustic, robust: The taste of Punjab||There’s something energetic and mood lifting about the cuisine. The colourful, spicy, buttery dishes that showcase the lively culinary tradition of Punjab have been the favourite of gourmands across cultures. “Punjabi food has been nurtured in hearts and palates rather than recipe books. It is so widely popular because of the use of fresh seasonal ingredients, and vibrant culture and folklore - all woven together,” says Sandeep Pande, executive chef, JW Marriot, New Delhi. The hotel had recently organised a food festival to celebrate the local, rustic flavours of Punjab. Bittu Meat Wala, a native from Amritsar, Punjab, visited Delhi and showcased recipes such as Amritsari Burrah, Bhatti da Murgh, Wadiyan Matar, Choley Kulchey, transporting guests to the rustic and authentic Punjab. “Punjab with its rich cultivating land and five rivers is ideal for growing crops and thus it’s called the granary of India. Punjabi cuisine stood the test of time because of its self sufficiency. Punjab is capable of producing its own requirement be it crops, milk or spices. Whatever happened in and around Punjab didn’t affect its food culture and thus it was able to retain its uniqueness,” says Chef Sanjay Vij, executive chef, Vivanta Surajkund. Punjabi food is considered to be one of the best when it comes to innovation and experimentation, say experts. Chef Monish Gujral, chairman of Moti Mahal Delux, says, “Punjabi cuisine is a result of experimentation. It’s a fusion of Mughlai food (the delicacies that the Mughals brought in the 18th century) and Punjabi recipes from the North-West province. Butter chicken and chicken tikka were created from the fusion. Punjabis added their flavours into the Mughlai kitchen and the food that we love today is the result of that fusion.”The Punjabi food as we know it today is an outcome of historic events but there is more to it. It’s an exciting exchange of various cultures and traditions. “During the partition, the Punjabis from Pakistan brought the tandoor. It opened up the world of barbequed fares. From the North-West frontier arrived simple but robust flavours of nomadic people. The cross-cultural influences resulted in embracing fresh and dried nuts from Afghanistan. In fact, the iconic dhaba culture evolved out of the need for survival for the displaced peoples of Punjab,” says Vij. Due to its flavours to style of cooking, easy techniques and approach, the cuisine transcended far and wide. However, chefs have been adding novelty into their creations. “Ingredients such as broccoli, morels, wild mushrooms, finer cuts of meats, and cold water fish are finding a place in modern Punjabi restaurant menus, leading to bigger ingredient baskets for chefs,” says Chef Gurpreet Singh, culinary director, Daryaganj Hospitality group. Alternate grains such as jawar, bajra and amaranth are also gradually finding place in the cuisine. The cooking methods in Punjabi cuisine are mostly simple, tried and tested methods. “Spices are freshly grounded, crushed with the traditional mortar and pestle. Tempering or tadka is another method of adding zing to the food. Use of brass and copper utensils is prevalent in Punjabi cuisine, owing to its health benefits,” says Vij. Pande adds, “The food needs to be cooked with care whilst cooking meats and dairy together. Also, the balance of sour, spice and salt needs to be perfect. Another factor is temperature control of chulahs and tandoors to create unforgettable dishes.” So, which Punjabi recipe are you trying this weekend?Chicken Pakoda Recipe:Ingredients● Chicken 1 - Cut into small pieces (No Boneless) - 800 gms● 2 TBSP Ginger- Garlic Paste● 250 grams Yogurt● 150 Grams Besan (Chickpea Flour)● 2 Eggs● 3 Green Chilies● 1 TBSP Grounded Cumin seeds● 1 TBSP Kasuri Methi● 1 TBSP Red Chilly Powder● 1 TBSP Salt● 1 TBSP Black Pepper Powder● Refined Oil for Frying.Process: 1.

Considering the seriousness of allegations against her, it is necessary that the investigation is carried out thoroughly," said justice Sarang Kotwal, while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of the judicial magistrate, Archana Jatkar.Jatkar has been booked by Dehu Road police station on the basis of a complaint lodged by Swapnil Shevkar, a milk vendor.Shevkar said on January 4, 2021 a woman came to his residence and informed his brother that a criminal complaint was filed against Shevkar and it could result in levying some serious charges against him. She gave her mobile number so that Shevkar could contact her.When Shevkar contacted and later met her, the woman, Jatkar's associate Shubhavari Gaikwad, informed him that she could settle the matter for him, if he agreed to pay Rs. 5 lakh. After negotiations, she reduced the amount to Rs. 3 lakh.Shevkar lodged a complaint with the anti-corruption bureau. On January 14, 2021, Shevkar met the woman, who sat in his car and moved around. At one spot, she accepted the bribe amount and got down from the vehicle. ACB sleuths then arrested Gaikwad, who revealed she had accepted the bribe amount on behalf of Jatkar, a judicial magistrate first class at Vadgaon Maval in Pune district.Jatkar first moved the sessions court at Pune for pre-arrest bail before approaching the HC after the sessions court rejected her plea on February 23.The JMFC contended that she was staying alone in Pune along with her 11-month-old baby since her husband was employed in Mumbai. She claimed she came in contact with Gaikwad while looking for a babysitter. She said she wasn’t aware of such activities of the woman.Justice Kotwal refused to accept her claim of innocence after noticing that certain conversations between Jatkar and Gaikwad referred to the case and at least prima facie indicated involvement of the JMFC in the crime.Also Read: 20 years on, court acquits 122 people accused of SIMI linksHC noted that investigation showed that there were 147 telephonic calls exchanged between the Applicant (Jatkar) and Gaikwad."These conversations are a strong indication of the applicant’s involvement in the offence," said justice Kotwal while rejecting her pre-arrest bail plea."Therefore considering the gravity of offence, order of anticipatory bail cannot be passed in her favour. Her custodial interrogation is necessary to find out the exact nature of relation between both the accused and as to whether in any other case these two have acted similarly," the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-judicial-magistrate-booked-in-bribery-case-101615092060208.html

We are trying to identify the deceased person and his body has been sent for post-mortem. As this is a sensitive area we have sought additional patrolling staff from the authorities as in the recent years, many such incidents of elephant-human conflict have come to light,” said Singh.Additional superintendent of police Pauri Garhwal Manisha Joshi also arrived at the spot and directed the deployment of police personnel as well as putting up warning signages about elephant movement in the area.Notably, last month on February 22 in a similar incident, an elephant had mowed down a person at Phoolchatti road near Neelkanth shrine-Lakshman Jhula area in Pauri Garhwal district.The wild elephant also rammed into nearby shops, damaging three of them and breaking window panes of a goods transport van parked adjacent to the shops.While two years ago in March, a 20-year-old youth, returning after paying obeisance at the Neelkanth shrine, was trampled to death when an elephant attacked him and his friends near Mauni Baba junction of Neelkanth-Lakshman Jhula stretch.Three days ago, a leopard attacked a Scooty driver near Chandolarai village on Premnagar- Gadauli-Khandah stretch of Pauri.Also Read: Uttarakhand Congress alleges corruption, mismanagement in MahakumbhForest range officer Pauri, Anil Bhatt said in view of the wild animal incidents, additional deployment of forest patrolling team has been done in Gadauli area and local people have been urged to be cautious and report to the forest control room immediately if they spot leopard movement.Local resident Rajendra Bhandari said that in recent months, movement of elephants in this area had increased, demanding round the clock deployment of forest personnel as both pilgrims and local people are under threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-man-trampled-to-death-by-elephant-on-neelkanth-stretch-101615087245793.html
07-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress alleges corruption, mismanagement in Mahakumbh||The sixth day of the ongoing budget session of Uttarakhand assembly witnessed a heated debate, with the Opposition Congress alleging corruption and mismanagement in several projects including the upcoming Haridwar Mahakumbh.Led by the Leader of Opposition (LoP), Indira Hridayesh, the opposition moved an adjournment motion in the House over alleged corruption in NH-74 case, high court’s old order to probe corruption allegations against chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, alleged corruption in the state labour board and others, demanding a debate on the same."The government talks of zero tolerance towards corruption but the reality is totally different as there is rampant corruption in the state under this government," said Congress MLA Pritam Singh. "The multi-crore NH-74 scam, state labour board scam and SC-ST scholarship scam, all prove rampant corruption in the state but the government is not ready to accept and makes false claims of zero tolerance to corruption," he continued. He also claimed that the government didn’t appoint a Lokpal despite a promise by the CM in 2017.Parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said the debate sought in the adjournment motion couldn’t be allowed as the cases mentioned in the motion were sub-judice and under probe.Later, Congress MLA Pritam objected to the curtailing of Haridwar Maha Kumbh to one month on the pretext of Coronavirus pandemic, while the opposition benches alleged "mismanagement and irregularities" in the organisation of the mega religious event. Pritam claimed that no one knew how much money has been spent so far as the event was limited only to Har Ki Pauri ghat of Haridwar this time .In response, minister Kaushik said the issue couldn’t be discussed in the house. "The Mahakumbh issue can't be discussed in the House as the High Court on Friday constituted a committee to monitor the works being done in Mahakumbh," he said.Congress MLA Nizamuddin responded by asking Madan Kaushik: "If the issue of Haridwar Mahakumbh can't be discussed in this state assembly then where will it be discussed?" Amid the heated argument, the Speaker of the assembly didn't allow the issue to be taken up.Later during the day, Nizamuddin raised the issue of the 108 emergency ambulance service in the state, alleging the ambulances were not reaching the spot in time.Kaushik responded by saying that at present, the state had 140 ambulances operating under the service, while 132 more ambulances were ordered for the purpose including the 71 that had arrived. He said the response time of ambulances will also improve gradually.Also Read: A month on, questions remain over cause of Chamoli disaster"Their response time in urban areas is 13 minutes 57 seconds while in rural areas it is 23 minutes 36 seconds. As more ambulances are added in the fleet, the response time will improve."The minister also promised a probe into BJP’s Kiccha MLA, Rajesh Shukla’s allegation that he was not allowed in a meeting of zila panchayat in his area by the representative of Panchayati Raj minister Arvind Pandey.Earlier during the day, Opposition MLAs brought ‘ganga jal’ to their sit-in protest at the entrance of the House, alleging mismanagement in the Haridwar Mahakumbh. The government said that the opposition had run out of ideas."The Mahakumbh has been curtailed due to the pandemic but the allegation of mismanagement is baseless. Congress has no issues to raise, hence they are doing this," minister Madan Kaushik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-congress-alleges-corruption-mismanagement-in-mahakumbh-101615085315175.html

Police have arrested two persons in the case, said officials.Police claimed that the men were making bombs in a hideout at Gosaba when the explosion took place. The dead man has been identified as one Sovan Debnath.“We have already arrested two persons and a case has been initiated in which the injured persons have been named as accused,” said a senior police officer.Assembly elections in the state would kick off from March 27 and would be held in eight phases. The contest is widely-anticipated to be bi-polar between the TMC and the BJP. Both the parties have accused each other of resorting to violence in the run up to the polls.“Political violence has hit the peak. TMC-goons have now started attacking with bombs,” tweeted Arvind Menon, BJP’s national general secretary.Also Read: Suvendu Adhikari to fight Didi in NandigramLocal TMC leaders, however, denied the charge and alleged that those injured the blast were BJP workers, who were making bombs when the explosion took place.Earlier on February 17, a deputy minister in the Bengal government, Jakir Hossain was injured along with 22 others in an explosion on a railway platform in Murshidabad district.

In 2021 too, the day prompts one to create conversation around the women's right to live, equality, vote, education etc.As for the lighting up of monuments, this has been an international trend followed to mark important days.

07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati: Women’s Lib, the new normal style||The new normal has perhaps done for women’s liberation what the old normal’s Women’s Lib couldn’t do. By making de-glam the new glam, it has liberated women from the compulsions of superwoman-hood, like looking picture perfect for all reasons and all seasons, come vain or shine.Never mind if new normal’s narrative of women’s liberation has got to do more with ‘cosmetic change’.On the eve of Women’s Day, here’s unmasking cosmetic changes scripted in the Women’s Lib narrative and here’s raising a tongue-in-cheek toast to new normal’s emblems of empowerment.What’s one of the invaluable lessons the pandemic has taught us? That burning bras may not be the best path to gender equality. For the simple reason that in pandemic season it’s more practical to convert bras, hitherto destined to become martyrs in the feminist ritualism, into ‘burqas’ or, as yours truly earlier coined the term, ‘half burqas’, or as some smart humorists called them ‘face bras’, the alternative catchphrase-ism for none other than new normal’s sartorial emblem —the mask.The perfect practical gift of the pandemic to feminism is thus not bra burning, but bra churning. Churning out and converting all outdated (or outsized) lacy lingerie into that ubiquitous face mask may be a more practical Pandemic ploy.Of (No) Lipstick Under My BurkhaIf you belong to the section of quarantining India’s womanhood that found itself bearing a poetic resemblance to bushy pet poodles or pomeranians as far as flaunting furry epidermis goes, pandemic’s phraseology such as ‘lady-stache’ will strike an instant chord in the cockles of your heart.A quarantine season that gifted a whole new vocabulary of phrases —‘lady-stache’ (female moustache), ‘maskne’ (acne induced by the mask) et al, has translated this downgrading and de-grooming into emblems of liberation.By making zero makeup the new normal, it’s liberated an entire generation of pandemic’s womanhood from the pressures of living up to the cosmetic stereotypes – of 24x7 looking prettier, younger and sassier. It’s liberated womanhood from the dependence on the perpetrators of these cosmetic stereotypes — blushers, balms or botox.Zero lipstick is the new mantra of the new normal’s greenroom —Zoom.India quarantining spelt not only womanhood’s liberation from lipstick, but also lipstick’s liberation from traditional roles.The zero dependence on lipstick and newfound liberation from the vanity box, has seen not only womanhood reinventing itself, but may also see the lipstick being reborn. And how!What better than to wear this lipstick liberation on the sleeve by dabbing that hot red lipstick not on masked lips but employing it as a ‘marker’ or ‘crayon’ for highlighting presentations on Zoom meetings!The curious case of ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ being reborn as ‘Lipstick on My Browser’.Of 50 Shades of GreyA spillover of the liberation from the vanity box has been on the scalps of India quarantining. Denied access to salons and hairdressers during Lockdown, many a blow-dried and colour coiffured specimen of womanhood was left high and dry without her desi or non-desi Chinese hairstylist, be it a Spruce “Lee” or hairdressing’s Hoo’s Hu.What this translated into was quarantined diva-hood first trying a hand not at painting the town red, but the head red. When these exercises in cranial camouflaging became cumbersome and when zero socialising made pandemic life not something to ‘dye’ for, there was born another chapter of womanhood’s liberation —freedom from hair colouring.If during the pandemic you suddenly sighted status update-ism on the social media boasting more than Fifty Shades of Grey, you saw it right. You were witness to an unsung New Normal narrative of women’s emancipation from the pressures of camouflaging their age under layers of hair colour.The curious case of Who Moved My Hair-Grease!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witerati-women-s-lib-the-new-normal-style-101615061588936.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The spirit of learning||To be born a Gujarati Indian and yet gladly forsake a life in San Diego, California. To follow it up and turn down an offer to live in a palace just to learn an ancient art. So goes an inspirational episode in humanity’s eternal quest for knowledge.Sarfrazuddin Malik, scion of a family of erstwhile jagirdars from Dasada, Gujarat, nurtured an inborn, insatiable passionfor falconry. Malik’s immigration to California was replete with opportunities to train and fly birds such as kestrels but those American birds did not leave him satisfied. Then, Malik came across an article in the National Geographic (NG) of 1942 on the Maharajas of Bhavnagar who were flying great raptors such as Peregrine and Saker falcons, Eurasian sparrowhawks and Northern goshawks (Punjab’s state bird) under the tutelage of Baazdar Fatekhan’s dynasty. Bhavnagar was so close to Malik’s home — right under his proverbial nose — but here he was flying lesser falcons in faraway foreign fields!Appointed hereditary falconers to the Maharajas of Bhavnagar, the Baazdar Khans were Pathans originally hailing from Talwandi Chaudhrian, Sultanpur Lodhi, in Punjab. The Bhavnagar royals included the acclaimed field naturalist, conservationist, author and falconer, the late prince RS Dharmakumarsinhji, who had been asked by the government of India in 1950 to survey Punjab and four other states to find suitable wildlife areas.“The NG article clutched tightly in my hand, I abandoned California in 1970 and met the erstwhile prince of Bhavnagar, Shivbhadrasinhji, and requested him to allow me to learn falconry from Fatekhan’s grandson Gulam Hussain. Since I came from a family of jagirdars, the prince offered me his Bhavnagar palace to stay but said that Hussain could not stay in the palace while teaching me as he was a servant. But learning falconry required getting up before dawn to tame the hawk or falcon and imbibing the nuances from the ustaad 24 x 7. I politely declined the offer of the palace and moved into Hussain’s small house. The house was packed with family so I would sleep some nights on the terrace’s chicken coop and developed ring-like rashes on my skin due to parasites. The result was that I learnt with precision the art of falconry, recognised by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage of mankind,” Malik told this writer.Malik’s single-minded devotion to his ustaad stood him in good stead. His expertise underpinned the complexities of managing raptors at the Ahmedabad zoo for several years. At 72, Malik is actively engaged in the rescue and rehabilitation of injured and ill raptors and also nurturing and setting free fallen raptor nestlings. He is a dogged advocate in the field for pesticide-free agriculture as contamination harms birds immensely,as established by the effects of DDT on Peregrine breeding in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-the-spirit-of-learning-101615060510296.html
07-03-2021||Dehradun||BJP postpones Dhankar’s meeting in Yamunanagar||Just hours before BJP state chief OP Dhankar’s scheduled visit to Yamunanagar, the party on Saturday night announced that the meeting had been postponed citing ‘personal reasons’ and the leader’s ‘busy schedule due to assembly session’.A message circulated by the party’s district media coordinator Kapil Garg said the meeting had been rescheduled for March 17, when the assembly session ends. Dhankar, a former agriculture minister and MLA from Jhajjar’s Badli constituency had, however, failed to get re-elected in the 2019 assembly polls. District party chief Rajesh Sapra said, “The program was postponed due to his urgency for some other meetings. He was scheduled to attend several cadre meetings here that could have taken a full day and he had urged us to reschedule it after two weeks.”Dhankar was scheduled to address district executive, core group and other meetings for the first time around noon since he took over as the state president last year.After the announcement, BKU (Charuni) district chief Sanju Gudiana, who had chaired meetings in several villages inviting residents to join the protest, said, “The district administration officials had called us earlier in the day to convince us to limit the protest to one spot but we refused. On Friday, they had urged us to skip the agitation but we were adamant to act on the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s call to ban his entry.”On Friday, former chief minister and leader of the opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda had said, “There is a need to move a no confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government as it has completely lost public confidence and the coalition is betraying public opinion and taking anti-people decisions one after the other. This is why the public no longer has any faith in the government. The situation has become such that the chief ministers, ministers and MLAs are scared to go out in public.”The Yamunanagar police had made elaborate arrangements to counter the ire of the farmer unions that have already announced a ‘repeat of Kaimla’, where CM Manohar Lal’s helicopter was not allowed to land in a Karnal village for a pro-farm-law rally in January.In a statement issued earlier in the day, superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal said tight security arrangements had been made and blockades had been setup at different places in the district. On the series of meetings and arrangements made ahead of Dhankar’s meeting, DC Mukul Kumar remained incommunicado, while Sapra said, “The administration had to make their own arrangements to maintain law and order. As far as the meeting at the party office is concerned, we were also fully prepared.”Earlier in the day, the party’s state general secretary Vedpal, an advocate, also had to addressed a press conference, urging unions to skip the protest as it was a party meeting, not a government event. Vedpal also blamed the opposition for doing politics in name of the agitation and invited them to a political contest before the voters.“The unions are scared of us, as our party has been telling the real truth about the farm laws to the people. Using the brotherhood of the society to hide the truth is wrong,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/bjp-postpones-dhankar-s-meeting-in-yamunanagar-101615059908824.html
07-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi will have its own school education board||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that the national capital will soon have its own school education board that will aim at replacing the existing practice of “rote learning” with “application-based learning” and prepare “staunchly patriotic” and “self-reliant” students.Delhi has 1,030 government schools and at least 1,700 private schools. While all government schools and majority of the private schools are affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), a few private schools are also associated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). Unlike other states, Delhi does not have its own state education board. There are about 1,500,000 government school students in Delhi.The CM said that initially, 20-25 Delhi government schools will become part of the Delhi Board of School Education in the upcoming academic session (2021-22). Under the new board, students will be assessed throughout the year to develop holistic learning outcomes and make students self-reliant. The 2021-22 academic session of CBSE will begin in April.The decision to set up the new education board was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by the chief minister on Saturday.Some experts welcomed the move, saying that there has been a need for a state education board for many years that caters specifically to Delhi’s students. The new board will have a governing body headed by the Delhi education minister and an executive body that will be headed by a chief executive officer.“In today’s cabinet meeting, we have given approval to the constitution of a Delhi Board of School Education. The board will function in close alignment with national and international boards. It will develop world-class education practices that will enable the shift in teaching-learning practices across Delhi. Through this board, an age-old practice of rote learning will be replaced with application-based learning and assessment. The board will ensure that each student’s talent is harnessed, and they apply what they learn,” Kejriwal said.“All schools will not become a part of the new board all at once. 20-25 government schools shall be included in the 2021-2022 session. These schools are being chosen based on the suggestions from students, their teachers, and parents. In the next 4-5 years, we hope to see all government and private schools being affiliated with the Delhi Education Board, voluntarily,” the chief minister said.During a news briefing on Saturday, Kejriwal said: “We need to prepare students who have a passion to sacrifice for their country, who will contribute to the nation’s building and take responsibility for their country beyond all religion, caste, and class differences. We need to prepare good human beings through this education board. Besides, we need to prepare students who are self-reliant.”Under the Delhi board, students will be assessed throughout the year in contrast to the present system of the once-in-a-year assessment. “Today, the entire system of education focuses on rote learning – this has to change and an emphasis has to be placed on understanding and personality development. The students will not be assessed once, at the end of the year. On the contrary, the assessment process would go on throughout the year,” Kejriwal said. The CM said that the Delhi government has been analysing international practices and teaching methods while developing the modules of the new education board. Saturday’s announcement was welcomed by principals of both government and private schools. RP Singh, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Surajmal Vihar, said: “It was much-needed. The state education board will keep local needs of students in mind while outlining the assessment policy.” Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School in Pusa Road, said: “The curriculum...is very transformative. It will bring out a very new learning system among the children of Delhi.” Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE’s controller of examinations, said: “Almost all states have their own education boards and CBSE has schools in all these states. Many state governments have given the responsibility of their schools to the CBSE, including Delhi as of now. So, it is not going to affect the interest of CBSE in Delhi. Rather we would be happy to have an education board in Delhi because they have particular requirements sometimes and they can now take care of these.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-will-have-its-own-school-education-board-101615059072270.html

The immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required under section (3) of the Passports Act, said officials.Inspector general of police (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh said, “155 illegal immigrant Rohingyas staying in J&K were today sent to the holding centre established vide home department notification dated March 5, 2021,” adding, “This was done under section 3(2)e of the Foreigners Act. Due process of law was followed in this exercise. These immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required in terms of section (3) of the Passports Act.”The exercise of identifying more such immigrants is going on and the UT administration is collecting biometric and other details of Rohingyas staying here.“After sending them to the holding centre, their nationality verification will be done as per the prescribed norms. Following that, the process to deport these illegal immigrants will be initiated,” said the IGP.Earlier today, the J&K administration started the verification process of Rohingyas at the MA Stadium here.A burqa-clad Sabina, who is currently staying near the Bawe shrine, said, “The officials sought details like my name, parentage where I lived in Myanmar.”Mohammad Haroon, another Rohingya who lives in Bathindi’s “Burma market”, said, “The police officials had asked us to reach MA Stadium, so we came with our families. They took our details from the UNHCR cards and also conducted Covid tests.” Haroon was among the around 200 Rohingyas who came to the venue, to which media was not allowed access.Shabir Khan said that besides the Covid test, the officials jotted down his credentials and took his thumb impression. “I have been living here for the past over 12 years now and have appeared 50 times for such verifications by now,” he said.Men, women, young and old, including toddlers, were seen coming out of the stadium after the verification exercise.It has been learnt that the administration has vacated the Hiranagar sub-jail in Kathua district, where CRPF personnel had been putting up earlier. “We were asked by the higher authorities to make security arrangements which we have in the sub-jail. What the administration wants to do with it is not known,” said a top prison department officer.The BJP has termed the move as the beginning of deportation of Rohingyas from the region.Party’s spokesperson Brig (retd) Anil Gupta said, “The long wait for their deportation from J&K seems to be getting over.”“They (Rohingyas) will probably be shifted to a camp. It is good news for the people of Jammu. Security forces and intelligence agencies have always been apprehensive about them and they are seen as a ticking time bomb in this border region. I hope their deportation outside J&K starts soon,” Gupta added.It may be stated here that the last PDP-BJP government had been asked by Centre to prepare a database of Rohingyas in J&K so that they could be deported to their native land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/155-rohingyas-sent-to-holding-centre-in-jammu-as-admn-starts-verification-101615059128745.html

07-03-2021||Dehradun||Impractical: Cong, experts on Gairsain as U'khand's new administrative division||Uttarakhand government's decision to declare the state summer capital of Gairsain as the third administrative division in the state after Garhwal and Kumaon has started receiving flak from the opposition and experts who have termed the move "needless and impractical."The declaration was made by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in his budgetary speech on March 4 under which the new division would comprise four districts including Chamoli and Rudraprayag from Garhwal division and Almora and Bageshwar from Kumaon division out of total 13 districts in the state.Senior Congress MLA Govind Singh Kunjwal raised the question on the decision on Friday during the speech in the house on the state budget.Criticising the decision, he said, "The move was not only surprising but shocking as nobody had demanded it. It is a completely needless and useless decision as the new division is of no use to the common man."Also read: Chamoli tragedy - Month later, rescue continues; experts say 'no lessons learnt'He said, "The new division would host a divisional commissioner and a deputy inspector general of police. The common man hardly visits these two senior officers as most of their works are related to the district magistrate office or the office of the superintendent of police. Instead of a division, Gairsain should have been declared a new district."The decision also didn't go down well with the experts.State-based Padma Shri awardee and renowned historian Shekhar Pathak said the decision was "not needed at all.""After declaring Gairsain as a new division, the government will now spend money on setting up of offices for the divisional commissioner and the DIG which is of no use to the residents of the place. Instead, if they should have made announcements for the development of the infrastructure which would have been more beneficial to the public," said Pathak.Apart from the Opposition, members of the ruling party, including some cabinet ministers also expressed their unhappiness on the move, saying, "The CM didn't consult the Cabinet before making the declaration in the House which was shocking to us.""This would have a major political impact, especially in the Kumaon division as Almora district is considered the cultural capital of Kumaon. But now after the district has been included in the new division, people there would be angry that it will no longer be in Kumaon," said the minister adding, "this would have major repercussions in the 2022 elections."He said, "Similarly, the people of Pauri Garhwal district, which hosts the Garhwal division headquarters, would also be angry as the new division has snatched Rudraprayag and Chamoli from it. The people are already not happy that despite being the Garhwal division headquarters, the divisional commissioner sits in his camp office in Dehradun, and now the CM made this decision."The government however refuted the criticism and said the decision would speed up the development of Gairsain as the summer capital."The new division would greatly help in the development of the summer capital which would put it in the state map with much more significance," said minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/impractical-cong-experts-on-gairsain-as-u-khand-s-new-administrative-division-101615057553298.html
07-03-2021||Lucknow||UP woman files rape case after 27 years||Twenty seven years after she was allegedly raped by two men in Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur district, a 40-year-old woman lodged an FIR against the accused after her son enquired about his father’s name, the police said on Saturday.According to the FIR, the incident took place in 1994 when the survivor was 13 years old and lived in the city at a relative’s house. One Naki Hasan, who lived in the complainant’s locality, entered the house when she was alone and raped her, superintendent of police (City) Sanjay Kumar told news agency PTI. The complainant has also accused Hasan’s younger brother, Guddu, of raping her, Kumar added.The survivor’s family members came to know about the assault when she conceived a child, said a relative of the woman. “The family decided not to pursue the case. So, she was sent to live with another relative where she gave birth to a son. The child was later given up for adoption,” the relative added.Years later, the two were united. The survivor decided to pursue the case on the insistence of her son, the relative said. “Her son is very supportive of her and he encouraged the woman to lodge a complaint.”Kumar said the police are investigating the case and will conduct a DNA test of the complainant’s son.Senior advocate IB Singh said there is statute of limitation in rape cases. “In case of rape, there is no statute of limitation. Delay in lodging a complaint can be a reason for disbelief but it cannot be a ground to prevent lodging an FIR or for a police investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-woman-files-rape-case-after-27-years-101615057526250.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Overcrowding in emergency linked with increased mortality: PGIMER study||The overflow of patients in the paediatrics emergency department (ED) of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is linked with increased mortality as well as the high frequency of care discontinuation, a study has noted.A prospective observational study was conducted in the 22-bed emergency between February and December 2019, and has appeared online in the Indian Paediatrics Journal, ahead of its print edition, in February.The data correlated significant overcrowding in the emergency, as indicated by a high number of non-urgent visits, higher bed occupancy rate, and prolonged stay. The overcrowding correlated with increased frequency of care discontinuation and death on any given day.“Doubling or trebling of patients on a single bed is practised if the number of patients exceeds the available bed capacity. The nurse-patient and doctor-patient ratios vary from 1:5 to 1:12 for the red area (critical patients), and 1:8 to 1:30 for the yellow area (non-critical ill patients) as there is no provision for surge staffing which compromises the quality of care,” the study states.The causes of ED overcrowding are divided into input, throughput and output factors.Input factors include causes that increase patient inflow, for instance, lack of access to primary and increased number of referrals from other sectors of health care. Throughput factors pertain to lack of space, understaffing, and inadequately trained healthcare providers. Non-availability of inpatient beds and delayed transfer out from ED constitute the output factors.A sizable burden (53%) of the visits was contributed by children with low acuity illness, which, the study suggests, could have been otherwise managed effectively in outpatient settings.The proposed solutions to curtail input include strengthening of primary and secondary healthcare through capacity building and telemedicine services, establishing an organised referral network, and protecting health workers through proper laws. Trained medical or nursing staff-conducted telephone triage systems were shown to decrease the number of self-referred paediatric emergency attendees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/overcrowding-in-emergency-linked-with-increased-mortality-pgimer-study-101615057508727.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||Death of owner of car found near Ambani house fans row||The death of Mansukh Hiren, the owner of the stolen SUV found with explosives and a threat letter outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has emerged as a new flashpoint in the ongoing war of words between the state’s MVA government and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.On Saturday, the BJP raised questions over the circumstances surrounding Hiren’s death — he was found dead in a creek, and police were quick to term it possible suicide — and said it would ask the Centre to have the National Investigation Agency (NIA) take over the investigation, citing a possible terror angle. The opposition has also demanded President’s Rule in the state on the grounds of poor law and order.“The entire country is shaken [because] the person who is among the top 10 richest people in the world is also unsafe (here),” Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, referring to Ambani, who was already granted so-called Z+ category security, among the highest provided.Former Maharashtra chief minister and BJP MP Narayan Rane said law and order has collapsed in the state and demanded President’s Rule. “The police itself has taken law in their hands... Anybody’s body can be found anywhere. Looking at this, President’s Rule must be imposed in Maharashtra, and I am going to write to Delhi [demanding it].”Also read | Uncovering truth behind Hiren Mansukh's death crucial for MVA: Sanjay RautThe BJP has also targeted police officer Sachin Vaze, who has admitted that he knew Hiren, and who was originally named the investigating officer of the SUV case before it was reassigned.Vaze, a controversial police officer, was suspended in 2004 after being accused of killing Khwaja Yunus in police custody. He joined the Shiv Sena in 2008 in presence of Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray. He was reinstated in July 2020, months after the Thackeray-led government came to power. He was again in focus when he led the police team that arrested TV news anchor Arnab Goswami.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena, which along with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, makes up the MVA, said the home department should quickly investigate the case. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Saturday, Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena said that if the opposition has raised some questions which are important, then they must be investigated. “The person’s death is unfortunate and shocking. People have doubts whether this is a murder or suicide and that doubt needs to be cleared at the earliest.”The state home department on Saturday issued an order, transferring the case to Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).Watch | Mukesh Ambani threat case: Owner of bomb-laden car found dead; BJP's NIA demandMeanwhile, the mystery around the death of Hiren continued, with the police refusing to reveal the findings of the post-mortem exam report. The police claimed that the reports are inconclusive and the cause of death will be revealed only after chemical analysis of the samples they have sent to a forensic laboratory. The police officials also claimed there are no major injuries on Hiren’s body and only a few minor abrasions on his face.The family of the deceased refused to claim his body in the morning unless the police gave them the forensic report. Vinod Hiren, elder brother of the deceased, said: “The police have alleged that my brother died by suicide; however, we know him and he wouldn’t have done this.”Deputy police commissioner Avinash Ambure met the family and explained the report. “We requested them to let our f family doctors examine the post mortem report suggesting further investigation and then we will take the body,” added Vinod Hiren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/death-of-owner-of-car-found-near-ambani-house-fans-row-101615056870877.html
07-03-2021||City||Kin say hospital left UP girl with open surgical wounds, probe ordered||The district magistrate of Prayagraj, Bhanu Chandra Goswami, has initiated an investigation into the death of a three-year-old, allegedly because of medical negligence arising from her family’s inability to pay for her treatment, although there is conflicting and inadequate information about the case.The district’s chief medical officer told ANI that a post-mortem examination has been conducted and the report will be handed over to the DM. The DM said a probe was ordered on the basis of a tweet that the girl died after being discharged after surgery with “an open abdomen”. He added that the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has also asked for a report and that a FIR be filed against the hospital.Shyamkant, the circle officer (Chail) in Kaushambi, said that an FIR had been registered against a doctor of the private hospital on Saturday on the basis of the family’s complaint received on Friday.NCPCR has also asked for adequate compensation to the family of the deceased child.According to the DM, the girl’s family claimed that she was throw out of the hospital, United Medicity, near Jhalwa in Prayagraj without even having her stitches closed properly after the family couldn’t arrange for the money in time.“On the 13th day (after admission), the hospital evicted the girl and all of us from the hospital even without properly stitching her open abdomen region,” said an uncle of the girl.Satpal Gulati, the hospital’s vice chairperson denied the charge, according to ANI. He claimed the girl was treated for free, operated upon, and, that when her condition didn’t improve, the family was asked to take her to the Motilal Nehru Medical College hospital. The family then took her away, he said. It wasn’t immediately clear what the girl was being treated for. It is also not clear when the family took her away from United Medicity. It emerges that the family did go to the Motilal Nehru Medical College hospital.Dr Mukesh Veer Singh, the head of the department of paediatrics at Children Hospital (under SRN Hospital of MLN Medical College), said: “The child was admitted at the hospital on March 3 and remained under our supervision till the evening of March 4 when the girl’s father left the hospital along with the kid without informing us.” The girl is believed to have died late on March 4.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kin-say-hospital-left-up-girl-with-open-surgical-wounds-probe-ordered-101615057242087.html
07-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s daily Covid count crosses 100 after 3 months||For the first time since December 8 last year, the number of daily Covid-19 cases crossed the 100 mark in Chandigarh on Saturday.Also, the active case ratio has seen an exponential rise in the last three weeks to reach 3% of the total cases after falling to 1% in mid-February.With 122 cases reported on Saturday, the number of cases has reached 22,238, of which 675 are active. While 21,208 (95.5%) patients have recovered, 355 (1.5%) have died so far.Amid the surge, the Centre has told the local authorities to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests, expand the vaccination drive and take samples from the community to check for mutations in the virus. This was suggested by the health ministry and Niti Aayog during a review of the Covid-19 situation in a few states and UTs, which included Chandigarh.UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has also expressed concern over the sudden rise in Covid-19 cases.“The sudden spike is alarming and worrisome. After giving such a good fight to Covid, we are getting complacent and forgetting the Covid appropriate behaviour. My appeal is to follow the health advisories, “ he shared on Twitter.‘Will increase RT-PCR tests, vax sites’ Dr Amandeep Kang, director of the UT health department, said: “The number of tests being conducted has increased but the proportion of rapid antigen testing is more. We have been suggested to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests, which stands at around 35%. We will push it up to 50% of the total tests being conducted.” RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests are more reliable than rapid antigen tests, which are cheaper and give quicker results.Dr Kang said the number of vaccination centres are set to increase with major focus on the peripheral areas and colonies. At present, the drive is being carried out at 27 sites, including private hospitals.“In the coming week, we will open new vaccination sites near colonies and peripheral areas where the majority of the population resides. Though a good number of people from affluent sections have come forward to take the jab, we have to motivate those from less privileged classes as well and make arrangements for them,” she said.The administration has also been told to pick samples from the community and send them to advanced laboratories in Delhi to check whether there has been any mutation. “So far, there is no case of mutant virus, but samples will be picked. Reports are awaited for a few samples already sent,” said Dr Kang.Active cases on rise in Mohali, Panchkula tooThe neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula districts have also seen a surge in the past week. Mohali reported 87 cases on Saturday, taking the total to 20,768. As many as 57 cases surfaced in Mohali city alone. While 19,452 (93.7%) patients have recovered and 389 (1.8%) have died, 927 (4.5%) are still undergoing treatment.In Panchkula, 35 new cases took the total to 11,003. The active case count stands at 209 (1.9%). While 10,645 (96.7%) patients have been cured, 149 (1.4%) have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-daily-covid-count-crosses-100-after-3-months-101615057268499.html

A member of the panel, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We have suggested that research scholars who enrolled from March 23 onwards last year should be given hostel accommodation.”The recommendation, however, is subject to the approval of vice-chancellor Raj Kumar.PU is reopening hostels in a phased manner and so far, the varsity has allowed research scholars and MPhil students to return to hostels. Also the final year students of various courses, which come under different regulatory bodies, including master of dental surgery (MDS), MPharm, nuclear medicine and medical physics, have been allowed to stay in hostels. However, the newly enrolled PhD scholars are still awaiting a decision.The panel has also suggested that final year postgraduate students of final semesters, who are required to perform experiments, should be allowed as well. “This will include MTech and MSc students who require labs for completing their dissertations on time,” said a member of the panel.Besides this, the panel has also recommended that all MDS students should be allowed to avail hostel accommodation; only final-year MDS students are allowed for now.PU is yet to take a call over reopening of the varsity for students. Students have already submitted a memorandum stating that online teaching was ineffective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/reopen-hostels-for-more-phd-scholars-panjab-university-panel-101615057088556.html

07-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bird-ringing exercise identifies Akshi Beach as crucial habitat for migratory waterbirds||Of 105 migratory water-birds that were ‘ringed’ or tagged as part of a Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) study at Akshi Beach in September 2019, 31 specimens were resighted at the same location during subsequent months, between October and December 2019. At least two birds that were previously tagged in Mumbai, were also recorded at Akshi during the study period.Experts said this indicates that the Akshi beach, along with Alibag beach in the north and Nagaon beach in the south, is a crucial wintering ground for migratory birds, including at least two species that are globally threatened. The area, BNHS’s report points out, also requires protection from significant anthropogenic stressors, including pollution, tourism and free-ranging dogs, which may pose a threat to its rich avifauna. Hindustan Times had reported, on March 6, that a BHNS and Mangrove Cell study has recorded over 70 species of waterfowl across 99 monitoring sites across the Maharashtra coast. However, bird-banding exercises were carried out only at Akshi, which is about 50kms aerial distance from Mumbai.“We picked Akshi beach for this exercise because it is the only wetland outside of Mumbai that harbours such large congregations of migratory birds. We wanted to gauge the interconnectivity of these wetlands by seeing if birds visiting Akshi were also visiting Mumbai and vice versa,” said Tuhina Katti, a research scientist who worked on the study.Bird ringing, also known as banding, is a well-established wildlife surveillance tool in which individual specimens are tagged with a small plastic or metal ring, make it easier for researchers to individually identify them. The method has long been used by scientists to understand the movement patterns and life cycles of birds.In September 2019, a total of 105 individuals belonging to 15 bird species, including 65 Lesser Sandplover, 10 Kentish Plover, 7 Ruddy Turnstone and 6 Terek Sandpiper were ringed at Akshi. “One individual each of near-threatened Bar-tailed Godwit and Eurasian Oystercatcher were also ringed,” the study notes.Of these 105 birds, 31 birds were resighted multiple times in the area, indicating that they have a high fidelity toward the local ecosystem. The time elapsed between resightings ranged from as little as 13 days to as many as 84 days, indicating strongly that birds were not just staging (or resting) at Akshi, but that they had established themselves there for the winter season. The black-tailed godwit, one of two threatened species that were tagged, was seen in the area after nearly two months.Conversely, the birds were not observed to be moving between Akshi and Mumbai. Only a single Kentish Plover, “ringed in Akshi on September 24, 2019, recorded at Merces Beach in Vasai on October 17, 2019,” the report notes. However, two birds who had been tagged in Mumbai during previous studies were resighted at Akshi between October and December 2019.“This tells us that the birds visiting Akshi are highly partial to that ecosystem. To answer why requires more studies over a longer period,” said Katti, adding that the BNHS has proposed to conduct similar exercises at other wetlands in Maharashtra. “Permission for the same could not be obtained due to the bird flu outbreak last year but we are hoping to start soon,” she added.Virender Tiwari, additional PCCF (mangrove cell), said that the findings of the Akshi beach study are encouraging enough to commission more comprehensive bird-ringing studies in other areas as well. Tiwari reiterated his comment to Hindustan Times on March 5, saying, “The wildlife department has tabled a proposal with the state to monitor not just coastal wetlands, but all wetlands in the state. The budget for this second study is ₹2.77 crore. We are awaiting in-principle approval.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bird-ringing-exercise-identifies-akshi-beach-as-crucial-habitat-for-migratory-waterbirds-101615056788520.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man dies by suicide after killing father, grandfather||A 20-year-old student died by suicide on Saturday morning after allegedly murdering his father and grandfather. The police have registered a case of murder and filed an accidental death report (ADR). On Saturday morning, at around 8.45am, the student was at home with his 55-year-old father, who is a motivational speaker and consultant, and his 85-year-old grandfather. The three lived on a sixth-floor apartment in an eight-storey building in Mulund (West). Their domestic help, was also in the apartment at the time. According to the police, the father had been scolding the son and telling him to focus on his studies when the 20-year-old lost his temper. He allegedly got hold of a kitchen knife and attacked his father, slitting the older man’s neck. “The injured father rushed out of their sixth-floor flat to save himself from further attack. He then ranged the doorbell of their neighbour,” said Prashant Kadam, deputy commissioner of police, zone 7. According to the police, the domestic help, who is in his 20s and had started working in this household on March 2, was a witness to some of the accused actions, as was the neighbour. “The neighbour, a man in his mid-thirties, opened the main door, but before opening the safety door, he noticed blood flowing down the victim’s neck,” said Kadam. The neighbour alerted the security guard and other residents in the building, and also called the police. He did not let the injured in, fearing for the safety of his family. Meanwhile, the accused allegedly followed his father and stabbed him multiple times in the back and ribs. The 55-year-old ultimately collapsed on the staircase while attempting to flee. While this was happening, the domestic help attempted to move the grandfather, who had been lying in a bedroom, but the 85-year-old insisted on remaining where he was. The terrified domestic help then hid in the bathroom, locking the door. When accused returned to their flat, he attacked his grandfather, allegedly slit the 85-year-old’s throat and stabbed him multiple times. Then, the 20-year-old killed himself.The police arrived at the scene after he died by suicide. Preliminary investigation suggests that the accused was receiving treatment for mental illness. The police took the accused, father and the grandfather to a nearby hospital where all three were declared dead on arrival. A team from Kalina forensic science laboratory has collected evidence from the scenes of the crimes. The Joint commissioner of police (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil also visited the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-dies-by-suicide-after-killing-father-grandfather-101615056548677.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra goes past 2.2 million Covid-19 infections||Maharashtra on Saturday crossed a grim Covid-19 milestone of 2.2 million cases with a second consecutive day of over 10,000 infections (10,187), pushing the count to 2,208,586. It crossed 100 cases within 13 days after the 2.1 million mark was breached on February 21. Considering the situation, the Centre, too, dispatched a team to assist the state administration to contain the spread of the epidemic.The state’s death toll reached 52,440 after 47 casualties were reported, of which 30 occurred in the past 48 hours and 10 were in the past week. The other seven deaths were from the period before last week, officials said.The current rise in daily cases has pushed the state back to October’s situation when 10,000 plus cases used to be report every day. The average per day cases of this month also increased to 8,919, which is close to October’s numbers and the highest in the past four months. The average number of daily cases in October was 9,423. In the subsequent months, it was 4,775 cases, 3,892, 2,973 and 4,689 cases, according to figures released by the state health department.The current high number of Covid-19 infections is likely to continue for more than a month as health officials are of the opinion that the situation would take three to four weeks to come under control.Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, “As of now, it appears the rise will continue for another three to four weeks, although it will not be much, but it will be there and we will require at least a month or so to contain the spread.”He said there was a need to make field teams more robust, for which directives have been issued. “Our field teams need to be made more robust because they perform some very important tasks such as surveillance of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), daily monitoring of home isolated patients, contact tracing of every patient and special focus towards super spreaders. It will contain the transmission thus we have directed to divide as per the population of a particular area so that they should not be overburdened,” Dr Awate said.To assist the state, the central government on Friday deputed a high level multi-disciplinary public health team. “It will be deployed to assist the state health department in Covid-19 surveillance, control and containment measures,” the union ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement.It was also the fourth consecutive day Mumbai reported over 1,000 daily infections. On Saturday it recorded 1,188 cases, taking the tally to 332,208. On March 3, 4 and 5, the city reported 1,121, 1,104 and 1,174 cases respectively. With three deaths, the toll reached 11,495.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) recorded 2,208 cases which is the second-highest among the regions as Pune region’s tally was 2,212.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-goes-past-2-2-million-covid-19-infections-101615056075344.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||After Surat success AAP targets Mumbai civic body polls||‘Surat today, Mumbai tomorrow’, read the tagline of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the city as they celebrated their remarkable performance in the Surat Municipal Corporation, where they won 27 seats in their debut election. AAP has now set its sights on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections scheduled next year.The AAP has announced that their next battle will be BMC polls where it will contest all the 227 seats. The BMC is one of the prestigious civic body, boasting an annual budget of approximately ₹39,000 crore - the richest in the nation and its budget outstrips that of several smaller states in India. An impressive performance in Mumbai will give the AAP a chance to relaunch the efforts to build a base in Maharashtra where the party has failed so far.AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon, who has been appointed in charge of the BMC’s campaign, said the party will repeat its Surat performance in Mumbai. “Mumbai and Surat share similar work culture and have almost similar civic issues. Like Surat even the people of Mumbai want an alternative which the AAP will provide,” said Menon.However, both former party leaders and political experts doubt this claim saying Mumbai is a different case altogether.“The AAP does not have any known face nor an organisation to fight these polls effectively. The party has no base in Mumbai,” said Sunder Balakrishnan, who had fought the Lok Sabha 2014 elections from Mumbai south-central constituency on the AAP ticket.Balakrishnan blames the interference from the Delhi leadership for this sorry state of affairs. “We had built a strong Mumbai team in 2015 which was working very efficiently but this was dissolved overnight in October 2015 by the Delhi leadership. Had this team been allowed to continue, we would have been a strong force by now in the city,” he added.Similar is the contention of another former top leader who put the onus on Surat success solely on the support given by the influential Patidar community. “The main factor was the disenchantment of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) with the Congress party as it ignored serious candidates from the community and hence they all backed the AAP,” said the former leader who refused to come on record. “In Gujarat, the BJP has vanquished all opposition parties and Surat had a very good AAP team, However in Mumbai, the ruling Shiv Sena is challenged by the resurgent BJP and even the Congress has its strongholds. There is no one in the AAP’s current team to create that space in Mumbai,” he added.However, Menon defends the AAP saying that the coming months will be challenging and the party is geared to take the bull by its horns. “We will start exposing the ruling Shiv Sena and demonstrate how they have looted this city for decades,” said Menon. “We are also going to target the slums dwellers and show them how the BMC has deprived them of basic facilities like proper roads, water supply as well as clearing the garbage. Many Area Local Management (ALM’s) teams, as well as NGO’s, are joining us and we are opening local offices across Mumbai,” said Menon. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to many of the supporters to come forward and help the AAP in the BMC elections.The AAP, which was founded in 2012, boasted of several leaders in Maharashtra like Medha Patkar, Anjali Damania, Mayank Gandhi, Preeti Sharma Menon, Subhash Ware and Wamanrao Chatap. They also ran a campaign with allegations against top leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal, Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Nitin Gadkari.Riding on this euphoria, AAP contested all the 48 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls but lost very badly as 47 of their candidates lost their deposits. There were rumblings in the party as the Delhi leadership refused permission to the Maharashtra unit to contest the state assembly polls which were held within the few months after the Lok Sabha elections. After this, most of the leaders deserted the party making the party irrelevant for years. However, the situation improved a bit when the party contested the 2021 Maharashtra Gram Panchayat polls and won 145 seats.Political expert Hemant Desai says AAP will be confined to single digit in the BMC polls. “There is a space in Mumbai for AAP but they have not been able to capitalise it. We have hardly seen them agitating for various issues like fuel hike or electricity bills,” said Desai. Similar is the contention of political commentator Surendra Jondhale, who said that problem for the AAP is which constituency to target and their political programs. However, they have not been able to strike a chord with people. “The Shiv Sena has a solid grassroots network and is supported by the Marathi speaking population while the BJP has a disciplined cadre backed by the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and boasts of Gujarati and North Indian vote banks. The Congress may be down but still has a presence in its strongholds. In such a scenario where does AAP stand and whom does it woo?” questioned Jondhale. Ahead of the Mumbai civic polls early next year, the parties are gearing up. The BJP has unveiled ‘Mission Mumbai’ to win the BMC while the Sena has started preparations at its shakha (local branch) level. The Congress now has a new team with trade union leader Ashok (Bhai) Jagtap as its Mumbai chief. Jagtap is an aggressive and known face. Menon says that after the formation of the party in 2012, the party won Delhi within a year. “Delhi had all unknown fresh faces who are now well known and the same will be repeated in Mumbai also. We will showcase our Delhi government model where we have revamped the entire education and medical facilities and affirm our commitment to do so in Mumbai also. Everyone is aware of our success in Delhi,” said Menon. Menon says that since the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) will not contest elections together, the AAP will benefit in a multi-cornered fight. The AAP has started webinars every weekend to raise money to fight the polls.However, an AAP senior Maharashtra leader said that it was too late for the party to start now. “Our opponents are well equipped both in muscle and money power and know the art of electioneering very well. Our volunteers still have to get on the ground and gain the confidence of the citizens. The problem with us is that the Delhi high command did not take Maharashtra seriously till now and attempt to infuse strength in our outfit. There are people waiting to join AAP and work but there is no encouragement from our end,” said the leader who is heading a committee in AAP.Problems for AAP1) AAP does not have a known face in Mumbai to lead the campaign.2) AAP has no organisational network. Till now of the 227 just 35 ward presidents have been appointed.3) AAP faces a resurgent BJP, ruling Shiv Sena and Congress, which is now having a new team.4) AAP is confined to the upper and middle class and still has to penetrate the slums which make a majority of the Mumbai population.5) There is constant interference from Delhi.6) AAP still is playing its mascot Arvind Kejriwal as a trump card by highlighting the achievements of his Delhi government in its main campaign theme.7) AAP has lost a galaxy of leaders like Medha Patkar, Anjali Damania and Mayank Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-surat-success-aap-targets-mumbai-civic-body-polls-101615056008482.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||ED arrests NCP MLC from Pune in a ₹71 crore bank scam||TheThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday arrested Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member of Legislative Council (MLC) Anil Bhosale and three others in Pune’s Shivajirao Bhosale Co-operative Bank scam.After securing a production warrant from the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mumbai, the ED officers on Saturday took custody of Bhosale, Suryaji Pandurang Jadhav, director of the bank; Tanaji Dattu Padwal, chief executive officer and Shailesh Sampatrao Bhosale, a senior executive.All four were lodged in Pune’s Yerwada jail ever since Pune Police arrested them in the cheating and forgery case in February 2020. The case was first registered by Shivaji Nagar police station.Bhosale and others have been accused of siphoning off money from the bank. It is found that there was a cash discrepancy of nearly ₹71 crores. Later, based on Pune Police’s first information report (FIR) the ED registered a PMLA case. Now ED officers arrested Bhosale and others in their PMLA case. Bhosale and three others are remanded in ED’s custody up till March 11.ED, previously in a statement, said that the bank did not comply with the internal audit, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) audit, and inspection audit. Borrowers and guarantor’s financial statement and repayment capacity were not considered before sanctioning the loan.“In most of the cases, the bank has not conducted a post-sanction verification. Periodical inspection of primary and collateral securities was not done. Bank did not obtain the latest valuation report for loans against property,” an ED officer said.It is revealed that the bank has violated the guidelines of RBI as well as the co-operative department while disbursing advances, the officer added.Many advances were unsecured but the banks treated them as secured. Even though some of the accounts were marked as a non-performing asset (NPA) and their account balance was lying outstanding, their properties were released along with a no-objection certificate (NOC).Multiple properties are mortgaged to various loans, even if the margin was not sufficient to cover the said advances, ED states.Bhosale, Suryaji Jadhav, Tanaji Padwal hatched a criminal conspiracy and illegally transferred the money through RTGS / NEFT from the bank.It is observed that more than 90% of bank loans are NPA, ED stated.ED in January also conducted searches on multiple premises in and around Pune in connection with a money laundering case linked to the bank scam. During the search operation, incriminating documents were recovered and seized including digital evidence under PMLA.(With inputs from Charul Shah)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-arrests-ncp-mlc-from-pune-in-a-71-crore-bank-scam-101615055768476.html
07-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC allows man to tender evidence to counter wife’s charge of impotency||The Bombay high court (HC) recently allowed a Borivli resident, whose marriage has been annulled by a civil court at Sangli on the ground of his impotency, to submit medical evidence to prove his “physical competence” at the appellate stage.“It has to be noted that the said finding (about impotency of the 43-year-old) would cast a stigma on him throughout his life,” said justice Nitin Sambre while dismissing his wife’s petition, challenging the October 17, 2018 order of the district judge-4, Sangli, passed on an application filed by her estranged husband.The couple had married in December 2009. The next year, the 38-year-old woman moved the civil court for divorce, claiming her husband - a Borivli resident was impotent and had failed to consummate the marriage. On September 2, 2013, the civil court accepted her claim and annulled the marriage on that ground.The husband then carried the matter in appeal before the district court-4, and during the pendency of the appeal, filed an application for a direction to the husband a civil surgeon from Sangli, to examine him with regards to his erectile response and normal sexual capacity and submit a report to the court.On October 17, 2018, the district judge allowed the husband’s application and issued directions to the civil surgeon, prompting the woman to file the petition contending that in the given circumstances the district judge could not have allowed her husband to adduce additional evidence at the appellate stage.Justice Sambre, however, rejected her contention. HC said the district judge was justified in issuing the order especially since the husband had called a doctor to support his claim of potency, but the doctor failed to produce a medical certificate to that effect. However, the civil court drew adverse inference and recorded the finding that he was impotent.Justice Sambre said allowing the 43-year-old to adduce additional evidence would not cause any prejudice to his wife, as she will get the opportunity to cross-examine the doctor concerned. Besides, HC took into consideration that the man has already undergone a medical examination and the civil hospital has already submitted its report to the district judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-man-to-tender-evidence-to-counter-wife-s-charge-of-impotency-101615055588605.html
07-03-2021||City||Kashmir's iconic Tulip Garden readies to witness 1.5 mn flowers bloom||Over 15 lakh (1.5 million) tulips are expected to bloom at the end of this month in Kashmir’s Tulip Garden, one of the largest in Asia, and will mesmerize thousands of tourists and locals.The bloom usually lasts up to a maximum of four weeks but the efforts in making the garden reach this stage is a long, painstaking and cumbersome process involving the blood and sweat of some 120 gardeners, labourers, among other workers.For a few weeks of visual aesthetics for the visitors in the months of March-April, the gardeners and labourers toil yearlong, braving the vagaries of weather and indulging in constant hard work.“The tulip flowers last for a maximum of one month but the process continues for the whole year and involves a very cumbersome activity. The garden is the result of sweat and blood of our employees and workers,” said Sofi Inam-ur-Rehman, assistant floriculture officer and in-charge of the Tulip Garden.This year, an additional two lakh bulbs have been added to the 30-hectare terracing garden at Siraj Bagh in Srinagar than last year when the bloom of 13 lakh (1.3 million) tulips had quietly withered away without catching an eye of any visitor due to the Covid-19 lockdown.Also read: Need to develop military into ‘future force’ - PM Modi at top commanders’ meetThis year, te bloom is expected to happen in the last week of March as the temperature-sensitive flowers need mercury to stay above 15 degrees at a stretch.“The opening of the garden is weather dependent. The temperatures in March have gone down from above-normal in February. There is also a prediction of rains from March 07. The garden won’t open before March 20,” said in-charge deputy director of the floriculture department, Shayiq Rasool.Usually, the blooming begins by late March. The average life of a tulip flower is 20 days and can stretch to a maximum of 25 with overall bloom getting extended by adding late-blooming varieties of tulips.The flowers start to fall by late April. “During the bloom, the work gets doubled because we have to take care of the flowers as well as deal with the enthusiastic visitors,” said Abdul Rehman, 55, who has been working as a gardener in Tulip Garden for the past five years.He said that they have to observe the plants as the foliage of the tulip bulbs is allowed to dry up for May and up to June 15. He said that the rigorous work starts a the beginning of July when the summer heat is at its peak.“In July, August and September, we have to painstakingly remove the bulbs with proper caution to store them in cold stores with proper grading,” Rehman said. “Mind you, these are not a few hundred or thousand bulbs but over a million and a half,” he said.The temperature in the cold sheds is maintained at around 15 to 18 degrees.Rehman said that there is a depreciation of tulip bulbs year after year and the officials have to import more tulip bulbs every year. “Around 30 per cent bulbs get damaged or diseased during and after the extraction process and have to be replaced by new bulbs,” he said.Sofi said that they import the bulbs every year from Holland.“This year we bought 4.6 lakh tulip bulbs from Holland which is the world's biggest flower bulb market,” Sofi said.A tulip bulb may cost anywhere between ₹12 and 24. “The rates depend on the condition of the international market which works on euro rates,” he said.The picturesque garden, one of the biggest tulip gardens in Asia and located on the foothills of the Zabarwan range and the banks of majestic Dal Lake, has over 63 varieties of red, yellow, pink, white, purple, blue, yellow and multi-color – early blooming, mid blooming and late blooming – tulip bulbs this year.“The colours are to cherish. It is an array of hues. Besides the usual ones, we also have crimson and brick red, maroon and apricot colour. The early and late blooming varieties have been added to extend the total blooming period,” he said.In addition to tulips, the garden also has hyacinths, daffodils and spring-flowering shrubs. “We also have ornamental trees like apricots and almonds which coincide with tulip blooming. This has been done to enhance the beauty of the garden,” he said.The garden has been divided into 36 plots with 16-18 beds in each plot. There are three parks also inside the garden where the visitors can sit and visualize themselves in a sea of colours, dominated by the Zabarwan Mountains. Various small ornamental trees including the tulip tree decorate the sides of the numerous paths of the garden.In October, soil preparation is done by using tractors. The beds are also prepared during the period with proper channels for draining of water as well as for beautification.“By November 15, the sowing of tulip bulbs starts. It takes around a month by which time the winter sets in,” said Mohammad Ayoub Lone, another gardener who has been here for the past 16 years.“By February 20, when the snow has already melted, we start to loosen the soil and remove unwanted grass. The spray is done as the flowers start to grow,” he said.Kashmir’s connection with tulips traces back its origin hundreds of years when the flowers were grown on muddy rooftops of houses. Gradually, they were grown in kitchen gardens and flower beds till in 2005-06 the then state government decided to convert Siraj Bagh into a regal Tulip Garden in keeping with Kashmir's historical ties with tulips.On the foothills of Zabarwan range, the Tulip Garden was opened in 2007 on sloping ground with multiple terraces, overlooking the scenic Botanical Garden.In 2019, the garden attracted 2.58 lakh visitors, including many local Kashmiris and 1.9 lakh in 2018 as the annual Tulip Festival gained popularity.Tourism nosedived in Kashmir in 2019 as the central government revoked the special status under Article 370 of the erstwhile state and split the region into two Union territories on August 5 and put it under restrictions. The lockdown implemented in March 2020 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the situation.Shayiq Rasool, the deputy director, said that the garden has become a landmark for tourism and indirectly benefits thousands of people in the sector.“Our annual budget for the garden is around one crore rupees and in return, it gives us a lot of bookings for the hotels, houseboats and transport sector. We have to look at its trickle-down benefits,” he said.Meanwhile, gardener M Ayoub Lone is eagerly waiting for the mesmerizing bloom.“The beauty is not actually of the garden but of the hard work I and my colleagues have put in to make it bloom. When it does we want to be here, day and night,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmirs-iconic-tulip-garden-readies-to-witness-1-5-mn-flowers-bloom-101615054568839.html
07-03-2021||Delhi||In budget, Delhi likely to allocate funds for Tricolours across city||The Delhi government plans to hoist the Tricolour across the city and is preparing to allocate funds for it in the upcoming budget, senior government officials said on Saturday.The flag will be very much like the one in Connaught Place, which is hoisted atop a 207-feet mast. The flag itself is 60 feet in width and 90 feet in length. “We plan to install such flags across the city. Funds will be allocated for that in the budget,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.The budget session in the Delhi Assembly starts on Monday. HT has learnt that the economic survey and outcome budget 2020-21 is likely to be tabled on Monday, while the 2021-22 state budget — the seventh by the AAP in its three terms in power — will be tabled on Tuesday.The theme of the upcoming budget of the Delhi government will be “patriotism” and there is likely to be allocation of funds for a series of events to he held across the city over a span of 75 weeks – starting next week – to celebrate 75 years of independence in India in August next year, said the government official.In its first budget after coming to power in 2015 with a thumping majority in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government chose “Swaraj” (self-governance) as the theme of the 2015-16 budget. In that budget the government allocated a large amount of funds on welfare schemes such as subsidies on power and water bills. Similarly, the 2018-19 budget was branded as “green budget” because of the large number of allocations focused on the fight against air pollution in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-budget-delhi-likely-to-allocate-funds-for-tricolours-across-city-101615054028282.html
07-03-2021||Delhi||Vaccine drive needs to pick up pace by at least sixfold, say health experts||The national capital has immunised over 86,700 persons in the five days since the Covid-19 vaccination drive was opened up to those above the age of 60 years and those above 45 with comorbidities, but the numbers are too few, say health experts, considering that there are 1.2 million people above the age of 60 years living in the city. They say the drive needs to pick up pace right now if all beneficiaries under this third priority group are to be inoculated anytime soon.With 33,287 doses, Delhi saw the highest number vaccinations being administered on Saturday. Yet, the slow pace of the drive has experts and the government worried. With an average of just 12,612 beneficiaries over the age of 60 years receiving the shot each day, health experts say it would take more than five months to administer the first dose of the vaccine to the estimated 2.1 million people in this category living in the city.The government has no concrete estimate as to how many people above the age of 45, who have one or more of the 20 specific comorbidities, are living in the city.Two doses have to be administered four to six weeks apart for both vaccines – Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield – that are currently in use in the country. Next vaccine in line for approval is Russia’s Sputnik V, being brought to India by Dr Reddy’s Lab, which is also a two-dose vaccine.“We need to speed up the vaccination drive by at least sixfold. For that, there is a need to increase the number of vaccination centres, the timing of centres – which the Central government has already done -- remove the cap on the number of shots each centre can give daily, set up bigger centres at facilities like the 10,000-bed Covid Care Centre that had been set up in Delhi and carry out mass vaccination campaigns, and gradually relax the age criteria for vaccination,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.He headed Delhi government’s first committee set up to control and manage Covid-19.In a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Friday, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal gave directions for speeding up the vaccination drive by scaling up capacity, according to two officials privy to the details.The government is now looking at several measures to increase immunisation among the aged and the comorbid. It plans to increase the number of vaccination centres in private hospitals and government dispensaries, allow flexible timings at private centres, allow walk-ins and the use of ASHA (accredited social health activists) and anganwadi workers’ network to mobilise people to come to the nearest vaccination centre, and to hold camps to register those who are unable to use the Co-WIN portal for registrations on their own.Delhi increased the number of vaccination sites from 308 to 402 this Thursday, including the addition of several government dispensaries. So far, the vaccination centres were housed only in hospitals.“The vaccination drive in dispensaries can only be conducted four days a week, to ensure that other routine immunisation (for polio, measles etc.) is not disturbed. So, we are looking at more dispensaries where we can start Covid-19 vaccine centres. Private hospitals have also been allowed to have flexible timings for their centres; they can open whenever they get more people,” said a senior district official, on condition of anonymity.A second district official, also on condition of anonymity, said, “We added around 100 centres this week and we are slowly increasing the numbers. Although, there aren’t any centres running round-the-clock yet, it is likely to happen in the coming days.”The Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital had started a 24X7 centre last week; however, it is only meant for front-line workers who are on duty during morning hours.“We are also getting in touch with the residents’ welfare associations and sending our teams to register those who cannot do it themselves,” the second district official said.All the vaccination sites also allow walk-in immunisations after 3pm to boost the numbers.HEALTH-CARE AND FRONT-LINE WORKERSThe Delhi government has designated 36 vaccination sites at government dispensaries and polyclinics for the immunisation of health-care and front-line workers who haven’t registered on the Co-WIN portal yet. The beneficiaries will have to furnish proof of employment in the prescribed form, as well as a signed and stamped certificate from the head of the hospital/department or a medical council registration in case of private practitioners.The registration and subsequent immunisation can happen at the hospital where they work, the designated centre for their health-care facility, or the designated centre for their department.So far, just over 66% of the health-care workers and 70% of front-line workers who registered on the Co-WIN portal have received their shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccine-drive-needs-to-pick-up-pace-by-at-least-sixfold-say-health-experts-101615053848298.html
07-03-2021||Delhi||Positivity rate up to 0.60%, almost double since February 27||Delhi reported over 300 cases of Covid-19 for the second day in a row on Saturday even as the city’s positivity rate continued to slowly creep up. The city recorded 321 cases on Saturday — highest since the 340 cases were reported on January 14, data released by the Delhi government said.The city’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – rose to 0.60%, with only 53,062 tests having been conducted on Friday and reported a day later in Saturday’s health bulletin. Saturday’s positivity rate is almost double of 0.36% that was reported last Saturday and highest since January 9, when it stood at 0.65%.Positivity rate, which reflects the spread of the infection, has increased to 0.43% on an average in the last seven days, from 0.32% the week before and 0.25% the week before that. After Delhi saw the third surge of cases in November – when 8,593 cases were reported in a day at its peak – the positivity rate started dipping, slipping below 5% on December 3. The positivity rate then dropped to below 1% by December end.Although a positivity rate of less than 5% means that the spread of the infection is under check, the new increase has expert worried. “The current increase in the number of cases in Delhi – and other states like Maharashtra – is likely because of new variants of the virus that are more transmissible. The last serosurvey in Delhi had shown that over 50% of the population had antibodies. The new variants may be spreading faster among the rest,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Hastening the vaccination drive in such areas is likely to help.“There is a need for the vaccination drive to pick up pace; the number of infections have already started increasing in Maharashtra and Delhi is also reporting some increase. The more people we are able to vaccinate in these areas, the less the transmission will be,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Science. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on controlling and managing Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/positivity-rate-up-to-0-60-almost-double-since-february-27-101615053847713.html
07-03-2021||Noida||Protesting farmers shut Eastern Peripheral Expressway for five hours||Farmers protesting the Centre’s agriculture laws blocked the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) affecting traffic for almost five hours on Saturday.The protesters had announced several days in advance that they would move to block the 135-km EPE on the 100th day of their stir against the central government. Commuters were forced to take alternative routes as police deployed at the EPE entry points diverted them to prevent clogging of the expressway. The result was that other routes, ill-equipped to handle the extra vehicles, suffered traffic snarls.The main points of the blockade were the eight interchanges on the expressway that connects Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal, bypassing Delhi.Protesters blocked both carriageways at Duhai and Dasna, the two interchanges in Ghaziabad, with their cars and tractors from 11am. This led to arguments between them and commuters.“Police told us that you have stopped my vehicle... It is because of you that country is suffering huge losses. A death has taken place in my family and I am not allowed to proceed ahead,” commuter Ritu Sharma told the protesters at Dasna interchange. She said that she was travelling from Noida to Ambala.“I got stuck at Dasna interchange. I was transporting petrol and had to reach Mathura by 6.30pm. But they stopped me midway and gave me pakoras to eat. Half an hour later they allowed me to pass,” said Mohammad Nazim who identified himself as a supervisor of the tanker he was travelling in.Commuters on the Delhi Meerut Road and NH-9 too were affected.Protesters allowed doctors, ambulances, police and two-wheelers with women on pillion to pass.“We offered food and water to the people stuck on the EPE and also used the opportunity to talk to them about the issues we face. We also told them that we were issues like price rise, increase in price rates of fuel that affected them too,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee, said at Dasna interchange. “Many commuters were allowed to pass through. We wanted to tell the government that our agitation is still on and that we had not got silent.”The farmers lifted the blockade at about 3.45pm and normal traffic on the EPE resumed.Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic) said that police stopped commuters at the interchanges. “If we had allowed them in, all would have been stuck at the EPE. It could have disturbed law and order. There were long traffic snarls on parts of NH-9 and Delhi Meerut Road as commuters had to take alternative routes,” he said.According to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), about 50,000 passenger car units ply on the EPE.“Protesters took over all eight interchanges with toll plazas on the EPE. We estimate that the loss for the day could be about ₹40 lakh. Many vehicles were also stuck up at up and down ramps at different interchanges,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI.The EPE was also shut on January 7 when the protesting farmers took out a tractor rally on it and blocked one carriageway.The protesters are demanding the repeal of the three central government farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/protesting-farmers-shut-eastern-peripheral-expressway-for-five-hours-101615052707616.html

Ekbote, who is accused in a case registered by Pune rural police during the Bhima Koregaon violence in 2018, also claimed in the video that Kondhwa area is home to “sleeper cells”. “The high court has said that no religious place can be built without prior permission from the government, but the PMC has found a way out of this by terming the “Haj House” as a cultural centre and is using funds meant for public welfare for constructing the Haj house. The Samasta Hindu Aghadi will use all its might and I swear by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s feet that we will not let it happen,” Ekbote said in a video shot in front of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The video has allegedly been shot on March 2. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Satish Bhaskar Kale (47), a resident of the NIBM Road area of Kondhwa, Pune who is a Sambhaji Brigade member and part of the Maratha Seva Sangh. “The aim of that video was to destroy peace in the Kondhwa area and cause communal violence; if anything of that sort happens, Milind Ekbote will be solely responsible for it,” read a part of the complaint lodged by Kale. A case under Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153(a) (hurting religious sentiments), 153(b), 295(a), 298 (uttering words etc., with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person), 500 (defamation), 501, 502, 505(1)(c), 505(2), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(a) and 66(b) of Information Technology Act was registered at Kondhwa police station against Ekbote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ekbote-booked-for-provocative-speech-mini-pakistan-comment-101615046827292.html

Police have apprehended a 12-year-old neighbour, who is suspected to have sexually assaulted her before bludgeoning her to death. “The 12-year-old boy took the girl on his cycle. He later killed her by hitting her on the head with a stone,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. After a night-long search, police had found the girl’s half-naked body around 8am on Saturday. The stone used to kill her was also recovered from near the crime scene. The postmortem report is awaited.The boy has been booked under Sections 302 (murder) and 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code.A senior official investigating the case said the juvenile had murdered the girl after he got scared that she might tell her parents that he had taken her to the forest area. Police are awaiting the postmortem report to confirm whether the girl had been sexually assaulted before the murder.In 2020, Chandigarh had reported 41 cases of sexual assault on minors. According to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, 65 minors were raped in the city in 2019. Meanwhile, police had apprehended eight juveniles for rape that year.Child had left to play The girl studied in the nursery class. She is survived by her parents and two younger siblings – a three-year-old brother and one-year-old sister. They live in Hallomajra.Her father, who works in a factory, told police that his wife was at home with their youngest daughter when the six-year-old left to play with other children in the neighbourhood on Friday afternoon. She was supposed to go for a tuition from there at 5pm. When his wife came to know that the girl had not reached the tuition, she went out to look for her. The girl’s friends told her that she had not even turned up to play. The woman then called her husband, and the two started searching for the child. Police were informed at 8:30pm, and a case of suspected kidnapping was registered at night. Police searched the area, including parts of the forest, till about 3am, but could not trace the child. The body was spotted in the morning, when the search was resumed and the entire forest area was covered. CCTV footage help nail boy There are around five families that live in the building where her family resides. The child was last spotted around 4pm on a street near the building. While scanning the area’s CCTV footage, police spotted the girl being taken on a cycle by a 12-year-old neighbour. He was soon apprehended.Earlier, area residents along with a student organisation blocked the Chandigarh-Delhi highway near Hallomajra in the afternoon. They were demanding justice for the victim. The protest led to a traffic jam on the busy highway, and police had to divert the traffic coming from Zirakpur. Some of the protesters were also detained after they pelted stones at cops, leaving a few with bruises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sixyearold-missing-girl-found-dead-in-chandigarh-101615009865475.html

The UK's Sunday Times newspaper, citing an anonymous source, reported that the queen wouldn't watch it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-stresses-importance-of-friends-family-during-covid-19-pandemic-101615138835648.html

We just need to hang in there a bit longer," Fauci told CBS. "We want to get those death levels of the virus very, very low, and then we'll have a much, much easier time to safely pull back" on mitigation measures.The United States is now vaccinating on average 2.1 million people a day."We project that high school students will very likely be able to be vaccinated by the fall term, maybe not the very first day, but certainly in the early part of the fall," he said.He said elementary school children would likely be ready to receive vaccinations by the first quarter of next year, after studies on safety are finished, he said.The decline in cases had begun to plateau at 60,000 to 70,000 new infections per day, which Fauci said was not acceptable. He pointed to the need to continue mask mandates and other mitigation measures to avoid a resurgence as new variants emerge.A new variant was spreading in the New York City area and was proving "rather vigorous" in its ability to spread and eluded somewhat the protection offered by monoclonal antibodies and the vaccines, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-upbeat-on-vaccinations-for-us-teens-by-autumn-younger-children-next-year-101615137616905.html

That is a sign of our basic freedoms," Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and a member of parliament for the Swiss People's Party, had said before the vote.He called facial covering "a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland".The Central Council of Muslims in Switzerland called the vote a dark day for the community."Today's decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority," it said.It promised legal challenges to laws implementing the ban and a fundraising drive to help women who are fined.The proposal predated the Covid-19 pandemic, which has required adults to wear masks in many settings to prevent the spread of infection.Two cantons already have local bans on face coverings.France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.Practically no one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates. Muslims make up 5% of the Swiss population of 8.6 million people, most with roots in Turkey, Bosnia and Kosovo.The government had urged people to vote against a ban."After the ban on minarets, a majority of Swiss voters has once again backed an initiative that discriminates against a single religious community and needlessly stirs up fears and division," Amnesty International said."The veiling ban is not a measure for women's liberation, but a dangerous symbolic policy that violates freedom of expression and religion."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-agree-to-outlaw-facial-coverings-in-burqa-ban-vote-101615137397391.html
07-03-2021||World||Report says Japan planning to send armed forces to East China Sea||Amid escalating tensions in the disputed East China Sea, Japan is mulling to send its armed forces to deal with the surge in Chinese activity in the Japanese-controlled Diaoyu Islands, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.The Chinese Coast Guard has expanded its presence in the contested water near the Diaoyu Islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus.The increased activity by China comes after it implements a new law that allows Beijing's quasi-military force to use weapons against foreign ships that Beijing sees as illegally entering its waters.The frequency of Chinese coastguard vessels entering the waters has risen from twice a month last year to twice a week in February, according to the Japan Coast Guard.A Japanese official said Tokyo was alarmed by the Chinese activities and was considering its response."Under our domestic law, the self-defence forces can use weapons as law enforcement against unlawful activities on behalf of our coastguard if the Chinese coastguard enters our territorial waters including surrounding the Senkaku Islands without permission," the SCMP quoted the official as saying.While stressing that Japan did not intend to escalate the situation, the official said Tokyo would try to increase pressure on China on the diplomatic front, such as seeking support from countries like Britain and Canada.The islands in question have long been an object of territorial disputes between China and Japan.Last month, Japan lodged a protest with China after two Chinese ships intruded into Japanese coastal waters near the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, local media reported.China has conflicting territorial claims with four of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam -- as well as Taiwan in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, US warships carried out freedom of navigation operations in an apparent bid to challenge Chinese claims and actions in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-says-japan-planning-to-send-armed-forces-to-east-china-sea-101615136017986.html
07-03-2021||World||France ramps up weekend Covid-19 vaccinations after slow start||Thousands of people across France flocked to vaccination centres on Sunday as the government stepped up inoculations against the coronavirus to ease the load on hospitals and stave off further restrictions.French authorities have come under criticism for the slow vaccination rollout, which has so far targeted the most vulnerable only. About 3.58 million people of France's 67 million population have received a first jab compared to neighbouring Britain, which is nearing 23 million.While some European countries have resorted to sweeping national lockdowns to fight a resurgence in the virus spurred by new variants, France has opted for a less severe nightly curfew and the closure of bars, restaurants and entertainment venues.The country continues to see cases rise, averaging about 23,000 new cases a day compared with just over 6,000 in Britain, while intensive care units are increasingly saturated."It's a race against time," Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told reporters visiting one of four military hospitals opened on Sunday for vaccinations.Some 220,000 people were vaccinated on Saturday, more than twice as many as last week. France expects to deliver 10 million first-round shots by mid-April and 30 million - or two thirds of all adults - by the summer.In Paris on Sunday, where the virus is spreading faster than elsewhere in the country, there was relief among some who have struggled to get their vaccination."It turns out that I had to wait a long time for someone to respond, to give me an appointment," retiree Lucette Ugolini, 87, told Reuters at a vaccine centre after waiting six weeks.Needing to vaccinate 200,000 people a day to reach its targets, it's not clear whether the government will get enough doses to have a quick enough impact to avoid a new lockdown."We can only hope that in four weeks, the government can give us the same allocations for the second injection, but we don't know. We're navigating without a clear roadmap. We do what we can," Ariel Weil, Socialist mayor for four central Paris districts told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-ramps-up-weekend-covid-19-vaccinations-after-slow-start-101615136081550.html
07-03-2021||World||Judge, jury, Covid: Key players in trial of ex-officer charged in George Floyd's death||Jury selection begins Monday for a former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death. Derek Chauvin's trial, which is expected to last weeks, will be overseen by an experienced judge and argued by skilled attorneys on both sides. It will be streamed online for the world to see because the Covid-19 pandemic has limited who can attend.Floyd, who was Black, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Among the key figures and elements at trial:Covid-19, cameras and court securityChauvin's trial, one of the highest-profile criminal cases in Minnesota history, is taking place during a global pandemic that has had a dramatic impact. Precautions to guard against the spread of Covid-19 have limited courtroom space, forcing the judge to try Chauvin ahead of three other fired officers charged with aiding and abetting.And because the pandemic all but wiped out the possibility of public seating, the judge is allowing the trial to be broadcast and livestreamed — a rare occurrence in a state that doesn't routinely allow cameras in court.City, county and state officials are preparing for any sort of reaction that trial testimony or a verdict might elicit. Barbed and razor wire and concrete barriers surround the courthouse, and strict security is in place to protect trial proceedings. City and state leaders want to avoid a repeat of last year's rioting that destroyed dozens of businesses and a police station.The JudgeHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill is respected and has a reputation as a no-nonsense, fair judge. He started in the county public defender’s office in 1984 and worked for 10 years as a prosecutor, serving as top advisor to US Sen. Amy Klobuchar when she was the county’s head prosecutor.Cahill has been a judge since 2007 and has been chief judge. He's known for being decisive and direct. He held firm on his decision to allow video cameras at the trial over the state's objections, and to starting the trial in March despite prosecutors' concerns about the pandemic. He also refused to reinstate a third-degree murder charge, sending prosecutors to the Court of Appeals — which ruled Friday that he must reconsider that decision — and denied defense requests to move the trial out of Hennepin County.ProsecutionDays after Floyd's death, Minnesota's governor announced that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead on prosecuting the case. The county prosecutor's office is still part of the case, but the unusual move was a win for local civil rights advocates who said longtime Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman didn't have the trust of the Black community.Ellison, the state's first African American elected attorney general, previously served in Congress and worked as a defense attorney.His team of prosecutors includes Matthew Frank, an experienced attorney in Ellison’s office who recently won a guilty plea in the case of Lois Riess, a Minnesota woman who got life in prison without parole for killing her husband in 2018. Riess became notorious after she fled the state, killed a woman in Florida, and assumed her identity before she was captured.Also on board are: Jerry Blackwell, who last year won a posthumous pardon for a Black man wrongly convicted of rape before the infamous Duluth lynchings of 1920; and Steven Schleicher, a former federal prosecutor who led prosecution of the man who kidnapped and killed Jacob Wetterling in 1989.DefenseChauvin, 44, started working for the Minneapolis Police Department in 2001, making him by far the most experienced of the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest.He was fired soon after bystander video of Floyd's arrest emerged the following day. He was charged days later, and moved to a state prison for security reasons. He posted $1 million bond in October and was allowed to live out of state due to safety concerns.His attorney, Eric Nelson, is among a handful of attorneys in Minnesota who often represent police officers. One of his bigger cases involved Amy Senser, the wife of former Minnesota Vikings tight end Joe Senser, who was convicted in the 2011 hit-and-run death of a Minneapolis chef. Nelson argued that Senser should be sentenced to probation, but a judge gave her 41 months in prison.Nelson also has tried murder cases. He helped win an acquittal for a Minnesota man who was charged with fatally shooting his unarmed neighbor in 2017. He also won an acquittal for a Wisconsin man who testified that he feared for his safety when he fatally stabbed a man who confronted him in 2015.Nelson has not said whether Chauvin will testify during his trial, but many legal observers predict Chauvin will take the stand.George FloydFloyd, 46, moved to Minneapolis from Houston several years before his death in hopes of finding work but had lost his job as a restaurant bouncer due to Covid-19. On May 25, an employee at a Minneapolis grocery store called the police saying Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill.Floyd left behind a young daughter, who lives with her mother in Houston. His friend, Christopher Harris, told The Associated Press last year that Floyd “was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning.”The JuryChauvin's fate will be decided by 12 Hennepin County residents, whose names will be kept confidential until further court order. Two alternate jurors will be selected to listen to testimony, but will not be part of deliberations unless needed.Prospective jurors were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they had formed any opinions. Prosecutors can block up to nine potential jurors without giving a reason, while the defense will be allowed up to 15 objections, with no reason given.Legal experts say since pretrial publicity has been so pervasive, both sides will seek jurors who are willing to have open minds.“You don’t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they're not in tune at all with the world,” Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said in a recent interview. “But what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-players-in-trial-of-ex-officer-charged-in-george-floyd-s-death-101615134189420.html
07-03-2021||World||India, China friends, but ‘rights and wrongs’ of border friction clear: Wang Yi||China on Sunday again blamed India for the border friction in eastern Ladakh but couched its anti-India rhetoric by saying New Delhi and Beijing are friends and partners, not rivals.Addressing his annual press conference, state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi first said India and China should not undercut or be suspicious of each other but went on to add that the rights and wrongs of what happened at the border last year were clear, tactfully putting the blame on India for the worst military standoff between the two countries in decades.The Chinese diplomat did acknowledge that it was on both countries to jointly maintain peace and tranquility along the border.“The right and wrongs of what happened in the border area last year are clear, so are the stakes involved. It again proves that initiating confrontation will not solve the problem. Returning to peaceful negotiation is the right way forward,” Wang said during his press interaction with foreign and local journalists on the sidelines of the ongoing session of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC).“China’s position is very clear. We are committed to settling the boundary dispute through dialogue and consultation. At the same time, we are resolved to safeguard our sovereign rights and interests,” he said.India has consistently denied China’s allegation of provoking friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and have said that Chinese border troops were the first to trespass across the disputed boundary, triggering the faceoff and deaths of border troops on both sides.“It falls on both sides to solidify existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication, and improve various management mechanisms to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border area,” Wang added.One of China’s top diplomats, Wang was responding to a question on the way ahead for Sino-India ties in the backdrop of the partial disengagement of border troops from near the Pangong lake.The first part of Wang’s response gave the impression that China had softened its one-sided narrative against India.“The China India relationship is essentially about how the world’s two largest developing countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together,” he said, adding that the two countries have “broad common interests and tremendous potential for cooperation”.“On many important issues, our positions are the same or close due to similar national realities. Therefore, China and India are each other’s friends and partners, not threats, or rivals. The two sides need to help each other succeed instead of undercutting each other. We should intensify cooperation instead of harbouring suspicions of each other,” Wang added.Wang reiterated the point he made to external affairs minister, S Jaishankar during a phone conversation last week that the border dispute is not the entirety of Sino-India ties.“The boundary dispute, an issue left from history, is not the whole story of the China-India relationship. It is important that two sides manage disputes properly and at the same time expand and enhance cooperation to create enabling conditions for the settlement of the issue.”New Delhi has made it clear to Beijing – as recently as on Friday -- that the way to improve bilateral ties only lies through peace and tranquility at the border and the road to normalcy lies only through disengagement and de-escalation all along the LAC.During the phone call with Jaishankar, while Wang had suggested the two sides should set aside the border issue, the Indian minister had insisted bilateral ties could be repaired only by completing disengagement at all friction points.For the year ahead, Wang said: “…we hope India will work with China to truly deliver on important common understanding reached by our leaders that both are not threats to each other but opportunities for each other’s development.Together we can bring great benefits for 2.7 billion people in China and India and make great contributions for the advent of the Asian Century.During his lengthy – and choreographed – press conference, Wang answered about 25 questions on topics ranging from China’s ties with the US, Russia and Asean, electoral reforms in Hong Kong and the situation in Myanmar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-friends-but-rights-and-wrongs-of-border-friction-clear-wang-yi-101615133616744.html

That compares with just over 3.4 million distributed so far to member states since the vaccine was approved in January, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The schedule refers to the 160 million doses procured by the EU in November, before a deal last month to buy an additional 150 million shots both this year and next. The EU has been under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccine roll-out that’s lagged several peers, including the US and the UK.Gergely Gulyas, the cabinet minister to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary’s government, published the schedule in defense of a decision to opt out of additional purchases.Nationally procured vaccines from China’s Sinopharm and Russia’s Sputnik V will allow Hungary to inoculate all of its population aged over 18 by the third quarter, Gulyas said in the Facebook post. That gives little reason to buy supplies via the EU that would probably only arrive after that time, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-got-a-third-of-moderna-covid-19-shots-so-far-data-show-101615132508894.html
07-03-2021||World||Mexican camp that was symbol of migrant misery empties out under Biden||A sprawling camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, within sight of the Texan border, has since 2019 been one of the most powerful reminders of the human toll of former President Donald Trump's efforts to keep migrants out of the United States.The camp has dwindled to just a few dozen in residents in recent days, after hundreds of asylum seekers living there were finally allowed to cross the border to press their claim to stay in the United States.   President Joe Biden last month rolled back the program - known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - that had forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.Biden's wife, Jill, visited the camp during last year's presidential campaign to witness the difficult conditions first hand."If it hadn't been for this camp, I don't think they would have ever ended MPP," said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, one of the last remaining residents.Like hundreds of asylum seekers expelled from the United States to this crime-ridden town, Borjas began sleeping near the foot of the international bridge across the Rio Grande out of fear and necessity.But the migrants also intended to make a statement, he said: a visible reminder of the human toll of the MPP program. "We were there so that people would see us; see it wasn't fair what they were doing to us."As of Friday, some 1,127 people in the MPP program across Mexico have been permitted to enter the United States since Biden rescinded the policy last month. More than half of those were from the Matamoros camp, according to the UN refugee agency.Once home to more than 3,000 people, the camp now stands largely deserted, except for the few whose appeals to enter the United States have been denied, Borjas said."I don't know what I'll do now. I can't go back," said Borjas, who said he faces the threat of murder in Honduras for supporting an opposition party."LET'S UNITE"The Trump administration touted the MPP program as part of its successful efforts to reduce immigration and cut down on what it called fraudulent asylum claims.Since 2019, the policy pushed more than 65,000 migrants back into Mexico as their asylum cases wound through US courts. The majority gave up waiting and left Mexico. Thousands more crowded into shelters or apartments, disappearing from sight.But in Matamoros, which had scant resources for migrants, families opted to sleep in the plaza at the foot of the bridge."We said 'Let's unite' and that's how the camp in Matamoros began," said Honduran asylum seeker Josue Cornejo, who was returned to Matamoros along with his wife and their children in August 2019.Parents scavenged cardboard to stop the summer heat radiating off the pavement from burning their children's skin. The men formed a guard watch.Aid workers arrived. So did Matamoros' criminal groups, which doled out beatings and siphoned off donations, migrants say.As the camp population ballooned, the tents sprawled from the plaza to the wooded banks of the Rio Grande, where residents braved contamination and undercurrents to bathe and wash their clothes.The migrants resisted federal government efforts to house them in a makeshift shelter, miles from the border.Life took root in a way migrants say they had never expected, making the lengthy wait in Mexico slightly more bearable.They formed church groups, supply distribution tents and kitchens with handmade earthen ovens and stoves improvised from old washing machines.Nicaraguan asylum seeker Perla Vargas and other migrants launched a tent school that provided music, dance, English and Spanish classes to dozens of children each day, including her two grandchildren.There were quinceaneras, romances, and at least one wedding.Consuelo Tomas, an indigenous Q'anjob'al Guatemalan asylum seeker, gave birth inside the camp and named her newborn Andrea in honor of the child's grandmother, who died years earlier trying to cross the Sonoran desert to reach the United States.Insecurity and hardship reigned.The weather whiplashed between scorching heat and freezing cold. Human rights groups documented kidnappings and rape of asylum seekers in Matamoros. Occasionally, migrants' bodies washed up along the river bank.Some mothers, including Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, sent their children to cross the US border alone illegally out of concern for their safety."It was one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make, but I wanted to protect them," she said.MATAMOROS TO WASHINGTONAt times, the camp served as the launchpad for protests: from a blockade of the international bridge that halted traffic for hours to demonstrations and all-night vigils opposing Trump's re-election.Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, said that MPP program might have succeeded in obscuring the plight of these migrants from the American public if it were not for the Matamoros camp."It was the one place where you couldn't deny that what we were doing was inflicting harm on people," he said.Last month, the Biden administration said it would allow about 25,000 migrants in MPP to enter the United States to pursue their cases. Matamoros camp residents were to be among the first in line, it added.Buoyed by the news, migrants had prepared for their departure in late February: snapping farewell photographs and snipping haircuts for fellow migrants. The sound of bachata music rang out as children hopped about, rehearsing for their final dance recital. Andrade packed up her remaining protest signs and distributed donated pairs of tiny sneakers."It's so the kids can cross into the United States in brand new shoes," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-camp-that-was-symbol-of-migrant-misery-empties-out-under-biden-101615132494873.html
07-03-2021||World||Hong Kong: 4 people fall ill after receiving China's Sinovac Covid vaccine jabs||Four people in Hong Kong fell ill, including two who had to be put in intensive care, after recently receiving their Chinese vaccine Sinovac shots.This means a total of 15 people have sought medical attention after receiving the vaccines over the past week, according to the government. Some 83,400 people had been vaccinated with the mainland-produced jabs as of Saturday, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.The two people, who were sent to intensive care, had underlying diseases and felt severely ill after receiving their Sinovac jabs, the Department of Health said.The Sinovac vaccine, which was produced by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, is 50.4 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19 with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, according to the institute. Experts have raised questions about the effectiveness of the vaccine.An 80-year-old man was in critical condition after receiving his vaccine at a centre in Tin Shui Wai last Monday. After feeling unwell, he sought medical treatment at Caritas Medical Centre in Sham Shui Po, where he was transferred to the intensive care unit on Saturday. Another 72-year-old woman with a history of various illnesses, including diabetes, felt discomfort after receiving her shot at a centre in Tseung Kwan O.She skipped two doses of her insulin medication after feeling weak and found her general health worsened on Sunday morning. She was later admitted to the intensive care unit at Prince of Wales Hospital in Sha Tin and was found to have developed serious diabetic problems.Hong Kong launched its vaccination scheme in late February with the Sinovac shots. About 83,400 city residents received their first doses of the vaccine between February 22 and March 6. The city received its first batch of 585,000 BioNTech vaccine on February 27.Yesterday, Hong Kong health authorities have revealed that a chronically ill woman who had received the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine died after suffering a stroke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-4-people-fall-ill-after-receiving-china-s-sinovac-covid-vaccine-jabs-101615132581892.html
07-03-2021||World||US will do what’s necessary to defend itself after attack in Iraq: Defense secretary Lloyd Austin Lloyd Austin||The United States will do what it sees as necessary to defend its interests after a rocket attack last week against Iraq's Ain al-Sada airbase, which hosts American, coalition and Iraqi forces, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday.Speaking on ABC's "This Week" program, Austin said the United States is urging Iraq to quickly investigate the incident at the base located in western Anbar province and determine who was responsible. U.S. officials have said the incident fit the profile of a strike by Iran-backed militia."We'll strike, if that's what we think we need to do, at a time and place of our own choosing. We demand the right to protect our troops," Austin said.Asked if Iran had been given a message that U.S. retaliation would not constitute an escalation, Austin said that Iran is fully capable of assessing the strike and U.S activities."What they should draw from this, again, is that we're going to defend our troops and our response will be thoughtful. It will be appropriate," Austin said. "We would hope that they would choose to do the right things."There were no reports of injuries among U.S. service personnel after the attack but an American civilian contractor died after suffering a "cardiac episode" while sheltering from the rockets, the Pentagon said.Iraqi officials said 10 rockets landed at the base but the Pentagon was more guarded, saying there were 10 "impacts." It said the rockets appeared to have been fired from multiple sites east of the base, which also was targeted last year by a ballistic missile attack directly from Iran.U.S. forces carried out air strikes against facilities at a border control point in Syria used by Iranian-backed militias including Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-do-what-s-necessary-to-defend-itself-after-attack-in-iraq-lloyd-austin-101615131702041.html
07-03-2021||World||India, Iran, Russia to be part of new US push to find settlement in Afghanistan||The US plans to convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of India, Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran to forge a common approach on ending the war in Afghanistan while simultaneously taking steps to speed up a settlement with the Taliban.This was conveyed by US secretary of state Antony Blinken in a letter sent to President Ashraf Ghani. The letter marks the first time the new Biden administration has outlined its approach towards Afghanistan as it undertakes a review of the troubled peace process with the Taliban as well as plans to withdraw all American forces from the war-torn country by May 1.Soon after Blinken’s letter was accessed by Afghanistan’s Tolo News on Sunday afternoon, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke over the phone with external affairs minister S Jaishankar to discuss the peace process.“Received a call from US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad @US4AfghanPeace. Discussed latest developments pertaining to peace talks. We will remain in touch,” Jaishankar tweeted, without giving details.There was no other official word on the developments from the US and Indian sides.In his letter, Blinken outlined four elements that he said are part of a “high-level diplomatic effort with the parties and with regional countries and the United Nations” to move matters “more fundamentally and quickly toward a settlement and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”.As a first step, the US intends to “ask the United Nations to convene Foreign Ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India, and the United States to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan”, Blinken wrote.“It is my belief that these countries share an abiding common interest in a stable Afghanistan and must work together if we are to succeed,” he added.There was a perception in New Delhi that Khalilzad’s efforts under the Trump administration accorded greater significance to Pakistan and skipped over many of India’s concerns related to Afghanistan. Some quarters in New Delhi and Kabul even believed Khalilzad didn’t give adequate importance to the Afghan government in his efforts to push forward the peace process after the US and the Taliban signed an agreement at Doha in February 2020.Blinken’s efforts to rope in both India and Iran appear to indicate a desire to balance the process by roping in all states that have influence in Afghanistan.As the second element of the new effort, Blinken wrote he had asked Khalilzad to prepare and share with Ghani and Taliban leaders “written proposals aimed at accelerating discussions on a negotiated settlement and ceasefire”. These proposals will reflect ideas included in a roadmap for the peace process that Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib shared with the US ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson.“In sharing these documents, we do not intend to dictate terms to the parties. Rather, the documents will enable [the Afghan government] and the Taliban to move urgently to the tasks of developing a) the foundational principles that will guide Afghanistan's future constitutional and governing arrangements, b) a roadmap to a new, inclusive government; and c) the terms of a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,” he wrote.The third element will be the US asking the Turkish government to host a senior-level meeting of the Afghan government and the Taliban in the coming weeks to “finalise a peace agreement”. Blinken added, “I urge you or your authoritative designees to join other representatives of the Islamic Republic in this meeting.”The fourth element of the efforts will be aimed at reducing violence. Blinken wrote he shared Ghani’s view that “every effort must be made to reduce the high levels of violence in Afghanistan, which are exacting an unacceptable toll on the Afghan people and deeply undermining efforts to achieve peace”.He added that the US has prepared a “revised proposal for a 90-day Reduction-in-Violence, which is intended to prevent a Spring Offensive by the Taliban and to coincide with our diplomatic efforts to support a political settlement. He added that Khalilzad would share this proposal with Ghani.At the same time, Blinken called for greater unity among Afghan politicians to take forward the process. “Unity and inclusivity on the [Afghan] side are, I believe, essential for the difficult work that lies ahead. As you and your countrymen know all too well, disunity on the part of Afghan leaders proved disastrous in the early 1990s and must not be allowed to sabotage the opportunity before us,” he said.Blinken urged Ghani to build consensus on specific goals and objectives for a negotiation with the Taliban “about governance, power-sharing, and essential supporting principles”.He also said that as the Biden administration’s review continues, the US “has not ruled out any option” and is still “considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1st, as we consider other options”.“Even with the continuation of financial assistance from the United States to your forces after an American military withdrawal, I am concerned that the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,” he said.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said this appeared to be a clear attempt by the Biden administration to move way from Donald Trump’s legacy on Afghanistan.“Trump was often accused of not involving regional powers such as India and Iran because of his own foreign policy priorities. If there is to be lasting peace in Afghanistan, regional powers have to be brought in, along with a lessening of the focus on Pakistan. I would say this is a more balanced approach,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-iran-russia-to-be-part-of-new-us-push-to-find-settlement-in-afghanistan-101615131002914.html
07-03-2021||World||George Floyd's friends reflect on his striving, at times stumbling life||Travis Cains looks over to the spot where he and George Floyd watched the world go by when they were young.All that's left of the clubhouse across the street from the Cuney Homes projects where they debated sports and hip hop are two battered concrete steps now leading to nowhere. The clubhouse is long gone.It was on those steps that Cains — who considers himself Floyd's older brother and stuck with him through the highs of sports stardom at school to the lows of addiction and incarceration — became convinced that Floyd was destined to make his mark on the world."The whole neighborhood knew he would make history, but we didn't want it to be this way," Cains said. "But we're breathing for him now. Floyd is a martyr for us. He will forever be a part of a movement."Friends and family of Floyd spoke with Reuters in the days before the trial was set to begin on Monday of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. The Minnesota appeals court on Friday ordered the trial judge to reconsider adding a third-degree murder charge against Chauvin, a late development that could delay the start of proceedings.Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin Floyd, who was Black, to the ground by his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25 on a street in Minneapolis, where Floyd had moved from Houston. Police had arrested Floyd after a grocery store employee reported he had allegedly used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Lawyers for Chauvin say he followed his police training and contend that the fentanyl, an opioid, Floyd had recently ingested, was the main cause of his death.Floyd's aunt, Angela Harrelson, lives just outside Minneapolis. As a registered nurse she said she sought to help her nephew in his fight to maintain sobriety."He was just excited, he thought Minnesota was such a clean and nice place," said Harrelson. "This whole movement has been an awakening for Black Americans, but it also has been an awakening for white Americans as well, giving them knowledge that racism, systemic racism, does exist."Floyd's cousin Dexter Brown was traveling to Minneapolis for Chauvin's trial."We don’t want to see somebody else’s child, somebody else’s father, somebody else’s cousin get done like this," Brown said.Jonathan Veal, friends with Floyd since age 12, owns a management consulting business in Oklahoma City. He applauded developments such as the "George Floyd Justice in Policing Act" passed last week by the US House of Representatives.But Veal said what he finds more important are changes on the streets, where whites marched alongside Blacks to protest racism during a summer of demonstrations, and where African Americans lined up to vote in November's elections.Racism embedded in American institutions created segregated and impoverished neighborhoods such as Houston’s Third Ward where Floyd and Veal grew up. Systemic racism can only be truly changed, Veal said, when the people who make up those systems evolve.Veal and three other classmates of Floyd created the "88 CHUMP" community organization — 88 was Floyd’s high school football jersey number and CHUMP stands for Communities Helping Underprivileged Minorities Progress — with goals that include getting more people registered to vote.Cains, a retired bail bondsman, says he has devoted his life to fighting for human rights through the George Floyd Foundation.Cains said he hopes anybody, regardless of race, can understand Floyd’s humanity."For the police to do him like that, it just leaves any Black man to wonder: 'Man, does the world hate me that much? Is my skin color that bad, that you can just do us like that?'" Cains said.Floyd "was trying to get his life right," Cains said. "You could hear him telling the cops who killed him that 'I'm not a bad guy!'"Between 1997 and 2005 Floyd was in and out of jail, mostly on theft and drug charges. He pled guilty in 2009 to aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon committed in 2007 and was sentenced to five years in prison. He was paroled in early 2013.Patrick Ngwolo, a Houston criminal defense attorney and pastor who met Floyd after he left prison, described Floyd as his "man of peace" in the Third Ward. Ngwolo said he watched a familiar narrative play out after Floyd's killing."By day three after he was murdered, you already saw the debate in the media: 'Was he a good guy? Is he not a good guy?'" Ngwolo said. "That's shifting the narrative from 'these killings are crazy, we have to do something about them.'"Ngwolo believes that Floyd's death is an inflection point for America."We're either going to master this original sin of racism in this country," he said, "or it's going to master us."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-friends-reflect-on-his-striving-at-times-stumbling-life-101615130950886.html
07-03-2021||World||UK schools to reopen, backed by frequent Covid-19 testing||British students, backed by a robust coronavirus testing program, are gearing up to return to school Monday after a two-month closure, in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson says is a plan to get the country “moving closer to a sense of normality.”The reopening of schools is the first step in the U.K. government's plan to gradually ease Covid-19 restrictions as the country's vaccination drive gains critical mass, with all restrictions lifted by June.As part of the plan, millions of high school and college students coming back to U.K. classrooms will be tested for the virus for the first few weeks. Authorities want to quickly detect and isolate asymptomatic cases in order to avoid sending entire schools home.“We are being cautious in our approach so that we do not undo the progress we have made so far,” Johnson said in a statement, urging everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.High schools and colleges will be allowed to reopen in phases to allow for three rounds of testing. Students will then get kits so they can test themselves twice more at home. The U.K. government has distributed nearly 57 million rapid “lateral flow” test kits to schools across the country, but there are concerns about the accuracy of the tests, which may result in pupils being forced to self-isolate unnecessarilyA senior public health official, however, said Sunday that the risk of a false positive was very low. More than 5 million rapid tests have been carried out at schools during lockdown, including 1 million last week, the government said.Evidence from testing over the past eight weeks indicates “the risk of false positives is extremely low, less than 1 in 1,000,” Susan Hopkins, the Covid-19 strategic response director for Public Health England, told the BBC. “And a test that returns less than 1 in 1,000 false positives is a very good test."To help children forced into online learning for months to catch up with their education, officials are considering extending school days, shortening the summer holiday or adding an extra term to the year. British students already have a much shorter summer holiday than American students, usually leaving for summer break after mid-July.“We're looking at a whole range of measures,” U.K. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told Sky News. “We’ve got to look at what is going to have the biggest positive impact on children’s lives.”Britain has Europe's deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with nearly 125,000 lives lost so far. Its coronavirus vaccination program has, however, raced ahead of the United States and the European Union to give at least a first dose to nearly 22 million of the country's adults so far.Britain has approved three vaccines for use: those made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, and plans to vaccinate all adults by July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-schools-to-reopen-backed-by-frequent-covid-19-testing-101615127576629.html

Protesters are stringing up women's clothing on lines across the streets to utilise a superstition in their favour.In Myanmar, walking beneath wraparound clothes for women, known as longyi, is traditionally considered bad luck for men. In the photographs and videos circulating on social media, police can be seen taking down the lines of clothes before crossing them.A 20-year-old unnamed protester told news agency Reuters that the younger generation doesn't believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do. The protester said this weakness of soldiers might give more time to run if they charge towards demonstrators. Sometimes, protesters use women's undergarments as well to slow them down.“Women’s longyi and undergarments barricades that Myanmar protesters put up as a non-violent defense tool against police & soldiers who mostly and superstitiously believe that their “phoun” (loosely translated as men’s glory or virtue) will be gone,” tweeted a user with photographs of clothesline.Women’s longyi and undergarments barricades that Myanmar protesters put up as a non-violent defense tool against police & soldiers who mostly and superstitiously believe that their “phoun” (loosely translated as men’s glory or virtue) will be gone pic.twitter.com/ByqaVTdfOQEveryone knows junta ppl are extremely superstitious.

It marked the fourth-such bomber deployment into the Mideast this year and the second under President Joe Biden.Flight-tracking data showed the two B-52s flew out of Minot Air Base in North Dakota, something Central Command did not mention in its statement on the flights though authorities later published images of the flight crew preparing its departure there.The military did not directly mention Iran in its statement, saying the flight was to “deter aggression and reassure partners and allies of the US military’s commitment to security in the region.”However, such flights had become common in the last months of former President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers sparked a series of escalating incidents in the region.Biden has expressed a desire to return to the deal if Iran honors the deal’s limits on its nuclear program. However, tensions remain high after militias in Iraq — likely backed by Iran — continue to target American interests.Biden last month launched an airstrike just over the border into Syria in retaliation, joining every American president from Ronald Reagan onward who has ordered a bombardment of countries in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-flies-two-b-52-bombers-over-iran-as-washington-tehran-tensions-rise-101615125829648.html

His wife Radhika Shakya was also vaccinated.The Covishield vaccine was developed in a collaboration between Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. It is manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India.Oli's personal physician, Dr Dibya Singh Shah, said the new vaccine guidelines allow the COVID-19 shot to be administered three months after kidney transplantation.“(After) Evaluating the risks and benefits, it was decided that the prime minister should take the vaccine," Shah told The Kathmandu Post. In March last year, Oli had undergone a second kidney transplant surgery.After getting the vaccine, Oli asked all senior citizens in the country to get the vaccine jabs, saying they are safe with no side-effects.Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel, Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi and Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali also received the coronavirus jabs on Sunday.As part of phase II of the vaccination drive, the Nepal government will cover all persons over the age of 65 years in the country, which is around 1.6 million senior citizens.Earlier, the government had planned to vaccinate all persons above 55 years, however a shortage in immunisation doses led to the age group being shortened.In the first phase of the vaccination programme, health workers, security personnel and journalists were inoculated.The coronavirus has claimed 3,010 lives, along with over 270,000 confirmed infections, in Nepal, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-kp-sharma-oli-receives-india-made-covishield-covid-19-vaccine-101615126012208.html
07-03-2021||World||Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi says India, China should create 'enabling conditions' to resolve border issues||China and India should stop "undercutting" each other, shed mutual "suspicion" and create "enabling conditions" by expanding bilateral cooperation to resolve the border issue, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday.Calling the boundary dispute as not the "whole story" of the China-India relationship, Wang said that both countries were friends and partners but they should shed suspicion at each other.Answering a question at his annual press conference on the current state of India-China relations following the tense standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year and how Beijing viewed the relationship going forward, he said it is important that both countries manage their disputes properly and expand bilateral cooperation."The boundary dispute, an issue left from history, is not the whole story of the China-India relationship."It is important that the two sides manage disputes properly and at the same time expand and enhance cooperation to create enabling conditions for the settlement of the issue," Wang said at an online press conference held on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's Parliament.In his lengthy answer, Wang, who is also a State Councillor, did not touch upon the recent disengagement of troops from the most contentious north and south banks of the Pangong Lake area in eastern Ladakh after the 10th round of military-level talks between the two sides.Wang's comments on the border issue came days after he held a 75-minute telephonic conversation with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during which the latter emphasised that the disengagement of troops at all friction points is necessary to bring peace and tranquillity on the border and for the development of bilateral relations.Also on Friday, India's Ambassador to China Vikram Misri met Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui and called for completing the disengagement of troops from all areas in eastern Ladakh, saying that it would help restore peace and tranquillity at the border and provide conditions for progress in bilateral ties.In his remarks, Wang pointed out that the world expects both China and India to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries and advance multipolarity in the world.The similar national conditions of the two countries also mean that they share the same or similar positions on many major issues, he said."Therefore," Wang stressed, "China and India are each other's friends and partners, not threats or rivals."“The two sides need to help each other to succeed instead of undercutting each other. We should intensify cooperation instead of harbouring suspicion at each other,” he said.Without directly referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff, Wang said, “the right and wrongs at what happened at the border area last year are clear, so are the stakes involved.”“We are committed to settling the boundary dispute through dialogue and consultation. At the same time we are resolved to safeguard our sovereign rights," he said, reiterating China's stance on the border standoff.Wang said it falls on both sides to solidify the existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication and improve the various management mechanisms to jointly safeguard the peace and tranquillity in the border areas.On how China looks to move forward its relations with India after the border standoff, Wang said, “in the year ahead we hope India will work with China to truly deliver on the important common understanding reached by our leaders that the two countries are not threats to each other but opportunities for each other's development.”Both sides should consolidate existing consensus, strengthen dialogue and communication, improve the control mechanism and jointly safeguard peace in the border areas, he said, expressing hope that India will meet China halfway in the new year to benefit both peoples.“Together we can bring greater benefits to the 2.7 billion people in China and India, make greater contributions to the advent of the Asian Century,” he said.He said the China-India relationship is essentially about how the world’s two largest countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together.“As two ancient civilisations, next door to each other and as two major emerging economies with each over one billion people, we have broad common interests and tremendous potential for cooperation,” he said.At home, both countries face the “historic mission” of bettering lives, accelerating growth, Wang added.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.Subsequently, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in over four decades. Eight months after the confrontation, China admitted that its four soldiers were killed in the fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-says-india-china-should-create-enabling-conditions-to-resolve-border-issues-101615125130821.html

Its landslide November victory in national elections has been ignored by the junta, Reuters report said.Wang, incidentally, had met both Suu Kyi and Myanmar’s commander-in-chief of defence services Min Aung Hlaing in Nay Pyi Taw during a visit in the second week of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/willing-to-engage-with-all-parties-in-myanmar-says-china-s-foreign-minister-101615124653023.html

She has been under house arrest at her parent’s home in Tehran since.“The situation of her leaving the country is not clear yet,” lawyer Hodjat Kermani told The Associated Press.Last fall, Iranian state TV abruptly announced a new indictment against Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but the trial was indefinitely adjourned. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported that Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be summoned to court on March 13 over these new charges, which include “spreading propaganda against the system.”Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 42, was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups vigorously deny. She was taken into custody at the airport with her toddler daughter after visiting family on holiday in the capital of Tehran. At the time, she was working for Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency.In what the UN has criticized as an “emerging pattern,” Iran has frequently arrested dual citizens in recent years, often using their cases as bargaining chips for money or influence in negotiations with the West, something Tehran denies.The twists and turns of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s detention have played out against a decades-old debt dispute between Britain and Iran. The countries have been negotiating the release of some 400 million pounds ($530 million) held by London, a payment the late Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi made for Chieftain tanks that were never delivered.The shah abandoned the throne in 1979 and the Islamic Revolution installed the clerically overseen system that endures today.Authorities in London and Tehran deny that Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case is linked to the repayment deal. But a prisoner exchange that freed four American citizens in 2016 saw the US pay a similar sum to Iran the same day of their release.Richard Ratcliffe, who for years has campaigned vocally for his wife’s release, has said that Iran was holding Zaghari-Ratcliffe in retaliation for the tank sale dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-british-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-ends-5-year-sentence-in-spy-case-101615122430415.html

Sithu Maung, a member of the dissolved parliament, said in a Facebook post that Khin Maung Latt was his campaign manager and was arrested on Saturday night in the Pabedan district of Yangon.Police in Pabedan declined to comment.Police fired stun grenades and tear gas to break up a sit-in protest by tens of thousands of people in Mandalay, the Myanmar Now media group said. At least 70 people were arrested. Earlier, troops occupied a university in the city after firing rubber bullets at people there, it said. Two people were injured.Police also launched tear gas and stun grenades in the direction of protesters in Yangon and in the town of Lashio in the northern Shan region, videos posted on Facebook showed.A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan, and several residents said in social media posts that live bullets were used.Video posted by Myanmar Now showed soldiers beating up men in Yangon, where at least three protests were held despite overnight raids by security forces on campaign leaders and opposition activists.The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to stamp out daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military overthrew and detained Suu Kyi on Feb. 1."They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens," one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, a town in Myanmar's south. "What will we do if we don't revolt against them? We must revolt."Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.The state-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper quoted a police statement as saying security forces were dealing with the protests in accordance with law. It said the forces were using tear gas and stun grenades to break up rioting and protests that were blocking public roads.'Punched and Kicked'Well over 1,700 people had been detained under the military junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."The killings have drawn anger in the West and been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta.China, Myanmar's giant neighbour to the northeast, said on Sunday it is prepared to engage with "all parties" to ease the crisis and is not taking sides."China is...willing to contact and communicate with all parties on the basis of respecting Myanmar's sovereignty and the will of the people, so as to play a constructive role in easing tensions," State Councillor Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, told a news conference.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and respect for November's election - which her party won in a landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he had also been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Muslim Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-erupt-across-myanmar-suu-kyi-party-official-dies-in-custody-101615122473878.html

He is preparing a video address to mark Monday's International Women's Day and is expected to stress the need for solidarity with those suffering in the pandemic.Draghi, who took office on Feb. 13, has not spoken publicly since Feb. 17 when he addressed parliament.Italy has established a four-tier colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) with curbs calibrated according to the infection levels and revised every week.Italian newspapers reported on Sunday that the government is now considering automatically turning regions into red zones if the threshold of 250 weekly virus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is breached.Possible measures from mid-March include making the entire country a red zone for three or four weeks, La Repubblica said."The second wave never stopped, we’re seeing a very strong pickup due to the variants, which is leading us to take measures that are ever-more restrictive," Health Minister Roberto Speranza told Il Corriere della Sera in an interview on Sunday.Asked whether the government would introduce a national lockdown at least at weekends, and a stricter curfew, he said: "It’s clear that we will monitor the epidemiological situation, adapting the measures in the light of the variants."Italy reported 307 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday and 23,641 new infections. The country has registered 99,578 deaths linked to Covid-19, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-mario-draghi-prepares-a-video-message-as-new-covid-19-cases-spike-101615122561580.html

The US consulate in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah issued an advisory, citing reports of suspected attacks and explosions on Sunday near Jeddah and the southern town of Khamis Mushait.In the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa, a Reuters witness and two residents reported several air strikes. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV station said coalition warplanes conducted seven air raids.There was no immediate confirmation from the coalition, which has in the past conducted air strikes on Houthi military sites in Sanaa in response to cross-border attacks.On Saturday, the coalition said it intercepted seven drones over 24 hours launched towards Khamis Mushait and one towards the southern Saudi city of Jazan.The Houthis, who have been battling the coalition since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015, recently stepped up cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.Fighting has also intensified on the ground in Yemen in Marib and Taiz regions.The United States and the United Nations have stepped up diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, which is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Last week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Houthi military leaders in the first punitive action against the group taken by President Joe Biden's administration.The Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.The war, in a military stalemate for years, has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Friday that Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz treated 28 people wounded in intense clashes since Wednesday and that the hospital itself was hit by gun fire, injuring three, including a 12-year-old boy.In Marib, the government's last northern stronghold, hundreds of fighters from both sides have been killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudiled-coalition-jets-pound-yemen-capital-after-foiling-drone-attacks-report-101615121955569.html

07-03-2021||World||Covid-19 : Row over NHS pay overshadows Boris Johnson’s push to open schools||A row over a 1% pay rise for National Health Service staff in England has overshadowed Boris Johnson’s push to re-open schools on Monday, with the nurses fundraising for possible strike action against the government.The low-level pay rise sparked fury among health unions after a year in which NHS hospitals have been deluged with huge numbers of critically ill Covid-19 patients. The Royal College of Nurses has started fund-raising for possible strike action after calling for a pay rise of 12.5%. Meanwhile, according to NHS Providers, an organization for the membership for NHS services, the government had already planned for a pay rise of 2.1% in its long-term plan.The opposition Labour Party’s health spokesman, Jon Ashworth, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr program on Sunday the rise -- which is equivalent to 3.5 pounds ($4.80) a week is -- “disgusting” and nurses should get “at least” the planned for 2.1% increase this year.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson appeared on the Sunday morning politics shows to publicize what he called the “real excitement” about English schools returning on Monday for the first time since last year, but instead was forced to repeatedly defend the NHS pay plan. He did acknowledge that the government was considering eventually lengthening the school day and shortening summer holidays to help children recover classroom time lost in the pandemic.“Over the last few years we have seen record increases in terms of the pay going to our nurses and our doctors, quite rightly and we are effectively facing a much more difficult economic time and economic period,” Williamson told Sky News. “I am certain the Royal College of Nursing wouldn’t want to see industrial action but the government is completely committed to our investment in the NHS.”While Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak exempted health-care workers from a public sector pay freeze announced in November, his budget proposal would raise NHS salaries by little more than the current 0.7% inflation rate, and by less than government forecasts for price rises this year. The 1% recommendation was made by the Department of Health and Social Care to the independent panel that reviews salaries.In its submission, published Thursday, the department said anything higher “would require reprioritization” of funding. That review could overrule the government’s proposal and recommend a higher pay increase.Despite Labour’s efforts to highlight nurses’ pay, they may not be cutting through to voters. Johnson’s Conservatives have enjoyed a significant bounce in the polls since Wednesday’s budget despite announcing the biggest tax rises in decades. A survey by YouGov Plc found that the Tories had established a 13-point lead over Labour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-row-over-nhs-pay-overshadows-boris-johnson-s-push-to-open-schools-101615119702275.html

A pulmonary embolism is an acute lung disease caused by a dislodged blood clot."Currently there is no evidence of a causal relationship with the vaccination," BASG said.Austrian newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten as well as broadcaster ORF and the APA news agency reported that the women were both nurses who worked at the Zwettl clinic.BASG said blood clotting was not among the known side effects of the vaccine. It was pursuing its investigation vigorously to completely rule out any possible link."As a precautionary measure, the remaining stocks of the affected vaccine batch are no longer being issued or vaccinated," it added.An AstraZeneca spokesman said: "There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine," adding that all batches are subject to strict and rigorous quality controls.Trials and real-world experience so far suggests the vaccine is safe and effective and it had been approved for use in well over 50 countries, he said.AstraZeneca also said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support the investigation.European Union regulators at the end of January approved the product, saying it was effective and safe to use, while the World Health Organization (WHO) in mid-February listed the product for emergency use.Adverse reactions seen in trials were short-lived for the most part and blood clotting issues were not reported.A safety assessment by Germany’s vaccine regulator of more than 360,000 people who received the Astra vaccine in the country between the launch in early February and February 26 concluded that adverse reactions were in line with the safety profile described in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-suspends-astrazeneca-vaccine-as-precaution-after-woman-s-death-101615120505260.html
07-03-2021||World||Biden to mark 'Bloody Sunday' by signing voting-rights order||President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order directing federal agencies to take a series of steps to promote voting access, a move that comes as congressional Democrats press for a sweeping voting and elections bill to counter efforts to restrict voting access.Biden will announce the order during a recorded address on the 56th commemoration of “Bloody Sunday,” the 1965 incident in which some 600 civil rights activists were viciously beaten by state troopers as they tried to march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.“Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted,” Biden says in a script of his recorded remarks to Sunday’s Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast.Biden’s order includes several modest provisions. It directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, calls on the heads of federal agencies to come up with plans to give federal employees time off to vote or volunteer as nonpartisan poll workers, and proscribes an overhaul of the government’s Vote.gov website, according to an administration official who briefed reporters.Democrats are attempting to solidify support for House Resolution 1, which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process. It was approved Wednesday on a near party-line vote, 220-210.The voting-rights bill includes provisions to restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.Democrats say the bill will help stifle voter suppression attempts, while Republicans have cast the bill as unwanted federal interference in states’ authority to conduct their own elections.The bill's fate is far from certain in the closely divided Senate. Conservative groups have mounted a $5 million pressure campaign to try persuade moderate Senate Democrats to oppose rule changes needed to pass the measure.With his executive order, Biden is looking to turn the spotlight on the issue and is using the somber commemoration of Bloody Sunday to make the case that much is at stake.Bloody Sunday proved to be a conscious-shocking turning point in the civil rights movement that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Similarly, Biden is hoping the Jan. 6 sacking of the US Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob will prove to be a clarion call for Congress to take action to improve voter protections.“In 2020 — with our very democracy on the line — even in the midst of a pandemic – more Americans voted than ever before,” Biden says in the script. “Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting — we saw an unprecedented insurrection on our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January 6th. A never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine and undo the will of the people.”Biden's remarks also pay tribute to the late civil-rights giants Rev. C.T. Vivian, Rev. Joseph Lowery and Rep. John Lewis. All played critical roles in the 1965 organizing efforts in Selma and all died in within the last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-mark-bloody-sunday-by-signing-voting-rights-order-101615118256365.html
07-03-2021||World||Bloody Sunday memorial to honour late US civil rights giants||The commemoration of a pivotal moment in the fight for voting rights for African Americans will honor four giants of the civil rights movement who lost their lives in 2020, including the late US Rep. John Lewis.The Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee will mark the 56th anniversary of Bloody Sunday — the day on March 7, 1965, that civil rights marchers were brutally beaten by law enforcement officers on Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge. Lewis, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the Rev. C.T. Vivian, and attorney Bruce Boynton are the late civil rights leaders who will be honored on Sunday.Bloody Sunday became a turning point in the fight for voting rights. Footage of the beatings helped galvanize support for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.This year’s commemoration comes as some states seek to roll back expanded early and mail-in voting access and efforts have been unsuccessful to restore a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination to get federal approval for any changes to voting procedures.“Those of us who are still living, particularly the young, need to take up the challenge and go forward because there is still so much to be done,” said former state Sen. Hank Sanders, one of the founders of the annual celebration.The event typically brings thousands of people to Selma. However, most of the events are being held virtually this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The annual Martin & Coretta King Unity Breakfast will be held as a drive-in event. The Rev. Bernard LaFayette, Martin Luther King III and the founders of the group Black Voters Matter will speak at the breakfast.President Joe Biden will appear via a pre-recorded message in which he will announce an executive order aimed at promoting voting access.US Sen Raphael Warnock of Georgia and US Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina will also deliver remarks by video.Lowery, a charismatic and fiery preacher, is often considered the dean of the civil rights veterans and led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Vivian began organizing sit-ins against segregation in the 1940s and later joined forces with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1965, Vivian led dozens of marchers to a courthouse in Selma, confronting the local sheriff on the courthouse steps and telling him the marchers should be allowed to register to vote. The sheriff responded by punching Vivian in the head.Boynton was arrested for entering the white part of a racially segregated bus station in Virginia, launching a chain reaction that ultimately helped to bring about the abolition of Jim Crow laws in the South. Boynton contested his conviction, and his appeal resulted in a US Supreme Court decision that prohibited bus station segregation.His case inspired the Freedom Riders of 1961 — a group of young activists who went on bus rides throughout the South to test whether court-ruled desegregation was actually being enforced. They faced violence from white mobs and arrest by local authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bloody-sunday-memorial-to-honour-late-us-civil-rights-giants-101615118249356.html

Nonetheless, they seemed simply overjoyed that they had not been forgotten.It was a sign of the desperation for support among an ancient community uncertain whether it can hold on. Traditionally Christian towns dotting the Nineveh Plains of the north were emptied as Christians — as well as many Muslims — fled the Islamic State group’s onslaught in 2014. Only a few have returned to their homes since the defeat of IS in Iraq declared four years ago, and the rest remain scattered elsewhere in Iraq or abroad.Bells rang out in the town of Qaraqosh as the pope arrived. Speaking to a packed Church of the Immaculate Conception, Francis said “forgiveness” is a key word for Christians.“The road to a full recovery may still be long, but I ask you, please, not to grow discouraged. What is needed is the ability to forgive, but also the courage not to give up.” The Qaraqosh church has been extensively renovated after being vandalized by IS militants during their takeover of the town, making it a symbol of recovery efforts.For the Vatican, the continued presence of Christians in Iraq is vital to keeping alive faith communities that have existed here since the time of Christ. The population has dwindled from around 1.5 million before the 2003 U-led invasion that plunged the country into chaos to just a few hundred thousand today.Francis came to Iraq to encourage them to stay and help rebuild the country and restore what he called its “intricately designed carpet” of faith and ethnic groups.In striking images earlier Sunday, Francis, dressed in white, took to a red carpet stage in a square in the north’s main city, Mosul, surrounded by the grey hollowed-out shells of four churches, nearly destroyed in the war to oust the Islamic State group from the city.It was a scene that would have been unimaginable years earlier. Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, was at the heart of the IS so-called “caliphate” and witnessed the worst of the group’s rule inflicted on Muslims, Christians and others, including beheadings and mass killings.“How cruel it is that this country, the cradle of civilization, should have been afflicted by so barbarous a blow,” Francis said, “with ancient places of worship destroyed and many thousands of people – Muslims, Christians, Yazidis — who were cruelly annihilated by terrorism — and others forcibly displaced or killed.”He deviated from his prepared speech to address the plight of Iraq’s Yazidi minority, which was subjected to mass killings, abductions and sexual slavery at the hands of IS.“Today, however, we reaffirm our conviction that fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than hatred, that peace more powerful than war.”The square where he spoke is home to four different churches — Syriac Catholic, Armenian-Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldean — each left in ruins.IS inflicted atrocities against all communities, including Muslims, during its three-year rule across much of northern and western Iraq. But the Christian minority was hit especially hard. The militants forced them to choose among conversion, death or the payment of a special tax for non-Muslims. Thousands fled, leaving behind homes and churches that were destroyed or commandeered by the extremists.Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, became IS’s bureaucratic and financial backbone. It was from Mosul’s al-Nuri mosque that then-IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only public appearance when he gave a Friday sermon calling on all Muslims to follow him as “caliph.”It took a ferocious nine-month battle to finally free the city in July 2017, during which between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed, according to an AP investigation at the time. Al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid in Syria in 2019. The war left a swath of destruction across Mosul and the north, and many Iraqis have been left on their own to rebuild amid a years-long financial crisis.The Rev. Raed Kallo, was among the few Christians who returned to Mosul after IS was defeated. “My Muslim brothers received me after the liberation of the city with great hospitality and love,” he said on stage before the pontiff.Before IS, he had a parish of 500 Christian family. Most emigrated abroad, and now only 70 families remain, he said. “But today I live among 2 million Muslims who call me their Father Raed,” he said.Gutayba Aagha, the Muslim head of the Independent Social and Cultural Council for the Families of Mosul, encouraged other Christians to return.“In the name of the council I invite all our Christian brothers to return to this, their city, their properties and their businesses.”Throughout his four-day visit, Francis has delivered a message of interreligious tolerance and fraternity to Muslim leaders, including in an historic meeting Saturday with Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.At Qaraqosh, Francis urged its residents to continue to dream, and forgive.“Forgiveness is necessary to remain in love, to remain Christian,” he said.He spoke after a Qaraqosh resident, Doha Sabah Abdallah, told him how her son and two other young people had been killed in a mortar strike Aug. 6, 2014 as IS was nearing the city. Their death was the alarm for the rest of the residents to flee.“The martyrdom of these three angels was a clear warning: if it weren’t for them, the people of Baghdede would have remained, and would have inevitably fallen into the hands of ISIS,” referring to the name of Qaraqosh used by residents. “The deaths of three saved the entire city.”She said now it was for the survivors to “try to forgive the aggressor.”Before leaving Qaraqosh, the pontiff signed a book of honor, writing, “From this Church, destroyed and rebuilt, a symbol of the hope of Qaraqosh and of all Iraq, I ask of God, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary, the gift of peace.”Francis wraps up the day with a Mass in the stadium in Irbil, in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, that is expected to draw as many as 10,000 people. He arrived in Irbil early Sunday, where he was greeted by children in traditional dress and one outfitted as a pope.Public health experts had expressed concerns ahead of the trip that large gatherings could serve as superspreader events for the coronavirus in a country suffering from a worsening outbreak where few have been vaccinated.The Vatican has said it is taking precautions, including holding the Mass outdoors in a stadium that will only be partially filled. But throughout the visit, crowds have gathered in close proximity, with many people not wearing masks. The pope and members of his delegation have been vaccinated but most Iraqis have not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-is-ruled-pope-calls-on-christians-to-forgive-rebuild-101615117295095.html
07-03-2021||World||Oil price to dictate market trend this week, say analysts||Stock markets will focus on long term bond yield trends, crude oil prices and macroeconomic data this week as investors look for cues amid volatility, according to analysts.Besides, investments by FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) as well as domestic investors, movement of rupee against the US dollar and developments on the coronavirus front are likely to be closely watched for cues."The US 10 Year G-Sec yields have surpassed 1.5 per cent on a closing basis which is somewhat negative for global equities. The Dollar Index has also moved up from 90 to 92 level, which is seen as a negative for emerging market currencies and also equities."In the absence of any major domestic trigger Indian markets could take a cue from global developments and the US markets," said Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.The tone of the market seems to be on the downside, for now, Oza added.On March 5, benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled over 440 points and the NSE Nifty cracked below the psychological 15,000-level amid relentless sell-off in global equities as US bond market turmoil continued to rattle investors.The 30-share Sensex plummeted by 440.76 points or 0.87 per cent to close at 50,405.32, continuing its falling trend for the second day on Friday due to concerns over bond yields. The NSE barometer Nifty ended lower by 142.65 points or 0.95 per cent at 14,938.10.Also read: Tax cut should be joint call of Centre, states: Sitharaman on high fuel prices"In the coming week, the market will be mainly focusing on the expectations on whether the Fed, in its upcoming meeting, will maintain its accommodative stance in a rising bond yield market. Additionally, Fed's measures to maintain low-interest rate and high liquidity will also provide relief to the market sentiments," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.On a weekly basis, the Sensex gained 1,305.33 points or 2.65 per cent.Analysts, however, believe the broader market is expected to consolidate or correct further amid a bearish market sentiment."On a weekly basis, despite the market closing in the positive territory the market mood was sluggish. A substantial jump in the long term treasury yields and upward activity in the dollar index towards 92, resulted in weakness across the globe," said Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities.Further, Chouhan noted that "in the coming week, we could see Nifty/ Sensex touching minimum 14,750/ 50,000 or 14,550/ 49,300 levels. On the higher side, 15,150/ 51,200 and 15,280/ 51,600 would be major hurdles. The focus should be on FMCG and auto companies".Moreover, investors will also track domestic macroeconomic triggers -- CPI, WPI and IIP -- for further cues.Investors will also track movements in Brent crude prices as rising oil prices is another risk for Indian markets. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, is currently hovering around USD 69 per barrel.Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market as they offloaded shares worth ₹2,014.16 crore on Friday, according to exchange data.According to Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, "investors in Indian equities will look at the trend of bond yields abroad to assume higher risk and in the meanwhile, the markets could consolidate/ correct".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-price-to-dictate-market-trend-this-week-say-analysts-101615110068255.html

Francis has also delivered a message of interreligious tolerance and fraternity to Muslim leaders, including in an historic meeting Saturday with Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.Francis headed to the northern city of Mosul, which was heavily damaged in the war against IS, to pray for Iraq's war victims. In a scene unimaginable just four years ago, he mounted a stage in a city square surrounded by the remnants of four damaged churches belonging to some of Iraq’s myriad Christian rites and denominations. A jubilant crowd welcomed him.Also read: Pope Francis urges Arab Muslims to embrace Iraq's Christian minorityIS overran Mosul in June 2014 and declared a caliphate stretching from territory in northern Syria deep into Iraq’s north and west. It was from Mosul’s al-Nuri mosque that the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his only public appearance when he gave a Friday sermon calling on all Muslims to follow him as “caliph.”Mosul held deep symbolic importance for IS and became the bureaucratic and financial backbone of the group. It was finally liberated in July 2017 after a ferocious nine-month battle. Between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed, according to an AP investigation at the time. Al-Baghdadi was killed in a US raid in Syria in 2019.Francis will later travel by helicopter across the Nineveh plains to the small Christian community of Qaraqosh, where only a fraction of families have returned after fleeing the IS onslaught in 2014. He will hear testimonies from residents and pray in the Church of the Immaculate Conception, which was torched by IS and restored in recent years.He wraps up the day with a Mass in the stadium in Irbil, in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, that is expected to draw as many as 10,000 people. He arrived in Irbil early Sunday, where he was greeted by children in traditional dress and one outfitted as a pope.Iraq declared victory over IS in 2017, and while the extremist group no longer controls any territory it still carries out sporadic attacks, especially in the north. The country has also seen a series of recent rocket attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. targets, violence linked to tensions between Washington and Tehran.The IS group's brutal three-year rule of much of northern and western Iraq, and the gruelling campaign against it, left a vast swathe of destruction. Reconstruction efforts have stalled amid a years-long financial crisis, and entire neighbourhoods remain in ruins. Many Iraqis have had to rebuild their homes at their own expense.Iraq's Christian minority was hit especially hard. The militants forced them to choose among conversion, death or the payment of a special tax for non-Muslims. Thousands fled, leaving behind homes and churches that were destroyed or commandeered by the extremists.Iraq's Christian population, which traces its history back to the earliest days of the faith, had already rapidly dwindled, from around 1.5 million before the 2003 US led invasion that plunged the country into chaos to just a few hundred thousand today.Francis hopes to deliver a message of hope, one underscored by the historic nature of the visit and the fact that it is his first international trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.Public health experts had expressed concerns ahead of the trip that large gatherings could serve as super-spreader events for the coronavirus in a country suffering from a worsening outbreak where few have been vaccinated.The Vatican has said it is taking precautions, including holding the Mass outdoors in a stadium that will only be partially filled.

A video was widely shared on social media in which dozens of villagers were seen using shovels, other tools, and even bare hands to dig ores on a mountain to extract gold. Another clip showed locals washing the dirt off the yellow metal and collecting it in another container.“A video from the Republic of the Congo documents the biggest surprise for some villagers in this country, as an entire mountain filled with gold was discovered!

Loebel announced on Sunday that he was bowing out of politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-bloc-slumps-in-polls-on-german-covid-19-woes-101615114533396.html

He said Iran is the only country that kept its side of the bargain.Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Iranian nuclear accord, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. When the U.S. then reimposed some sanctions and added others, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits on its nuclear development.The Republic of Ireland has the role of facilitator in the implementation of the nuclear deal.Coveney said the withdrawal of former President Donald Trump was a mistake and noted that the new U.S. administration is determined to return to the deal.In December, Iran’s parliament approved a bill that calls for the suspension of part of U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-ready-to-take-steps-when-us-lifts-sanctions-says-prez-rouhani-101615114271291.html

The move comes after months of government-imposed shutdowns.The Israeli government approved the easing of limitations Saturday night, including the reopening of the main international airport to a limited number of incoming passengers each day.Most large public activities, including dining at restaurants, are available to people vaccinated against the coronavirus. Israel has sped ahead with its immunization campaign. Over 52% of its population has received one dose and almost 40% have had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, one of the highest rates in the world.Israel has confirmed at least 799,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, including 5,856 deaths, according to the Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-in-final-phase-of-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-101615113069708.html
07-03-2021||World||US must work with allies to counter Beijing's military threat: Analysts||The United States must work with allies to ensure it's capable of meeting the challenges and threats posed by China's military and defence programs in wake of Beijing's increased defence spending, according to analysts.Larry Wortzel, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council said, as quoted by South China Morning Post (SCMP), "The US cannot afford to take its focus off maintaining parity or a lead on China... The US must work with allies to ensure they are capable of meeting the challenges and potential threats posed by China's military and defence programmes."Other analysts have said China's growing capabilities should serve as a catalyst for the United States putting its affairs in order."Instead of fixating on Beijing, or worse, emulating China's top-down, inefficient, state-driven approach to R&D, the US government can use this announcement [of China's military spending plans] as a further nudge to get our own innovation house in order," said Anja Manuel, a former diplomat and partner at Rice, Hadley, Gates & Manuel, a strategic consulting firm."We could also give smart tax credits to the most important technologies," she said and added, "Currently I think you can get roughly the same R&D tax credit for developing a new craft beer and a new microchip."Another expert said that China's increase in military spending should not just be a concern for countries in the US but countries in the Indo-Pacific region as well."China's increased military spending, and related science and technology spending increases, should be taken seriously by policymakers in Washington, as well as by policymakers in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other countries in the Indo-Pacific," said Rockford Weitz, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and director of the school's maritime studies programme, according to SCMP."The US and its allies in the Indo-Pacific will need to keep pace with those investments," Weitz said.SCMP further reported that a top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee called on the US to step up its own spending in response. Even as the Pentagon has seen a reduction of US$400 billion in "buying power" since 2011, the PLA added more than USD 200 billion, Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said."This kind of sustained investment has helped China jump ahead of us in key technologies," he said. "If America wants to stand up to China, it's going to take not just working with our allies and partners, but the real investment of our own - into innovative capabilities and the forward posture that will send a strong message of deterrence."Wortzel said some spending this year was likely aimed at mitigating the effects of Trump administration restrictions on exports to China and the crackdown on Chinese military students attending US universities."That means that the PLA and defence industries cannot get the technologies they relied on from intellectual property theft or espionage," he said. "The Biden administration will probably not lift those restrictions."According to the news outlet, The State Department confirmed the new administration's concern about US technology being diverted to the PLA."We have to play a better defense, which must include making sure that American technologies are not facilitating China's military buildup or human rights abuses," a representative of the department said."The rapid development and operational focus of China's military constitutes a significant and long-term security threat to the United States and to our allies and partners," the representative added.In January, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, passed the coastguard law that empowers the coastguard to use "all necessary means" to deter threats posed by foreign vessels in waters "under China's jurisdiction".It allows the coastguards to launch pre-emptive strikes without prior warning if commanders deem it necessary.Under the new law, coastguard personnel can demolish structures built or installed by other countries in Chinese-claimed waters and board and inspect foreign ships in the area.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-work-with-allies-to-counter-beijing-s-military-threat-analysts-101615112897922.html
07-03-2021||World||Trump wants top Republican fundraising organizations to stop using his likeness||Former US President Donald Trump is pressing the Republican Party organs to stop using his name and likeness for fundraising and merchandise sales.According to The Hill, two sources confirmed that lawyers for Trump sent cease-and-desist letters on Friday to the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).The three groups are the largest fundraising bodies for the Republican Party."President Trump remains committed to the Republican Party and electing America First conservatives, but that doesn't give anyone - friend or foe - permission to use his likeness without explicit approval," a Trump adviser told Politico, which was the first to report on the letters, as reported by The Hill.The move came the same day the RNC sent two emails to supporters looking for donations in the form of a thank-you card to Trump."President Trump will ALWAYS stand up for the American People, and I just thought of the perfect way for you to show that you support him!" one email reads, as reported by the news outlet. "As one of President Trump's MOST LOYAL supporters, I think that YOU, deserve the great honor of adding your name to the Official Trump 'Thank You' Card."The letter from the former President's lawyers appears to be part of the former president's efforts to solidify his standing as a top "kingmaker" in the GOP (another name for the Republican Party).Trump has already forecasted that he will be heavily involved in the 2022 midterms while he mulls making a third presidential bid in 2024, and his endorsement is expected to be highly sought after by most Republicans.He has so far most backed incumbents in their reelection bids, though he has warned sitting lawmakers he is ready to throw his weight behind primary challengers running against those he deems insufficiently loyal."Where necessary and appropriate, I will back primary rivals who espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First. We want brilliant, strong, thoughtful, and compassionate leadership," Trump said in a statement last month.So far, he's endorsed former White House aide Max Miller, who is challenging Representative Anthony Gonzalez Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former President over his role in inciting the deadly January 6 riot on Capitol Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-top-republican-fundraising-organizations-to-stop-using-his-likeness-101615111411227.html
07-03-2021||World||Italy mulls tighter restrictions at least on weekends to check virus spread||The government of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is considering tighter curbs, including making the entire country a high-risk “red” zone at least during weekends, to counter a surge in the coronavirus pandemic.“The second wave never stopped, we’re seeing a very strong pickup due to the variants, which is leading us to take measures that are ever-more restrictive,” Health Minister Roberto Speranza told newspaper Corriere della Sera.Speranza did not rule out turning the whole of Italy into a red zone at least at weekends, and a stricter curfew. “It’s clear that we will monitor the epidemiological situation, adapting the measures in the light of the variants,” he said.Italy has a three-tier system in place that classifies regions by low, medium and high-risk based on the numbers of cases. The system involves closures of bars and restaurants, and strict limits on people’s movements barring them from leaving their city or town. Several regions have already closed schools with the variants spreading faster among young people.Among measures being considered by the government and a panel of medical and science experts are automatically turning regions into red zones if the threshold of 250 weekly virus cases per 100,000 inhabitants is breached, and closing shopping malls during the week, Italian newspapers reported on Sunday.Possible measures from mid-March include making the entire country a red zone for three or four weeks, La Repubblica said.Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, has made the vaccination effort a priority for his new administration both to slow contagion and restart an economy that contracted 8.9% last year.The government is working on prioritizing first shots instead of holding back doses for a second inoculation, as well as recruiting the armed forces, civil protection volunteers and family doctors to help eradicate differences between regions in the pace of vaccination.The UK strain of Covid-19 is now dominant in the country and cases are rising again, touching two-month highs.

Its landslide November victory in national elections has been ignored by the junta."No matter how the situation in Myanmar changes, China's determination to promote China-Myanmar relations will not waver, and China's direction of promoting China-Myanmar friendly cooperation will not change," Wang said.On Saturday, an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta told Reuters that the generals are keen to leave politics after their coup and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.Some of the protests against the coup, which have drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, have taken place outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon, with protesters accusing Beijing of supporting the junta.Beijing has said it was not informed in advance of the coup.China has traditionally been viewed with suspicion in Myanmar, where it has significant economic and strategic interests and has often backed Myanmar's position against Western criticism.

07-03-2021||World||Thousands of protesters on Myanmar streets after night raids by security forces||Tens of thousands of people came out in Myanmar on Sunday in one of the biggest days of protest against last month's coup despite overnight raids by security forces in the main city Yangon on campaign leaders and opposition activists.Police fired tear gas and stun grenades in Lashio town in the country's northern Shan region, according to live video posted on Facebook. A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan but it was not clear if they were using rubber bullets or live ammunition.There were no immediate reports of casualties. Protests in half a dozen other cities were peaceful.The biggest turnout was in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, where activists staged a sit-in protest after two minutes of silence in honour of people killed by police and the army, video showed.The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to stamp out the daily demonstrations and strikes in the Southeast Asian nation since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1."They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens," one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, in the country's south. "What will we do if we don't revolt against them? We must revolt."Also read: ‘Scores from Myanmar trying to flee to India’Protests were also held in at least three places in Yangon, where residents said soldiers and police moved into several districts overnight, firing shots. They arrested at least three in Kyauktada Township, residents there said. They did not know the reason for the arrests."They are asking to take out my father and brother. Is no one going to help us? Don't you even touch my father and brother. Take us too if you want to take them," one woman screamed as two of them, an actor and his son, were led off.Soldiers also came looking for a lawyer who worked for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy but were unable to find him, a member of the now dissolved parliament, Sithu Maung, said in a Facebook post.Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment."PUNCHED AND KICKED"Well over 1,700 people have been detained under the junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."Myanmar authorities said on Saturday they had exhumed the body of 19-year-old Kyal Sin, who has become an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".State-run MRTV said a surgical investigation showed she could not have been killed by police because the wrong sort of projectile was found in her head and she had been shot from behind, whereas police were in front.Photographs on the day showed her head turned away from security forces moments before she was killed. Opponents of the coup accused authorities of an attempted cover-up.The killings have drawn anger in the West and have been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta. China, meanwhile, has said the priority should be stability and that other countries should not interfere.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election - which her party won in landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he had also been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-protesters-on-myanmar-streets-after-night-raids-by-security-forces-101615094504321.html
07-03-2021||World||Sri Lankan Catholics mark 'Black Sunday' remembering victims of 2019 Easter bombings||COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan Roman Catholics attended Mass dressed in black on Sunday, with prayers and protests calling for justice for those killed in coordinated suicide bomb attacks on Easter Sunday two years ago.Church bells tolled and prayers were chanted at 8:45 a.m., the time when bombs were detonated almost simultaneously at two Roman Catholic churches and a Protestant church during Easter services on April 21, 2019. Bombs were also set off at three top hotels targeting locals and foreigners who were eating breakfast.More than 260 people, including 171 from the two Catholic churches, were killed in the attacks, which were blamed on two local Islamic extremist groups that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group.A presidential inquiry commission has handed its final report to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has shared parts of it with Catholic and Buddhist religious leaders. The report has also been sent to the attorney general for legal action.However, the archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, said the report had concentrated more on the failures of the then-government in preventing the attacks despite early warnings, rather than finding out the handlers of the groups accused of carrying out the bombings.“No one who wants to promote hatred and religious strife will receive our support. We believe there should be unity and brotherhood among different ethnic and religious groups all over the world," Ranjith said Sunday.“Today Holy Father Pope Francis has visited Iraq and has had a discussion with the Shia leaders (in Iran). It shows religious leaders in the world think about unity and brotherhood, not about creating strife. Therefore I request anyone inclined to create conflict on account of religion to give up that idea,” he said.At St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a predominantly Catholic area north of Colombo where 115 people were killed in the Easter attacks, parishioners attended Mass on Sunday dressed in black and held placards outside the church in a silent “Black Sunday” protest.“The main purpose of this is to show the people and our rulers that justice has not happened for the victims of the Easter attacks," said Auxiliary Bishop the Rev. Maxwell Silva, who celebrated Mass at the church.“We believe the commission report is not genuine and it did not do any justice to those who suffered," said Manilal Ranasinghe, who attended Mass at St. Mary's Church in Dehiwala, south of Colombo.Political infighting between the then-president and prime minister resulting in a communications breakdown and lapse of security coordination was said to have enabled the attacks despite foreign intelligence warnings.Rajapaksa told a public gathering Saturday that the report blamed the government at the time for letting its guard down on national security, and that his government will punish those responsible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lankan-catholics-mark-black-sunday-remembering-victims-of-2019-easter-bombings-101615107550392.html

London ultimately agreed to leave the British-ruled province aligned to the EU's single market for goods to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, fearing it could be detrimental to the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.This has required checks on some items arriving in Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, which some businesses say has made it difficult to bring in supplies. To address that issue, the British government extended the grace period for some checks until Oct. 1.The EU disputes that the grace period extension was in line with the agreement, saying London should honour what it signed up to. It has promised to launch legal action, or a so-called "infringement procedure" against Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shake-off-any-remaining-ill-will-britain-tells-eu-over-post-brexit-trade-101615107753448.html

In a report, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said Russian warships in the Mediterranean had fired three missiles that struck primitive oil refineries and tanker trucks in the region.It said more than 180 trucks and tankers were burned in the massive blaze, and at least four people killed and 24 wounded.Satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. analyzed by The Associated Press on Sunday showed what appeared to be the aftermath of a large fire that tore through an area near Jarablus between Friday and Saturday morning.Past satellite photos of the site, some 75 kilometers (45 miles) northeast of the Syrian city of Aleppo, showed hundreds of tanker trucks gathered in the area.An image from Saturday showed char marks across the entire area where the trucks once were. NASA’s fire satellite monitoring, which watches for flashes associated with blazes or explosions, showed fires at the site in the early morning hours of Saturday.The reports of missiles fired from a Russian warship — a rare occurrence — could not be independently verified and Russia, which is a main supporter of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country’s 10-year civil war, has not commented on the accusations.Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency reported they were ballistic missiles, but said it was not clear who carried out the attacks.Turkey and allied Syrian opposition fighters control large parts of northern Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-photos-show-aftermath-of-strike-in-northern-syria-101615107502344.html
07-03-2021||World||Covid vaccine rollout 'India’s gift' to world in combating pandemic: Scientist||The rollout of Covid-19 vaccine is "India's gift" to the world in combating coronavirus and will be remembered as a time when the country stepped up in a major way as a global player in innovation, a top American scientist has said.India is called the pharmacy of the world during the Covid-19 pandemic with its vast experience and deep knowledge in medicine. The country is one of the world’s biggest drug-makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring coronavirus vaccines.Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston during a webinar this week said that the two mRNA vaccines may not impact the world's low and middle income countries, but India’s vaccines, made in collaboration with universities across the world such as BCM and Oxford University, have “rescued the world” and its contributions must not to be underestimated.During the webinar, “Covid-19: Vaccination and Potential Return to Normalcy - If and When”, Dr Hotez, an internationally-recognised physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development, said that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is "India's gift' to the world in combating the virus.India’s drugs regulator gave emergency use authorisation to Covishield, produced by Pune-based Serum Institute of India after securing licence from British pharma company AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, indigenously developed jointly by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research scientists.The webinar was organised by Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston (IACCGH).“This is something very special and I see it myself because I'm on weekly teleconferences with our colleagues in India, you make a recommendation, and within days it's done and not only done, but it's done well and with incredible rigor and thought and creativity," Dr Hotez said, stressing that he felt compelled to make this statement because "India's huge efforts in combating global pandemic is a story that's not really getting out in the world."Dr Hotez, considered as the authority on vaccinations, is working on an affordable coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with Indian pharmaceutical companies.There is increasing evidence that vaccines not only “interrupt symptomatic illness and keep you out of the hospital” but halts asymptomatic transmission as well.However, the troubling news is that the vaccines work well against the UK B.1.1.7 variant, which is now accelerating across the US, but doesn’t work quite as well against the variant coming out of South Africa.It is likely that all the vaccines will require a booster for two reasons: the durability of protection for the vaccines is unknown and to create an added immune response that's better tailored towards the South African variant.Consul General of India in Houston, Aseem Mahajan, along with a distinguished panel of doctors participated in this webinar, that tracked the possibilities of a return to some semblance of normality due to the accelerated roll out of vaccines across the country.Appreciating Dr. Hotez for commending India’s efforts in getting vaccines to the world, Consul General Mahajan, said, “in keeping with “our tradition of sharing with the world,” India has exported vaccines to many countries across the world.India has provided 56 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines under grants assistance to a number of countries. The vaccines were sent to Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles.There has also been a boost in the collaborative medical partnerships emerging between the US and India during this pandemic. In addition, India is one of the fourth largest destinations in Asia for medical devices manufacturing and many US companies have expressed interest in collaborating on this front," Mahajan said.IACCGH Founding Secretary/Executive Director Jagdip Ahluwalia said that “India's response to the Covid crisis, as acknowledged by Dr Hotez, falls in line with Chamber’s vision. Since its inception, 21 years ago, that India would be a future global player in key areas like technology, medicine, manufacturing and international trade. This belief has been proved time and again particularly in the last decade." Chamber President Tarush Anand expressed pride that India has risen to this global challenge by leveraging the brilliance of its scientific community and extensive manufacturing capabilities in the most efficient manner to help the world recover from a deadly pandemic.Describing vaccines as “one of the highest expressions of science in pursuit of humanitarian goals,” Chief Radiation Oncology Officer and moderator Dr Vivek Kavadi noted that over 28 million people had contracted the virus in the US and more than half a million Americans had tragically died. Lives and businesses had been upended but the breakthrough on the vaccine front has been one reason for cautious optimism.More than 73 million vaccine doses have been administered to date, 15 per cent of the population has received 1 dose while 7 per cent have received both doses, Dr Kavadi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-rollout-india-s-gift-to-world-in-combating-pandemic-scientist-101615107284140.html
07-03-2021||World||South Korea, US to start scaled-back combined exercise this week||South Korea and the United States will stage a major springtime combined military exercise starting this week in a scaled-back manner amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said on Sunday.According to Yonhap News Agency, whether to hold the regular exercise has drawn attention as the unification ministry and some civic groups have called for its adjustment to help move forward the stalled inter-Korean ties. North Korea has long demanded a halt to such joint manoeuvres."South Korea and the U.S. decided to conduct the springtime combined exercise from March 8 for nine days, after comprehensively taking into consideration the Covid-19 situation, the maintenance of the combat readiness posture, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of peace," the JCS said in a statement as quoted by Yonhap.The statement added that the computer-simulated command post exercise (CPX) will not include outdoor drills, as such manoeuvres have been carried out throughout the year, and the size of troops and equipment to be involved will be "minimized" due to the pandemic.The upcoming exercise will also include a "rehearsal for theatre operations under the envisioned future Combined Forces Command (CFC)" to prepare for a planned Full Operational Capability (FOC) test, though it will focus mainly on ensuring their combined readiness posture, the news outlet further reported.The FOC test is a crucial step to check if South Korea is on course to meet conditions required for retaking the wartime operational control (OPCON) of its forces from Washington.Seoul hopes to take back the wartime OPCON within the term of the current administration that ends in May 2022 and has called for the test to be a key feature of the upcoming exercise.But the US military reportedly voiced opposition, as troops and military equipment necessary for the test are not able to come to South Korea due to the virus situation, the agency reported.The test was supposed to be held last year, but the two sides were not able to do so, as they were forced to cancel their springtime exercise and hold the summertime one in an adjusted manner."The two sides have had close consultations on the matter and agreed to carry out the rehearsal this time, albeit limitedly, to make progress in the transition process," a defense ministry official said, as quoted by Yonhap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-us-to-start-scaled-back-combined-exercise-this-week-101615106389134.html
07-03-2021||World||Hope US will remove 'unreasonable' restrictions on cooperation, says China||The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Sunday that Beijing is willing to communicate with the United States on the basis of mutual respect and hopes Washington will remove all "unreasonable" restrictions on cooperation as soon as possible.Last week US President Joe Biden singled out a "growing rivalry with China" as a key challenge facing the United States, with his top diplomat describing the Asian country as "the biggest geopolitical test" of this century.Questioned about recent US-China frictions over Taiwan, Xinjiang and the South China Sea during his annual news conference, Wang said that Beijing "will never accept baseless accusations and smears", and said the United States had used democracy and human rights as a basis for arbitrarily interfering with other countries' affairs."The US should realise this as soon as possible, otherwise the world will continue to experience instability," he said.Wang added that differences between China and the United States must be managed carefully and that the two sides must advocate healthy competition not zero-sum finger-pointing.The United States and China are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing's economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China's Xinjiang region.The Biden administration has indicated it will broadly continue a tough approach to China taken by former President Donald Trump, but do so in coordination will allies.During Trump's administration, the United States levied a series of sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing's economic policies, which have not been lifted under the new administration.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo's determination that genocide against Muslims is underway in Xinjiang.Activists and UN experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.During Wang's Sunday news conference, the diplomat also spoke broadly on accusations over human rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying that some Western politicians chose to believe lies about the region.Biden wants to signal a break with Trump's "America First" approach by re-engaging with allies and focussing on multilateral diplomacy, while also recognising the world has changed since he served in the Obama administration that preceded Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-us-will-remove-unreasonable-restrictions-on-cooperation-says-china-101615106332842.html
07-03-2021||World||Russia scores points with vaccine diplomacy, but snags arise||Russia's boast in August that it was the first country to authorize a coronavirus vaccine led to skepticism at the time because of its insufficient testing. Six months later, as demand for the Sputnik V vaccine grows, experts are raising questions again — this time, over whether Moscow can keep up with all the orders from the countries that want it.Slovakia got 200,000 doses on March 1, even though the European Medicines Agency, the European Union's pharmaceutical regulator, only began reviewing its use on Thursday in an expedited process. The president of the hard-hit Czech Republic said he wrote directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin to get a supply. Millions of doses are expected by countries in Latin America, Africa, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East in a wave of Russian vaccine diplomacy.“Sputnik V continues to confidently conquer Europe,” anchor Olga Skabeyeva declared on the Russia-1 state TV channel.Dmitry Kiselev, the network's top pro-Kremlin anchor, heaped on the hyperbole last month, blustering: “The Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, is the best in the world.”State TV channels have covered vaccine exports extensively, citing praise from abroad for Russia and running segments about the difficulties countries are having with Western vaccines.The early criticism of Sputnik V has been blunted by a report in the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet that said large-scale testing showed it to be safe, with an efficacy rate of 91% against the virus.That could help revamp Russia's image to one of a scientific, technological and benevolent power, especially as other countries encounter shortages of Covid-19 vaccines because richer nations are scooping up the Western-made versions or manufacturers struggle with limited production capacity.“The fact that Russia is among five countries that were able to quickly develop a vaccine … allows Moscow to present itself as a high-tech power of knowledge rather than a petrol pump in decline,” said foreign affairs analyst Vladimir Frolov.Some experts say boosting the use of vaccines from China and Russia — which have not been as popular as those from the West — could offer a quicker way to increase the global supply. Others note that Russia wants to score geopolitical points.“Putin is using (the vaccine) to bolster a very tarnished image of Russia’s scientific and technological prowess,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “He’s using it for geostrategic purposes in areas where Russia would like to have spheres of influence.”Whether Russia can deliver is another question. China has supplied millions of doses to other countries, but the output of Sputnik V appears for now to be far lower than the demand.“They succeeded beyond their wildest dreams in terms of this vaccine actually being a viable, marketable product," said Judy Twigg, a political science professor specializing in global health at Virginia Commonwealth University. "They’ve made all of these explicit and implicit promises to people inside and outside Russia about access to this product that now is unexpectedly great. And now they’re stuck trying, scrambling, trying to figure out how to deliver on all those promises.”Russia also must take care of its own. Authorities have announced plans to vaccinate 60% of adults, or roughly 68 million people, by the end of June.The domestic rollout in Russia has been slow, compared with other nations, with about 4 million people, or less than 3% of the population, vaccinated as of late February. Some of that could also be due to widespread reluctance among Russians to trust vaccines.The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which bankrolled and markets the vaccine abroad, has not responded to a request for comment on how many doses are going to other countries. It said earlier that it has received requests for 2.4 billion doses from over 50 nations.Airfinity, a London-based science analytics company, estimates that Russia agreed to supply about 392 million doses abroad, and there are talks with countries for at least another 356 million.Judging by production and exports so far, “Russia is very far from being able to deliver this,” said Airfinity CEO and founder Rasmus Hansen.Russia manufactured just over 2 million doses last year amid reports of local producers having problems with buying equipment and making the second component of the two-shot vaccine.Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Feb. 20 that over 10 million doses of Sputnik V have been produced.Sputnik V is a viral vector vaccine, which uses a harmless virus that carries genetic material to stimulate the immune system. Producing it is a complicated process, said Elena Subbotina, a consultant with the pharma consultancy CBPartners’ Central and Eastern Europe Team. Producers can’t guarantee stable output because working with biological ingredients involves a lot of variability in terms of the quality of the finished product.Some countries that have been offered large batches of Sputnik V have yet to approve it for use.In India, which has been pledged 125 million doses, the vaccine is undergoing studies to determine if it produces a comparable immune response. Brazil’s health ministry said it is negotiating to purchase 10 million doses, but the nation’s regulatory agency has yet to authorize its use. Nepal, which has been offered 25 million doses, also hasn’t given its approval.Other countries have had delays in receiving Sputnik V shipments.Argentina got nearly 2.5 million doses by March 1, even though at one point the government was expecting 5 million in January and over 14 million more in February. Officials in Hungary, who agreed to buy 2 million doses over three months, said Jan. 22 they were expecting 600,000 doses in the first 30 days, but got only 325,600 by early March. Mexico signed a deal for 24 million doses and was hoping to receive 400,000 in February but got only 200,000.The Russian Direct Investment Fund has agreements with manufacturers in countries including Brazil, South Korea and India to boost production, but there are few indications that manufacturers abroad have made any large amounts of the vaccine so far.The Brazilian company Uniao Quimica is in the pilot testing phase, the results of which will be shared with Russia before the company can produce it for sale. Indian drugmaker Hetero Biopharma, with a deal to make 100 million doses, was to begin production at the start of 2021, but it isn’t clear if it has actually started.South Korean company GL Rapha, which expects to make 150 million doses this year, will be manufacturing finished products by sometime in March, said company official Kim Gi-young.Russia so far hasn't faced any criticism for delaying supplies of Sputnik V to other countries, with foreign officials optimistic about the deals.Hungary is still awaiting large shipments, but expressed optimism about receiving them.“The Russian side, with minimal delay, will meet the 600,000 doses agreed to in the first phase, and then the additional 1.4 million doses,” Hungary's State Secretary Tamas Menczer said last month. Prime Minister Viktor Orban added Friday: “The Russians are pretty much keeping their promises.”Promising more than can be delivered appears to be a universal problem with coronavirus vaccines, and it is a real risk for Russia as well, said Theresa Fallon, director of the Brussels-based Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies.“They have won the gold medal for creating this very effective vaccine," she said. "But the problem is, how are they going to implement it?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-scores-points-with-vaccine-diplomacy-but-snags-arise-101615106347474.html

The Rescue personnel is busy in relief activities, aided by the local people, reported Geo News.The rescue sources said several people are still trapped inside the ill-fated train. The personnel are facing problems in the rescue operation owing to the darkness, they said.The train service has been suspended on both tracks, said the Pakistan Railways sources. They said all the Punjab-bound trains that left Karachi have been halted on different stations.Meanwhile, Pakistan Railways had suffered Pakistani ₹1.2 trillion losses during the past 50 years and the government plans to revive the collapsing organisation and have no clue how to proceed.The cash-strapped Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government seems as clueless about its strategy for the railway's revival as any previous administration.It has, apparently, put all its eggs in the Chinese basket, hoping that the investment of USD 6.8 billion on an upgrade of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) connecting Peshawar with Karachi would resuscitate the dying company.Citing the 2019-20 Economic Survey, Dawn reported, the railway owns 474 locomotives (458 diesel engines and 12 steam engines) for 7,791km length of the track. During the first eight months of FY20 (July-February), the number of passengers decreased to 39.4 million against 39.9m from the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-rail-accident-kills-one-injures-several-101615103041910.html
07-03-2021||World||US defence chief Austin likely to visit India soon: Report||US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is likely to visit India next week, an Indian government source told Reuters on Sunday, as the two allies seek to deepen military ties to counter the growing power of China in the Asia-Pacific region.The first person visit by a top official of the new US President Joe Biden's administration will focus on enhancing cooperation, said the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.Austin plans to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh during his visit some time in the week of March 15, the official added.The first Black US defence chief will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a visit to Japan and South Korea, sources told Reuters on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if Blinken will also visit India.The US Embassy in New Delhi referred a request for comment to the Defence Department, which could not be reached outside regular business hours.For India, closer bilateral military ties could bring greater access to American technology, as New Delhi tries to modernise its defence system amid tensions with neighbouring China in the western Himalayas.India and China last month began to pull back troops and battle tanks from a bitterly contested lake area high in the Himalayas, in a breakthrough after a months-long standoff on the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed giants.The standoff began in April when India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border in the Ladakh area in the western Himalayas.US defence manufacturers hope closer ties will boost their own prospects in India, which is one of the world's biggest defence spenders but still has major gaps in its military capabilities.

07-03-2021||World||Covid-19: Canadian provinces looking to import vaccine tech knowhow from India||A number of Canadian provincial governments, including Alberta, have approached India to explore the possibility of importing technical knowhow on Covid-19 vaccines from Indian manufacturers to establish vaccine-making facilities to tackle the pandemic.An Indian official said “preliminary” discussions have commenced and the provincial governments are interested in the technical expertise developed by companies such as Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. The two companies are manufacturing Indian-made vaccines. SII is making the Covishield vaccine, its version of the Astra Zeneca-Oxford shot, and Bharat Biotech is producing the Covaxin jab.Canada is importing Pune-based SII’s Covishield shots, with the first consignment of 500,000 doses having arrived last Wednesday and the remaining two million doses expected by mid-May.Canadian provinces have been eyeing Indian-made vaccines even as New Delhi has been dispatching shipments to numerous countries around the world. Canada has been troubled with maintaining a steady flow of doses because of the absence of indigenous manufacturing facilities and provincial governments have been seeking to establish such facilities in potential joint ventures with Indian manufacturers in future.Alberta apart, Indian officials didn’t yet identify the other Canadian provinces that have been in contact with the Indian government to pursue this matter. They said India’s “vaccine internationalism” could pay off in a post-pandemic scenario for its pharma sector as it emerges as a reliable supplier.The arrival of the coronavirus vaccines in Canada is being highlighted by India as its reliability and credulity when it comes to maintaining global supply chains as well as being the “pharmacy of the world”, as one official put it.While the Biden administration in the US has indicated it may not allow its manufacturers to export vaccines till domestic requirements are met, India is attempting to underscore its vaccine diplomacy initiative. Ajay Bisaria, India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, made this point during a series of interviews with the Canadian media as the Covishield vaccines arrived in Canada.Asked by Vassy Kapelos, host of CBC’s Power & Politics, whether there was the possibility that India could renege on contracts like the US seems likely to do, Bisaria said, “You have no worries from India. We have enough going and India is strongly committed and very conscious of its responsibility as the largest vaccine-maker in the world with 62% of the global capacity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canadian-provinces-looking-to-import-vaccine-tech-knowhow-from-india-101615098191925.html

Nyingchi is located less than 50km from the border with Arunachal Pradesh.China claims the entire Indian state as part of southern Tibet and has been rapidly developing infrastructure in the remote area of Nyingchi, which like the rest of TAR is not accessible to foreign journalists and diplomats. For example, China is building the Sichuan-Tibet railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section, which will be 1,011km in length and include 26 stations when completed - taking Chinese railway right up to the disputed boundary with India.Last November, President Xi Jinping identified the Ya’an-Nyingchi railway project as a major measure in facilitating the Communist Party of China’s plan for governing Tibet in the new era, and stressed the project’s role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.“The project would significantly contribute to the economic and social development of the western region, especially in Sichuan province and TAR,” Xi said in November.The Sichuan-Tibet railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.On Saturday, talking about the first high-speed train, Chinese railway official Lu Dongfu said the track-laying work had been completed by the end of 2020.“The railway has a designed speed of 160 kmph, according to its constructor Tibet Railway Construction Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China State Railway Group,” news agency Xinhua said.“China aims to extend the total length in operation (of high speed trains) to around 50,000km by 2025, up from 37,900km by the end of 2020,” Lu said.The high-speed railway network will cover 98% of cities with over 500,000 residents, he added.China’s self-developed Fuxing trains now operate at a speed range of 160kmph to 350kmph.By the end of last year, 1,036 “Fuxing” or “electrical multiple units” (EMU) had run a total of 836 million km and carried 827 million passengers since 2007, when the first bullet train became operational.Under a national blueprint, quoted by state media, China will extend the total length of its rail system to 200,000km and its high-speed rail system to 70,000km by 2035.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highspeed-train-from-lhasa-to-tibetan-city-near-arunachal-to-run-from-june-101615095851767.html
07-03-2021||World||Japan to closely monitor China's increased defense spending||Japanese defense officials on Sunday said that they intend to closely monitor how China will increase its defense spending this year, reported NHK World.As per this year's draft budget at the annual session of the National People's Congress, which opened on Friday, the Chinese government increased its defense budget by 6.8% from last year to about 209 billion dollars. That's around four times Japan's defense budget for fiscal 2021, starting in April, reported NHK World.The increase in defense budget reflects Beijing's urge in maritime activities.China has been claiming the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and their have been many incidents of incursions of Chinese ships in Japanese territorial waters.Japan controls the islands but China and Taiwan also lay their claim. The Japanese government maintains the islands as an inherent part of Japan's territory, in terms of history and international law. It said that there is no issue of sovereignty to be resolved over them, reported NHK World.The Japanese government plans to call on the Chinese side to increase transparency through security talks and exchanges as they are unaware of the type of equipment Beijing is planning to deploy.Further, they reiterated to closely analyze and monitor the activities of the Chinese military.Meanwhile, amid attempts to change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas by China, the United States and Japan on Thursday held bilateral security discussions on Beijing's Coast Guard Law.In January, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, passed the coastguard law that empowers the coastguard to use "all necessary means" to deter threats posed by foreign vessels in waters "under China's jurisdiction".It allows the coastguards to launch pre-emptive strikes without prior warning if commanders deem it necessary.Under the new law, coastguard personnel can demolish structures built or installed by other countries in Chinese-claimed waters and board and inspect foreign ships in the area.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-closely-monitor-china-s-increased-defense-spending-101615093349202.html

07-03-2021||World||Pressure piles on scandal hit Cuomo as ex-aide calls out office conduct||Another woman who worked for Gov. Andrew Cuomo is describing conduct she felt was inappropriate for the workplace.Ana Liss, 35, told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Saturday that when she worked as a policy aide to the governor between 2013 and 2015, Cuomo called her “sweetheart,” once kissed her hand and asked personal questions, including whether she had a boyfriend. She said he sometimes greeted her with a hug and a kiss on both cheeks.Liss told the Journal she initially thought of Cuomo’s behavior as harmless, but it grew to bother her. She felt it was patronizing.“It’s not appropriate, really, in any setting,” she said. “I wish that he took me seriously.”A spokesman for Cuomo didn’t immediately return a request for comment from The Associated Press, but told the Journal that some of the behavior Liss was describing was the kind of innocent glad-handing that politicians often do at public events.“Reporters and photographers have covered the governor for 14 years watching him kiss men and women and posing for pictures," said Rich Azzopardi, a senior advisor to Cuomo. "At the public open-house mansion reception, there are hundreds of people, and he poses for hundreds of pictures. That’s what people in politics do.”Liss said she never made a formal complaint about the governor’s behavior.Cuomo’s workplace conduct has been under intense scrutiny in recent days as several women have publicly told of feeling sexually harassed, or at least made to feel demeaned and uncomfortable by the Democrat.Former adviser Lindsey Boylan, 36, said he made inappropriate comments on her appearance, once kissed her on the lips at the end of a meeting and suggested a game of strip poker as they sat with other aides on a jet flight. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, 25, said Cuomo asked if she ever had sex with older men and made other comments she interpreted as gauging her interest in an affair.Another woman, who did not work for the state, described Cuomo putting his hands on her face and asking if he could kiss her after they met at a wedding.In a news conference Wednesday, Cuomo denied ever touching anyone inappropriately, but apologized for behaving in a way that he now realized had upset women he worked with. He said he’d made jokes and asked personal questions in an attempt to be playful and frequently greeted people with hugs and kisses, as his father, Mario Cuomo, had done when he was governor.“I understand sensitivities have changed. Behavior has changed,” Cuomo said. “I get it and I’m going to learn from it.”The state's attorney general plans to hire an outside law firm to investigate the sexual harassment allegations. Some lawmakers have called for Cuomo to resign over his workplace behavior, and separate allegations that his administration misled the public about coronavirus fatalities in nursing homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-piles-on-scandal-hit-cuomo-as-ex-aide-calls-out-office-conduct-101615091739849.html
07-03-2021||World||George Floyd: 'Gentle giant' who became symbol of fight against racism||His name is chanted by demonstrators around the globe. His face is displayed on murals all over the United States. Since his brutal death George Floyd has embodied, more than any other, the Black victims of police violence and racism in the United States."Daddy changed the world." The words of Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna summed up the paradox of his killing, in which the end of his life began a moral reckoning on race and white supremacy far beyond the borders of the United States.The 46-year-old died of asphyxiation beneath the knee of a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, on May 25, 2020 in the US city of Minneapolis.Chauvin's trial opens Monday.The horrifying killing, which kicked off the biggest civil rights protests in the US since the 1960s, snuffed out a life marked by hardship but also generosity.Standing at six foot four inches (1.93 meters), Floyd was known to friends and family as a "gentle giant," a rapper and athlete who suffered runs-in with the law and addiction but who wanted the best for his children.His mother, for whom he cried out when he was dying, moved to Houston shortly after he was born in 1973 in North Carolina.He grew up in the Third Ward, a poor and predominantly African American neighborhood in central Houston."We didn't have a whole lot, but we always had each other," his cousin Shareeduh Tate said during a memorial gathering last year in Minneapolis.At Jake Yates High School, he played the role of big brother to a lot of the local boys."He was teaching us how to be a man because he was in the world already before us," said his younger brother Philonise at the memorial.Floyd stood out on the football field and excelled at basketball, playing the latter sport when he went to college."He was a monster on the court," said Philonese. "But in life, in general, talking to people, a gentle giant."'Way with words' He dropped out of college and came back to Houston to help out his family.In the 1990s, he threw himself into Houston's hip-hop circuit under the name of "Big Floyd," where he enjoyed some success.But he could not escape the violence of Houston's underground scene, and was arrested several times for thefts and drug dealing. Local media said he was jailed in the early 2000s for armed burglary, serving four years.After prison, he turned to religion and fell in with the pastor of a church in the Third Ward, using his notoriety and his love of basketball star Lebron James to draw in young men to the ministry, where he taught them religion and coached them in basketball."He was powerful, he had a way with words," said Philonese.Floyd moved to Minneapolis in 2014 for a "change of scenery" and to look for more stable employment to help support the mother of his newborn daughter Gianna.He worked as a truck driver for the Salvation Army and then as a bouncer at a bar, a job he lost when the city's restaurants shut down because of the pandemic."I got my shortcomings and my flaws, and I ain't better than nobody else," Floyd wrote on Instagram in 2017."But, man, the shootings that's going on, man, I don't care what religion you're from, man, or where you're at, man. I love you, and God love you, man. Put them guns down, man."Delivering justice On May 25, Floyd bought a packet of cigarettes from a shop in Minneapolis. The shopkeeper suspected him of using a counterfeit $20 bill, and phoned the police.Floyd -- who had taken fentanyl, a powerful opiate -- resisted his arrest.He did not use violence, but he soon found himself handcuffed and pinned beneath Chauvin's knee anyway.In footage of his killing, filmed by horrified bystanders and later sent around the world, he can be heard begging for his mother and for relief. His final words were "I can't breathe."He was buried in June in Houston, next to his mother Larcenia, who died in 2018 and whose nickname "Cissy" he had tattooed on his chest.Residents of the Third Ward in Houston, where he grew up, have paid their respects with multiple murals.One, painted on the red brick wall of the social housing block where Floyd grew up, shows "Big Floyd" with angel's wings and a halo around his head.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-gentle-giant-who-became-symbol-of-fight-against-racism-101615086578041.html
07-03-2021||World||Protesters back on Myanmar streets after night raids by security forces||Tens of thousands of people came out on the streets in Myanmar on Sunday to demonstrate against last month's coup despite overnight raids by security forces in the main city Yangon to crack down on protest leaders.The biggest protest was in Myanmar's second city of Mandalay, local media said. Protests were also held in Yangon, in Kale near the Indian border, and in Dawei, a coastal city in the south. There were no reports of violence.The Southeast Asian country has been plunged into turmoil since the military overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1. Daily demonstrations and strikes have choked business and paralysed administration and the United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people.Into the early hours of Sunday, residents said soldiers and police moved into several districts of Yangon, firing shots. They arrested at least three in Kyauktada Township, residents there said. They did not know the reason for the arrests."They are asking to take out my father and brother. Is no one going to help us? Don't you even touch my father and brother. Take us too if you want to take them," one woman screamed as two of them, an actor and his son, were led off.Soldiers also came looking for a lawyer who worked for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy but were unable to find him, a member of the now dissolved parliament, Sithu Maung, said in a Facebook post.Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.'Punched and kicked'Well over 1,700 people have been detained under the junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group. It did not give a figure for overnight detentions."Detainees were punched and kicked with military boots, beaten with police batons, and then dragged into police vehicles," AAPP said in a statement. "Security forces entered residential areas and tried to arrest further protesters, and shot at the homes, destroying many."Myanmar authorities said on Saturday they had exhumed the body of 19-year-old Kyal Sin, who has become an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead in Mandalay on Wednesday wearing a T-shirt that read "Everything will be OK".State-run MRTV said a surgical investigation showed she could not have been killed by police because the wrong sort of projectile was found in her head and she had been shot from behind, whereas police were in front.Photographs on the day showed her head turned away from security forces moments before she was killed. Opponents of the coup accused authorities of an attempted cover-up.The killings have drawn anger in the West and have been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta. China, meanwhile, has said the priority should be stability and that other countries should not interfere.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November's election - which her party won in landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.Israeli-Canadian lobbyist Ari Ben-Menashe, hired by Myanmar's junta, told Reuters the generals are keen to leave politics and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.He said Suu Kyi had grown too close to China for the generals' liking.Ben-Menashe said he also had been tasked with seeking Arab support for a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom were driven from Myanmar in 2017 in an army crackdown after rebel attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-back-on-myanmar-streets-after-night-raids-by-security-forces-101615089588431.html
07-03-2021||World||'We can do big things,' Schumer says as Senate approves aid||Tensions were raw ahead of midnight as Republican leader Mitch McConnell rose in the Senate for the purpose of publicly ridiculing Majority Leader Chuck Schumer over the daylong delay as Democrats argued among themselves over the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue package.But 12 hours later, it was Schumer, D-N.Y., reveling in the last word, an unabashedly upbeat “help is on the way” to Americans suffering through the pandemic and lockdowns as the Senate prepared to approve the massive package without a single GOP vote.Senate passage of the sweeping relief bill Saturday puts President Joe Biden’s top priority closer to becoming law, poised to unleash billion for vaccines, $1,400 direct payments and other aid, and shows Schumer, in his first big test as majority leader, can unify the ever-so-slim Democratic majority and deliver the votes.“Lessons learned: If we have unity, we can do big things,” Schumer told The Associated Press in an interview after the vote.The outcome “gives us optimism about doing more big things in the future — because it worked,” he said.Stewardship of the massive pandemic relief package was an inaugural foray of the new power dynamics of Washington, testing Democratic control of the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade, and setting the foundation for what’s possible for Biden’s agenda.So much of Biden's success or failure depends on the Senate, where Democrats are in command of an evenly split chamber, 50-50, a majority so delicate that any one senator can upend the legislative agenda. While Vice President Kamala Harris is able to break tie votes, Schumer has zero slack if Republicans are opposed, voting lockstep as they did Saturday against the virus aid as bloated and unnecessary. One key centrist, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wavered over an unemployment provision, throwing the proceedings into chaos before a grueling all-night session.Biden has been telling senators privately their vote on pandemic aid will build momentum for the next priorities. An ambitious infrastructure package is emerging, part of his “Build Back Better” campaign agenda, to bring roads, broadband and green-energy projects nationwide. He and Schumer spoke often as the Senate leader steered the pandemic aid to approval. It's now headed back to the House for a final vote, as soon as Monday.While no senators appeared ready to tank Biden’s top priority, the next votes could prove more difficult.“There’s a whole series of issues that that quite a few of us were discussing,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a Biden ally eager for bipartisanship, who spoke to the president a few minutes after the vote.“This was a reminder yesterday that, in a 50-50 Senate, if any one member changes their mind on an amendment, or vote or an issue, it can change the outcome," Coons said.Voting rights, immigration law changes and other bills will be subject to filibuster rules that require 60 votes for passage, rather than 51, a potentially impossible hurdle in the face of Republican opposition that is stoking calls to change the process to ensure Biden’s priorities don’t flame out.“We’re going to have to have discussions about that,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., a member of leadership.But that tough topic was for another day. On Saturday, Democrats elbow-bumped and cheered in the chamber — Stabenow said some were almost in tears -- as they ushered the massive aid package they had promised voters to approval. With 10 million jobs lost and countless schools and businesses shuttered, it includes $300 a week in extra unemployment benefits, money school reopenings, eviction protections and small business assistance.“Only 45 days after Joe Biden became president of the United States, to be able to do something so big, and so significant, that fundamentally is the glue for us,” she said.Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said it was the “best day” he’d ever had in the Senate. That biting speech from McConnell, R-Ky., poking at Democrats' temporary disarray? Brown dismissed it as cynical and unsubstantial.“So what,” Brown said. “Nobody cares about that. What they care about is, did we deliver on unemployment? Did we deliver on vaccines? Did we deliver on pensions? We cut the rate of child poverty in half. Think about that.”McConnell led Republicans to put up a blockade of opposition, reviving a strategy used the last time Democrats held the sweep of power, when Barack Obama was president, against the 2009 financial crisis rescue package.After Donald Trump won the White House, McConnell and Republicans controlling Congress with only a slightly thicker Senate margin used similar procedural tools to pass the $2 trillion GOP tax cuts on a party-line vote in 2017. Their effort to repeal and replace the health care law known as “Obamacare” fizzled when Sen. John McCain and two other Republicans voted with Democrats, and McConnell was unable to hold his party together.From his stately office off the Senate floor, with the lived-in feel of the rumpled New Yorker, Schumer pulled out his not-so-secret weapon, the flat flip-phone, which he uses for his constant calls keeping in touch with senators on their votes."Every member of our caucus, from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin, realize that we had to pull together, that if we failed, we’d all be hurt,” Schumer said, referring to the liberal-most senator from Vermont and the centrist from West Virginia.As Manchin hesitated, Schumer called him, as did other senators, and even Biden. But Manchin also had time — hours dragged on — to make up his mind.“He listens to everybody and then he puts it together,” Brown said of Schumer. “He’s good at it.”When the votes were being tallied Saturday, Schumer spotted the two new senators from Georgia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and pointed at them. They had stunned the political world by defeating two Republican incumbents in special elections in January that delivered Democrats the majority.“The people of Georgia deserve a great deal of credit for what happened here today,” Warnock said afterward. “Had they not stood up in such a powerful way, in this historic election that sent Jon Ossoff and myself to the Senate, we simply would not be here.”Schumer urged the presiding officer to announce the vote, 50-49. One Republican senator was absent for a family matter. Harris was not needed to break the tie.Schumer turned to his senators and said, “We are a great team.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-can-do-big-things-schumer-says-as-senate-approves-aid-101615076371655.html

Similar protests were being organized in cities around the country in advance of the trial of Derek Chauvin.Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck while Floyd was held face-down on the ground in handcuffs, saying he couldn’t breathe. Body-camera video time stamps provided by prosecutors show Chauvin held his position for about nine minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter and jury selection in his trial begins Monday.Saturday's protest in Minnesota was organized by Families Supporting Families Against Police Violence, a coalition of families who lost loved ones in police confrontations. The Star Tribune reports that speakers said that in light of Floyd's death, they want other fatal police encounters reopened and examined.In Massachusetts, supporters of families who lost loved ones during police encounters also gathered in Boston's South End. Protest organizer Brock Satter told WBZ radio: “We're demanding convictions. They should go to jail for their crimes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-rally-before-ex-officer-put-on-trial-in-floyd-s-death-101615075976783.html
07-03-2021||World||Oral Covid treatment yields promising trial data: Drugmakers||German pharmaceutical giant Merck and a US partner reported promising results Saturday in trials of a drug administered orally to fight Covid-19, saying it helps reduce patients' viral load."At a time where there is unmet need for antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, we are encouraged by these preliminary data," said Wendy Painter, chief medical officer of the US firm, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.In January, Merck halted work on two Covid vaccine candidates but has pressed on with research into two products to treat the disease, including a pill-based one called molnupiravir, which it has developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.This drug caused a significant drop in patients' viral load after five days of treatment with it, Merck said at a meeting with infectious disease experts.This Phase 2a test -- drug trials have three stages before a product can be approved -- was carried out among 202 non-hospitalized people with symptoms of Covid-19.There was no alert in terms of safety, and of four serious adverse events that were reported, none were considered to be related to taking this drug, Ridgeback said.Anti-viral oral drugs such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are sometimes prescribed for seasonal flu but researchers have yet to come up with something similar to fight the coronavirus.The findings of this study -- a quicker decrease in viral load among individuals with early-stage Covid-19 who are treated with molnupiravir -- are promising, said William Fischer, lead investigator of the study and a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina."If supported by additional studies, (they) could have important public health implications, particularly as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to spread and evolve globally," Fischer added.Merck is also working on another oral Covid treatment called MK-711.Preliminary results from clinical trials with it show a more than 50 percent reduction in risk of death or respiratory trouble in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe Covid-19, the company said in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oral-covid-treatment-yields-promising-trial-data-drugmakers-101615075592729.html

We’re not,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, told an online briefing. “Countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.” Record Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Brazil this week and its hospital system is on the brink of collapse, driven partly by a more contagious variant first identified there.The US Senate narrowly approved a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill on Saturday. The chamber set a record in its longest single vote in the modern era at 11 hours and 50 minutes. The fight is not over as the bill needs to return to the House for the final approval.‘AstraZeneca effective against Brazil variant’Preliminary data from a study conducted at the University of Oxford indicates that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca is effective against the P1, or Brazilian, variant, a source with knowledge of the study told Reuters on Friday.The data indicates that the vaccine will not need to be modified in order to protect against the variant, which is believed to have originated in the Amazonian city of Manaus, said the source, who requested anonymity as the results have not yet been made public.

The 11-party opposition alliance — the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) —boycotted the assembly’s special session.Khan needed 172 votes to show a simple majority and dispel any suggestion he had lost the support of the majority of lawmakers in the National Assembly. In the National Assembly, the ruling Tehreek-e-Insaf Party has the support of 180 members, including 157 members from Khan’s party and 20 members from allied parties and two independents.Also read | Mutated Covid-19 variants responsible for spike in cases across EuropeThe need for the confidence vote arose after former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani in Senate elections on Wednesday defeated Hafeez Sheikh, the finance minister in Khan’s cabinet. The Senate vote was seen as a test for Khan, who came to power in the 2018 parliamentary elections. It boosted the number of Senate seats for the opposition, which has a slight, 53-47 majority over Khan and wants Khan to step down.Responding to the opposition demand, Khan decided to seek the vote of confidence.Addressing the House after securing the trust vote, the 68-year-old cricketer-turned politician thanked all lawmakers from his party and allies for supporting him.Top opposition leaders, however, demanded Khan’s resignation and holding of fresh elections. PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Pakistan Peoples Party leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the vote of confidence has no meaning.“This was not a confidence vote. We know which agencies watched the members of the assembly the entire night. [We know] who knocked on the doors of each member to ensure they were present,” Rehman said.His was referring to reports that said the government kept its members in lodges in Islamabad under strict watch so that all of them were present in parliament during the floor test.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz said Khan’s days as prime minister were numbered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-prime-minister-imran-khan-wins-trust-vote-101615055264249.html

07-03-2021||India||Women are not pleading, they’re leading: Smriti Irani||New Delhi: On the eve of the International Women’s Day, union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani spoke to HT on the challenges and opportunities the women have in the country, her role as a minister and the BJP’s battle axe against the Congress. Edited excerpts: We’re talking on the eve of the International Women’s Day. What’s your objective take on the status of women in our society?We’re at a point in our history where we’ve recognized that women not only have to be empowered but they, as citizens, must lead the change. For too long the empowerment narrative gave the impression that we were the weaker lot who needed additional support. More and more women--be they the younger age-bracket or those who have seen struggle--now know that all they needed was equal opportunity to compete, equal access to resources and credit and an acknowledgement of their achievement. When the Prime Minister speaks of women-led development, it’s a tectonic shift in narrative terms. Women are not pleading; they’re leading in all spheres of life.You may be right up to an extent. There are aberrations galore…I don’t say that there aren’t any challenges. The challenges have been aplenty before but today there’s an affirmation that irrespective of the challenges we can move towards change on the socio-political and economic front.Public outreach has to be there to sensitize the other gender. We’ve seen so many incidents (of violence against women)…. Our country has had an equal number of men who stood up for (gender) equality, who recognized the need to correct past wrongs. To paint all Indian men with one brush will be a disservice not only to the male gender but also to the female. Till such time that there’s recognition that both genders, for that matter all genders, need to work towards emancipation, I don’t think we’ll have a balanced outreach. Yes, there have been men who objectified women, who dissuaded women from reaching their full potential, who consistently broken the law, who ensured that women were kept away from resources and denied credit and respect. That said, there also have been men who stood shoulder to shoulder with their daughters, their wives. It’s a day also to acknowledge those men. You cannot look at all men in an inimical fashion.Nobody looks at them inimically. There’s a need to co-opt the other gender to empower our womenfolk.One of our achievements as a society has been that the gender narrative has acquired centrality. It’s not dismissed to the shadows, to just one day of celebration of international women’s day. There’s an affirmation: why only one day; why not apply yourself to solutions for women everyday; why not consistently celebrate the female potential?Your averments prompt the question: Women’s empowerment which is a much discussed issue in metropolitan India gets diluted as we move to million plus cities and the countryside.If you look at the political demography--- the voter turnout from 1962 to 2019--- it’s a matter of joy that the female participation has increased by 25-27 percent as compared to male voter turnout that’s up just about 7-8 percent. That predominantly has happened in rural areas. The trend shows an engaged voter consciousness among women. Many surveys and analysis brought to the fore that women have started voting on issues of development, infrastructure, security and the promises kept. What researchers call the sticky-ness factor showed that women stood steadfast with political organisations/representatives who delivered on issues of governance and development. It shows the maturity of the understanding women have of policies. Why’s it that stringent penal provisions against rape and other forms of violence against women, haven’t been a good enough deterrent….Deterrence comes from firm application of the law; by ensuring that investigation is speeded up. It comes with access to evidence-based justice, not justice which dis-balances (sic) the scale just because a decision has to be given in favour of a woman. There has been legislation which made the law more stringent; there’s effort as much to recognize that investigative and judicial processes need equal strengthening. Under the Nirbhaya fund we pronounced establishment of over one thousand fast-track courts especially in districts where the volume of crime against women and POCSO related cases was going up. That was a targeted intervention to support judicial processes additionally with funds. Looking at data from states, we’ve supported with funds police stations that do not have a women’s help desk. There’s a follow up by the MHA on these aspects. For the first time, we took steps to ensure that there’s an anti-human trafficking unit in each district of the country. The PM was insistent on ensuring that there’s a one-stop crisis centre in every district. West Bengal made the exception of not coming along on that process. But we today have 700 functional one-stop crisis centers that provide under one roof, medico-legal and police help to women victims. There’s a national emergency number (112). Its response time is less than 15 minutes. The emergency network replied to crores of calls in collaboration with state governments. Laws come into play after the incidents. Isn’t prevention the key?The national education policy which came to fruition after three decades has, for the first time, a gender-inclusion fund. It empowers the states fiscally by ensuring that there is money behind including gender not only up to grade VIII of education but also in enhancing the gender component in higher education. When we talk about societal change, we also have to focus on empowerment through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Six years ago when I began the conversation about women in science, particularly STEM, the first steps I took (as education minister), with the PM’s blessings, was to have a woman lead the IIT council. Till 2014, we had never had a female lead the council! I remember walking into a room full of men and look at some of the most celebrated scientific minds and IIT leaders. I asked why there wasn’t woman in the room. They looked at me and said: don’t you suffice? I said I’m not the scientist or the technical mind. To that, a very celebrated scientist replied: well, we don’t have many women. Thereafter, I remember walking out of that room and calling Tessy Thomas, the lady who was with Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, working on the missile programme. I told her: Tessy, would you accept my invite to lead the IIT council? She obviously accepted because she’s a very conscientious woman in science. When I met her, she said: Smriti, nobody ever thought of me before. So it’s not that women do not exist in terms of competencies, it’s just that they don’t get recognized. That’s particularly challenging for women who don’t come from a pedigreed position.That makes all the more important the need for the promised (33 per cent) quota for women in Parliament and state assemblies. Your party now has the legislative strength to make it a happen. I was in the Rajya Sabha when it passed the women’s reservation bill (in 2008). The UPA (then in power) was in disarray on the issue. There was absolutely no support the Congress party had on it. Our leadership stood up and said they’d support the passage of the Bill-- and we did! Apart from the fact that the BJP is steadfast in its commitment for passing the Bill, what fascinates me--- when I speak of pedigreed women--- that there’s that nuance and bias even in politics. We have today 1.3 million women serving in our panchayats. It seems we never consider them politically potent enough to be mentioned. There’s a report that comes out every year on gender inequality index. When I took position as WCD minister, asked: do they consider these women at the panchayat level when they describe the process of political empowerment, when they speak (on international platforms) about women in positions of power? It was saddening to find that they weren’t recognised. When we talk of women in politics, one of the toughest jobs is to lead the panchayat, to be the sarpanch or the zilla panchayat head. We do a great disservice to women’s political talent when we don’t recognize that. It’s time that we gave equal importance to the prowess of women in panchayats. When the WCD ministry team sat down with the 15th finance commission, I told Mr N K Singh that we never had devolution of funds with a gender lens. They put it up in their suggestions to the government. I’m happy that for the first time, multi-sectoral/ multi-agency fiscal transfers will have gender as a consistent facet. It has never happened in any other country; it has happened for the first time in India. That too ought to be recognized and celebrated.You didn’t address the core of my question— the likelihood of women’s reservation bill getting passed.Has the BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi ever shied away from its pronouncements in the manifesto? Aren’t Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi evidence enough? My party is resolute in its support of the bill. On the International Women’s Day, let’s also celebrate the potential of that woman who steps out of her home to take poll position as a sarpanch. They also need your attention. Yours has been a long journey to politics from issue-based television and the entertaining industry. Has that helped? I don’t why but I’m the only female politician who’s also recognized by her former vocation. It never happened to any other woman who possibly was a professional in another sphere and had come into politics. I recognize the bias in that. When you say oh, she used to be an actor you indicate that she possibly is not very serious on issues of policy and administration. It becomes that inflection point that helps to dismiss her capacities, her potential….. It becomes interesting when you look at the fact that as education minister, I made the first ever national ranking framework. Is there any recognition accorded to me for it? I conducted the largest ever consultation on education policy in our democracy. Would I get any kind of acceptance for that? On the PM’s direction, I created a network that had some of the best academicians from the world over, coming to India and teaching in government institutions. Under the PM’s leadership, we started a project called Imprint that brought together all research bodies, dedicating research to what India needs in the next decade and a half. It was dedicated to the country by then President Pranab Mukherjee. So it’s easier to dismiss the administrative capacity of Smriti Irani if you refer to her as former actor; to dismiss maybe what happened in I&B (ministry) where I processed the amalgamation of institutions working in silos. In the textile ministry we not only made India self reliant in PPE manufacturing but became the second largest exporter in the world in just three months? Absolutely it’s easy to dismiss Smriti Irani because you can just tag her as a former actress and not look at her administrative potential or contribution. There’s an incessant need (sic) to tag my previous vocation with my current avatar as a politician because otherwise, how can you reduce my capacities?  Your past is remembered because you were as a popular television person. Didn’t Sachin Tendulkar remain the champion cricketer and Lata Mangeshkar the legendary singer, as members of the Rajya Sabha? They never did policy….none of them did policyYou’re the BJP’s battle axe against the Congress and the Gandhis. There’s story recounted in a book on the Amethi election you won. It says, you turned away a local politician who at a meeting with you, used low-brow language for Priyanka Vadra. Is that true? When does the woman in you take over from the politician? The presumption is wrong if you think that they are in any way separate. I’ve never been afforded the same courtesy, be it Ms Vadra or her immediate friends circle or Mr (Rahul) Gandhi (and) his political positioning and support to men who sexually objectified me, mocked me or made explicit comments about me. I have not been afforded that compliment, that particular respect by the (Gandhi) siblings. That’s what makes me different from them. My value system is such that irrespective of the muck that they’ve thrown my way; irrespective of the explicit trolling, which was sexually very, very loaded, that their echo system unleashed against me, when it came to be measured it seems that I was a better woman. So, the incident happened…I will not comment because I’ve not read the book….I don’t understand why my politics has to be tugged to a star that’s drowning. My politics is much beyond the rambling siblings. I’ve spent a few years as an Opposition member as well. On the POCSO legislation I spoke on behalf of the entire Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 2013, I was a prominent speaker on the sexual harassment at workplace bill, not only from the Opposition but also the middle benches. When Meira Kumar was Speaker, I represented the Asia-Pacific region on the Syrian crisis in the International Parliamentary Union. I’m saying this today because, like I said, if a woman does not come from a pedigreed position, she’d be denied public recognition of her achievements. There wasn’t even a murmur when the world economic forum announced me as a young global leader in 2015. If some twiddling siblings were recognized with even a normal domestic award, there would’ve been much hoopla about it. As a minister I’ve spoken on issues which a BJP member wouldn’t conventionally be outspoken about. I stood up for women irrespective of ideologies and politics. I’m grateful that my party never admonished me for standing up for the value system that I hold dear.Mamata Banerjee made the grade without being pedigreed. But you’d be campaigning against her as WCD minister in the upcoming Bengal polls.Do you see the bias in your question? Would you ask a man to show deference to another man against whom he’s competing? I’m asking because she’s the only sitting woman CM in our country… That’s where the bias is. Why would you presume that a woman would not live up to the expectations of her organization or her politics by competing fairly? Why am I supposed to defer to a woman from another political ideology-- just because I’m a woman-- and do disservice to my ideology and my party? Isn’t there something that you admire in Mamata Banerjee as a fellow politician and a woman?  I’m mindful of you seeking compliments (for Mamata) to bring a new twist to the campaign. But I will desist and tell you why. If she wants to use the women’s card, then why does she refuse to implement the one-stop crisis center that’ll help in every district the women who are victims of violence? Why’s she not implementing processes which will help better nutritional facilities for women and children? If she wants to use the gender card, she must do it holistically and answer why women (and children) in West Bengal will be denied protection, nutrition or administrative services that women across the country have been given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-are-not-pleading-they-re-leading-smriti-irani-101615138033200.html

Aircraft doesn't know whether it's a male or female officer who is flying it. It is the journey to sit in the aircraft that says everything -- whether we will be able to do it or not,” she said. Her statement comes months after the controversy over actor Janhvi Kapoor starrer ‘Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl.’ Delhi High Court had in October last year refused to pass any interim order to restrain the streaming of the film based on allegations by the Centre that the Netflix film depicts the IAF in poor light and dents its image. In recent years, many women have been seen performing leading roles in the defence sector. In January, flight lieutenant Bhawana Kanth became the first woman fighter pilot to take part in the Republic Day parade. She was part of the Indian Air Force's (IAF's) tableau that displayed mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30 fighter plane. Kanth had joined the fighter squadron in November 2017 and flew the first solo on MiG-21 Bison in March 2018. At present, she is posted at an airbase in Rajasthan where she flies the MiG-21 Bison fighter plane.During the Budget Session in Parliament last month, the government informed that the headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years. There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aircraft-doesn-t-know-if-man-or-woman-officer-is-flying-it-iaf-s-shaliza-dhami-101615136397375.html

07-03-2021||India||Goa Cong says Centre's new OCI notification will 'finish Goans working abroad'||In a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Girish Chodankar on Sunday said the 'draconian Overseas Citizens of India (OCI)' notification issued by the Union Home Ministry will 'finish the hard working Goans abroad'.Addressing a press conference here, Chodankar said that since coming to power, the ruling BJP government in the state "is all out to sell Goa to crony capitalists friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the three linear projects, Railway Double Tracking and Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP)."The Congress leader said the Union Ministry of Home Affairs' (MHA) notification issued on March 4 dramatically altered the status of OCIs (including Non-Resident Goans)."The notification issued under Section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955, supersedes three earlier notifications issued during the UPA Government's time and laid down the rights of the OCIs. The new notification humiliates and illegally classifies OCIs as "foreign nationals" and introduces a series of new restrictions that dramatically curtails the rights and liberties of OCIs of India," said Chodankar. He alleged that the Central government is working on the behest of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and implementing their ideologies to create more troubles for people."They together want to sell Goa to crony capitalist friends of PM Modi," the Congress leader claimed.Further attacking Chief Minister Pramod Sawant-led government in the state, he said "Goa government is not able to give jobs to the people of this state, hence our youths find jobs overseas. This new notification will disconnect them with Goa and also will create hurdles to send money, by creating a wall of bureaucracy, to their families. Hence this notification should be immediately withdrawn as it will further collapse the economy."Chodankar further claimed that non-resident Goans abroad will now not be able to send money to their families in India without having to go through the hardships of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations."Goan OCIs, especially those with Portuguese passports, will not be able to participate in religious activities such as organizing feasts and donating to temples, churches, mosques and gurudwaras in Goa," he said."I want to remind the BJP Government that the OCI privileges were a gift and a right extended to the Goans overseas from Indian National Congress. Congress Party had implemented the concept not to just give people of Indian origin with foreign national citizenship a right-filled pass to participate in the future of their country of origin but was the first experimental step towards dual citizenship where people like Goans with Portuguese passports would be able to vote in elections in India," he added.He further claimed that after the new notification, children of OCIs will not be able to study in India at par with other Indian citizens."Goans children residing abroad wishing to study in IITs, IIMs, AIIMS will not be able to do so anymore, claimed Girish Chodankar... This bill does not just deny people of Indian origin living abroad their lifelong wish of dual citizenship, it severs the legal and emotional link they have to their motherland," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cong-says-centre-s-new-oci-notification-will-finish-goans-working-abroad-101615130775574.html
07-03-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan says India is in the endgame of Covid-19 pandemic||"We are in the end game of the COVID-19 pandemic in India" and to succeed at this stage, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said, politics should be kept out the Covid-19 vaccination drive.He said people should trust the science behind vaccines and ensure that their near and dear ones get vaccinated on time.Speaking at the Delhi Medical Association's (DMA's) 62nd Annual Delhi State Medical Conference (MEDICON 2021) in collaboration with Dharamshila Narayana Hospital on Sunday, Vardhan said over 2 crore Covid-19 vaccine shots have been administered so far and the vaccination rate has been increased to 15 lakhs per day. Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "Unlike most other countries, we have a steady supply of COVID-19 vaccines that are safe with proven immunogenicity and efficacy. Based on the initial results, these Made in India vaccines have shown some of the lowest adverse events following immunization (AEFI) anywhere in the world," he said.Vardhan asserted that today children in the entire world need to be vaccinated against poliomyelitis only because Pakistan and Afghanistan failed to eradicate this disease from their respective countries, the statement said."Similarly, India cannot be safe from coronavirus and COVID19 if rest of the world continues to be unsafe, which is why it is essential to curb COVID-19 vaccine nationalism. "If poor and underdeveloped countries continue to harbour the novel coronavirus, we shall not be able to ensure safety for all. A fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine is the biggest need of the hour," he said.Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India, has emerged as the world's pharmacy, and it supplied 5.51 crore Covid-19 vaccines to 62 different countries, he said."At a time of global crisis, under the leadership of Modi Ji, India has emerged as an example to the world in international cooperation," he was quoted as saying in the statement."It was Modi ji's insistence that COVID-19 vaccines should be provided with no strings attached, and the countries without the vaccine supply should not be taken advantage of at the time of a global humanitarian crisis," he said.Looking at the possibility of eradication of Covid-19 in India, Vardhan said, "We are in the end game of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, and to succeed at this stage, we need to follow 3 steps: Keep politics out of the COVID-19 vaccination drive, trust the science behind COVID-19 vaccines, and ensure our near and dear ones get vaccinated on time.”The government has already involved private players in Covid-19 vaccination, and if hospitals want, they can conduct vaccination 24x7, the minister said."My request to everyone is that just like people embraced 'Jan Andolan for COVID-19 appropriate behaviour', they should embrace Jan Andolan for COVID-19 vaccination and get all COVID-19 vaccine shots whenever they are eligible," he said. Delhi Medical Association (DMA) honoured Vardhan for his contribution to the medical fraternity and outstanding service and exemplary work during the Covid-19 pandemic, the health Ministry said in a statement. Healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers, not just in this room, but across India, rose to the occasion and sacrificed not only their time with family, but also their own mental, physical and emotional health for this beloved nation, Vardhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-says-india-is-in-the-endgame-of-covid-19-pandemic-101615128329364.html

Most are in ramshackle camps on the border with Bangladesh.Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign.Rohingyas living in Jammu said they were concerned about the weekend's detentions and the threat of deportation."We will go back when peace returns to our country," said Sufeera, 28, who said her uncle and brother had been sent to the holding centre, leaving her alone with her children.Another refugee, 48-year-old Sadiq, said members of his family had also been detained."We have been told that we will be deported," he said. "They took mother and father ... Who will take care of them?".India rejects a United Nations position that deporting the Rohingya violates the principle of refoulement – sending refugees back to a place where they face danger.Rohingyas staying in India have said conditions are not conducive for them to return to Myanmar after fleeing violence and persecution over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohingyas-in-jammu-fear-deportation-to-myanmar-after-police-detain-over-150-101615127578656.html

07-03-2021||India||Activist withdraws complaint that led to Ramesh Jarkiholi’s resignation||Dinesh Kalahalli, a self proclaimed social activist, on Sunday withdrew his earlier complaint of sexual harassment and exploitation against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator and former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi.In a letter to the Cubbon Park police station, Kalahalli said that the complaint had taken a sinister turn wherein the character of the alleged victim was being questioned."If the cloth falls on a thorn or a thorn falls on a cloth, only the cloth tears," Kalahalli said in his letter to emphasise on the reports raising questions on the victim's character.Kalahalli could not be reached for comment.The activist's complaint on March 2 had forced Jarkiholi on the back foot and he eventually resigned from chief minister BS Yediyurappa's cabinet.A video of what appears to be Jarkiholi getting physically intimate with an unnamed woman was played by Kannada TV news channels. A phone call allegedly between the Jarkiholi and the unnamed woman was also being played repeatedly.In one such call, a person believed to be Jarkiholi is heard stating that Yediyirurappa was indulging in corruption.Jarkiholi was among the 17 legislators who had defected from the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019 and helped Yediyurappa come to power."This is a big political conspiracy to defame Ramesh Jarkiholi, our family and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)," Balachandra Jarkiholi, a BJP legislator and Ramesh Jarkiholi’s brother said on Sunday.He said that there were two main conspirators and seven others backing themHe alleged the conspirators had paid around ₹15 crore to upload the video from Russia and that seven servers were used for this.He added that they would consult legal experts to discuss the way forward.Balachandra also said that it was possible that Kalahalli was also "misguided" by the main conspirators.Balachandra first said that this was a possible case of honey trapping, possibly implying that his brother Ramesh was indeed the man in the video.He later said that the video itself was "100%" fake that was edited and stitched together with the help of the latest technology..Since the complaint, Kalahalli has kept a low profile and is reported to have shared very minimal details with the police about the alleged victim or her family.Since the video of Ramesh Jarkiholi, at least six other ministers from the Yediyurappa government have approached the courts seeking injunctions against the publishing or broadcasting of any material that may be considered defamatory.The six ministers are K.Sudhakar, Narayana Gowda, Shivaram Hebbar, BC Patil, Byrathi Basavaraj and ST Somashekar. All seven, including Jarkiholi, were among the 17 turncoats who defected to the BJP and were made ministers by Yediyurappa.The incident has left Yediyurappa in a tough spot as he had taken it upon himself personally to placate the turncoats into his cabinet as a reward for helping him to power for a record fourth term as chief minister.The scandal involving Jarkiholi had left the BJP red-faced in Karnataka, further pushing them into a corner ahead of the budget, scheduled to be presented on March 8.Balachandra Jarkiholi also said that this case should be given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) since the video was allegedly uploaded on YouTube from Russia.He also said that the home and law minister were preparing a draft law to punish people who use fake cases to blackmail eminent citizens.The case also gave more ammunition to the opposition to attack the Yediyurappa government.Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy had said that there was an alleged exchange of ₹5 crore in the scandal.His predecessor from the Congress, Siddaramaiah said that the case can be withdrawn but the video of the former minister (Ramesh Jarkiholi) was there for everyone to see.Ramesh Jarkiholi has kept a low profile since the complaint but it remains to be seen if Yediyurappa can reinstate the leader into his cabinet or wait till the case runs its course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-withdraws-complaint-that-led-to-ramesh-jarkiholi-s-resignation-101615125833785.html

07-03-2021||India||Delhi entering endemic phase of Covid-19, pandemic phase over: Satyandar Jain||The national Capital is witnessing a spike in the number of daily Covid-19 infections in March, but the situation is not yet worrying, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday. The pandemic stage of Covid-19 in the Capital is ending and the endemic stage is going to begin, the health minister said.When a disease becomes natural and permanent to a region or population, it is called endemic. Pandemic refers to a global epidemic spread across continents. What Delhi's health minister implies is that Delhi is past that time when the city was importing cases from outside and the infection was spreading at a rapid rate putting immense pressure on the healthcare system.Delhi reports less than 300 new Covid-19 cases after 2 days, active cases up slightly"Coronavirus is nearing an endemic phase in Delhi. Experts say some cases continue to occur in the endemic phase. Delhi witnessed a swine flu outbreak around 10 years ago, but still some cases are reported every year. Coronavirus is not going to end completely... we will have to learn to live with it," Jain said, as quoted by news agency PTI.However, the Union health ministry lists Delhi as one of those eight states which are displaying an upward trajectory in daily cases.Since January, Delhi's daily number of infections remained within 250. On February 26, the Capital recorded 256 new infections — the highest in February. Since March 2, the cases are on the rise. On March 1, there were 175 new infections. On March 2, the figure shot up to 217, to only further to 240 on March 3. On March 4, the Capital recorded 261 cases, more than February's highest, and on March 5, Delhi reported the highest daily cases in the last one-and-a-half month, with 312 cases. On March 6, the number further hiked to 321. On Sunday, the number again dropped and settled at 286.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-entering-endemic-phase-of-covid-19-pandemic-phase-over-satyandar-jain-101615123649352.html
07-03-2021||India||Bihar police suspend 2 cops for forcing man to walk with son’s body for 3 km||The Bihar police on Sunday suspended two policemen who forced a man to carry the decomposed body of his teenage son in a plastic bag for a distance of 3 km on foot to reach the nearest police station in Katihar district and denied him an ambulance to reach Bhagalpur Sadar hospital for postmortem.The suspended police officers are sub-inspector of Gopalpur police station Rajdeo Raman and assistant sub-inspector of Kursela police station, who had refused the man a vehicle to carry his son’s body for postmortem.On February 26, the 13-year-old boy Hariom Yadav had fallen down from a boat while crossing the Ganga near Tintanga under Gopalpur police station of Naugachhia police district, but his body could not be traced.On March 3, the boy’s decomposed body was found in Kharia Ganga ghat under Kuresala police station. On getting information, policemen from Kursela and Gopalpur police stations arrived at the spot. The victim’s father Teju Yadav also arrived at the spot and identified the body.However, the police teams reportedly did not take the matter seriously and left the scene without taking possession of the body for autopsy.The police headquarters swung into action after the matter went viral on social media following which a DSP rank officer was asked to investigate the whole matter, people familiar with the development said.The investigation revealed a hapless Teju Yadav managed to procure a plastic bag to carry his son’s body and walked 3 km to reach the Kursela police station where he was subsequently referred to Bhagalpur Sadar hospital for post mortem. His pleas to the policemen for arranging a vehicle or ambulance fell on deaf ears. Yadav eventually made his own arrangements to take the body to Bhagalpur for autopsy.On Sunday, the police headquarters suspended sub-inspectors Rajdeo Raman of Gopalpur police station and Nand Lal Choudhary of Kursela police station on charges of dereliction of duty.“When the matter came to light a probe was ordered. The SDPO (Sadar), Katihar had found allegations against the two officials true on which basis the suspension has been made with immediate effect,” ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-suspend-2-cops-for-forcing-man-to-walk-with-son-s-body-for-3-km-101615123309987.html
07-03-2021||India||FICCI's Overall Business Confidence Index has witnessed a decadal high of 74.2||FICCI's Overall Business Confidence Index has witnessed a decadal high of 74.2 in the current round on account of improvement in present conditions as well as expectations, the industry body said on Sunday.The Index had stood at 70.9 in the previous survey and 59 a year ago, noted the survey. It revealed recovery of demand conditions, improved capacity utilisation and a promising outlook on various operational parameters.With regard to the constraining factors for business, the demand situation has improved on back of the release of the pent-up demand build up during the lockdown.However, rising raw material costs is emerging as a bothersome factor for members of India Inc. The rise in fuel and other commodity prices is beginning to exert pressure on the input costs of companies, FICCI stated on the survey.Companies participating in the survey cited high input costs including man power costs, weak demand conditions and lack of availability of affordable credit as their top-most concerns for the year 2021. A near-unanimity was observed as far as input costs were concerned. This along with high interest costs on loans, higher inward and outward transport and logistics costs, greater compliance burden on the back of frequently changing statutory compliances and increased manpower costs are further pushing the cost of doing business in India, FICCI stated.Also read: ‘Haryana’s quota for jobs will spell disaster for state’, says FicciThis does not bode well in the current environment wherein a shift in global supply chains is being witnessed, it added."In this context, respondents also added that leaving trade policy issues unaddressed will create an even bigger challenge with China as well as other countries including Vietnam regaining market share to become global suppliers."Lack of adequate export incentives is also making it difficult for Indian entrepreneurs to compete globally," the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) stated.Improvement in conditions as well as expectations have pulled the Overall Business Confidence Index value to a decadal high in the current survey, FICCI said.The Union Budget 2021-22 has been forward looking, said FICCI.This, together with measures announced as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, has infused optimism among industry members and the same is corroborated in the improved outlook for various operational parameters, it added.Improved economic conditions and greater pricing power are likely to drive profits of corporate India over the next two quarters. The percentage of participants citing higher profits over next six months increased to 36 per cent in the latest survey from 33 per cent respondents stating likewise in the previous round, the survey showed.Outlook on employment and exports also reported a discernible improvement, as about 35 per cent respondents were optimistic about better hiring prospects over the next two quarters, up from 22 per cent stating the same in the previous round.Export prospects were reported to be better in the current round with 41 per cent respondents, indicating higher outbounds shipments. The corresponding number in the previous round was 27 per cent.Furthermore, the proportion of respondents citing 'higher to much higher' investments in the coming six months witnessed an upswing in the current survey when compared to the previous round.With demand situation slowly turning positive, an improvement was also noticed in capacity utilisation rates. In the current survey, around 77 per cent participating companies reported capacity utilisation of more than 50 per cent, compared with 68 per cent stating likewise in the previous round.Companies expect higher export orders in the coming months on the back of global economic recovery led by large scale vaccination drive against Covid-19 around the world.Respondents emphasised that given the current global sentiment, India could easily become the preferred sourcing destination for western countries if adequate and timely steps taken to support this change.In addition, companies stressed the need for reducing customs duty on imports to curtail rising domestic prices of raw materials. Commodity prices have risen drastically in the past few weeks and this is impacting profitability and viability of business.Participants highlighted that restrictions on imports must be removed at least until India achieves some level of self reliance in production of industrial inputs such as components and parts.The current survey drew responses from a wide array of sectors and was conducted during January and February this year. It gauges expectations for the period January to June 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ficcis-overall-business-confidence-index-has-witnessed-a-decadal-high-of-742-101615118997918.html
07-03-2021||India||Satellite set for Mar 28 launch will provide near real time images of borders, quick monitoring of natural disasters||India plans to launch on March 28 an earth observation satellite that will provide it near real-time images of its borders and also enable quick monitoring of natural disasters. GISAT-1 is slated to be lofted into space by GSLV-F10 rocket from Sriharikota spaceport in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore district, about 100 kms north of Chennai. "We are looking to launch this Geo imaging satellite on March 28, subject to weather conditions", an official of the Bengaluru-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) told PTI on Sunday. The rocket will place the spacecraft in a geosynchronous orbit. It will be subsequently positioned in geostationary orbit, about 36,000 kms above earth's equator, using its onboard propulsion system. The launch of GISAT-1 onboard GSLV-F10 rocket was originally planned for March 5 last year but postponed a day before the blast-off due to technical reasons. Experts said positioning the state-of-the-art agile earth observation satellite in geostationary orbit has key advantages. "It's going to be a game-changer in some sense for India", a Department of Space official said. "With onboard high resolution cameras, the satellite will allow the country to monitor the Indian land mass and the oceans, particularly its borders continuously." Listing the objectives of the mission, ISRO has earlier said the satellite would provide near real-time imaging of the large area region of interest at frequent intervals. It would help in quick monitoring of natural disasters, episodic and any short-term events. The third objective is to obtain spectral signatures of agriculture, forestry, mineralogy, disaster warning, cloud properties, snow and glacier and oceanography. GISAT-1 will facilitate near real-time observation of the Indian sub-continent, under cloud-free condition, at frequent intervals, ISRO said. The planned launch of GISAT-1, weighing about 2,268 kg, comes close on the heels of the successful February 28 PSLV- C51 mission that orbited Brazil's earth observation satellite Amazonia-1 and 18 co-passengers, including five built by students. Secretary in the Department of Space and ISRO Chairman K Sivan told PTI last week that the technical issues that led to postponement of GISAT-1 mission have been resolved and the further delay in the launch was due to Covid-19-induced lockdown which affected normal work.According to sources, GISAT-1 will be followed by the maiden flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, ISRO's compact launcher, likely in April. SSLV has been designed to meet "launch on demand" requirements in a cost-effective manner for small satellites in a dedicated and ride-share mode. It is a three-stage all solid vehicle with a capability to launch up to 500 kg satellite mass into 500 km low earth orbit (LEO) and 300 kg into Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). By comparison, PSLV -- the workhorse launch vehicle of ISRO -- can take up to 1,750 kg payload into SSO of 600 km altitude. With lower per kg launch cost, the mini launcher will have multiple satellite mounting options for nano, micro and small satellites. Sivan had earlier termed the SSLV an innovative vehicle which can be assembled in just 72 hours. "Instead of 60 days (for building a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be assembled in three days; instead of 600 people (needed to build a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be done by six people", he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-set-for-mar-28-launch-will-provide-near-real-time-images-of-borders-quick-monitoring-of-natural-disasters-101615122664849.html

07-03-2021||India||Farm laws made for farmers or for Modi’s ‘kharabpati’ friends?: Priyanka Gandhi||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday continued to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Centre over the farmers’ agitation against the government’s three farm laws. Addressing a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi questioned whether the laws were drafted for the farmers or for PM Modi’s ‘kharabpati’ (trillionaire) friends. The protest against the new laws has been going on for more than 100 days with farmers camping at several border points in Delhi since November 26 last year.“Today 100 days are over, lakhs of farmers have been stationed at several border points in Delhi… If these farm laws were made for you, then why are you still stationed here?” Gandhi asked during the gathering.Reiterating her previous point that the Prime Minister never spoke to the protesters in Delhi, Gandhi alleged that Modi was not visiting any border points in the Capital because he did not respect the farmers. His government did not work for them or the citizens and was only functioning in the interests of the industrialists and trillionaires, she added.ये जो 3 कानून हैं..ये क्या आपके (किसान) भलाई के लिए बनाएं गए हैं या मोदी जी के खरबपति मित्रों के भलाई के लिए बनाएं गए हैं? आज 100 दिन पूरे हो गए हैं,लाखों किसान बॉर्डर पर बैठें हैं..अगर ये कानून आपके लिए बनाया गया है तो आप में से लाखों लोग बॉर्डर पर क्यों बैठे हैं?:प्रियंका गांधी https://t.co/2BrTkCA4c2 pic.twitter.com/XYMicaTk1U“Shouldn’t the Prime Minister and the Centre show respect to the protesting farmers who have been camping in Delhi? Are they (farmers) so worthless that you can’t even meet them?” Gandhi asked. She pointed out that the farmers stayed determined to their cause despite surviving in harsh weather conditions and facing electricity cuts at protest sites but the Centre still thinks that it should not meet them.As the movement against the farm laws completed 100 days, the Congress party said on Saturday that this period was a ‘black chapter’ in the country’s democracy due to the way in which the protesters were being treated and it also marked 100 days of the Centre’s arrogance. Several party leaders including Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Randeep Surjewala etc. used the hashtag #100DaysOfBJParrogance on Twitter to highlight the plight of the farmers and the Centre’s arrogant approach towards them.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar once again appealed to the farmers on Saturday by saying that the Centre was committed to their welfare and was ready to make amendments to the new laws. Tomar added that the new laws were passed to boost investment in the agriculture sector and give independence to the farmers to sell their produce anywhere and at any price. Accusing the opposition parties of doing politics over this issue, Tomar said that they were doing this at the cost of the country’s agriculture economy and were also hurting the interests of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-made-for-farmers-or-for-modi-s-kharabpati-friends-priyanka-gandhi-101615120140506.html

He also appreciated the medical and paramedical institutes being run by the ESIC for their role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.During the ceremony, the vice president was glad to see that all the medal winners were girls.He congratulated them and underlined the need to provide equal opportunities to women in every field.Also read: Budget session of Parliament likely to be cut short due to assembly polls"I have always believed that if you serve humanity with a spirit of selfless dedication, you will derive boundless satisfaction," he told the passing out students.Referring to the largest vaccination drive in the world against Covid-19 being undertaken in India, the vice president said the worst phase of the pandemic appears to be over.However, he cautioned people to remain vigilant and continue to take all the necessary precautions till the country defeats the virus decisively.In his address, Naidu also referred to several other health challenges that need to be addressed such as low doctor-patient ratio, shortage of medical colleges, inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, and low adoption of health insurance.Expressing concern over high out-of-pocket expenditure on health in India, Naidu called for ensuring quality healthcare for all at affordable rates.The vice president praised ESIC for running India's largest social security programme covering roughly 10 per cent of the country's population.Naidu also appreciated ESIC for several new initiatives such as MoU with the National Health Authority (NHA) wherein the beneficiaries of the ESI scheme in selected districts can access services at Ayushman Bharat-empanelled hospitals. He also appreciated the ESIC's initiative to open its underutilised hospitals to the general public on a nominal user charge basis.Naidu also expressed satisfaction over India emerging as an attractive medical tourism hub in the region due to its state-of-the-art facilities and highly skilled professionals.On this occasion, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said, "A historic task of amalgamating 44 labour laws into four codes. After the implementation of the Code on Social Security 2020, which is one of those codes, Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) services would be expanded to all districts in the country."Labour Secretary Apurva Chandra said the ESIC would cover unorganised workers including gig and platform workers under its social security ambit.Gig and platform workers are those workers that work outside of traditional employers and employees relationship.

He had fasted a record 194 days from October 14, 2018 till May 4, 2019 on similar demands for prohibition on quarrying and hydropower projects.His last agitation lasted 41 days in February-March 2020 prior to the lockdown imposition when he sat on agitation in support of Sadhvi Padmavati, another disciple of Swami Shivanand Saraswati, who also staged 100 days of agitation last year demanding a ban on quarrying.Prior to Brahamchari in October 2018, Sant Gopal Das had also started fast unto death agitation at Matri Sadan ashram, within hours of the demise of Gyan Swarup Sanand, a former Indian Institute of Technology professor.Swami Sanand had started his fast on June 20, 2018 demanding total ban on quarrying, removal of all stone crushers from Ganga river bed, stopping of hydropower projects on the eco-sensitive zone of Bhagirathi, Alaknanda and Ganga. He died after 112 days on October 11, 2018.On the same demands another Matri Sadan seer Swami Nigmanand had died on June 13, 2011 after 114 days of indefinite fast carried at Matri Sadan ashram which brought global attention towards illegal quarrying and the ill effects of hydro power projects on Ganga and ecology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seer-on-fast-for-closure-of-all-hydel-power-projects-on-ganga-writes-to-pm-modi-101615118659282.html
07-03-2021||India||Delhi Fire Services plan tech overhaul, reduce response time, improve efficiency||From GPS-enabled computer systems for automatically redirecting calls to area fire stations to equipping firefighting vehicles with tablets and WiFi for receiving instructions from control rooms in real-time, the Delhi Fire Service is planning a technology overhaul to reduce response time and increase efficiency.The National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the National e-Governance Division (NeGD) have been asked to study the working of the fire department and accordingly give suggestions to modernise its functioning, officials said on Sunday.Last month, a proposal in this regard was discussed at a meeting. For the NIC-NeGD study, a survey has been carried out and a report is awaited, they said."We are in the process of modernising our way of functioning. But it's in the initial stage currently. We have given an expression of interest and asked the NIC and the NeGD to conduct a study on the working of the fire department," a senior Delhi Fire Service (DFS) official said.Following their study, the NIC and the NeGD will suggest the DFS ways to modernise its functioning using technology in an effective manner to increase efficiency for quicker response, he said.Citing an example, the fire service official said the department has been using basic technology when it comes to dispatching fire tenders to the spot of incident. Dispatching, among many protocols, includes determining the shortest route to the place of incident, he said."So, we are planning to introduce GPS-enabled systems in the DFS' control room, so that any distress call can be directly received by the system, which will also guide the nearest fire station to that particular fire call. Fire tenders, accordingly, will be dispatched from the fire station concerned," the official said.Currently, the central control room receives calls on helplines and a department staffer logs in details of a distress call, including location, in a register. However, when the new computer systems are in place, details of a caller like the person's location will automatically get saved in the system, he said.In case the call gets disconnected, the caller can be contacted again as all details will be recorded digitally, the official said.The DFS said that WiFi-enabled IP address cameras and computer tablets are also likely to be installed in fire tenders.The camera and the tablet will be connected with the central control room so that it can automatically guide firefighting crews to the spot of incident by suggesting the shortest routes. This will lead to quicker response, the fire department said."The idea behind fitting cameras in fire vehicles is that it will help us to keep track of them. In case a fire tender is stuck in traffic, we can mobilise fire tenders from other nearest fire stations. The camera feed will also help those at the control room judge the intensity of a fire and accordingly, strategise and deploy resources," the official said.He said that currently when a distress call is received, a fire station alerts its crew by sounding a siren, but with tablets attached to fire tenders, the device will automatically get an alert from the control room.The in-charge of the fire tender and its crew will also receive SMS about the location of the call and can be guided to it with details of the shortest route.In addition, through the process of data mining, all raw data generated through the system can be used for analysing and identifying hotspots from where the highest number of fire calls are received and to further study the reasons behind high number of incidents, the Delhi Fire Service said.Through modernisation, the fire department also hopes to minimise human interface as much possible to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, DFS officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-fire-services-plan-tech-overhaul-reduce-response-time-improve-efficiency-101615112446473.html

He said tribal communities do not discriminate on the basis of gender, and hence their male to female sex ratio is better than that of the general population."There is no discrimination between men and women, and that is why the sex ratio in these communities was better than the general population," said Kovind.Kovind said being at the meet especially reminded him of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was born in Madhya Pradesh, and during whose tenure the ministry of tribal affairs was created.“Born in Madhya Pradesh, former Prime Minister, Bharat-Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji, I am particularly reminded of him today because it was during his tenure as Prime Minister that a separate 'ministry of tribal affairs' was formed in the Central Government,” said the President.Kovind heralded the tribal communities as guardians and protectors of this country’s natural resources, saying that if they hadn’t protected the wealth of the forest from being exploited by the British, with their courage and valour, exploitation would have occurred on a much larger scale.The President also talked at length about the various schemes launched by the government in the interest of tribal communities. He praised tribal communities as “storehouse of knowledge” citing the example of the Baiga community, who fall under the 'Special Backward Tribe Group' in Madhya Pradesh, for their knowledge on traditional medicines.The President was on a two-day visit to Madhya Pradesh. Sunday's 'Janjatiya Sammelan' where he delivered his speech was organised by the MP Tribal Welfare Department. He had also attended the ‘sandhya aarti’ on the Narmada coast in Jabalpur, on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sex-ratio-better-here-president-kovind-praises-gender-equality-among-tribals-101615116746640.html

While addressing a function in his constituency of Begusarai in Bihar on Saturday, Singh told people that they should beat up government officials who don’t listen to them. “If even that does not work, then Giriraj shall throw his weight behind you,” he said and which led to an overwhelming appreciation from the public.Singh’s comment led to a wave of reactions within the state’s political spectrum. Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar also weighed in.“Aap unhi se puchiye (ask him only),” Kumar said on Sunday after reporters asked what he had to say about the Union minister’s remark. Kumar further questioned whether it was justified or appropriate to use words like ‘pitai’ (beating) and then refused to speak on this matter.Apart from Kumar, opposition parties in Bihar such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) strongly condemned Singh’s remark. The BSP’s national spokesperson, Sudhindra Bhadoria, said on Sunday that such a statement might create a law and order problem and added that why hasn’t the Centre taken any action against the Union minister. The RJD hit out at Singh as well as CM Kumar and said that whether these two parties were running a government or a ‘Mahajungleraj’ in the state. The current government in Bihar is under the realm of the alliance between the JD(U) and the BJP.#WATCH | If someone (any government official) doesn't listen to your grievances, hit them with a bamboo stick.

07-03-2021||India||Maharashtra Covid spike: Crowded public transport, polls to blame, says Centre||The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra is due to many reasons including crowding at public transport, recent gram panchayat elections, the Centre has said in its report probing the sudden spike in fresh infections in the state, which started from February. The rise is not specific to any region, though it started with the Vidarbha region. The Centre had sent a team to Maharashtra and in other states which are seeing the abnormal spike after the situation hit a plateau in the state.Mutation of Covid-19 was initially thought to be a reason in case a particular mutation is more contagious, but the Centre earlier said that there is no scientific link between the two as some of these mutations have been present in the country since 2020 and mutations are only natural.A team of experts comprising joint secretary of health ministry Nipun Vinayak, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) deputy director Sanket Kulkarni and National Institute of TB and Respiratory Diseases professor Ashish Ranjan, visited the state on March 1 and 2 and have zeroed in on a few reasons.Maharashtra adds over 50k new cases in 6 days: What ministers said on lockdown"While the exact causes of the surge are not known— since laxity in Covid-19 behaviour is not specific to the state — the possible factors are Covid-inappropriate behaviour due to lack of fear of disease, pandemic fatigue; miss outs and super spreaders; and enhanced aggregations due to recent gram panchayat elections, marriage season and opening of schools, crowded public transport, etc.," according to a report shared by the government.Watch: ‘Covid vaccination done for free at govt hospitals in India’: PM ModiIn the face of a fresh threat from a second Covid-19, several districts in Maharashtra have imposed restrictions by shutting schools, bringing back night curfews and choosing brief local lockdowns. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said he is not in favour of a lockdown in the state again.In its report, the contribution of the resumption of Mumbai local trains behind the rise has not been separately pointed out as the report pertains to the overall rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, but it mentions crowded public transport as one of the reasons. So are gram panchayat elections in the state. In January, elections were held in 12,711 gram panchayat spread across 34 districts in Maharashtra."Don't let the guard down. Stay to basics of surveillance, contact tracing and testing. Micro plan and ensure strict compliance of protocols. Strengthen teams to ensure meticulous home quarantine, do focused testing of 100 per cent population in hotspot areas repeated at five days, and isolate positives to check spread,” it said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-covid-spike-crowded-public-transport-polls-to-blame-says-centre-101615110636865.html

07-03-2021||India||‘Topic of emergency should be buried once and for all’, says Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Sunday said the topic of India's Emergency of 1975 is 'outdated' and must be 'buried once and for all'. Party mouthpiece Saamana has also termed the present situation in the country no different than the emergency."The present situation in the country prompts us to say 'situation during emergency was better,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut wrote in his weekly column RokhThok.Raut said newspapers and media houses are now being controlled, many opposition leaders are jailed, public property is up for sale, and only some people are gaining from it while those who point out this is wrong are termed 'enemies of the country'. Those who speak frankly and sometimes criticize the actions of the government, including persons from the film industry such as Anurag Kashyap and Tapsee Pannu were raided by the income tax department."How is this any different from the emergency?" the column questioned.Talking about the arrest of Disha Ravi, the 22-year old environment activist for sedition, Raut asked, "Why is the government afraid of a 22-year old? Does such an action suit the world's biggest democracy? Such incidents erode the basis of democracy."It went on to say that renaming of the Motera stadium in Ahmedabad after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a resounding reminder of the slogan coined during emergency, "Indira is India". Now Indira's place has been taken by Narendra Modi, it said.The column also questioned if it is necessary for Rahul Gandhi to express the view that the emergency was wrong and revisit the topic. Indira Gandhi was criticised by people for the aspects of emergency that were wrong, she was forgiven, and then re-elected.“Why revisit the same topic again and again? That topic has now become obsolete,” it said. Praising Rahul Gandhi for his frankness, it said that what he spoke simply became a talking point.It went on to say that an era has passed since Indira Gandhi declared the emergency in the country, under very specific circumstances. Now there is a generation in politics and in journalism that has nothing to do with the emergency period."Those who were never affected by the emergency now hold power in the central government and in many states. Yet BJP continues to grind axe over the emergency, this is very surprising," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/topic-of-emergency-should-be-buried-once-and-for-all-says-shiv-sena-101615108445962.html

As of Saturday evening, a total of 20,662,073 vaccine doses have been administered in the country, the health ministry said in the statement.In the first phase, which started on January 16, healthcare and frontline workers - the most vulnerable group in fight against Covid-19 - were given vaccines. So far, 69,72,859 healthcare and 65,02,869 frontline workers have received a jab against the infection. Out of these, 35,22,671 healthcare and 1,97,853 frontline workers have received the second dose as well, according to health ministry.India reached the ten million-mark on February 19. It vaccinated the highest number of people on March 5 when nearly 1.5 million people were inoculated against Covid-19. Before this, the country administered about 1.4 million doses on Thursday.India is behind only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of the total number of people receiving vaccination, data from the health ministry shows. It is also one of the fastest countries to reach the 20 million milestone.In the second phase of vaccination drive, which commenced from March 1, the government allowed people above 60 years of age to receive the jab. Those above 45 and with specified co-morbid conditions are also getting vaccinated in the second phase.The government also gave a nod to private vaccination centres where people can get the jab at a set price.Meanwhile, experts said there is a need to speed up the drive at least six to 10 times if the country plans to achieve its target of immunising 300 million people most at risk of exposure or death by August.The Centre is planning to more than double the number of vaccination centres and reach deeper into rural parts of the country, targeting a massive expansion that experts believe is possible only if policies are relaxed and India’s vast immunisation infrastructure is tapped into.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-weekly-wrap-india-reaches-20-million-mark-1-5-million-inoculated-in-a-singleday-101615107694147.html

Currently, the two Houses of Parliament sit in different shifts to maintain social distance.Parliament officials said that the government managers as well as many opposition leaders have requested Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to cut short the session as leaders of the BJP, Congress, TMC, DMK, Left bloc, AGP, AIADMK and many regional outfits would be busy in the campaign for the polls.Elections are being held in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry from March 27 to April 29.The second half of the budget session was scheduled to end on April 8. The first half of the session was also cut short by two days.Top officials indicated that the second half of the session that starts on Monday, may run for a maximum of two weeks."The elections are starting from March 27. Keeping the political considerations in mind, it looks like the session is likely to run for two weeks only," said a senior official.The government's top priority would be to clear the finance bill and the ministry wise demand for grants in Parliament. The government also has about 25 bills shortlisted for passage but those can always be taken up later.Officials also said that both houses might meet at 11 am from the second week following vaccination of MPs. "Since many MPs would be busy campaigning, we are not expecting a full House in this session," said a Rajya Sabha official."Therefore, the current system of allotment of seats covering both Houses will be scrapped and MPs of one House can be accommodated in their own House. This will allow simultaneous running of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha," said a third official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-of-parliament-likely-to-be-cut-short-due-to-assembly-polls-101615105725652.html

The venue remains out of bounds for the media.Dozens of others who gathered with their luggage outside Mecca Masjid in Jammu’s Bhatindi area in the morning said that they were heading home following the verification process initiated by Jammu and Kashmir police.By late Saturday a total of 169 illegal immigrants without valid travel documents were lodged in Hiranagar jail in Kathua, which has been turned into a holding centre.“Due process of law was followed in this exercise. These immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required in terms of section (3) of the Passports Act,” inspector general of police (Jammu zone) Mukesh Singh had said Saturday.The exercise of identifying more such immigrants is going on and the union territory administration is collecting biometric and other details of Rohingyas staying here.According to an official estimate of the then BJP-PDP alliance government, 5,700 Rohingyas had settled in and around Jammu.In April 2017, the UNHCR said there were 7,000 Rohingyas in Jammu and Kashmir. The Rohingyas are settled largely in Jammu's Bhatindi, Subhuman and Bawe areas, in Samba's Bari Brahmana, and are also scattered in Kathua and Udhampur districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-continue-verification-drive-of-illegal-rohingyas-101615104742999.html
07-03-2021||India||From farms to mills, a long wait for UP farmers just to get sugarcane weighed||As thousands of farmers lay siege to Delhi borders for over 100 days demanding the repeal of three contentious farm laws, those staying back in Western Uttar Pradesh have to endure a different kind of long wait -- at times for multiple days just to get weighed quintals of sugarcane lying in tractor-trollies on their way from farms to mills.Some pass their time chit-chatting about the ongoing protests, others while smoking bidis or cigarettes, but all of them sound worried about loads of sugarcane drying under a scorching sun, while Punjabi and Haryanvi songs continue to blare out loudly, either from their mobiles or small speakers fitted in their vehicles.Also, problems for them are much more beyond the three laws that have been in limelight due to the protests at the national capital borders.Almost a hundred tractor-trollies, each loaded with 300 quintals of sugarcane on an average, can be seen parked in a barren field near the Bhopada weighing scale in Budhana tehsil here, barely two kilometres from the Dhampur sugar mill -- the final destination of the load and their carriers after days-long 'weighing' halt.Some drivers, many of them farmers with small landholdings, even have arrangements made for sleeping on cots fitted under their 'trollas' (customised and bigger trolleys used to transport sugarcane)."It has been two days since I am waiting at this weighing scale and looks like it will take me another two days for my work to be done so that I can take my stock to the sugar mill," Rohit Balyan, who hails from Kutba village, told PTI."The exhausting long wait at weighing scales hurts farmers because the sugarcane load starts drying up under the sun and by the time one's turn comes for measurement, the weight comes down a bit," the 21-year-old Balyan said while lighting up a cigarette borrowed from a friend waiting next in the queue.A sugar mill official in Muzaffarnagar, which is widely known as the 'sugar bowl' of India and also has Asia's largest gur mandi (jaggery market), told PTI the weight loss during the waiting time is only a few kilogrammes but farmers argue this loss means a lot to them because their earnings go down by thousands of rupees.However, mill owners put the blame for the delay in weighing the crop on farmers growing sugarcane way beyond the daily intake capacity of the mills and also on lack of weighing facilities in the region. They also claim that sugar production from the region is often in surplus vis-a-vis the market demand and therefore they do not have enough incentives to further enhance their processing facilities.Farmers also claim that sugar mills are procuring sugarcane at ₹325 per quintal, lower than the government-fixed Minimum Support Price (MSP) of ₹385."We are not getting the MSP and then we have to wait here for days at the weighing scale. The sugarcane starts drying up after a couple of days and this means a reduction in weight and money for us," said Anuj Tomar, who hails from Kakda village.Tomar, 25, said he has been standing in the queue for days with sugarcane produced in his family's 27-bigha land.Among those waiting at the weighing scale are also people who do not own land but are engaged in transporting sugarcane from farms to sugar mills after getting the yield measures at weighing scales.For them also, the loss of time during a peak work season means loss of money.Harsoli village resident Mukeem, 35, said he uses his tractor-trolla for the transport work like many others in the region, who are typically paid nearly ₹12 per quintal of sugarcane from the mills."It has been three days since I am standing here. I have got more than 300 quintals of sugarcane loaded on my trolla. If we get it measured quickly, then I can do more rounds and make more money," Mukeem said.He is also upset over an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that calls for phasing out old tractors in the National Capital Region (NCR). Muzaffarnagar, which thrives on sugarcane production, is among the areas affected by this order."How are we supposed to phase out our tractors just because they are 15 or 20-years old. They are working fine for us. The price of diesel has gone up sharply in the last 10 years. The rate we get for transportation is still the same but nobody is bothered about these issues,” he said.Also waiting for two days at the weighing scale are Raju Tyagi, 23, from Osika village and 23-years-old Saleem from Kethal village, both of whom strongly support protesting farmers' demand for a legal guarantee on the MSP and repeal of the three contentious agriculture laws.Transporting sugarcane is a seasonal work both Tyagi and Saleem take up and are mightily upset over the long delays at weighing scales."I hope that one day the government will consider our issues also," Saleem said.According to the Muzaffarnagar administration estimates, more than 40 per cent of the district's population is engaged in agriculture with sugarcane farming topping the chart.Sugar mill officials say much of the problem related to sugarcane farming in the region is due to the surplus yield of sugarcane and the limited production capacity of the mills."There are eight sugar mills in Muzaffarnagar alone. The one in Khatauli is the biggest in Western Uttar Pradesh and has a purchasing capacity of 1,30,000 quintals a day," a sugar mill official said requesting anonymity."Farmers in the region mostly grow sugarcane and wheat. While wheat is mostly grown for personal consumption, they sell sugarcane to mills because of the MSP on it. That leads to sugar being in surplus, which in turn results in various problems related to it," the official said.A measure to check these problems can only be policy-driven by the government, the official suggested, adding there should be an upper limit for farming of sugarcane."Farmers here are growing sugarcane on 90 per cent of their lands. If that is reduced to say, 60 per cent, and farmers are asked to grow other crops also, then a solution could be in sight," he told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-farms-to-mills-a-long-wait-for-up-farmers-just-to-get-sugarcane-weighed-101615103087737.html

07-03-2021||India||When Mithun Chakraborty resigned from Rajya Sabha citing health reasons||Actor Mithun Chakraborty is present at the Brigade Parade ground in Kolkata to attend the mega rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, there has been no confirmation till now from the BJP side whether he will also be joining the party ahead of the crucial West Bengal Assembly election 2021.If Chakraborty joins the BJP, it will be an extension of his long tryst with politics which apparently started with his links with the Naxalite movement in West Bengal.After building a successful Bollywood career, his association with Bengal politics got renewed after Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) came to power in 2011. In 2014, the party sent him to the Rajya Sabha but the Saradha scam apparently tarnished his image as he was the brand ambassador of the group that ran a ponzi scam in Bengal. Many other TMC leaders were associated with the group.PM Modi's Brigade rally: BJP clarifies about Mithun Chakraborty, Sourav GangulyDuring the investigation into the scam, Chakraborty was interrogated and returned ₹1.19 crore to the Enforcement Directorate after tax deduction from ₹2 crore that he had got from the group for being their brand ambassador. This happened in 2015. In 2016, Chakraborty resigned from the Rajya Sabha citing health reasons. His attendance was also poor as he had attended Parliament for three days during his stint.Following this, he distanced himself from both politics and the public eye and was believed to have undergone treatment abroad for his chronic back problem.In 2019, Mithun Chakraborty was seen in filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri's The Tashkent Files. He will also be seen in the same director's upcoming movie The Kashmir Files, which was supposed to be released in 2020, but got delayed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.His re-emergence in the political space and speculations over it began with his meeting with RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, though the actor said it was a breakfast meeting and there was no politics in it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-mithun-chakraborty-resigned-from-rajya-sabha-citing-health-reasons-101615099980487.html

07-03-2021||India||Amit Shah visits Kerala as Vijayan govt battles to rid gold smuggling taint||As the rift between the Left democratic front government and the Centre widened over the gold smuggling case, Union home minister Amit Shah arrived in the state late on Saturday for one-day visit to Kerala and bordering Tamil Nadu.Shah will address the concluding session of the BJP state president K Surendran’s state-wide ‘Vijay Yatra’ at Shankumugham beach in the state capital on Sunday evening. His visit assumes much significance in the backdrop of chief minister Pinarayi Viijayan’s criticism that the Centre was using its agencies to portray the state government in a bad light. Shah’s visit is expected to brighten poll fireworks in the state. “His visit will streamline our vigorous campaign in the state,” said Surendran.The Centre-state friction over the matter escalated after the customs department filed an affidavit in Kerala high court on Friday linking chief minister, three of his ministers, and assembly Speaker with the sensational smuggling scandal. It also summoned former party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s wife Vinodini Balakrishnan in connection with an expensive smartphone, allegedly gifted by a builder Sanotsh Eapen, who got the contract for the controversial Life Mission project in Thrissur.The ruling party protested outside the customs office in major cities on Saturday. Attacked personally, customs and preventive commissioner Sumit Kumar later took to social media, saying “intimidation tactics” won’t pay. He said there were many attacks on him and his officers but the state police had failed to probe these cases properly.“The commissioner had submitted a statement recorded under Section 164 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the high court in a case in which he was not a party. The motive behind the latest move is to tarnish the image of the government,” said the CM, adding that the commissioner was carrying out the dirty job to help the BJP-Congress “alliance” in the state. He alleged both the BJP and the Congress worked as a single unit in the state to attack the Left front government.Also Read: Kerala CM slams union minister amid calls for resignation over smuggling caseEarlier, the CM had hit out at BJP's minister of state for external affairs, V Muraleedharan, alleging after his elevation, smuggling from West Asian countries increased manifold. Hailing from the state, Muraleedharan is one of the staunchest critics of the state government. He responded by saying that the government was barking at the wrong tree after its own role in the smuggling scandal unearthed.The sensational gold smuggling case is a major talking point in the state assembly polls this time. It came to light last July after customs seized 30 kg gold from a consignment that came in the name of an official of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram, camouflaged as a diplomatic consignment. Later, the case was handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and at least four other central agencies are part of the probe now. The NIA and other agencies arrested 30 persons in connection with the case including the CM’s former principal secretary, M Sivasankar, and questioned a minister and many others in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-visits-kerala-as-vijayan-govt-battles-to-rid-gold-smuggling-taint-101615094033444.html
07-03-2021||India||During PM Modi’s Kolkata rally, CM Banerjee will decry LPG price in Siliguri||In a bid to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first Kolkata rally prior to the eight-phase assembly polls that begins on March 27, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday will lead a roadshow in Siliguri, 570 km away in north Bengal, to decry the hike in price of LPG.“I will lead the protest in Siliguri. We will carry cylinders. The state government gives food to the people for free. It is unacceptable that price of the fire needed to cook it costs ₹900. How can common people survive?” Banerjee said on Saturday afternoon before leaving for north Bengal where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made impressive progress in 2019 and won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats.On Sunday, Banerjee set the tone for the day early with an attack on the issue on Twitter at 10.45 am."BJP is looting people by regularly hiking LPG prices. Women have been hit the hardest & I’m disgusted at Centre’s lack of intent to cut taxes & lessen their burden. In protest, today I’ll be leading an all women michil at Siliguri. REDUCE LPG PRICES NOW! #IndiaAgainstLPGLoot," she wrote.Modi’s rally, to be held at the famous Brigade Parade Grounds in Maidan area, is expected to draw a huge crowd. Mithun Chakraborty, former Bollywood star and an icon in Bengal, may appear on the dais. No BJP leader confirmed or denied it till Saturday night. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat recently met Chakraborty at the latter’s Mumbai residence. After that meeting, the actor said he discussed only spiritual matters with the RSS chief and skipped questions on joining politics. He was a Rajya Sabha member of the TMC before resigning in 2016. He has maintained a distance from the TMC since then.TMC leaders, who did not want to be identified, said one purpose of the chief minister’s north Bengal tour is to present before voters the effect of her welfare schemes, of which free ration is a part, as well as the fallout of the Centre’s decisions.The other purpose, they said, is to address dissent among a section of north Bengal leaders following the release of the party’s candidate list for 291 of the state’s 294 assembly seats.In 2019, the TMC’s tally in the Lok Sabha came down from 34 seats to 22, while the BJP increased its seats from only two to 18. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal, the BJP was ahead of the TMC in 34 as per the general election figures.“The selection of candidates has triggered dissent among some TMC leaders in north Bengal. Siliguri is no exception since Om Prakash Mishra, a former Congress leader and resident of Kolkata, has been fielded from the constituency. The party hopes that the dissidents will fall in line once they see Mishra accompanying the TMC chief,” a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity.Banerjee has other problems to take care of as well. She has left Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, the three assembly segments in the north Bengal hills, for the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). Though both factions of the GJM, led by Bimal Gurung and Binoy Tamang respectively, support Banerjee, the hill leaders want to contest each other instead of burying the hatchet.Also Read: ‘Mamata Banerjee will lose in Nandigram by over 50,000 votes’: Suvendu AdhikariThe Left and the Congress also held a road show in the heart of Kolkata on Saturday in protest against hike in the price of petrol, diesel and LPG.

MPs, MLAs, village mukhiyas, DMs, SDMs, BDOs... these are all under obligation to serve the people. If they do not listen to you, pick up a bamboo stick with both hands and give a crushing blow on their head," said Singh."If even that does not work, then Giriraj shall throw his weight behind you," he said, evoking applause from the crowds even as dignitaries sharing the dais squirmed in their seats.A BJP leader in the Bihar capital, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "Giriaj Singh is a mass leader who has to be responsive towards public anger.

07-03-2021||India||Govt ready to amend farm laws, says Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar once again said on Saturday that the government is ready to amend the three farm laws, against which the farmers have been protesting for over 100 days. The protesters have been demanding the withdrawal of the three contentious laws.Addressing the fifth national convention of Agrivision, Tomar said that the Centre is ready to amend these laws "to respect the sentiments of protesting farmers". He, however, stressed that the government's proposal does not mean that there were any deficiencies in these reform laws. He made the same statement in the Rajya Sabha last month.Tomar said the three laws passed by Parliament in September last year will help farmers fetch more prices in the market. These laws will also boost investment in the farm sector, said the Union minister."No one is ready to talk on how these protests can be in the interest of farmers," said Tomar.He also attacked the opposition parties which are supporting the farmers' protest. "There is a place for disagreement in democracy and so is for opposition and difference of opinion, but should there be any opposition that can harm the nation," he said.The Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of these laws and formed a committee on the issue, the government to has said that it is ready to suspend these laws for 18 months but the farmers have been adamant with their demand that they should be withdrawn.Eleven rounds of talks have taken place between the farmers and the government but the imapsse still continues. The protesters also want legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP). They say that the provisions in the law will put them at the mercy of big corporate houses - a point which has been expanded by the opposition parties, especially Congress, to say that the laws will benefit only a handful of corporate houses.The government, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has assured that the MSP system is here to stay but the farmers have not ended their protest.The stir, launched on November 26 last year, completed 100 days on Saturday. Bharatiya Kisan union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, who has been leading the protest, asked the farmers to be prepared for long haul and also gave a formula to intensify the agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-ready-to-amend-farm-laws-says-union-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-101615084394351.html

Tikait's mantra for farmers included 1 village, 1 tractor, 15 men and 10 days, adding another 15 are to replace the first 15 on rotational basis.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson gave the formula as the ongoing farmers' protest completed 100 days on Saturday."If these farm laws are enforced then the foodgrain will be locked in godowns of the traders and big companies and the price of foodgrain will be decided on the basis of hunger," he said.Also Watch: Farmers mark 100th day of protest with road blockadeOn Thursday, Tikait asked his supporters to be prepared for a long protest "until the government agrees to talk to the committee". Several leaders of farmer unions have also said that their movement is far from over.The farmers have been sitting at various borders near national capital Delhi since November 26 last year with the demand that the three central farm laws must be repealed. They have held several rounds of talks with the government, but the impasse continues.They also want a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP).While a resolution was reached on two of the four demands - rollback of rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning - in January, a decision on repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP are the two major sticking points.The government has given assurances on MSP, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying "MSP will always be there" but the farmers want a law on it.The Centre has called these laws historic and liberating for the small farmers. But the unions and opposition farmers have trashed these laws saying they will favour big corporate houses and put the farmers at their mercy.Several non-BJP state governments have passed resolution against these farm laws. The Punjab government passed a second resolution last week asking the Centre to withdraw of these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-s-formula-for-farmers-protest-101615080505812.html

He is said to be in charge of the Middle East. Is there any estimate of how much gold has been smuggled since he became a minister?” “Didn’t the smuggling of gold through the diplomatic channel start after this minister took charge? Does this minister have anything to do with the person who persuaded the accused to say that the smuggling was not in diplomatic baggage?” he asked.The CPI(M) in Kerala had alleged Muraleedharan had all along been insisting that the bag in which 30 kg of gold was seized by customs officials at the international airport here on July 5 last year was not diplomatic cargo. The CM’s statement came hours after targeting rubbished as “childish” the CPI(M)’s allegation that the BJP was politically using the probe agencies.Meanwhile, the Customs department has summoned Vinodini Balakrishnan, wife of former Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, to appear before it on March 10. The developments come a day after the Customs claimed that gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh has made “shocking revelations” against Vijayan on dollar ‘smuggling’ involving UAE consulate officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-slams-union-minister-amid-calls-for-resignation-over-smuggling-case-101615060627050.html

In the other party, they work for a family… For me, the country is above all,” Trivedi said as he joined the BJP in the presence of party president JP Nadda and Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi.Trivedi is the latest in the list of TMC leaders, including political heavyweight and minister Suvendu Adhikari and state minister Rajib Banerjee, who switched over to the BJP ahead of the eight-phase state elections, scheduled to begin on March 27.Also read | ‘He backstabbed us’: Trinamool Congress slams Dinesh Trivedi’s move to BJPWelcoming Trivedi to the BJP, Nadda said the former MP paid a price for sticking to his principles while in the TMC. “For principles, he quit the Rajya Sabha seat, he opted for idealism instead of opportunism… In the TMC, corruption, opportunism, and killing the democracy are enshrined, so he quit and joined the BJP.”On February 12, Trivedi announced his resignation from the Rajya Sabha while participating in the debate on the budget in the House, alleging that he was feeling “suffocated” and saying that he heard the call of his ‘antaratma’ (inner voice).“The way there is violence, I feel awkward what should I do by sitting here.

07-03-2021||India||Bihar finance dept sounds alert against attempts of irregular fund withdrawal||Following the detection of a couple of instances during system audit when some individual officers opened bank accounts in their names and were trying to transfer government money in them, the Bihar government’s finance department has sounded an alert for all the departments to be watchful against such practice.The finance department has written to the top brass of various departments, offices and administration to ensure strict compliance to the finance and treasury rules for maintaining fiscal discipline. It has also directed all the departments and offices to ensure submission of bills to the treasury for this fiscal latest by March 25 to prevent the old practice of delayed submission.“It has been observed that the departments/offices withdraw funds from required head/ PL account through bills submitted to concerned treasury and later it is transferred to bank accounts opened in the name of official designations or individual officials. This is not in accordance with the laid down rules and it could lead to irregular withdrawals,” said a letter from principal secretary, finance, S Siddharth.The letter has been addressed to all the additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries, department heads, divisional commissioners, district magistrates, treasury officials and all drawing and disbursing officials.Siddhharth said that the instance of an assistant director opening a bank account in his name and the concerned department trying to divert money there had been detected during system audit. It is not allowed and rules are clearly laid down in this regard. No money can be transferred in personal account,” he addedThe finance department has categorically written that as per rules, the withdrawal from treasury has to be done only up to the extent required for direct payment to vendor/contractor/payee in their respective bank accounts and under no circumstances it the money should go the bank accounts of subordinate officials or individual.“Under no circumstances, no advance withdrawal of funds has to be done for transferring the amount in bank accounts. Even for opening bank accounts and transfer of government money, there are clear guidelines from the finance department,” says the letter, adding it was important to review all the claims for withdrawal by different departments/offices in the light of financial provisions at the level of departments/offices.The finance department has also cited rules 34, 176 and 177 of the Bihar Treasury Code, 2011 in this regard and the guidelines issued from time to time. The rule 34 states that “a drawing officer shall not, except with special permission of the finance department, deposit in a bank account money withdrawn from the government account “.Rule 176 states that “all charges incurred must be drawn and paid at once and no money should be withdrawn from the treasury unless it is required for immediate payment”, while rule 177 states that “no money shall be drawn from the treasury in anticipation of demands or to prevent lapse of budget grants”.The finance department principal secretary has also written to the departments to ensure that money spent till March 31, 2021 is under prescribed heads in accordance with the provisions of the Bihar Appropriation Act, 2021, which has been notified in the gazette following gubernatorial nod. “If any sub-head is created, it must have prior nod of the Accountant General,” he added in another letter.Siddharth said that with the online system in place, the departments no bills would be accepted after March 25 and the departments have been asked to ensure it. “There is no reason for submitting bills after March 25,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-finance-dept-sounds-alert-against-attempts-of-irregular-fund-withdrawal-101615055453698.html
07-03-2021||India||Issue of national security key as govt decides on cryptocurrency, says Thakur||The government needs to be very careful while taking any decision regarding cryptocurrencies as they are highly volatile and could have security implications, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur said on Saturday, adding that the government was keen to embrace the blockchain technology of virtual currencies.“We understand there is an immense interest in these emerging virtual currencies, but we also need to look at the national security and securities of Indians and individuals,” he said at a virtual event organised by the Entrepreneurs’ Organisation (EO) Punjab.The Indian government has not accepted any cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cautioned users of cryptocurrencies of the risks involved in dealing with virtual currencies. Cryptocurrency is, however, not legally banned and the government is in the process of enacting a law on this matter.Thakur said the government welcomes innovation and new technology, but with caution, so that citizens get due protection and national security is ensured. “And looking at Prime Minister Modi, he himself is a strong advocate of embracing technology in various aspects of governance,” he said. “If you look at one of these currencies... in couple of weeks time the rate is X... after couple of weeks you could see it becomes 10X. It doesn’t happen with the fiat currency. So, I think, you have to be very careful at this stage for taking any kind of step... That is why this inter-ministerial committee is helping with their report and government will look into that and if need be, we’ll come out with legislation as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issue-of-national-security-key-as-govt-decides-on-101615052895250.html
07-03-2021||Today's||Look at number of people dying post-vaccination: Efficacy number that matters||Something sounds fishy when public health experts advise us to take whatever vaccine is available even though some vaccines show much more promising efficacy numbers than others. And it’s understandable that people would want to shop for the best vaccine. Americans are accustomed to the idea of consumer choice in pharmaceuticals — why else would we have so much direct-to-consumer drug advertising? But cut through the noise and there’s only one thing that really matters: all three FDA-authorized vaccines seem to work equally well — close to 100% — at preventing hospitalization and death.That message has gotten diluted in the reporting around the efficacy numbers for different vaccines. The efficacy numbers associated with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines came in at around 95%, while the newly approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine has shown a less impressive 72% in the US, and even lower in other countries. As risk communication expert Peter Sandman says, people remember from school that 95% usually earns and A, and 72% a C at best. The problem is that numbers most touted to measure “efficacy” measure various degrees of symptoms plus a positive test — criteria that vary some from trial to trial. They don’t measure what’s most important: protection against hospitalization and death.And on that score, all three vaccines are outstanding. So public health experts are justified in suggesting people take the first vaccine available.People aren’t only worried about dying from Covid; they’re also worried about getting so-called long Covid and transmitting the disease to others even after they’re vaccinated. There’s no data one way or the other one whether vaccination cuts the risk of long Covid for those who get sick, but all the vaccines appear to reduce the number of people who get mild illness or asymptomatic cases, and thereby probably reduce transmission.While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work the same way, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine works through a different mechanism. The first two use messenger RNA, and the latter uses DNA, which is ferried to the nucleus of cells with a different kind of virus, called an adenovirus, modified so it can’t replicate itself and cause disease. All three vaccines have good safety data, and all of them prompt the body to produce T-cells, which retain a sort of memory of the protein and attack it.One reason for the seemingly stark difference in efficacy numbers is that the clinical trials were held in very different groups of people. The Johnson & Johnson trial enrolled more people with hypertension, diabetes and HIV, as well as more people over 60, says University of California infectious disease doctor Monica Gandhi. Johnson and Johnson’s results also came from testing people in South Africa and Latin America at a time when new variants of the virus were already rampant. The important thing to note, says Gandhi, is that nobody who got the vaccine in the clinical trials — for any of the shots — was hospitalized for Covid-19. None of them died. None even got a severe enough case to require medical intervention at all.The absence of hospitalizations and deaths in the Johnson and Johnson trial looks even more impressive given that the volunteers included people who were more vulnerable to dying from the virus. Gandhi says she’d advise her own 80-something parents to get that shot if it was the first one available. Earlier this year, Yale University epidemiologist Robert Hecht had told me in an interview that he thought more lives could be saved by vaccinating people in so-called hot spots where there was an unusually high burden of disease. I called him back and asked whether the single-shot advantage of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine might make it a good choice for those places. He agreed it would, but worried about the perception that it’s an inferior vaccine, which could incite outrage about racial or socioeconomic injustice.Other experts are also wrestling with this question, since the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is cheaper than the other approved shots, delivered in a single dose, and requires only ordinary refrigeration rather than ultra-cold storage. That would make it a practical choice for vaccinating homeless people, and those in hard-to-reach rural areas, but again, experts are wrestling with the perception of inequality.That concern isn’t justified, given a proper interpretation of the data. Even the perception of unfairness, though, could be harmful. Giving people the ability to vaccine-shop might help more hesitant people feel more in control and less coerced — but also inadvertently prolong the pandemic.Getting the one-shot vaccine out as fast as possible and focusing on virus hot spots would save lives and hasten a return to some level of normal life. It’s now up to the public health community to send out a clearer message and get the public on board.The most important numbers here aren't 95% or 72%, but 0%: the number of vaccinated people who've died from the virus. When that's the emphasis, the message to get the first available vaccine makes a lot more sense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/look-at-number-of-people-dying-post-vaccination-efficacy-number-that-matters-101615124021661.html
07-03-2021||Today's||For reforms, create a coalition of the willing||On contentious matters of economic policy, the Narendra Modi government has demonstrated a penchant for pursuing a shock-and-awe approach.In 2015, the government attempted to push through a controversial bill that diluted the most stringent provisions of the previous government’s flagship land acquisition law. In 2016, the prime minister (PM) announced a draconian demonetisation measure, with just a few hours of notice. And more recently, the government has pushed through — with minimal consultation and deference to parliamentary procedure — three bills liberalising agricultural markets.On each occasion, the planned dhamaka (big bang) has led to an unfortunate tamasha (spectacle). While the government succeeded in winning the Lok Sabha’s assent on the land bill, it failed to muster the requisite numbers in the Rajya Sabha, forcing it to beat a hasty retreat. Demonetisation triggered a massive economic disruption and, though the government stayed the course, it failed to secure its principal objective of rooting out black money. Now, the fierce opposition to the farm bills has caught the ruling alliance on the back foot. The government has offered to stay the bill’s enactment for 18 months, but negotiations with the protesting farmers persist with no resolution in sight.One common driver of these shock-and-awe policies — and the PM’s governance style more generally — is the increasing concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister’s Office. This vertical approach to national policymaking shuts out input not only from the Opposition but also stalwart rank-and-file Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) officeholders and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) allies. Debate and deliberation are often sacrificed for the sake of speed and scale.Yet, this strategy often ends up costing the ruling party. In an effort to override the fragmented, every-state-for-itself nature of India’s economic governance, the party high command has failed to pre-emptively defuse— or even anticipate — the kind of backlash that the farm bills provoked. Excess centralisation has too often delivered ineffectual policy.Fortunately, for contentious economic reform, there is an alternative path. Imagine, for a moment, if PM Modi deployed his considerable stature, charisma, and political savvy to forge a common minimum programme for a coalition of the willing, comprised of BJP-ruled states (the same idea could extend even further to include NDA allies, of course).This programme could include commitments to reform outmoded labour laws, ease impediments to land acquisition, revise laws governing Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), and reform inefficient power sectors. A common minimum programme for BJP states could also spell out changes to ease-of-doing-business regulations and roll back the most intrusive tentacles of the Inspector Raj.Under such a coordinated approach, BJP-ruled states would lead by example and let investors vote with their feet. If reforms kicked off a virtuous cycle in a critical mass of large states stretching from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh, states that dithered would come under pressure to act.Forging a common programme for BJP states is not the same as letting allied states tinker with policy. When the Centre gave up on pushing nationwide land reform, it signalled it would use its authority under Article 254(2) of the Constitution to allow states to refashion their own land laws even if they contravened federal ones. This, however, is a half-measure — rather than galvanising states to act in unison, it merely permits ad hoc changes.Conditions are ripe for a more coordinated approach. Since assuming power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP’s fortunes at the state level have improved considerably. Today the party occupies chief ministerial positions in a plurality of states, accounting for 40% of India’s population and 36% of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Of course, there may be pushback from within the BJP’s ranks.But PM Modi possesses considerable leverage here. In states controlled by the BJP, each and every chief minister owes his position to Modi’s patronage. At the state level, Modi faces no credible alternative power centres within his own party.This then throws up a question. Why has the government persisted with a highly centralised approach? At least three factors appear to be at work.First, the BJP 2.0 appears enthralled with the idea of One Nation, One India. The Goods and Services Tax, simultaneous elections, new farm laws — all of these have been defended as necessary steps on the road to One India. This economic thrust aligns well with the government’s political modus operandi. This brand of politics relies on strict uniformity, an erasure of federal differences, Hindu unity, and an all-powerful executive. This helps reinforce what political scientist Neelanjan Sircar refers to as the “politics of vishwas”.Second, there are also strategic considerations at play. Collaborating with state governments or opening legislation up to parliamentary debate requires more time, effort, and risk of failure than executive decree. After all, there is a reason that issues such as market reforms have long been seen as intractable. The Modi government may simply prefer the speed and certainty of policy by fiat.Third, there is the issue of credit-claiming. Much of Modi’s success in projecting an image of delivering for the aam aadmi (common man) has stemmed from sweeping welfare initiatives such as rural electrification, toilet construction, and the distribution of LPG cylinders that can be clearly tied to Brand Modi.A common minimum programme places the party, instead of the PM, upfront. And if states ruled by non-BJP forces mimic the BJP’s approach, Modi’s rivals could assume credit for the changes he initiated.But shock-and-awe won’t work forever. Centralisation gives the illusion of control, but usually serves to exacerbate underlying social and political cleavages, and rarely achieves durable change. A common minimum programme for BJP states, in contrast, offers a middle path between One India and patchwork India.There is an obvious allure to pursuing a big bang approach that can be implemented in a top-down manner. It would seem to place opponents on the defensive, avoid pesky political compromises, and signal audacity to the electorate. Unfortunately, this is a best-case scenario and, as the record reflects, even the best-laid plans can go awry.Facing no existential threat until 2024, it is not too late for the government to change course. Ultimately, the question is how PM Modi understands his own strategic imperative. If he believes that he can get by on the perception of success — taking the tough, bold calls that might ultimately backfire — then crafting a coalition of like-minded states will be seen as more trouble than it’s worth.But this approach relies on an illusion that will only grow more difficult to sustain -- the deception that sheer vigour can substitute for progress. The BJP, then, will have to gamble that voters don’t notice that Made-in-Delhi diktats often don’t survive their first contact with reality.Milan Vaishnav is senior fellow and director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace in Washington, D.C.

07-03-2021||Today's||The missing women in India’s workforce||According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018-19, the female labour force participation rates among women aged above 15 years are as low as 26.4% in rural areas and 20.4% in urban areas in India. Both supply and demand factors contribute to the low levels of employment among women — especially the burden of domestic responsibilities, including the reproductive roles played by women, coupled with the lack of adequate and appropriate job opportunities.Studies have shown that women are willing to be employed, negating the argument that cultural factors keep women from working outside the household. It is also seen that unemployment rates (ie, those who are seeking employment but not finding any) are highest among women who are educated up to secondary and higher levels (17%; this is higher among young women at 26%).There is also the problem of much of women’s work not being counted as work. The All India Time Use Survey (2019) shows the disproportionate amount of time women spend on unpaid activities, much of which is not accounted for as economic activity. For instance, over 80% women participated in “unpaid domestic services for household members”, spending, on an average, 299 minutes a day compared to 26% men spending, on an average, 97 minutes a day.Even for women who are in the workforce, the nature of their employment is such that most of them are out of the purview of labour laws, including the recently passed Social Security Code. Over 55% of women (71% in rural India), who are counted as being part of the workforce, are in agriculture (vis-à-vis 53% in rural areas and 38% overall in the case of male workers). This is, by its very nature, informal and lacks social security provisions. Moreover, with land in agriculture continuing to be mostly in the name of men, women are not even recognised as farmers, although a large proportion of them are involved in agricultural work. This also keeps women away from accessing various schemes and resources such as priority sector loans, income support cash transfers and so on.At least 53% of women workers are in the self-employed category (of this, the majority are in the category of “helpers”), 22% receive regular wage/salary, and 25% are casual labour. Even among regular/salaried employees, two-thirds of the women workers had no written contract, about half were not eligible for any paid leave or had any social security benefit. The wages earned are also very low — their average earnings in a month from self-employment work in 2018-19, for example, being only ₹4,919. The average earning of those in regular employment is also only ₹12,000 per month. This category also includes domestic workers, anganwadi workers and so on — basically all those who receive some payment at regular intervals, even though that might be below minimum wages in some instances.The Social Security Code has minimal provisions for such women workers who are in informal employment. The maternity benefits portion of the Code is simply a reproduction of the Maternity Benefits Act, which includes only those women who work in an “establishment” and have worked for more than 80 days with the employer from whom she claims the maternity benefit. This automatically leaves out women in self-employment and those in informal jobs, together constituting more than 90% of the female workforce. In relation to the workers in unorganised sectors, the Code only specifies that they need to be registered (with mandatory Aadhaar) but does not spell out what they are entitled to. This is left for schemes to be notified by central and state governments.It is clear that Covid-19 has impacted women’s employment even more than that for men. Concerted efforts towards ensuring enabling conditions for women to be employed including transport, safety, women’s hostels along with social security provisions for all in the form of maternity benefits and child care arrangements are required for providing a level playing field for women entering the labour market. Unfortunately, these are all absent.Dipa Sinha teaches at Ambedkar University, DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-missing-women-in-india-s-workforce-101615022286658.html
07-03-2021||Today's||Institutions have failed citizens on sedition||I haven’t kept count but the available facts suggest an alarming increase in cases of sedition.The website, Article 14, claims 65% of the sedition charges against 10,938 individuals since 2010 were brought after 2014. Within that category, 96% of sedition cases “for criticising politicians and governments over the last decade” were registered after 2014.According to Article 14, this means “a 28% increase in the number of sedition cases filed each year between 2014 and 2020… compared to the yearly average between 2010 and 2014”. Finally, the National Crime Records Bureau seems to confirm these figures with its own, which show a 165% increase in cases of sedition between 2016 and 2019.Mahatma Gandhi would be appalled. He called Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which is the sedition law, “the prince amongst the political sections of the Indian Penal Code designed to suppress the liberty of the citizen”.As for “attempts to excite disaffection against the government”, which the law penalises, he said: “I hold it as a virtue to be disaffected towards the government … one should be free to give the fullest expression to his disaffection, so long as he does not contemplate, promote or incite violence.”The fact that, in recent years, sedition has been used against cartoonists, students, journalists, historians, authors, actors, directors and, even, threatened against little children would have reduced the Mahatma to tears. Not of anger, but shame. This is not the future he envisaged for his country.Yet, the truly perplexing bit is not that our rulers have ignored Mahatma Gandhi — they’ve been doing that ever since he died — but they also refuse to heed the Supreme Court (SC). And even more bizarre is the fact the court has not complained.In 1962, in the Kedar Nath Singh judgment, the court upheld Section 124A, but restricted its use to “such activities as would be intended, or have a tendency, to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence”.In other words, it read down the law. It’s no longer what the language seems to suggest. Today, it has very limited application. Equally importantly, the court reiterated this in the Balwant Singh case of 1995, the Bilal Ahmed Kaloo case and the Common Cause case and reaffirmed as recently as September 2016.In a nutshell, sedition can only apply if there is clear and imminent incitement to violence. Not otherwise. But have our police and various governments recognised this? Or, if they have, do they care? Clearly, the answer is no.They blithely accuse of sedition men who complain of power cuts, people who write to the prime minister criticising mob-lynching and journalists who’ve tweeted about the death of protesters. Yet there was no hint of incitement of violence in any of these cases.We have even reached the point where a junior judge has admonished that “the offence of sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the government”.But it is. That’s the only credible explanation for the blatant and frequent misuse of Section 124A. It’s become the favourite weapon of government retribution against people who say things it doesn’t like or act in ways it disagrees with. This is not simply disregard of the SC. Not just disrespect of it. It’s defiance.So why is the court silent? Once retired, judges have spoken out, but those still sitting on its benches have kept their lips sealed.Yet, I would argue our police and governments are guilty of contempt. And this is far more serious than a comedian or cartoonist mocking the judges or the court. Across Indian states and irrespective of party in power, governments, which take oath to uphold the constitution, are repeatedly dishonouring and disobeying it.Last month, a junior judge in Delhi spoke out. Is it not time for the elderly brethren who adorn the apex of our judicial system to find their voice? I, for one, am aching to hear it.Karan Thapar is author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/institutions-have-failed-citizens-on-sedition-101615021326331.html
07-03-2021||Today's||Can Covid-19 open doors for working women?||As India slowly begins battling its way out of the pandemic with its vaccination drive, new models of work and innovative thinking on the part of employers can create positive outcomes for women. Women have suffered tremendously during the pandemic, but there may well be some silver linings.India’s social structures, which force a woman to move to different locations depending on her husband’s job or remain behind with families in villages or small towns to take care of the household, have resulted in millions of women either having to stay out of jobs, drop out or miss opportunities to acquire the appropriate skills or educational qualifications to build a career.A range of sectors now allow employees to work from anywhere. This can benefit women, for whom lack of mobility and distance to office, not to mention household chores, have meant a decrease in career opportunities. Flexibility in the workplace will give them more choices, though this transformation will take time.If location and time are not factors, more women are likely to stay on in a job after having children, which gives them continuity in service and hence better chances at career progression. New work models will bring, apart from more work from home opportunities, possibilities of fewer days a week in the workplace for many.But this is not enough, for women also need support structures if they are to be truly productive. This is a good time for workplaces across the spectrum to consider crèches so that women who do have opportunities but are held back by child care responsibilities can put themselves into the job market.The government has been proactive in getting the economy back on track. The issue of giving women the right tools to not just empower themselves but also make a significant contribution to the economy should be a priority. If health care and social support systems improve, some of the burden of care-giving at home can also be lifted from women, leaving them to pursue their own aspirations. Employers should actively look at reskilling women already on the rolls and the government should offer more support for women who wish to acquire the educational skills to meet the demands of the labour market today.Though it may be a bit premature to say that mindsets have changed, there is definitely greater realisation now, after the onset of the pandemic, even within patriarchal structures, that women have had to bear a disproportionate burden of housework and care-giving for the young, elderly and sick.This could lead to greater male participation in the household. Economic pressure will also push more women into the job market and they should be able to access resources, information and skills with much greater ease than was the case before the pandemic.The Start-up India and Skill India schemes should target women much more aggressively now. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose words have proved transformational in many areas, should use his popular radio broadcast, Mann ki Baat, to emphasis the need to get women back into the workforce and make the workplace more conducive to those already in it. This would ensure that India does not lose out on so much talent waiting to be tapped if only the conditions are enabling. On this International Women’s Day, a pledge to bring women back into the workforce should be India’s top priority.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/can-covid-19-open-doors-for-working-women-101615020549334.html
