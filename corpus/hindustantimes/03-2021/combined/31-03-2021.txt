This comes after the authority refused to allow apartment registry if builders do not develop sports facilities as promised in realty projects, for which housing land was allotted in 2011.The developers have formed a consortium after the authority issued a ban on plot sale and lease permission, and stopped registry and issuance of occupancy certificates after it realised that the realtors did not develop the required sports facilities – which were to come up on 70% of the land – and only built flats – for which 30% of the land was marked.These nine builders have developed a total of about 5,500 apartments across the ten projects under them on group housing land that was allotted in the name of ‘Sports City’.The nine developers had established a consortium– Sports City Development Private Limited – in February 2021 after holding several rounds of meetings with senior authority officials.The consortium has offered to develop a golf course, cricket stadium, playfield, swimming centre, and tennis courts in the sector. The nine developers will pool in money as per the proportion of their plots and the layout of the Sports City that was finalised by the authority in 2011.In October 2011, the authority had handed over about 180 acres of land in Sector 79 to the now 3C real estate group. Sports amenities worth ₹410 crore had to be developed.The 3C group sub-leased the plot to different developers over the years who established about one dozen projects with an inventory of 11,000 units. Among them, 5,500 units are complete or are in various stages of construction. “We submitted our proposal to the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Noida authority on Tuesday. We will meet authority officials for further discussions on the matter this week,” said founder and managing director of the Civitech group, Subodh Goel, who is leading the consortium.The consortium has not mentioned the budget it is going to set aside at this stage and has sought specifications and measurements of the sports facilities that are to be developed. “The authority will decide how many facilities are needed out of the ones that were proposed originally, as well as their size. What standards are to be provided to users can be decided by experts of the field and only then can we get the estimated cost,” added Goel.Before handing over land to the consortium, the authority will either have to cancel the allotment to the 3C group or seek the group’s consensus in writing. Several group companies and subsidiaries of the 3C group are already facing insolvency proceedings. Ritu Maheshwari, the CEO of the authority, said that the proposal is being reviewed by the concerned team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/developers-submit-plan-for-sports-facilities-in-noida-sector-79-101617215033407.html

The police said the suspect allegedly lured the woman from her house in Khoda on Monday night and allegedly raped her at a park in Indirapuram. The suspect was identified as Raj Vir, a resident of Khoda who is from Etawah district. The police said that he allegedly visited the shop of the victim’s parents often, and on the night of the incident he went to their shop where he found the victim. “He then lured her to a park in Indirapuram where he raped her and left her there. After some locals informed the police, we launched a search. The victim, being mentally challenged, could only tell the suspect’s first name and somehow told her parents about the incident,” said Mohammad Aslam, SHO of Khoda police station. Police said they scanned CCTV footage from dozens of locations.“In one of the CCTVs, the woman was seen walking alone while in another, she was accompanied by the suspect. The footage was not clear, so we showed it to many local residents and one of them revealed his identity to us. Based on information gathered, we nabbed the suspect from his house,” the SHO added. The police registered an FIR into the incident and levied IPC Section 376 (rape) against the suspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-arrested-for-raping-mentally-challenged-woman-in-indirapuram-101617215032732.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Noida: Temperature drops slightly but will soar now, say weather experts||Noida: The mercury fell by three degrees on Wednesday in Noida, with weather analysts predicting temperatures to rise gradually within the next two days.Noida and its adjoining regions had experienced severe heat waves on Monday at 40.1 degrees Celsius, however, the mercury dropped later on. Weather analysts, however, predict that the region will see heat waves by the first week of April as the mercury is likely to gradually rise from April 2.On Wednesday, the maximum and minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 34.5 degrees Celsius and 23.1 degrees Celsius, respectively, against 37.9 degrees Celsius and 20.6 degrees Celsius a day earlier.“The region is out of heat waves for now, but is most likely to see heat waves within the first week of April – around April 5 – while the mercury will start rising gradually from the next two days. The region may also see dust-raising winds from Rajasthan on Thursday, which may affect pollution levels. On Wednesday, the city saw strong winds at 30 to 40 kmph,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.Meanwhile, the air quality of the region improved slightly due to strong and dry winds.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 226 against 282 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 267 against 294 a day earlier. Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 244 on Wednesday against 342 on Tuesday.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality will remain between ‘poor’ and ‘very-poor’.“Surface winds are high and forecasted to stay high for the next 48 hrs. High winds and boundary layer heights are leading to better and faster ventilation, however, an increase in coarse dust contribution in suspended particles is expected due to the dust raising high winds. Probability for significant long-range transport of dust from the arid region exists but only for a short period. Hence, no extreme pollution event is forecasted and AQI is likely to stay only in the ‘very poor’ to ‘poor’ range for next three days,” said a SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-temperature-drops-slightly-but-will-soar-now-say-weather-experts-101617214972754.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal bonds oversubscribed four times||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad municipal corporation on Wednesday successfully concluded its municipal bond issue and raised ₹150 crore, officials of the civic body said. The ‘green’ bonds were oversubscribed more than four times with 40 bids totalling ₹401 crore, the officials said, adding that the amount will be used for the construction of a tertiary sewage treatment plant.Green bonds are the bonds issued by any sovereign entity, inter-governmental groups and corporates with an aim to utilize the proceeds of the bonds for projects classified as environmentally sustainable. The officials said that the corporation issued bonds of ₹150 crore which included base issue of ₹100 crore and green issue of ₹50 crore.“The issue on Wednesday was oversubscribed more than four times. The listing will take place on the Bombay Stock Exchange on April 8. The corporation has proposed to take up a project for setting up a tertiary sewage treatment plant to further treat secondary treated sewage water. This water will be supplied further to industrial units and will help reduce pressure on groundwater resources in the city,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The officials said that the project is of a revenue generating nature and is expected to yield revenues after 30 months. They said that the total estimated cost of the project is about ₹239.93 crore, of which ₹150 crore will be funded through the bonds while the rest will be funded from the resources of the corporation. In December 2020, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had visited the BSE in Mumbai on the occasion when the bond of the Lucknow municipal corporation got listed. In July 2019, the UP cabinet approved the proposal of floating bonds by the municipal corporations of Lucknow and Ghaziabad to fund their infrastructure projects. During the approval, bonds totalling ₹350 crore, including ₹200 crore for Lucknow and ₹150 crore for Ghaziabad, were proposed to be floated after a process. “The Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam is the second municipal corporation to raise funds in the state of Uttar Pradesh. BSE firmly believes that Indian bond market is poised for a substantial growth and wide participation from non-institutional investors in this issue shows that India can use its domestic savings to fund its infrastructure needs in a substantial manner,” Ashishkumar Chauhan, managing director and chief executive officer of BSE, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-municipal-bonds-oversubscribed-four-times-101617214913453.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad revises PMAY target to 11,000 housing units||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) annual target for construction of low-cost housing units under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) has been scaled down to 11,000 from its previous target of 20,000.Launched in June 2015, PMAY is a central government scheme to address urban housing shortage among low-income groups. “There were previous revisions in the target, and it was about 20,000 till recently, which has now been scaled down to about 11,000 housing units at present. The construction is to be completed by 2022. The reason for scaling down the target is lesser number of beneficiaries available to seek PMAY houses. In case we get more beneficiaries, we will construct more such housing units in the future,” said Karuna Karunesh, vice-chairperson of the authority. Officials said that in 2018 they received a target of constructing about 36000 such houses. The authority’s town planning department said that of the 11,000 proposed units, about 3,000 are being constructed by private players while the rest have been taken up by the authority.Earlier in February, the authority’s board had approved the cost of each PMAY housing unit from ₹4.5 lakh to ₹6 lakh. However, the new rates were applicable only for new housing units and not those already under construction. The cost of ₹4.5 lakh was fixed under a government order on September 5, 2017. The Uttar Pradesh cabinet in March last year decided to revise the cost.“At present, we have about 3,700 units which are under construction at six sites. The reduction in target was approved by the state administration. It was scaled down due to high land costs, besides lesser number of beneficiaries coming up,” said an officer from the authority’s town planning department, requesting anonymity. The officials estimate that the cost of each unit under the PMAY was about ₹9-10 lakh to the authority, which also had to part with land. “We have about 20,000 housing units which are available under low-cost housing schemes, apart from the PMAY. So, people coming from low-income groups have an option to take up houses available with the authority. We also faced issues where PMAY housing units were proposed outside city limits. So, beneficiaries were reluctant to purchase houses away from the city,” the vice-chairperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-revises-pmay-target-to-11-000-housing-units-101617214912835.html

31-03-2021||Noida||Greater Noida makes map approval, completion certification issuance online from today||GREATER NOIDA: In order to maintain transparency in public works, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) has decided to stop approving building maps and completion certificates offline. Beginning April 1, these will only be approved online, said officials. The authority’s chief executive officer Narendra Bhooshan on Tuesday held a meeting with officials of the planning and IT departments to get the process started. Officials said the CEO has deputed 12 staff members who have been trained to carry out the job – six will handle the traffic of work coming from property allottees online while six from the planning department will conduct physical inspections.“The authority will initially run this facility to check anomalies in a month or so, and once it starts functioning properly, the system will be enhanced further to serve allottees,” said Deep Chand, additional CEO of the authority.As per process, once a property allottee, be it from a group housing section, individual residential plot, institutional, industrial, farmer’s plot or commercial, its building owner has to obtain a completion certificate before shifting into the premises. Besides, before starting construction work, allottees have to obtain approval for the building’s map. Subsequently, the authority’s department checks the map to ascertain whether the map is in line with the building bylaws or not. Meanwhile, to give approval for completion certificate once the building is ready, the planning department verifies if the building is constructed as per the approved map or not.“Once the allottee applies for a building map or completion certificate, he or she will have to submit all requisite documents such as allotment letter, approved map and no-dues certificate, etc. The team will check if the map is in line with bylaws and if yes, it will be approved,” said Chand. He further added that if the building is found built as per the approved map, the planning staff member will give approval so that the online sanction can be granted.Officials said soon, the authority will fix the specific dates within which map approval or completion will be granted. Officials said the CEO has indicated that if the work is not done in a timely manner, action will be initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-makes-map-approval-completion-certification-issuance-online-from-today-101617214852777.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: No hotel quarantine facility for medical staff this time||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration has decided to discontinue the hotel quarantine facility provided to the doctors and other medical staff treating the Covid-19 patients at state-run hospitals in the district, officials said on Wednesday.The officials said that such an arrangement is needed as majority of the health-care workers (HCWs) in the district have received Covid-19 vaccine and do not require active and passive quarantine procedure during which they were made to stay in hotels and lodges while on Covid duty last year. According to the officials, HCWs on active Covid duty were required to make a stay (active quarantine) at hotels, after duty hours, where they were provided free lodging and food for two weeks. Later, after completion of two weeks, they were required to stay for another one week in hotels as part of passive quarantine while off duty. “The similar arrangement will not be made available this time during Covid duty as majority of the HCWs have received vaccine shots. This has been decided by the state administration. Some of HCWs, who did not receive or opt for vaccination, will be given non-Covid duties this time,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. According to official records, 23,171 of 27,280 HCWs in the district received their first vaccine shots while 13,997 of them also received their second vaccine shots till April 30. The vaccination coverage in the district is about 85% for HCWs who received their first dose. However, experts are of view that the government should not withdraw providing quarantine for HCWs on active Covid duty. “In case any HCW contracts the infection, he/she may pass it on to family members and even to relatives and friends. This will result in spread of the infection. So, HCWs should be given hotel quarantine facility,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president, Indian Medical Association -- Ghaziabad. The district is starting with Covid duty for HCWs with opening up of the Sanjay Nagar district hospital as an L2 category Covid facility on April 1. Under the UP government’s three-tier Covid health-care setup, the L2 category hospitals are meant for Covid-19 patients having mild or moderate symptoms. Besides, Santosh Medical College, an L3 category hospital, is already in operation and meant for patients requiring critical care. “All the HCWs on Covid duty will be required to make stay at home. Also, last year, HCWs over 55 years and those having comorbid conditions were not assigned Covid duties. This time, they will be assigned duties as they have received vaccine against Covid-19,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the Sanjay Nagar hospital. He said that the hospital treated about 1,900 patients from March 2020 to February 2 this year. “None of our patients succumbed to Covid-19. We resumed as non-Covid facility on February 3 this year and we will resume as dedicated Covid hospital from April 1. We have 100 beds that include 20 beds with ventilators and six high flow nasal cannula. All the 100 beds have oxygen facility,” Teotia added. The hospital is also serving as a vaccination centre and the function will now be taken up at the emergency ward of the hospital, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-no-hotel-quarantine-facility-for-medical-staff-this-time-101617214792808.html

Gautam Budh Nagar district currently has 319 active cases and more cases are being reported daily. Last year residential bodies had faced flack from people for taking decisions that were inconvenient for them such as monitoring visitors and domestic helps even before official guidelines were shared on these matters.“Till March 10 we did not have a single positive case in our society but today we have 16. When a health department team visited us today, we decided to get ahead of the situation. We have closed the gym, club and the kids’ playing area till April 15 for now. We will review the situation and take further action,” said Amit Gupta, president, Apartment Owners Association, Prateek Wisteria. He said that the swimming pool that was scheduled to open will also remain closed. Associations urged senior citizens to avoid going out as much as possible, while also requesting people to continue using masks and maintain social distancing. “We are acting on the experience of the last year. Currently there are no government orders on this. We don’t want to create any unnecessary inconvenience for the residents. But all societies are monitoring the situation closely. In case there are several positive cases, the respective association will take a call on restrictions,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association. “There are no new official orders yet (on whether there would be any restrictions). If we receive them, it will be shared with the public,” said city magistrate, Uma Shankar Singh. The district administration is working on identifying clusters, increasing surveillance and random testing has already begun at the borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-spike-in-cases-residential-bodies-in-noida-gear-up-to-tackle-covid19-101617214673559.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad fails to achieve March vaccination target, coverage at 83%||Ghaziabad: The district missed the Covid-19 vaccination target for March by more than 17% as the month ended on Wednesday. The district could achieve vaccination of about 77,475 beneficiaries till March 31 with a coverage of about 82.87%, officials said. Ghaziabad had got a March target of inoculating 93,480 beneficiaries under the category of senior citizens and people above 45 years having comorbid conditions. “We missed the target, but we have vaccinated a high number of beneficiaries at coverage of about 83%. The next round of vaccination is starting April 1 and we will try to achieve the target given by the state government. We have about 93 hospitals, including 36 private hospitals, which will take up vaccination from April 1,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. For the month of April, Ghaziabad has received a rather high target of vaccinating 216,000 beneficiaries, while neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar is to cover 162,000 beneficiaries. The target for the month of April means that authorities in Ghaziabad will have to inoculate about 7,200 people per day on an average. Experts said that the Ghaziabad authorities managed to vaccinate an average of about 2,500 beneficiaries in March as against 3015 required per day. “If they wish to achieve vaccination target for April, they will have to take up aggressive vaccination and on a campaign mode. The upcoming panchayat elections and rise in temperature will also pose hindrance. We have also written to the authorities to allow private health centres and clinics to take up vaccination so that more population is covered before any significant rise in Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president, Indian Medical Association -- Ghaziabad. Unlike the overall target given for the month of March, the state government this time has defined targets to be met on “major days” – Monday, Thursday and Friday – and also for “minor days” – Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday – as well as the weekly target assigned to each district. “On ‘major days’ when all our primary health centres (PHCs) will be working for vaccination, we will have a total of 93 health-care centres taking up vaccination. On ‘minor days’ we will have 10 government facilities and 36 private hospitals which will be taking up vaccination. We have also decided to increase individual targets for PHCs from 100 to 200 and 200 to 300,” said an officer from the district health department. On ‘major days,’ the district will have to achieve a target of vaccinating 14,000 beneficiaries each day, while on ‘minor days’ it is given a target to inoculate 4,000 people. The weekly target has also been spelt out for each of the 75 districts across the district. Ghaziabad is given a target of vaccinating 54,000 beneficiaries every week in April. The overall vaccination target given to the 75 districts of the state is 12,073,200 for April, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-fails-to-achieve-march-vaccination-target-coverage-at-83-101617214672913.html

The authority on Wednesday said for now 15-20 dog feeding points will be established while proper shelter homes for stray dogs will be set up later.The authority at present relies upon the expertise of two veterinary doctors and their respective teams to tackle the issue of stray dogs and carry out sterilisation. However, during a meeting presided by chief secretary RK Tiwari that took place on March 6, Gautam Budh Nagar commissioner of police Alok Singh had suggested that more focus was needed on the matter as feeding dogs is leading to law and order problems frequently in Noida and Greater Noida.During a meeting of the public health department last week, authority officials had said they were of the view that running shelter homes will require a lot of funds and resources. “To handle the problem on an urgent basis, feeding points will be earmarked across residential sectors in the city. We will provide our green belts as well. Dog lovers can leave the food and feed dogs at designated spots. Office bearers of residents welfare associations will be taken on board before the feeding locations are decided,” said SC Mishra, the in-charge of the public health department.The authority has one shelter home in Sector 94 but more such centres are required. Officials said the process to empanel an agency for carrying out sterilisation and immunisation of stray dogs has already been initiated. “Once the agency is finalised, we will have experts who will guide us on how to deal with the problem,” said Mishra, adding that the agency will be appointed by April 15 after evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-dog-feeding-points-in-residential-areas-101617214552820.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Man beaten to death by neighbours in Dadri||Greater Noida: A 45-year-old man was allegedly beaten to death by a group of neighbours in Dadri on Tuesday night. Police said the victim, allegedly a habitual drinker, would frequently fight with his neighbours and abuse them under influence of alcohol. The victim was identified as Ashok, a resident of Luharli village. However, Ashok’s family said that on Tuesday night, he had shouted at his family members over some issues. His daughter Aarti said that there was a ‘mundan’ (child’s head shaving) ceremony of her cousin in the house and some relatives had come for the function. “My father attended to the guests. After sometime, he shouted at family members over some issues,” she said.The complainant in the case, Sunny, who is a distant relative of the victim, said that Ashok used some “abusive words” for his family members. “At the same time, some neighbours, who were standing outside the house, believed that Ashok was abusing them. They barged into our house and thrashed Ashok,” he said.In the FIR, Sunny said that Lala alias Mehndi, Rahul, Vickku, Saurabh, Gaurav, Anshu and Sunder attacked Ashok. “Ashok collapsed on the spot after sustaining critical injuries to the head,” he said. Rajveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Dadri police station, said the victim, under the influence of alcohol, clashed with the suspects. “The suspects attacked him with sticks and also punched him. A police team reached the spot and rushed the victim to a private hospital where he was declared dead,” he said.Chauhan said police have registered a case against seven persons under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), and 302 (murder) of IPC. “We have launched a search to arrest the suspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-beaten-to-death-by-neighbours-in-dadri-101617214492697.html
31-03-2021||Gurugram||Mask indiscipline continues despite Covid 19 resurgence, police to issue more fines||With Covid-19 infections rising once again in Gurugram, the city police have begun intensifying checks on mask discipline.A senior police officer said they had issued 980 challans on March 26, 984 on March 27, 646 on March 28, and 398 on March 29, which was Holi. Police said that since March 22, 2020 they had issued close to 137,200 challans till March 29. Each challan cost a violator ₹500.Gurugram Police public relations officer Subash Boken said that the force was asked to strictly enforce the mask rule and social distancing. “Our teams are visiting markets and crowded spots. We have increased our enforcement over the last few weeks and will be even more strict in the coming days. City residents followed the health protocols on Holi as celebrations were low key,” said Boken.The west police district reported the most violations with the force issuing close to 70,000 challans.The municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) had issued fines last year over Covid-19 health protocol violations but partially suspended it in July as the focus shifted to other measures such as ensuring protocols in public places, and due to a dip in new cases. Now, the civic body awaited a government order to resume issuing fines.“The MCG can act on the matter only if there was a complaint. We can resume issuing fines if the government orders us or if there is an internal decision on the matter,” said Bijender Sharma, senior sanitary inspector, MCG.The practice of issuing challans was first ordered in March last year. Even till July last year, the civic body had not issued too many challans -- less than 6000 versus Gurugram Police;s nearly 13,000. The MCG challan too was ₹500. As per the health department, the number of Covid-19 infections reported on Wednesday was 276 and the total number of infected persons till date stood at 63,013. According to residents, there had been a discernible shift in people’s attitude towards mask and social distancing especially at Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) markets, although malls seem to have better enforcement with the security staff ensuring discipline. Even shopkeepers had stopped supplying sanitizers before entry.Rakesh Malik, president of the sector 22 market association, said, “We have asked shopkeepers to not entertain customers if they don’t wear masks but what to do if a most of them are violating rules? We want authorities to enforce masks.”Chaitalee Mandhotra, a resident of Ardee City, said that while they have managed to enforce curbs inside the colony, the nearby market was out of their hands. “It appears that in many parts of city particularly villages adjoining the sectors there is no Covid-19. No one wears a mask and enforcement is lax,” she said.Residents along the Dwarka Expressway and SPR said the authorities had to intervene. “If someone is wearing a mask voluntarily then it is fine else only few challans are being issued in developing areas. There is need to fix this situation,” said Pravin Malik, president, Sare Home RWA in sector 92.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mask-indiscipline-continues-despite-covid-19-resurgence-police-to-issue-more-fines-101617213233836.html

The three-tier panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held in four phases from April 15 onwards.The expansion was carried out with the induction of vice-presidents, general secretaries and secretaries. The exercise was aimed at strengthening the party ahead of the panchayat elections and gearing up the organisation for the state assembly elections.“Yes, we have inducted 60 more office bearers to give representation to different sections. We have accommodated young and experienced leaders alike and the total strength of UPCC office bearers has reached 125 now. We have fixed responsibilities for the new team to ensure good results,” UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu.Under the new structure, a general secretary will work as the incharge of the party’s organisation in three districts. A secretary will be in charge of a district now. As many of those appointed in the new team have worked on various posts earlier, the party is claiming to have roped in leaders from different sections and regions. “We have tried to accommodate leaders from different sections and regions. The new team will help us in strengthening the party organisation for the panchayat elections and achieving the objectives in the 2022 assembly elections,” said Lallu.“We are sure the new team will show good results under the leadership of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The party will work harder in the coming months and all leaders will be accommodated somewhere or the other,” said UPCC spokesman Surendra Rajput.Did the Congress take any steps to take along the party’s veterans and youngsters, who raised a banner of revolt soon after formation of the new UPCC?“We will make efforts to take along all those who have been left out,” said Lallu.Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Aradhna Mishra ‘Mona’ said the new team was full of energy and would work hard for the party under Priyanka Gandhi’s leadership in the 2022 assembly elections in the state.A senior party leader said a party veteran had been asked to get in touch with old guards and make efforts to bring those expelled earlier back to the party fold.“Priyanka Gandhi Vadra believes in inclusive politics. She is serious about bringing back old-timers and we hope the party will work unitedly in the coming months,” said the leader.“Bringing in new generation leaders is always welcome. But bringing new leaders at the cost of old timers, who have been loyal to the party, cannot help. You cannot strengthen the organisation by humiliating the old guard,” said Satyadev Tripathi, a former minister, who is one of the veteran leaders expelled by the party earlier.Others, however, said the party needed to work more and show results before it was considered a serious contender for power in the state. The Congress should follow its own rules about size of the UPCC.“When Ajay Kumar Lallu took over as the UPCC chief, the party talked about having a smaller team. But the party is back to having a large committee,” said a senior party leader.Another expelled leader Siraj Mehandi said the party was not giving sufficient time to its office bearers.“Lucknow city unit president Mukesh Chauhan has been removed in a few months after his appointment. Chauhan has been the choice of party workers. With new office bearers, the party needs to work at the grassroot level and show results. The party acted against its veterans and no efforts have been made to take them along. Those sitting on the top in the state are not being given proper feedback to the high command,” said Mehandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/panchayat-polls-the-first-test-for-expanded-upcc-team-101617211072722.html

Rising mercury and high speed winds coupled together to further fuel the already spreading fire.PTR deputy director (south division) Mukesh Kumar said, “The situation is alarming. Wildfire during this time of the year has no precedence in PTR. The high temperature and strong wind flow has made our task to douse it even tougher.”As per available information, the wild fire picked pace on Tuesday afternoon. Forests in critical tiger habitats such as Kujrum, Ramandag, Rud, Baresanrh and other areas were also in the grip of the fire even as the field staff and members of quick reaction team were trying to douse it.Forest fires wildfire are generally caused due to burning of dried leaves by locals for picking up Mahua fruit as they enter reserve forest to collect it.Officials have not divulged details regarding loss of wildlife due to the fire so far.“Generally, the fire season begins in May-June. But this year, it has already gripped forests in Kujrum, Ramandag, Rud and other areas. The local eco-development committee (EDC) members have been pressed into the dousing operation along with field staff,” Kumar said, adding that the unusually strong winds also rendered fire line ineffective this time.Noted wildlife expert Dr DS Srivastava said, “Lack of community participation in fire management seems to be the root cause of spread of fire to such a large scale. Locals have to be involved in forest management if such incidents are to be averted in future.”Locals burn dry leaves for Mahua picking in remote area. However, they earlier used to ensure that fire does not spread to other areas collectively. They doused it on the spot, Srivastava said, adding that no loss of wildlife was reported so far, but birds and reptiles living on ground must have suffered. Meanwhile, the fire also gripped parts of forests along National Highway-75 at Amjhariya, Siknee, Komo, Jognatand, Manika and other places.In Latehar, the local MLA rushed to the spot with a team of officials on Tuesday night on getting information about the fire approaching the district headquarters.

Sale and consumption of liquor is prohibited in Bihar for five years now. According to local residents, six deathsand seven cases of illness have been reported from Gondapur and Kharidi-Bigha villages in Nawada. The deceased have been identified as Ajay Yadav, Ramdeo Yadav, Loha Singh Thathera, Shakti Singh, Shailendra and Prabhakar Kumar Gupta. However, Nawada‘s district magistrate Yashpal Meena said, “Four deaths have been reported till nowand the bodies were cremated by the families last night,” said. The seven taken ill were referred to a private clinic in Patna. According to villagers, the victims consumed alcohol on the occasion of Holi and started vomiting, following which their family members took them to a private hospital for treatment. Most of them have been complaining of nausea, headache, vomiting and uneasiness since Tuesday morning. Nawada SP Dhurat Saayli Savlaram said, “We are investigating the matter. If the consumption of spurious liquor is established, action will be taken against all the erring officials, including SHO of the police station concerned”. Reports from Begusarai said two persons, identified as Rajkumar Sahni and Sakaldeo Choudhary, died and one Birju Sahni was critical after allegedly consuming spurious liquor.

31-03-2021||Patna||Bihar’s biggest lake left high and dry despite Ramsar tag||Kanwar lake, Asia’s largest freshwater oxbow lake and Bihar’s only Ramsar site, located in Begusarai district, is facing threat of running dry. Originally spread over 6,786 hectares, the lake has been a preferred destination for migratory birds and home to several rare aquatic species. In 1986, the state government notified it as a protected area. Later, the central government declared it as a sanctuary to stop poaching of birds. The lake, also known as Kabartal jheel, was declared a Ramsar site in July last year following a sustained campaign by environmentalists from across the world, who hoped that the state government might step in to conserve the wetland once it was designated as a wetland of international importance. The news was broken by Union environment minister Prakash Jawdekar in November 2020. However, unrestrained encroachment of land and construction of embankment on Burhi Gandak river near Majhaul village of Begusarai have choked the major water inlet to the wetland and have taken a toll. “Excessive use of groundwater for irrigation in the protected area has taken a toll on the rich biodiversity of the lake and created a kind of climate crisis in the region,” says Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB). Ghosh, also an environment expert who carried out a research on biodiversity of the lake, said size of the wetland has reduced considerably over the last few decades owing to encroachment by individuals and dumping of municipal waste. “I have seen the lake speared on around 7,000 hectares in 1986, which has now been reduced to a little over 2500 hectares,” he said. Kumar Deepak, environment officer of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), who was part of the team that carried out economic evaluation of the lake under a Government of India (GOI) project during 2016-17, said the natural water reservoir was serving the society in many ways, including income generation through fishery, keeping water table up in the vicinity, promoting tourism and being part of the local culture. “The huge stretch of wetland also absorbs considerable amount of water during the flooding and offers land for cultivation during the summers. About 165 plant species, 394 animal species, including 221 variety of birds, were recorded to be present around the lake, which is also home to 53 migratory birds, including some rare ones,” says Deepak. Water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said the department would assess the situation and take corrective steps. “Engineers would be asked to see how the natural outflow of Burhi Gandak could be restored,” Jha said. Dipak Kumar Singh, principal secretary of forest and environment, said the department would seek help of water resources department to ensure flow of water from Burhi Gandak to the lake. Singh said the lake area often witness land dispute and the district magistrate had been asked to settle the issue so that actual expanse of the waterbody could be identified. “Nearly 3,000 hectares out of the total 6,700 hectares covered by the lake are said to be private holding. The department would soon come out with a comprehensive plan to protect and develop the wetland,” said Singh.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||You were duty-bound to file FIR against Deshmukh, HC tells Param Bir Singh||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh why he did not lodge a police complaint against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh if he was aware of alleged wrongdoing being committed by the leader.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also said that without an FIR the high court cannot intervene and direct for an independent agency like CBI to carry out an investigation.Singh, who was shifted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner on March 17, had initially approached the Supreme Court, alleging that he was transferred after he complained to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders about the "corrupt malpractices" of Deshmukh. The top court had, however, asked him to approach the high court.After his transfer, Singh had claimed that Deshmukh asked police officer Sachin Waze and others to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars and restaurants. But the minister has denied any wrongdoing."You (Singh) are a senior police officer. You are not a layman. You were duty-bound to register a complaint against any wrongdoing. Despite knowing that an offence is being committed by your boss, you (Singh) remained silent," Chief Justice Datta said.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Singh, seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh. He filed the criminal PIL in the high court on March 25.On Wednesday, after hearing the arguments at length, the court reserved its order on the preliminary objections raised by the state government and the reliefs sought by Singh.The court also reserved its order on three other petitions filed by two lawyers and a professor seeking independent probe in the case.The court, while hearing the arguments noted that when Singh had himself not heard Deshmukh make those statements asking police to extort money, then the allegations would amount to hearsay.The bench sought to know if any civilian had lodged a complaint with the police in this matter. The court was then informed by Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that advocate Jayshri Patil had lodged a complaint with the Malabar Hill police station in south Mumbai on March 21, but no FIR has been registered yet.Patil, who has also filed a petition in the HC, told the bench that she had in her complaint to the police sought for FIR to be registered into the charges levelled by Singh.The court then asked Kumbhakoni if any inquiry has been carried out by the police, and also asked him to produce the station diary of the police station.The court also asked why the police was hesitant to lodge FIR and then carry out its probe."Why are you ashamed? What is wrong if FIR is filed? What heavens will fall on the accused? This will only set the criminal law in motion," Chief Justice Datta said, adding that since FIRs are not lodged, people are forced to approach courts.Kumbhakoni later told the court that the station diary could not be produced before the court immediately, but there is no entry in the diary of the complaint filed by Patil.The bench said that Singh had the option of either lodging a complaint with the police or file an application before a magistrate.Singh's counsel Vikram Nankani told the court that Singh wanted to avoid this "chakravyuh" (labyrinth).The court, however, noted that this was the procedure laid down in law. "Are you saying that you are above the law? Is the law only for common man and not you?" Chief Justice Datta asked.The court said that if Singh does not trust the state police to carry out a fair probe, then he has the option of approaching the magistrate's court."You (Singh) are saying that since the state home minister is involved so the state police would not carry out fair probe. What if in future, god forbid, the allegation is against the Prime Minister or the Union Home Minister, who will probe then?" Chief Justice Datta asked."Do you want some superpower from outside? Who does the CBI work under?" the court asked.Nankani argued that Singh did not have any other option than to approach the HC as the complaint and the allegations are against the "very head of the state administration".The court further asked Nankani if any statements, as alleged by Singh in the petition against Deshmukh that he had asked police officers to extort money, was made by the home minister in Singh's presence."Otherwise this is nothing but hearsay," it said.The bench said that without an FIR it cannot pass an order directing an independent agency to investigate. It said that only in rare and unusual cases, the courts interfere and order probe.The court further asked if a PIL is maintainable when the issue pertains to a service matter."You (Singh) have an axe to grind with the minister (Deshmukh). It is not a case that you do not have any ties with the minister," the court said.To this, Nankani said the PIL has got nothing to do with Singh's transfer order.Kumbhakoni, appearing for the Maharashtra government, sought dismissal of the petition with exemplary cost and said the plea was filed with personal vendetta."The PIL is not filed in public interest, but is riddled with personal grievances and interests. The petitioner has come to this court with dirty hands and dirty mind," Kumbhakoni said."This is a classic and textbook case of personal enmity and grudge," he argued.Singh, in his petition, claimed that Deshmukh had asked police officers, including Waze, who has been arrested by the NIA in the case of bomb scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house, to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars and restaurants.The PIL also raised the issue of alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in the state.Kumbhakoni further told the HC that the state government was eager and anxious to clear the cloud of suspicion and allegations against Deshmukh.Nankani argued that the entire police force was demoralised and working under pressure due to interference from the political masters.He added that Singh was constrained to approach the HC as no action was taken by the government."On Tuesday, the government has announced that a committee has been set up to look into the allegations. Our contention is that this is not adequate," Nankani said.Kumbhakoni told the court that the committee has not been set up under the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act and hence does not have any statutory provisions.Singh has filed the PIL in the HC, reiterating his charges against Deshmukh and seeking an "immediate, unbiased, impartial" probe by the CBI against Deshmukh, an NCP leader.Kumbhakoni argued that Singh in his complaint letter to the chief minister has said that his relation with Deshmukh was strained.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the CBI, told the court that the agency would abide by whatever order the court passes.In his PIL, Param Bir Singh also accused Deshmukh of routinely interfering in police investigations and putting pressure on him to implicate BJP leaders in the case of suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar.Singh also sought a direction from the HC to the CBI to secure CCTV footage of Deshmukh's residence from earlierthis year before it was "destroyed", and a direction to the state government to produce all records of communication received from IPS officer Rashmi Shukla in March 2020.

31-03-2021||Pune||PMC to not pick up wet garbage from “bulk generators”||From April 1, 2021, onwards, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will not collect wet waste of 792 bulk generating establishments in the city. The bulk generating establishments that produce more than 100 kg of wet waste per day were given a choice to take the help of private companies to dispose of the garbage. On the background of the Covid-19 situation, the PMC will concentrate on the commercial establishment first. For the past year, the PMC has been creating awareness and warning bulk generators including big residential societies, government, and private establishments. In December 2020, the PMC solid waste department set a deadline of March 31, 2021for bulk generators to make arrangements or set up a system to process garbage within their premises. Starting today, the PMC will not pick up wet garbage from bulk generators. The PMC will act and charge ₹5,000 on the first instance if the society is not processing the garbage. In the second instance, the PMC will charge ₹10,000. In the third instance, the PMC will charge ₹15,000. After that, if the society or establishment continues to disobey the rule, the PMC will charge ₹15,000 each time. As per the data of the solid waste management department, there are a total of 1,403 bulk waste generators. The number of residential societies are more in comparison to the commercial establishments. Of that, 792 have not set up any mechanism until March 31, 2021, and the remaining 611 generators are processing garbage. Some generators, especially residential housing societies, are outsourcing private composite site facilities. The maximum bulk generators are falling in the Hadapsar-Mundhwa area. The total number is 201 of that, 137 establishments are not processing the garbage. The PMC calculates 450 grams of waste per person. In a five-member family, the PMC considers two kilograms of garbage generation. Kunal Khemnar, PMC’s additional municipal commissioner said, “The bulk generators should appoint a private agency to process wet garbage. The PMC is ready to pick up dry garbage but, the PMC will not pick up garbage from bulk generators after March 31, 2021, and impose a fine as per law. However, we are concentrating on the commercial establishments.” As per the solid waste management rules 2016, a “bulk waste generator” includes buildings occupied by the Central government departments or undertakings, state government departments or undertakings, local bodies, public sector undertakings or private companies, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, colleges, universities, or other educational institutions, hostels, hotels, commercial establishments, markets, places of worship, stadium and sports complexes having an average waste generation rate exceeding 100 kg per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-not-pick-up-wet-garbage-from-bulk-generators-101617208012453.html

The state’s immediate concern remains availability of vaccines as well as sufficient number of data entry operators as it plans to ramp up its vaccination session sites from existing 1,700 to 2,500 in the next few days to meet the vaccination requirement of the 45 years and above age group. “We need vaccines in sufficient quantity before we can increase the number of session sites,” said an official who did not wish to be named. Given the shortage, the state is rotating vaccines from underperforming cold chain points to districts where vaccine utilisation was more, adding to logistics issues. The health department has also written to district magistrates (DMs) to make available data entry operators, who are used as “verification officers” at the vaccination centres. “We have sufficient vaccinators, but do not have as many data entry operators in our department. We have requested DMs to make them available through different departments so that we can increase the number of vaccination session sites,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. On the availability of vaccines, he said the state had enough to sustain at least another four days after it began vaccinating the 45 years and above age cohort of population. “The Centre has committed to send additional 8 lakh doses of vaccine on April 2 to add to the tally of 33 lakh doses, which it has sent so far since the commencement of the vaccination drive on January 16,” said Kumar. It will, however, take at least two days for the vaccines to reach around 700 cold chain points after their arrival at the state vaccine depot in Patna. “The Centre has given us an assurance that it will not allow any shortage of vaccines in the state. It does not want the vaccines to remain idle,” he said. The Centre does not want states to build up inventory. It wants the vaccines to be in continuous circulation and use. “We want to vaccinate at least 2 lakh doses of vaccines every day after attaining a vaccination figure of 1.40 lakh doses in a day before the Holi festival,” added Kumar. The state has decided to rope in around 4.5 lakh government school teachers and children to encourage eligible family members take the jab. It will also involve around 1 crore Jeevika (women self-help group) workers and urban local body members as motivators. Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar and principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit addressed a joint video conference with district education officers in this regard on Wednesday. The health department plans to use its existing health sub-centres as session sites. Of the 10,800 health sub-centres, there are only around 3,000 facilities housed in three-room accommodation, which is the minimum requirement for a vaccination session site. After primary health centres, Bihar has rolled out vaccination centres to the level of health and wellness centres, with 1,700 of them being functional in the state. Around 100 of the existing 1,700 vaccination session sites in the state were private facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/availability-of-vaccines-data-entry-operators-worry-for-bihar-101617208013171.html

The demands come at a time when the PCB is facing a severe shortage of funds even to carry out developmental activities in the area. The stall holders’ body which represents 448 legal vendors have expressed the desire to bear the cost of clearing, loading, and unloading the material. The letter specifically mentions bearing the costs of clearing off debris from the spot. “We want the entire area to be cleared off the debris as businesses need to be restarted. All our vendors have sustained losses and removal of debris will take more than ten days. Also, new wiring must be put in place and the entire infrastructure upgradation will take a month. Vendors are ready to pool in funds and there is a lot of pressure on the association to start the market as families are without livelihood since Friday with no financial help and relief from the state so far,” said Yusuf Khan, vice president of the Sanstha. Fashion Street vendors further added that there should not be any further delay in starting the market as the financial crisis was staring in their faces. Over 600 shops were completely gutted after a major fire broke out at the famous Fashion Street market in the Camp area of Pune late on Friday night, officials said. While there were no casualties in the blaze, the head of Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) fire department Prakash Hasabe was killed in a road accident while returning home after dousing fire. The PCB administration is facing a severe shortage of funds as GST revenues worth ₹200 crores have yet not been released by the Central government despite persistent demands to the effect. The PCB does not have any funds to either repair and restore the historic Chhatrapati Shivaji Market and even Fashion Street. The victims at both places are running from pillar to post seeking funds from parliamentarians, legislators, board administration, the district administration, and CSR funds so that their lost businesses can be restored. The Pune district collector after seeking individual reports from the PCB administration, Pune police, and tehsildar will present a report before deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar who will then issue directions to the administration. The board has already petitioned the district collector seeking ₹5 crores for the restoration of Shivaji Market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/stallholders-association-seeks-pcb-permission-to-remove-debris-at-fashion-street-101617207652482.html

31-03-2021||Pune||Police posers rob senior citizens in Wakad||In yet another case of citizens getting robbed by men posing as policemen, an elderly couple was robbed of gold jewellery worth ₹1,85,000 on Tuesday morning in Wakad. A complaint was lodged by a 77-year-old man who was walking with his wife along the road that connects Chhatrapati chowk to Kalewadi phata, according to the complaint. The complainant was identified as Ramchandra Sadashiv Panchgade (77), a businessman living in a residential complex in Kaspate Vasti area of Wakad. The two approached the pedestrian couple around 10 am and told them that they were policemen. “Two people approached them on a two-wheeler and said that there has been a murder in the area and that the two senior citizens need to meet their fake senior officer who was standing ahead on the couple’s walking route. They went to the third man who asked them questions and said that the woman needs to remove her jewellery. As they were very old, they pretended to help them remove the jewellery and put it in the cloth bag that the couple was carrying and then tied 3-4 knots on the bag. By the time, the couple could open the knots and check, these men had fled,” said PSI Maksood Karim Maner of Wakad police station. A case under Sections 170 (personating a public servant), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Wakad police station.

31-03-2021||Pune||Another case of ATM jackpotting in Pune||The ATM of another private bank was hit in a method similar to that of four ATMs of another bank that fell prey to the jackpotting attack. The officials of the major private bank have approached the Pune police cyber-crime cell but have not lodged an official complaint yet, according to senior police inspector S Hake who recently took charge of the cyber-crime police station. Two cases have been registered in the attack mounted on four ATMs of the first bank while only one incident was reported from the second bank in Pune. The bank officials told the police that their ATM in Delhi has also been targeted in a similar attack. “The operating system used in these ATMs is Windows XP and these are the type of kiosks which have space to go behind,” said PI Hake. The ATM of the second bank, which had not lodged an official complaint yet, is located in Sasanenagar area of Pune and is estimated to have lost ₹7 lakh. The first victim bank lost close to ₹30 lakh in the four attacks. However, a senior officer of the cyber cell suspects that more than four ATMs of the first victim bank have been attacked. The two cases registered include one at Shivajinagar and one at Marketyard police station. The cyber-crime cell officials are tracking the two suspects. “ATMs running on Windows XP are more vulnerable to this attack. Windows OS (operating system) should be updated to newer versions. In India, a considerably large number of ATMs are running on Windows XP. It is high time that these OS are updated. Also, communication between cash dispenser and ATM core software should be encrypted,” reads a part of a skeletal report on ATM jackpotting published by a government agency called National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) which is run by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO). The NTRO was formed in 2004 and is under the ambit of the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), according to its website. This minimal report on jackpotting was published in 2018 when jackpotting attacks were reported on a large scale in America.In this form of attack, the connection between the ATM and the bank servers is cut off and the machine is tricked into dispensing more amount than what is entered during withdrawal. This is done by inserting manually inserting a device at the back of the ATM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/another-case-of-atm-jackpotting-in-pune-101617207232484.html

It will reduce the travel time between Meerut and Delhi to 50 minutes. Project director of the expressway Mudit Garg said that eventually the e-way would be operational from Thursday and traffic would be allowed on it from both sides. He said that a bridge near Chipiyana was still under construction, otherwise the entire 14-lane expressway would be operational. The toll barriers are also ready and files for approval of toll rates are with the ministry. Hopefully everything would be finalized within a week. Garg said that toll on the expressway would be collected only through FASTag and cameras had been fitted at different locations to keep commuters aware about their speed. The permissible speed on the expressway is 100 kms per hour for cars and 80 kms per hour for other vehicles. The toll on the expressway would be collected through scanning of number plates of vehicles and arrangements are being made with traffic department to send e-challan for violation of traffic rules and speed limits. The expressway will reduce travel time between Meerut and Delhi to 50 minutes. At present, commuters travel through NH 58 to reach Delhi and it takes over three hours to cover a distance of 70 kms. Commuters to Ghaziabad, Modinagar and Noida will also take less time to reach their destination. The expressway will also reduce travel time of commuters from Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Haridwar and Dehradun to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-meerut-e-way-opens-today-101617202313242.html

The result is hampering the sanitisation and contact tracing methods of the civic body. The civic body has also stopped posting banners and posters of micro- containment zones at buildings with multiple active cases. As the surge in cases continues to remain highest in Pune, the civic staff is not only involved in containing the virus, but also vaccinating citizens. A huge society which currently has more than 15 active cases from different families in Hadapsar, has not had any sanitisation done by the civic body, nor any officials coming in for contact tracing. Tanishka Gowda, a resident of Vardhaman Township which has these cases said, “We did not have any sanitisation done by the civic body. The society members took the job in hand and did it themselves. None of the civic officials came for contact tracing or put up the posters. We have delivery guys coming in and out every day. After much follow up the civic body did send a person but he was down with fever and said that he himself had to undergo a test.”Prashant Ranpise, chief of the PMC fire department, said, “We have long stopped doing sanitisation. Earlier, the health department staff would provide us with the required equipment and our men would sanitise the places. We have 10 members of the fire department currently positive. We did do sanitisation in the earlier months of the pandemic, but with fire incidents in the city and a shortage of staff we have stopped doing so.” Contact tracing and sanitising of a Covid-19 positive patient’s premises is crucial, as per the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) protocol to control the spread of the infection. As of Monday, the PMC claims to have traced 37,35,685 contacts for 2,59,112 Covid-19 cases, of which 9,64,295 are high-risk contacts and 27,71,390 are low-risk contacts. So, 14.4 contacts have been traced per case. However the central team in its last visit to the city had said that most of the contact tracing is limited to only family members of the patients and does not include social or professional contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sanitisation-contact-tracing-efforts-of-pmc-hampered-by-infected-overworked-staff-101617202312301.html

The BJP has also demanded a provision of ₹500 crore for the city, warning the state against a lockdown in Pune.A BJP delegation met Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Vikram Kumar, and demanded an increase in testing and vaccination in the city. Pune member of Parliament (MP) Girish Bapat, mayor Murlidhar Mohol, city president Jagdish Mulik, standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane, house of leader in the PMC, Ganesh Bidkar, and former MLA Bapu Pathare, were part of the delegation.Bapat said, “We demanded the PMC increase its rate of testing as well as vaccination centres. Private hospitals have shown a positive response to the demand for beds. The state government should provide funds for Pune city to tackle the Covid-19 situation.”Jagdish Mulik, BJP city president said, “The state government should provide ₹500 crore to Pune city to control Covid-19. PMC is doing good work, but unfortunately the state government is deliberately ignoring its efforts. To control the pandemic is the duty of the state government. Despite that, PMC is doing remarkable work. Instead of helping people, the state has more interest in imposing a lockdown.”He further added, “The state should have to give packages to people as they are facing financial problems. We will conduct an agitation against the state government if it imposes a lockdown in the city.”Murlidhar Mohol, mayor, said, “We have instructed the PMC administration to increase vaccination and testing centres. We have also instructed an increase of five Covid-19 call centres to get updated information on the situation, like bed availability, ambulance service, testing centres, vaccination centres. The centres will work 24x7.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-demands-rs500-crore-in-funds-for-pune-to-fight-covid19-101617201712251.html

As of Tuesday, a cumulative 6.65 lakh beneficiaries have got their first dose of Covid vaccine in the district. As most beneficiaries get the vaccine each day, some session sites ran out of doses and had to shut down the centres early on Wednesday.The administration had to shut down session sites at nine talukas in rural Pune, while in the city a few private hospitals could not start the vaccination process.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health chief, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), confirmed the shortage of vaccines and said, “It is true that there is a shortage of doses and a few private hospitals have said that they had to shut the vaccination centres as they do not have doses. We had distributed all the doses which we had got at our storage, except for 700 odd doses, to the private and government centres.”“The hospitals schedule their appointments as per the doses available with them so no one is sent back. However, we will get a fresh stock of doses by Wednesday evening which we will distribute by late night,” she said.Ayush Prasad, Zilla Parishad, chief executive officer, said, “We had to stop vaccination at Junnar, Purandar, Bhor, Velha, Mulshi, Haveli, Daund, Ambegaon and Purandar. We also had to reallocate vaccines from some of our own sites to the other centres where we did not have enough vaccines. For Tuesday and Wednesday (March 30-31) we had only 20,000 doses which we had received from Solapur earlier.”At least 39,385 beneficiaries got vaccinated on Wednesday and the numbers are likely to increase as more people become eligible to get the vaccine from today.The government has opened vaccination for all above 45 years of age with or without comorbidities which earlier was restricted to only those with comorbidities in the age group of 45-59. With the district reporting maximum new cases in the state, the district administration is rushing to vaccinate a maximum number of people even as only a limited stock comes for every week.Dist gets fresh stock of 3.25 lakh dosesOn Wednesday evening, Pune received a fresh stock of 3,25,780 lakh doses of Covishield out of which PMC got 1,40,000 doses, Pune rural got 1,40,000 doses and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) got 45,780 doses and in the next few days, the district is expected to receive one more lakh doses of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shortage-of-covid-vaccine-hits-inoculation-drive-at-some-centres-in-pune-dist-101617201352249.html

Tuesday’s decision came as a bid to curb the crowd in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases in the Maharashtra city.However, a day later, people could be seen queuing up to pay the fee and collect their receipts at the city’s Cidco market on Wednesday morning, defeating the purpose of the move, even as police struggled to control the crowd.Some were not happy with the fee. “The new rule makes no sense. I had to pay ₹10 for two hours only to check the availability of a few things in the market,” said Aditi Kulkarni, a student.According to police officials, charges of ₹5 are applicable for an hour. Anyone found overstaying will be fined ₹500 under relevant sections of the Bombay Police Act.Justifying the decision, Nashik police commissioner Deepak Pandey said, “We have adopted a different approach. The intention behind charging ₹5 is to control the crowd and contain the Covid-19 surge.”The city has already witnessed lockdown twice during weekends this month. The state government is now planning stricter measures across Maharashtra to control the spread of the virus.Recently, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had also pointed out that people were not wearing face masks in public places, marriage halls were allowing more than the allowed number of guests, people were crowding market places and not observing social distancing and private offices were calling to work more than 50 per cent of staff in one go.However, the state has, for now, ruled out a lockdown, but could implement stricter curbs from the next week, said reports. The state government is likely to decide on shutting down restaurants, hotels, theatres and reducing business house hours in a meeting slated to be chaired by Thackeray this weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/to-tackle-rising-covid-cases-nashik-charges-5-for-hour-long-market-visit-101617197391986.html

Singh said he received the court’s copy of the withdrawal of the case on Tuesday, which he shared on social media, thanking the UP government for it. He said the case had been withdrawn based on the report given by the assistant prosecution officer.The former DSP said he was harassed by the then government and his department bosses because of the action taken by him against Ansari and eventually had to resign and also face vandalism charges.Singh said the chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court in Varanasi ordered the withdrawal of the case against him on March 6. The FIR against him was filed at the Cantt police station in Varanasi for allegedly creating a ruckus at the district magistrate’s office. Singh was arrested and sent to jail.Asked whether he would rejoin the police force, Singh stated that he was busy with an organic farmhouse in rural Lucknow and quite happing with it.Recalling the incident, a retired DIG said Singh was in-charge of the Varanasi unit of the UP STF. The force was vigilant about gangs of Mukhtar Ansari and Krishna Nand Rai, after a shootout between them in Lucknow in 2003 following which some suspicious mobile phone numbers were put on electronic surveillance.“One suspicious conversation about a deal of providing a light machine gun (LMG) for ₹1 crore was intercepted by the STF. On the basis of this call, Singh claimed that Ansari was dealing with a fugitive army man to add LMG in his armoury,” the DIG said. He said Singh and his team arrested two people from Varanasi’s Chaubepur and recovered the LMG and cartridges on January 25, 2004, after which the POTA case was filed against Ansari and his henchmen.The investigation revealed that the mobile number, on which the LMG deal was carried out, was issued in the name of Ansari’s henchman. Political pressure started building up on the police after the FIR under POTA showing involvement of Ansari in the illegal purchase of the LMG, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/case-against-ex-dsp-who-slapped-pota-on-mukhtar-withdrawn-after-17-yrs-101617196611972.html
31-03-2021||Pune||Manufacturers unhappy with govt’s decision to reserve 80% of oxygen supply for medical use||PUNE A day after the state government issued orders to oxygen manufacturers to reserve 80 per cent of their output for medical purpose in the light of rising Covid-19 cases, various manufacturing units from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad have criticised the decision saying the diktat is unjust.The fabrication units, which require oxygen on a large scale, lamented that the government’s decision to supply only 20 per cent oxygen for industries will adversely affect the production.According to the new order issued under Disaster Control Act, Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra Essential Services Act, the 80:20 oxygen supply ratio will be effective till June 30, 2021.“In a normal situation, 80 per cent of oxygen output is used by industries, whereas 20 per cent for medical purpose. But now with the reversal of the ratio, it will have an impact on industries considering oxygen is basic gas which is used in all manufacturing companies,” said Bhushan Sahani, Sahani Gas Industries, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Bhosari.“As of now, the demand for oxygen for medical purpose is not high like last year (during the first wave). The demand has increased a bit in the last few days,” he said.The district currently has an oxygen requirement of 135 metric tonnes, which is fulfilled as there is an availability of 370 metric tonnes of oxygen.“If allocated cylinders for medical purpose as per the 80:20 ratio goes unsold then it will be a loss to the manufacturer as he will not be able to sell the same cylinders to industrialists. We are not against providing cylinders to hospitals, but the 80:20 ratio is harsh,” said one of the manufacturers from Bhosari on the request of anonymity.Sandeep Belsare, president, Pimpri-Chinchwad small-scale industries association, said, “Last year due to a similar order, rate of oxygen cylinders saw an upward trend and gave rise to black marketing. With this order, the government should also bring out GR that states the rates of oxygen cylinders will not rise.”Last year, the small scale industries had demanded the government to open a 1,000-tonne oxygen manufacturing plant in Chakan, but the work has still not started.“Chakan plant could have been a major relief for industrialists. Last year one oxygen cylinder (7 cubic metres) which cost ₹140 rose to ₹1,000. Such things should not happen this time as industrialists have already suffered in the last year. With the situation still not as bad like it was last year, the order could have been issued later,” said Belsare.The experts from the health sector, meanwhile, have welcomed the move.“The government order on oxygen is in the right direction as the spread of the second wave is much more rapid than it was during the first wave. The health sector has little time to prepare for the crisis. Only vaccinating people cannot be considered as a preventive step; we should be prepared for the worst,” said Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer at Symbiosis hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/manufacturers-protest-govt-s-decision-to-reserve-80-of-oxygen-supply-for-medical-use-101617196311920.html

31-03-2021||Delhi||Proposing a new governance structure for Delhi||The passage of the Government of National Capital Territory (GNCT) Bill sets the stage for a new cycle of confrontation between the Centre and the Delhi government. The new law circumscribes the already limited powers divested by the GNCT 1991 to the elected government. It does this by emphasising that “the expression ‘government’ referred to in any law to be made by the Legislative Assembly shall mean the Lieutenant Governor (L-G)”, drastically expanding the Centre’s powers.To a layperson, Delhi looks like any other Indian state, given that it has an assembly and a chief minister. In reality, it is a Union Territory (UT), despite the 69th amendment transferring limited powers to an elected government in 1991. All successive central governments continued to retain control over land, police and public order, with power exercised via the L-G. Taking a long view, it is important to recognise two things about Delhi. First, Delhi’s administrative arrangements have been unsatisfactory over the last 20 years. Second, changes resulting from the GNCT amendment are unlikely to improve governance and will make Delhi an outlier with respect to federal capitals.Also Read | NCT Bill gets presidential assent, L-G gets sweeping powers over DelhiBroadly speaking, there are three ways in which the governance of capital cities in federal countries have been organised. First, some capitals are organised as federal districts (Abuja, Brasilia, Canberra, Washington DC), with varying degrees of federal control over them. Second, some are organised as city-states (Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires), where the city government also carries out state functions. The third model is that of a city-in-a-state (Bern, Ottawa) where the capital is a municipality, under the state government. In the latter two models, there may be federal lands within the state or city boundary under federal jurisdiction, but the federal government has no hand in the governance of the broader metropolitan region.As a UT, Delhi is best compared with other federal districts. Abuja, Canberra, Brasilia and Washington DC share certain features with Delhi. Each of these territories lacks full statehood. Abuja is the most centralised where Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is a federal ministry. This is followed by Washington DC, where the Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council. The Congress is presently debating a bill to provide DC with full statehood. In structure and form, Canberra and Brasilia are closest to Delhi, with popularly elected governments. While lacking full statehood, governments in both Brasilia and Canberra face no federal encumbrances in the day-to-day business of governance. Furthermore, both these capitals have significant powers over land and public security.What distinguishes Delhi from other federal districts is sheer size. Its population would subsume the populations of the above-mentioned cities. Its closest peer is Mexico City. In a significant development, Mexico City was upgraded from federal district to the country’s 32nd state in 2016. This was driven by the desire to provide more responsive government for residents.Among Capitals, Delhi’s governing structure is by far the most convoluted with a multiplicity of overlapping sub-national jurisdictions, including the Delhi government, New Delhi Municipal Council, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and Cantonment Board, each supervised by a different agency or government. Further, there are over 100 para-statal institutions involved in providing different services, often duplicating each other’s works in Delhi. An important step towards improving the management of metropolitan region would be to rationalise these bodies.Decentralisation of decision-making is important. There are alternative ways in which both the central government as well as local authorities can partake jointly in the management of the city. This might be achieved by a two-tier metropolitan authority. The first tier could be based on elected municipal councils for each of Delhi’s 11 revenue districts. These municipal authorities could provide local services (local roads, garbage, schools and public health, parks) and certainly be more responsive than existing local arrangements. The executive from these municipalities could then be brought together institutionally with the central representatives in a regional government with responsibility for land and infrastructure planning.For comparison, Mexico City, in addition to an elected governor, now has elected mayors for its 16 boroughs, and the state legislature is composed of a mix of directly elected and local representatives. In Australia, the Sydney metropolitan area is divided into 31 local governments, with the state government playing a coordinating role.Control over policing has been a major point of contention in Delhi. With the lone exception of Abuja, in other federal districts, the local governments have jurisdiction over at least some aspects of policing. Though the Australian Federal Police provide services for the Government of the Australian Capital Territory, it is done in agreement and under oversight with the Territory Government. It is the same in Washington DC. For Delhi, one option could be to provide municipalities with enforcement powers exercised through community police officers to ensure civil compliance, whereas the Delhi Police deals with criminal issues. The second option might be to transfer the Delhi Police from the Union home ministry to the new (jointly managed) Regional Government, while, as is presently the case, central armed police forces continue maintain security at central assets. Delhi’s governance needs a new re-imagination. Learning from international examples, and conceptualising a new structure, can be a way forward.

Yet, the city sometimes cannot bear the untold story and exposes the ancient remnants of a settlement to reveal hidden chapter of Pune’s past. Our journey so far tells us that the original settlement of Pune city situated at the confluence of various streams meeting the river Mutha. Streams such as Ambil Odha, Middle Odha and Nagzhari, flowing from the Katraj hills meet the river and their deposition on the either sides helped create safe mounds for habitation. It is around these areas one finds the original settlement of Pune growing in early medieval times.People tend to associate sacred importance to places of transition or transcendence, both in the physical and spiritual world. The concept of sacred tirtha originates from such ideas and one sees birth of a Tirthakshetra. Pune being a city of confluences of rivers and streams was no exception and the “sacred headquarters” of Rashtrakuta and Shilahara dynastic copperplates slowly take shape in the form of a sacred complex on banks of Mutha during the Yadava period.The Yadava dynasty, one of the most prominent early medieval dynasties of Maharashtra, ruled during the 12th century to 14th century CE from the capital of Deogiri, present day Daulatabad. It was the first dynasty which predominately used the Marathi language in their epigraphs and governance. This era saw a significant rise of Vaishnava Bhagwat sampradaya in the Deccan, and most Yadava kings claimed Vaishnava affiliations. The earlier predominantly Shaiva Maharashtra saw an extraordinary syncretism of Shaiva and Vaishnava cults and rise of several sects such as Varkaris, Nath, Datta Sampradaya and Mahanubhavas. Hemadri a polymath and prime minister who served three Yadava kings, was author of “Chaturvarga – Chintamani”, an encyclopaedic socio- religious treatise which laid a new way of religious life. In his “Tirthakhanda” chapter, he identified many important sacred tirthas and pilgrimages to these sacred sites became part of religious practice.Text of “Bhima Mahatmya” informs us of a rather interesting mythology of origin of river Mula and Mutha. It narrates the story of king Gajanak who was performing penance on the Bhimashankar mountain in service of lord Shiva. Lord Indra felt insecure about his position due to an anticipated Shiva’s boon to king Gajanak. He ordered two apsaras (celestial damsels) to create an obstacle in Gajanaka’s penance. Gajanaka, realising this conspiracy, cursed the apsaras and turned them into rivers. When the two apsaras apologised and asked for reversal of course, they were told that the confluence with the river Bhima will release them of the curse and they would be back to their original form. Such associations with the bigger sacred landscapes highlights the importance of Pune as a sacred place and helps realise the merit of pilgrimage. If we traverse the banks of river Mutha around Shaniwarwada today, the remnants of the Yadava period ghat leading to the river can be seen. Near the present Thorla Shaikh Salla Dargah, one comes across fairly well preserved stone staircase built with T-shaped dressed stones. For lack of datable markers it was not paid attention to, until recently. The retaining wall of the bank came crashing down a decade ago, and two incredible marvels of the Yadava period were exposed in the form of intricately dressed stones of two temples, known as Narayaneshwar and Punyeshwar. The memory of existence of these two temples was documented in Purandare Daftar, but it was only this revelation which provided us with real evidence. Local historian Pandurang Balkawade was instrumental in cleaning and shifting the remains to a museum of the Bharat Itihas Samshodhak Mandal in Pune where they are available for public viewing. The remains though, are not enough to give us a complete idea of the two temple structures help us arrive at following conjectures.The temple of Narayaneshwar was located near the banks opposite Shaniwadwada, next to the present Shivaji bridge and temple, given that Punyeshwar was located near Kumbharwada and the old Kumbhar Ves near the municipal corporation bridge.Both the temples were built in highly ornamental carved stones in dry masonry, colloquially known as hemandpanti style. These temples technically could be of Bhumija or Nagara mode, which was the prevalent style during the Yadava period. The Narayaneshwar temple doorway elements reveal that it was a probably a Vaishnava temple or a combined Shiva-Vishnu temple. The doorway of this temple has five shakha or decorative strips which are carved with Dashavtaras, or the 10 Vishnu incarnations. The Vaishanva dwarpalas are seen along with Garuda, a handsome Vamana, and vidarna Narasimha slaying Hiranyakshapu. The important evidences of existence of Narayaneshwar temple are seen embedded in structural elements of Thorla Shaikh Salla Dargah in the form of ornate central pillars of sabhamandapa and corbelled roof, even today. A highly ornate doorway at Dhakta Shaikh Salla Dargah stands testimony to temple of Punyeshwar. Overall, the sculptural quality of fragments indicates presence of fully developed temples with classical artistic Yadava expression.The location of Kumbharwada and Ves (gateway) might have been the boundary of the sacred Yadava era settlement during this period and one can witness few Yadava period herostones located there, even today. A few temple remains of a doorway and a broken lady figurine are seen at the Baloba Munja shrine near Surya hospital. A few more herostones from this era are scattered around the lanes of Kasba peth. The tale of these unknown heroes is for some other time. In the year 1994-95, a handsome sculpture of lord Vishnu was found by Dr Padmakar Prabhune near the Vaikuntha cremation grounds on the banks of river Mutha. This one-metre tall samabhanga sculpture has two arms, one in varada mudra and one akimbo. Shankha and chakra are seen on the shoulders and the icon wears a tall karandaka mukuta crown. The sculpture has a distinct south Indian influence and may belong to the late Yadava or Vijayanagara period. It is presently placed in a museum at Deccan College. These remains, however, do not shade light on the makers of the handsome monumental marvels. The sacred core of the Yadava era in Pune, however, could not stand against the whirling political winds from the north and were lost permanently from the map of Pune. The violent tale of the political and cultural upheaval of Deccan and Pune is for forthcoming columns!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-temple-fragments-expose-pune-s-yadava-era-footprints-101617188513402.html
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||UP MLA Mukhtar Ansari produced in Mohali court in extortion case||Days after the Supreme Court ordered the shifting of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail in Punjab to Banda prison in Uttar Pradesh, the BSP MLA was brought to a Mohali court under tight security on Wednesday in connection with a case of extortion and criminal intimidation. Ansari, who was produced in the courtroom in a wheelchair, was brought from the Ropar jail in an ambulance with a UP registration number with police escorting the vehicle. The MLA from Mau in UP is facing trial in an extortion case based on the complaint of a builder in Sector 70, Mohali. The next date of hearing in the case is April 12. Also read: Hand over Mukhtar Ansari to UP in 14 days: Supreme Court to PunjabSpeaking to the media before he was taken back to the Ropar jail, where he has been lodged since January 2019, Ansari said, “I have been framed in a false case. I’m innocent.” On March 26, the Supreme Court ordered shifting him within a fortnight from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh, where he is wanted in several criminal cases. The apex court ruling came as a victory for the Uttar Pradesh government, which made marathon efforts to get him back to the state so that he can be tried for the cases against him. The UP government has been carrying out an extensive drive to demolish Ansari’s network in the state and has seized or demolished property worth ₹200 crore illegally occupied by him and his gang members. Moreover, several of his alleged gang members and aides have been gunned down or arrested since March 2017. Ansari’s wife writes to Prez seeking security for him Lucknow: Ansari’s wife has written to President Ram Nath Kovind urging him to ensure adequate security for him when he is transferred from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh following a Supreme Court direction.In her letter released to the media on Wednesday, Afshan Ansari claimed that her husband is an eyewitness in a case and the accused BJP MLC is threatening to kill him in connivance with the government machinery.Afshan said she fears that her husband might be killed “in the guise of a fake encounter” during his transfer from Ropar jail to Uttar Pradesh’s Banda prison.She also urged that if it is required to produce Ansari in court, the President should order the government to arrange central security force personnel “to accompany him from prison to court and back”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/up-mla-mukhtar-ansari-produced-in-mohali-court-in-extortion-case-101617188332545.html

If the number of cases keeps rising,then, we’ll have to take a decision,” Tope was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.With the overall Covid-19 situation worsening in Maharashtra since February 10, Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered officials to come up with lockdown-like restrictions which will have less impact on the state’s economy. A night curfew has already been imposed by the government from March 28 across all districts and cities from till April 15 from 8pm-7am.As deliberations on a second round of restrictions are going on, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is a part of the MVA government, said on Monday that Maharashtra cannot afford another lockdown. Speaking to ANI, NCP leader and state minority minister Nawab Malik said that the NCP has asked Thackeray to consider other options. He added that a lockdown can be avoided if people follow rules. To this, state government officials said that there will not be a complete shutdown but stricter restrictions will be imposed in a phased manner starting from the coming weekend.We're increasing testing, tracking & tracing in the State. We are also going to increase the number of vaccination centres. Today, there is no shortage of beds, medicines, doctors.

This is the first time that cases went below the 30,000-mark after six consecutive days. The low Covid-19 case count on Tuesday can be attributed to fewer tests carried out on Monday due to a public holiday on the occasion of Holi. Only 129,876 people were tested for Covid-19 on Monday compared to 136,848 tests conducted on Sunday.As many as 139 people succumbed to the disease while 23,820 recovered on Tuesday.

She is survived by two sons and their families. A writer of short stories and children’s literature, Taran also dabbled in poetry. Hailing from the Pothohar region of undivided Punjab, she was the soul of music gatherings in Chandigarh and its adjoining towns of Panchkula and Mohali, regaling audiences with old Punjabi folk songs. She was witness to two major displacements in her life, fleeing her native place, Gujjar Khan near Rawalpindi, as a teenager at the time of Partition in 1947. The family settled in Kanpur, where Taran was married. Sadly, she and her family had to migrate from Kanpur to Mohali after the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Living in Chandigarh for the past 15 years since her husband’s death, her house had become a hub for writers. She published nine collections of short stories, a book of poetry along with children’s books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-writer-taran-gujral-passes-away-at-90-101617185692666.html
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet takes up direct payment to farmers||With the Centre firm on direct online payment of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers and wheat procurement to begin in April, the Punjab cabinet is meeting on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue and build consensus on its stand. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said: “I’ll raise the issue of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme to farmers for the wheat crop and request all ministers to reach a consensus. What the Centre has proposed is against the state’s norms and in violation of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act that governs the functioning of the state procurement machinery.” The Centre wants Punjab to make payment to farmers for the wheat crop by bypassing commission agents or arhtiyas, who are part of the existing system. Union food minister Piyush Goyal has rejected Punjab’s plea to allow the existing system and suggested the state amend its APMC Act. “This is not possible as it will be a direct hit on the country’s federal structure,” Ashu said. Punjab is the only state among the 12 procuring ones that is not making direct digital payment to farmers as mandated by the finance ministry’s Public Finance Management System (PFMS) order of May 28, 2018. It continues to pay farmers through arhtiyas under the Punjab Agriculture Produce Marketing Rules, 1962. Unlike neighbouring Haryana and other states, Punjab has not integrated its land records with the central procurement portal. Goyal has now written to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh seeking compliance and has suggested that Punjab follow Haryana’s software that enables details of tenant or sharecropper to be uploaded on the portal with a disclaimer that this would not be a legal proof for claiming ownership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-takes-up-direct-payment-to-farmers-101617183892351.html

Officials at the Bengaluru airport police station said that Pratap arrived at the airport around 4.30pm on Tuesday. “After stopping his car near the pick-up point, he poured petrol on himself and set himself on fire. CISF [Central Industrial Security Force] men who saw the fire, immediately broke the car windows and pulled him out,” said the officials. Pratap was admitted to Victoria Hospital after primary treatment at a hospital nearby; however, he succumbed to the injuries on Wednesday. According to police, during the investigation, his colleagues said that he was facing financial problems and was unable to pay his car’s EMI since he was not getting enough trips. Tanveer Pasha, president, Uber, TaxiForSure and Ola drivers and owners’ association, said that several drivers like Pratap were suffering because of competitive pricing from cab aggregators and the recent inflation. “Cab services by KSTDC were not getting enough riders because Ola and Uber are offering rides at ₹9 or ₹10 per km. At the same, petrol prices are soaring, how can a driver repay the loan?” he said.

This means it is not in the fray for the DSGMC elections,” department director Narinder Singh said a day after seeking an undertaking from the SAD that it is a religious party.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is a former deputy chief minister of Punjab, failed to give the undertaking, leading to the seizure of the party’s poll symbol.Narinder Singh, however, said that the SAD can field its candidates as independents in all 46 wards and will have to seek individual symbols from the returning officer of each ward.Reacting to the development, SAD leader Balwinder Singh Bhunder said, “The AAP government in Delhi doesn’t want the SAD to contest the elections, that’s why it has manipulated the orders. Our candidates will contest the elections even if it is as independents.”SAD sources said the party is planning to challenge the “arbitrary order” in the Delhi high court.Meanwhile, the filing of nominations for the DSGMC elections began on Wednesday.On March 19, the gurdwara elections department had issued an order that only registered religious parties will be allotted symbols to contest the DSGMC elections.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||Late prof’s wife bequeaths property to IIT-Bombay||In a first, an 82-year-old woman, who is the wife of a late Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) professor, has bequeathed her property to the Powai-based institute. Nina Kar handed over her will to the institute on Friday to set up a chair professorship at the mechanical engineering department in the name of her husband Subir, who had retired as a professor of fluid mechanics at IIT-B in the early nineties. “It was my husband’s wish that our property be donated to the institute where he served for almost 30 years. We don’t have any ward to pass down our property to and this is for a good cause,” said Kar. The bequeathed property is a one-bedroom flat in Powai where Nina is currently living. She refused to reveal the monetary value of the property. Although bequeathing property to institutes is a common phenomenon in the western countries, this is the first such case for IIT-B, said institute’s director Subhasis Chaudhuri. Nina, a Bangladeshi Bengali, moved to Mumbai after her marriage to Subir in 1963. The couple stayed on campus until his retirement. It was only after his retirement that the couple moved to their Powai flat. Subir, who was among the first few batches of professors of the institute, was a well-known researcher in fluid mechanics, and was instrumental in setting up the biomedical engineering programme at IIT-B. In 1973, he helped establish the National Society for Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power as a registered professional society to promote advancement and activities in aspects of fluid mechanics and fluid power in the country.In 2001, he passed away following a heart attack. “The will was drawn up before he passed away. I have only handed over the official document now. After my death, the property will go to the institute,” Nina said. Amit Agrawal, professor at the department of mechanical engineering who received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award in 2018, will be the first to occupy the Professor Subir Kar Chair Professorship. “It is a matter of great honour to be associated with a chair named after professor Subir. He played a crucial role in setting up the fluid mechanics society that brings researchers across the country together on a platform,” said Agrawal. “Professor Subir helped guide many PhD scholars,” said Chaudhuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/late-prof-s-wife-bequeaths-property-to-iitbombay-101617175073217.html

Whereas, the wife can, in any case, file a petition in a competent court, within whose local limits she is residing. The said right has been exclusively conferred on a wife so as to keep her convenience in mind in the matrimonial matters,” justice Monga said, while allowing her plea.2020 disputeThe woman had sought the transfer of the 2020 case to Mohali from Bhiwani, where she and her husband were last living when he moved court in the matrimonial dispute. The man, who lives in the United States, had argued that his wife had sufficient means and could easily appear in the Bhiwani court. On the other hand, she had argued that she was currently living with her parents in Mohali, which was over 250km away from Bhiwani.Her father was a heart patient, while her two brothers were married and living separately, she had told the court, adding that there was no other male family member to accompany her to the court hearings. Therefore, it was difficult for her to visit Bhiwani.The court observed that ethos as manifested under Article 51-A of the Constitution of India envisaged that it will be the fundamental duty of every Indian citizen to uphold the dignity of women. In addition, as per Article 15 (3), power had also been conferred on the state to make special provisions for women and children. It was perhaps in this spirit that an amendment was inserted in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, whereby, in case the wife was the petitioner, she could pick a court near where she was residing on the date of presentation of the petition, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wife-has-the-right-to-pick-court-in-matrimonial-dispute-says-hc-101617164991524.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Now, Delhi’s north municipal body wants jhatka, halal distinction||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Wednesday made it mandatory for restaurants and meat shops to display whether the meat being sold in the establishment is halal or jhatka. The north civic body passed a proposal regarding this in its House meeting. Similar proposals have already been passed by east and south civic bodies. The proposal stated, “Thousands of restaurants are in operation in 104 wards of four zone falling under North Delhi Municipal Corporation. Out of these, meat is being served in about 90% of restaurants but it is not displayed by them whether the meat being served by the restaurants is halal or jhatka. Similarly, it is not ascertained about the meat being sold at meat shops that whether the same is halal or jhatka. According to Hindu and Sikhism, eating halal meat is forbidden and against religion. Therefore, this meeting resolves that this direction be given to restaurants and meat shops that it should be written mandatorily about the meat being sold and served by them that jhatka or halal meat is available here.” In “jhatka”, an animal is slaughtered in one go while in “halal”, it is slaughtered in a way that it bleeds slowly to death. Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said that people have their preferences but in restaurants, you cannot tell the type of meat being served. “Halal or jhatka meat can be seen written on the meat shops but such a practice is seldom seen in restaurants. So it is a healthy exercise to mention that halal or jhatka meat food is being served at the restaurants. The proposal has been approved keeping people’s sentiments in mind and there is no other reason behind it,” Prakash said. All the three corporations are ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party. The polls for civic bodies will be held next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/now-delhi-s-north-municipal-body-wants-jhatka-halal-distinction-101617163912618.html

I had got the feedback that someone wants to talk to me. So I talked to him after getting his number. I told him to keep well, to take care of his health. So what is my crime?” the TMC supremo said.“But if someone makes the conversation viral that is a criminal offence. Action should be taken against the person who made my conversation viral, not me,” Banerjee said adding she will continue to call up people in the same manner in future.She recounted that in the past she reached out to people cutting across party lines and even opposition MLAs who sought her help.A controversy erupted on Saturday amid the first phase polling for 30 assembly seats in West Bengal with BJP releasing an audio clip in which Banerjee was heard cajoling the BJP leader from Nandigram to rejoin TMC and help her win the seat.A BJP delegation led by the party general secretary and its Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargia met the state’s chief electoral officer and handed over the audio tape.

31-03-2021||Kolkata||BJP, TMC spar over death of 80-year-old||The death of 80-year-old Shova Majumdar in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district sparked a political slugfest in the state, just days ahead of the second phase of voting on April 1.While the Trinamool Congress targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party for alleged discrepancies in Majumdar’s death certificate and her age, the TMC has come under fire for an alleged assault on her last month.Majumdar, a resident of Nimta, died on Monday due to “severe internal hemorrhage”, according to a death certificate issued by BJP leader and doctor, Archana Majumdar.TMC’s Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar hit out at the BJP leader for “violating medical ethics”. “Not only did she violate medical ethics and norms she also wrote that the cause of death was cardio-respiratory failure in an 80-year-old healthy lady. How can the BJP allege that the woman was fatally wounded while and the death certificate say she was healthy?” said Ghosh Dastidar.Also read | In Amphan-hit Sunderbans, aid ‘irregularities’ may hurt TrinamoolTMC’s Rajya Sabha MP and former president of the Indian Medical Association, Shantanu Sen said, “No doctor can cite internal injuries and haemorrhage as cause of death without a postmortem examination.”Majumdar was allegedly assaulted by some men on February 27. After photos and videos of her went viral, the BJP said that she was the mother of party worker Gopal Majumdar and blamed TMC for the attack.Denying the allegations, TMC leaders said that the BJP was making false claims with an eye on the polls. Majumdar was rushed to a hospital after the alleged assault and released only three days before her death.

The pain & wounds of her family will haunt Mamata didi for long. Bengal will fight for a violence-free tomorrow, Bengal will fight for a safer state for our sisters & mothers,” tweeted Shah.“Every death is tragic.

31-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The rush-hour bats||The sun is gone, the sky is dark. Bats are flying over the lake, letting out shrill chee-chee cries. They are spilling out in all directions, as chaotically and in as large numbers as their human counterparts in the Rajiv Chowk Metro station, during the rush hours of the BC (before corona) era.This is one of the most surreal sights to experience in the Capital. Every day, just after sunset, hundreds of bats start flying over and around the lake in south Delhi’s Deer Park.This evening the crowd of regular walkers has almost disappeared, and the stage is left empty for the flying bats’ performance. They are flapping their wings in great restlessness, and are noisily streaming through the air. It is difficult to see anything in the dark—sky, water and trees are in varying shades of black. The bats are discernible only because they are of the darkest hue.One swiftly notices that the mammals are flying out of a small tree-filled island in the lake. The island is inaccessible to visitors but, during the day, scores of those tree-clinging bats are easily visible from the park’s walking tracks—hanging upside down from the branches, and probably sleeping, as is the habit of nocturnal animals.To be sure, Delhi harbours a great number of bats. The trees along the Janpath avenue, in the central part of the city, teem with them. In the evening, as their day begins, the creatures drift across like smoke, but one is likely to be stuck in traffic at that hour, and the bats, flying high up above the trees, go unnoticed.But here in Deer Park, they emanate out of the island and course through the empty space most majestically, some flying towards Hauz Khas village, some towards Safdarjung Enclave in the opposite direction, and some towards Green Park.This evening the moon is in (almost) full bloom, and to see the bats going about this white orb fills the senses with intense thrill. It’s like being in a dream, or perhaps a nightmare, depending on your feeling about these unique creatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-rush-hour-bats-101617144387767.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Dusty winds add to pollution, mercury may rise from Apr 2||Dry, dust laden winds from Rajasthan have started blowing over Delhi leading to a deterioration in air quality and visibility in the Capital.The average air quality index on Tuesday was recorded at 232, in the “poor” category. The concentrations of PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) spiked from 224 micrograms per cubic metres to 326 micrograms per cubic metres at 4pm, according to data with the Central Pollution Control Board.The PM 10 concentration at 9pm was 361.1 micrograms per cubic metres. The 24-hour safe standard for PM10 as per CPCB is 100 micrograms per cubic metres.Scientists from the India Meteorological Department said the air quality is likely to deteriorate further as strong, westerly winds is likely to blow over the city till April 1.“The change in the colour of the sky is mainly due to dust. There is loose soil floating around and strong winds is raising this soil and dust particles. Westerly winds, which is blowing at about 40kmph, is also bringing dust from Rajasthan. These conditions will continue till April 1, following which temperature will rise further,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.The relative humidity was only 16% to 17% on Tuesday afternoon.According to IMD scientists, dust raising winds are affecting the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains region.“Our models are showing that these strong winds will prevail for 2-3 days. There is no moisture incursion over the region. Winds are blowing from dry regions to the west and northwest. Heat wave conditions were recorded over parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi on Monday because of clear skies, uninterrupted solar radiation and low wind speed. But the strong winds will help keep the maximum temperature in check for now. Maximum temperatures will shoot up again from April 2 or April 3,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.A severe heat wave condition affected Delhi on Monday, as the maximum temperature shot up to 40.1 degrees Celsius — at least eight degrees above normal and the highest March temperature since March 31, 1945 .The maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung observatory — which is taken as the official marker for Delhi’s weather — on Tuesday was 37.9 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal.The minimum temperature was recorded at 19 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.For the plains, a heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees Celsius, and at least 4.5 notches above normal.A severe heatwave is declared if departure from normal temperature is more than 6.5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.In Delhi, the normal maximum temperature for March-end is 30-32 degrees Celsius.Heat wave can also be declared when the actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees Celsius or more for a day irrespective of normal maximum temperature, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dusty-winds-add-to-pollution-mercury-may-rise-from-apr-2-101617143553027.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||No decision on when new NCT law will take effect; staff await clarity||Officials and experts said they are waiting for the Gazette notification from the Union home ministry, bringing into force the national capital’s new administrative framework, and which will decide crucial questions on subjects that fall exclusively under the domain of the Lieutenant Governor, the future role of the Delhi assembly, and the definition of “day-to-day administration”.The Union home ministry is yet to decide on the date from which the controversial Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (amendment) Act, 2021 will come into effect, senior MHA officials said on Tuesday, even as Delhi government officials outlined a number of areas where they need clarity.There is also some concern whether the staff strength in the office of the Lieutenant Governor -- now the government, according to the law -- is adequate to handle the increased volume of paperwork as all files will now have to be sent to him.On Sunday , March 28, the Union ministry of law and justice issued a gazette notification to the effect that the law has received the President’s assent. But a senior home ministry official said on condition of anonymity that a decision on when the law will come into effect hasn’t been made yet.With government offices resuming on Tuesday after a holiday on account of Holi, the Delhi government, in its first reaction since, said it still is exploring its legal options.“Certainly, the Supreme Court is one way for us to appeal against this black law. But a final decision will be taken only after our discussions with legal experts are over,” said Gopal Rai, Delhi environment minister and convener of Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi unit, who insisted that the law went against a July 2018 Supreme Court judgement that demarcated power between the government and the L-G.Also read | Switzerland Ambassador meets Kejriwal, Sisodia over Covid strategyOfficials in the Delhi secretariat, from where the Delhi government functions, said there is ambiguity on several aspects. “The Act makes it amply clear that all files will have to be sent to the L-G and all functionaries will have to wait for the files to return from the L-G’s office -- an additional process which could delay day-to-day administration -- but will the L-G actually ask all files to be routed through him or will there be specific topics or subjects that he would like to remain informed about? We are hoping that the ministry of home affairs will clear such doubts in its final notification,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.Shakti Sinha, a retired IAS officer who has served in the Delhi government, said the law actually clears all ambiguities that currently exist in Delhi’s governance, which leads to frequent confrontations between the L-G and the political executive , with bureaucrats caught in the middle.“This law clarifies the provisions of the Constitution. Even the Supreme Court judgment of July 2018 stated that the L-G should work in the aid and advice of the council of ministers, but until now, L-G could hardly give his opinion on anything because no file except those on land, police, law and order and services used to go to him. Previous governments in Delhi have operated the same way (as prescribed by the new law) -- all files used to go to the L-G -- and yet their functioning never used to be hampered. This Act will also clarify which files will need to go to the L-G and which won’t,” he said.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter, but officials at Raj Niwas said on condition of anonymity that the L-G’s secretariat might need more staff.“Right now, the team of the L-G’s office is relatively small. There is one senior official each for matters related to the police, services departments, DDA, municipal corporations and day-to-day governance. With all files coming to the L-G’s office, a restructuring may be required, which may include recruiting more officials,” said one official .An official in the Delhi Assembly secretariat said one of the ambiguities that need clarity is the definition of “day-to-day administration”. For instance, this person added on condition of anonymity, would a committee looking into riots such as the February 2020 one, be allowed. The assembly does have such a panel.Former secretary of the Lok Sabha and the Delhi Assembly SK Sharma said the Act will render the assembly useless. “It may well be disbanded in that case as the law now even raises questions over the validity and necessity of having Question Hour in the House,” he said.PDT Achary, former secretary-general of Lok Sabha said the law will increase red-tape. “There will be a lot of back and forth of files. The L-G now has the power to pick up any matter and send it to the President for his opinion if he differs with the Council of ministers. A lot will also depend on how the L-G and the political executive balance their powers.”Sinha said what the law proposes is practiced in a similar fashion in Washington DC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-decision-on-when-new-nct-law-will-take-effect-staff-await-clarity-101617142396833.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi: New school board to bank on AI for assessment||The Delhi government plans to introduce the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and game-based techniques for continuous assessment of students under its new state school education board, officials said after the board’s first general body meeting on Tuesday.The Delhi cabinet approved the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) on March 6. The society for the board was registered on March 19. The board is likely to be operational for up to at least the middle-school level (up to Class 8) from the upcoming academic session.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who is the head of the board, said students will be assessed holistically on the basis of their knowledge, attitude, and skills. “DBSE will employ effective modern technology available today to ensure a personalised learning experience for our students. AI and game-based assessments will be put to use to create a system where every student is regularly evaluated on the basis of their strengths...,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.Shailendra Sharma, the principal advisor to the directorate of education (DoE), said the new education board will focus on assessing students on the basis of their skills and not just classroom learning. “Conventionally, board assessments are designed as pen-and-paper tests only. They test subject knowledge which is to be recalled by students during one exam. But in this day and age, we also need to assess the application of knowledge, the extent of understanding, and attitudes like empathy, teamwork, collaboration, problem-solving abilities,” he said.Also read | Pvt schools fund vaccine shots for staffersThe board will use AI to provide teachers with real-time learning feedback. Under game-based assessments, students will be given situations or be involved in activities to evaluate their skills and understanding.Sharma said the government will also look at assessment models used abroad. “The purpose of setting up the Delhi board is not to replicate the existing models. We are basically looking at how assessment can complement the teaching-learning process in class across all grades. This is why we will explore the most contemporary models followed across the globe,” he added.Educationalist Meeta Sengupta said that while the use of AI and game-based tools in assessment will be “a refreshing change”, it will not be without its challenges. “It’s also an incredibly complex process where one has to be very careful about ethics and empathy. It should be used without intruding on privacy and without making bad assumptions.”Principals of several government schools too welcomed the idea. Awadesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “There is a requirement of reforms in the existing assessment process. We need to evaluate students holistically in order to make them understand their strengths and weaknesses. The game-based assessment will of great help, especially for the younger students.”Aparajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents Association, said that the government should create awareness about changes it was planning to bring in the education system among parents . “It is a great idea.

31-03-2021||Delhi||Two deaths during road accidents on Holi this year: Cops||Two people lost their lives in separate road accidents reported from Civil Lines and Dwarka during muted Holi celebrations in the city on Monday, showed Delhi Police data.Except for the two fatalities, no more accidents were reported this year. There were 23 road accidents reported during Holi celebrations in 2020 and 28 in 2019. The city saw seven deaths because of mishaps in 2019, data showed.To be sure, Holi was on March 10 last year, nearly two weeks before curbs were put in place to stem the spread of Covid-19.Of the total fines issued on Monday, 1,255 were for riding without helmets, 170 for triple riding, 100 for drink driving, 121 for dangerous driving while 1,800 were for other traffic violations, the data said.Police officers attributed this decline to heavy deployment of their personnel on the streets and restrictions imposed in the city following the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) Covid-19 guidelines that banned Holi celebrations and gatherings in public places. Owing to massive awareness campaigns through newspapers, news channels and social media, there was better compliance observed this year, officers said.As far as action taken for violations of DDMA guidelines regarding Covid-19 is concerned, 72 cases were registered for celebrating Holi in public places. As many as 871 people were prosecuted or arrested for various violations such as drinking in public places, disturbing peace, obstructing or annoying people on streets, not wearing masks and not following social distancing, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said.“We also impounded 1,696 vehicles. No major incident was reported during Holi this year. Delhi Police takes this opportunity to thank all stakeholders for extending their cooperation for celebrating Holi while observing Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Biswal.Apart from the police, the Delhi government also issued challans for mask and social distancing-related violations.According to government data, all 11 revenue districts on Monday issued 2,758 fines, with north district topping the chart with 607 fines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-deaths-during-road-accidents-on-holi-this-year-cops-101617141830042.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Pvt schools fund vaccine shots for staffers||Several private schools in the national capital have started chalking out plans to arrange Covid-19 vaccinations for teachers, ahead of the new academic session and the upcoming Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams.The Union government had last week announced that everyone above the age of 45 will be eligible for a coronavirus vaccine from April 1.Following this, several private schools have started booking vaccination slots for their staff, while some have also urged the district administration to allow all their staff members, irrespective of their age, to get the vaccine shots, and consider them as “frontline workers”, who are among the target groups eligible to receive the jabs.For instance, Mount Abu Public School in Rohini has booked an April 1 appointment in a private hospital for all their staffers aged 45 and above. The school has also asked the north-west district administration to consider allowing jabs for all of the staffers of the school. School principal Jyoti Arora said, “The school has decided to sponsor the vaccination for all our staff members who are willing and are eligible as per government guidelines... We hope that all our staff members can get at least the first shot before we start the academic session on April 5.”The new academic session is scheduled to begin from the first week of April. While online classes will continue for students up to Class 8, those in classes 9 to 12 are likely to attend schools in-person. The CBSE Class 10 and 12 board exams will be held from May 4 to June 10, and results will be declared by July 15.Also read | Govt to ramp up Covid-19 beds as Capital adds 992 fresh infectionsThe administration of Mount Carmel Schools also said they want their staff members, even those aged below 45, to get vaccinated before classes kick off. “We want to start the new academic session with a carefree mind and for that we need all our staff to be vaccinated,” said Michael V Williams, dean of Mount Carmel Schools.Meenakshi Khushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan in Pushp Vihar, said that she has also written to the district administration to allow all their staff members to get vaccinated. “We are planning to start a new academic session online for all classes till our all teachers get vaccinated and the situation normalises,” she said.Several schools have already begun vaccinating their eligible teachers in groups on a voluntary basis. For example, in Springdales School a large chunk of eligible teachers was vaccinated last week. Principal Ameeta Wattal said, “Our teachers are front-line workers too. They meet students on a daily basis. They will soon start taking classes as the new academic session, they will also work as invigilators in the upcoming CBSE board exams, and then evaluate the board exam answer scripts. They need the vaccine as much as the hospital staffers do.”Others, including Shri Ram Schools, and Bluebells School International have also started the vaccination process for their eligible teaching and non-teaching staff in collaboration with private hospitals designated as vaccination centres.Apeejay Schools are also planning similar arrangements for their employees“The Apeejay group has already completed vaccinating all its staff, including teachers, aged above 60, and now a similar drive is expected to begin soon for those who fall in 45-year-old and above age group,” said Smita Amit, principal, Apeejay School, Saket.In government schools, a majority of the teachers who were on Covid-19 duty have been vaccinated under the “frontline category”.Officials at several district administrations said central and state government guidelines will determine if teachers aged below 45 can be vaccinated.“There have been requests to allow shots for these teachers and to consider them frontline workers. However, this will depend on approvals from the state health and welfare department,” an official at the north-west district administration said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pvt-schools-fund-vaccine-shots-for-staffers-101617141576168.html

We are now in favour of shutting down interstate or interdistrict travel or bringing down the industrial commercial activities to a halt,” an official from Mantralaya said on condition of anonymity.Also watch | Covid: Centre explains 5 steps discussed with States to curb virus spread﻿﻿“But at the same time, the crowd and gatherings at public places need to be brought down considerably. For this, the operation of market places, shops and establishments need to be curbed. It is necessary to see that private and public offices operate at minimum possible capacity so that crowding in trains and buses is reduced,” the official added. The state on Tuesday reported 27,918 fresh cases, two days after recording the highest 40,414 infections in a day, taking the tally to 2,773,436, the health department announced. With 139 patients succumbing to the infection, the toll in the state mounted to 54,422, it added.Also read | With 27,918 Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra’s tally at 2,773,435In view of the rising cases, Thackeray had directed officials to start preparing for another lockdown as citizens failed to follow Covid protocols. State minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik, however, said the state “cannot afford any lockdown” and had asked the chief minister to consider other options.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope also hinted at stricter curbs rather than a complete lockdown. “We will impose stricter restrictions first before a complete lockdown. Nobody wants the lockdown but it would be the last resort if the number of new patients exceeds the number of beds available in hospitals and Covid care centres. Before that, we are checking if restaurants and theatres need to be completely shut as crowding in these areas is more,” he said.Authorities at the state and city levels are reportedly lagging to track and test people arriving from other areas mainly due to shortage of manpower and non-cooperation from citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-rules-out-statewide-lockdown-for-now-localised-curbs-possible-101617137905779.html

Though the results of the MC elections were declared on February 18, Punjab is yet to notify it and the elected councillors are yet to take oath. For the last five years, the civic body has been facing a budget deficit. ₹75 crore proposed for park maintenanceNow that all parks of the new sectors 76 to 80 have been transferred from the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) from April 1, the civic body has proposed a budget of ₹75 crore out of a total ₹100 crore as they have already received ₹25 crore from GMADA for park maintenance.In 2019-20, the MC had proposed a ₹22.2-crore deficit budget, and in 2018, the MC passed ₹128 crore annual budget showing ₹15 crore deficit for the 2018-19 fiscal.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “Due to the pandemic, we suffered a loss of nearly ₹10 crore, but we will now focus on increasing the collection from various factors like building application fee, licence fee and tehbazari (licence to squat and sell goods in a particular location). This will give us a boost of nearly ₹10 crore. Also, the budget will be approved in the first House meeting of the councillors.”Revenue curtailed due to Covid in 2020-21The MC had expected to earn ₹28 crore from property tax, but got only ₹17 crore; from excise duty, MC was to get ₹30 crore, but got just ₹12.5 crore from the state government.A major blow came in the form of unipole advertisers when the state government waived off the ₹5-crore fee for six months after six companies sought it citing no revenue earned. The civic body was to earn ₹11 crore, it got only ₹1.42 crore from advertisers as most of them did not even pay their pending dues. On the account of tehbazari fee, MC was to collect ₹60 lakh, but earned only ₹32 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-mc-proposes-148-crore-budget-for-202122-101617136730271.html

The police suspected it to be a fallout of a 2019 turf war at Ambala Central Jail between members of the Bhupi Rana and Lawrence Bishnoi gangs.Ashwani is a resident of Manimajra, while the other three are from Mauli Jagran. Gaurav was their driver, police said.Four crime investigation teams were on the assailants’ trail since the shootout at one of the busiest chowks of the district, where nearly 20 shots were fired by the accused on their Verna car, who were following the men in their Swift car registered in Kurukshetra.The CCTVs at the crime spot were also found to be defunct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchkula-man-held-in-ambala-s-kalka-chowk-shootout-case-101617136670589.html
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||14 more Punjabi University faculty members resign from administrative posts||The ongoing crisis at Punjabi University, Patiala, deepened on Tuesday as 14 more senior faculty members resigned from their administrative posts and two key meetings of the syndicate and finance committee were postponed indefinitely in the wake of a tiff between officiating vice-chancellor Ravneet Kaur, a senior IAS officer, and the staff. Prof Manjit Singh put in his papers as director of the placement cell, Prof Bhupinder Singh Virk as university legal adviser, Jaswinder Singh as coordinator placement cell, Balraj Singh as director incubation centre and Prof Sarbjinder Singh as incharge of the publication bureau. The meetings were to be held to finalise and approve the budget for the 2021-22 financial year. The varsity had even extended an invitation to the syndicate members 10 days back for a meeting scheduled for Monday, but no agenda was released for the meeting.Last week, 28 top varsity officials, including the dean of academic affairs, a key member of the syndicate, and the registrar tendered their resignation from their administrative charges. The Punjabi University Teachers Association (PUTA) is at loggerheads with the officiating V-C over alleged delay in promotions and other administrative issues. Besides, the union has accused Kaur of working in an autocratic manner.“No one from the V-C’s office informed us of the meeting being cancelled or postponed. We came to know about it from other sources,” a syndicate member said.Kaur said the meetings were postponed due to the ongoing issues. “Though no decision was taken about rescheduling of the two meetings, they will be held at the earliest. We are making every possible effort to resolve the issues to streamline the working of the varsity,” she said.PUTA president Nishan Singh Deol said they have called the general house of teachers on Wednesday to decide the next course of action.“Senior faculty members are putting in their papers to express their resentment against the officiating V-C and the state government for not taking the teachers’ demands seriously,” Deol said.The bone of contention The PUTA had moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the appointment of Kaur as officiating V-C. The state government had given officiating charge to Kaur on November 25 last year following the resignation of Prof BS Ghuman from the post. The association has also moved the court against the state government- constituted search committee under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to find a suitable candidate for the job. Taking up the civil writ petition on February 24, the high court issued notices to the university chancellor, state government, and the officiating V-C. The next hearing is scheduled on April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/14-more-punjabi-university-faculty-members-resign-from-administrative-posts-101617136190261.html

However, the trend of growth has slowed down.While between the second and third week of March, the cases grew by around 75%, their number saw a dip into the fourth week, with the surge lowering to 24%.‘Awareness about disease still low’“The number of deaths is expected to increase as the cases show an exponential increase. The sudden jump also suggests that the awareness about the progression of the disease is still low among the population. If people with mild symptoms seek medical attention in time, lives can be saved. But, people seem to be delaying treatment and thus lose the golden hour,” said Dr PVM Lakshmi, an epidemiologist at Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).Dr GD Puri, chairman of the Covid-19 management committee at PGIMER, said there was an increase in the number of severely ill patients, as compared to last year.“We are managing around 170 Covid-19 patients now, while their number had dropped to 30 by the end of 2020. The number of severely ill patients is doubling every week, which we did not experience last year. Precautions against the virus are vital as hospitals getting overwhelmed will compromise the quality of care,” he cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-deaths-in-chandigarh-shot-up-by-275-in-the-week-gone-by-101617134932179.html
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||Govt can restrict employee from applying elsewhere: HC||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that an employer has the right to restrict its employee from applying elsewhere to defeat the practice among those in public employment hopping from one job to another. The high court bench of justice Anil Kshetrapal said that the selection process of a public servant consumes a lot of time and also puts monetary burden on the employer. The contract conditions, which are un-lawful or forbidden by law, can’t be imposed, but to stop job hoppers, certain conditions can be imposed, the court said. In the case in hand, Yogesh Kumar Vashisht was an assistant professor with the department of forensic medicine in Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College for Women, Khanpur Kalan, Sonepat. In 2019, he had applied for the post of assistant professor at Pandit BD Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak. However, he was denied no objection certificate (NOC) by his then employer. He challenged the decision in high court, arguing that the contract signed at the time of employment with the clause as in the given case is “unconscionable” and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as it deprives a person equality before law. At the time of employment, the bargaining power between an employee and the state is unequal and, therefore, the employee has no other option but to sign on dotted lines, it was argued. The court found that at the time of employment, he had signed a contract according to which he was not to get NOC till completion of 5 years of service. If he was to resign, he was to submit three months’ advance notice or deposit three months’ salary. Another condition was that resignation will be accepted only after the arrangement of a suitable substitute in his place so that studies of the students and patient care do not suffer. The court observed that the restrictions imposed were only for a period of five years and that he could not have applied for the same post. There is no restriction on applying for a higher post, it said. “By now, it is well known that sometimes qualified persons indulge in job-hopping. Such clause has been incorporated to curb such practices,” the bench said, adding that the selection of a public servant consumes a lot of time and involves a lot of expenditure for the employer. “If the teacher, who has been appointed after following a long process is allowed to hop from one job to another, immediately after joining, then the students are likely to suffer,” it added, dismissing the plea. The court said that the clause is not in violation of Article 14 and the Indian Contract Act. The Rule 21 of the Haryana Medical Education Service Rules, 1988, enables the employer to impose special terms and conditions in the order of appointment. If the petitioner wants to resign, he/she has to comply with the rules and terms of the appointment letter, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-can-restrict-employee-from-applying-elsewhere-hc-101617134930365.html

SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said an attempt had been made to remove a big misconception among the sangat about the organisation’s budget. “The expenditure is more than the income, for which the SGPC would motivate the sangat to contribute and also spend from its own savings,” she said, adding that there was again a sharp decline in income due to income. Historical gurdwaras, which get some government concession, are expected to generate ₹647 crore in 2021-22, while estimated expenditure was about ₹652 crore. Similarly, revenue from educational institutions would be ₹189 crore and expenditure is at ₹223 crore. “We have earmarked about ₹16.5 crore to cover the budget deficit of educational institutions and are constantly trying to bring the budget of the SGPC on track by reducing expenses,” said Bibi Jagir Kaur. She added that the sangat offering donation at Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) would be exempted from tax. “Reply received to an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act has revealed that 80G tax exemption for the shrine had already been received in 1965. Under this, sangat can now get tax exemption,” she claimed. Bibi Jagir Kaur added that ₹14 crore had been earmarked in this year’s budget to celebrate the 400th birth anniversary of the ninth Sikh master, Guru Tegh Bahadur. She added up to ₹2 crore had been earmarked for the recently established Girls Sports Academy.During the meeting, many SGPC members raised questions over what they claimed was self-styled working and politicisation of trusts working under the organisation’s patronage. These members demanded that such trust be dissolved. “We are working to resolve this issue,” the SGPC president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-passes-rs-912-crore-budget-rs-40-crore-more-than-revenue-101617134210307.html

Of these, 22 have contracted the virus. The health of none of the medical staff is serious,” he said.“Patients visiting the gynaecology department range from 500 to 1,000 per day. There is no serious threat to healthcare facilities so far even after some service providers were found infected,” he added.He said that they are ascertaining as to how the doctors got infected.A junior doctor, working with the gynaecology department, who has tested positive for the virus, said, “The negligence and nonchalant attitude of faculty and senior resident doctors has led to many of the associates turning into patients.”“Many patients are visiting the hospital without getting tested for Covid-19 and our bosses are also reluctant in tackling the situation. There is more burden on the PGs and that’s why 19 students got infected with the virus,” the doctor said, requesting anonymity.Patients have urged the hospital authorities not to shut down services of the department.“We think that there was a super spreader and due to this, 22 healthcare providers are infected. This is negligence on part of staff of the gynaecology department,” the senior official said, pleading anonymity.‘None of those infected had received second dose of Covid vaccine’Dr VK Katyal, nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS, said he has sought a report from the gynaecology department on how many doctors have taken first dose of the vaccine.“Initially, we got information that four of the 22 healthcare providers have received the first dose. But none of these doctors had taken the second dose of the vaccine. The gynaecology department is claiming that many of the infected workers had taken the first jab but it is now a matter of investigation. We are closing the labour room for the next 48 hours and will start operations from another place,” the nodal officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/22-healthcare-providers-at-pgims-rohtak-test-positive-for-covid-101617134159235.html

The bridge connects BRS Nagar and Sarabha Nagar and was closed from one side on December 23, 2020 for carrying out widening work. Its width has now been increased from four metres to nine metres.The project worth ₹1.40 crore was taken up under the Smart City Mission wherein funds were allocated by the Ludhiana Smart City Limited and construction taken up by the irrigation department.Harkirat Singh, a commuter, said, “When the bridge was closed from one side in December last year, we had to face huge traffic jams while crossing the area. Now that the bridge has been widened, we hope that it will facilitate smooth movement of traffic.” Cabinet minister and MLA (Ludhiana west) Bharat Bhushan Ashu said, “Widening of the bridge was a long-pending demand of the area residents as traffic jams were common here.” He also lauded the officials of the irrigation department and municipal corporation for completing the project in record time of around three months. It is pertinent to mention that in March 2019, four youngsters, including a brother-sister duo, had died after their car plunged into the Sidhwan canal after crashing into the railing of the bridge. Police had said that the accident took place due to speeding. Following this incident, residents had started demanding for the widening of the bridge. They had also sought that the railings of the bridge be strengthened to ensure that vehicles don’t plunge into the canal in case of a mishap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/relief-for-commuters-as-brs-nagar-canal-bridge-reopens-for-vehicular-traffic-101617134090250.html

Many of these houseboats are decades’ old and with the passage of time have sustained damages and decay. Introduced by the British before independence, these floating houses made of deodar (cedar) wood with carved walnut interiors have been an important part of Kashmir’s tourism sector.The administrative council under the chairmanship of L-G Manoj Sinha met on Monday and approved the roll-out of the policy and guidelines for sustainable operation of houseboats.“In a bid to preserve the marine ecosystem of both the lakes, the new policy aims to regulate the functioning of houseboats docked at Dal and Nageen lakes by adopting the models of sustainable and responsible tourism. The policy envisages providing a pleasant experience to tourists and sustainable source of living to stakeholders while preserving the fragile ecosystem,” J&K government spokesperson said. As per the new policy in view the carrying capacities, the tourism department has now capped the number of houseboats in both lakes at 910. Under the new policy, the houseboats are required to be registered online subject to the fulfilment of various conservation parameters; within 30 days from the date notification of the policy. The houseboats and associated structures are required to be fitted with bio-digesters for scientific treatment of solid/liquid waste as per the approved design of the Lakes and Waterways Development Authority, besides ensuring availability of adequate fire safety equipment along with trained staff to be verified by fire and emergency services department,” a senior J&K tourism officer said. He said the policy lays down regulations for ancillary facilities like kitchen, lodging, furniture, first-aid, electricity, power backup, sanitary fittings and shikara for navigation.The new policy also allows repairs on damaged, dilapidated and abandoned houseboats, and revival of cruise boats and donga cruise.After a sharp decline in tourism sector after August 5 and the pandemic last year, at least 134 houseboat owners wanted to surrender their boats and licences in case government didn’t come for their rescue.They had earlier written to the administration that they will surrender their boats if the government provides them land at suitable places and construct structures like guest houses where they can live and also earn their livelihoods. A committee of experts constituted under the supervision of the Jammu and Kashmir high court was monitoring the conservation of Dal Lake, where 800 of these houseboats are anchored.Houseboat Association general secretary Abdul Rashid Kaloo said most of the houseboats were built between 1970 and mid 80s and they have a lifespan of 60 to 70 years. “Now, most of these houseboats are old, damaged and in need of repair. With this policy, the repair could be started. This is a very good initiative,” he added. He, however, said once the policy is implemented, only then they can say whether it’s beneficial or not. “All houseboat owners are ready to cooperate with government. Now, we have to see what is in this policy which will help people and tourism,” he added. Umar Nazir Tibet Baqal, director, Labaika travels and tourism services, said the formation of houseboat policy is a welcome step but unless and until the contents are not made public, things wont be clear. “Unfortunately, this policy was drafted last year when Covid was at its peak and was not released in public domain for deliberations.”He said the matter is subjudice and policy can’t be formed unless and until court is not taken on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/finally-a-comprehensive-policy-for-houseboats-in-srinagar-s-dal-nageen-lakes-101617133670306.html

The federal agency had made a significant breakthrough in the case on Sunday, when with the help of divers, investigators recovered two digital video recorders (DVRs), two Central Processing Units, a laptop and two vehicle registration plates, among other evidence from Mithi river. The NIA, which is also investigating a murder related to the explosives case, questioned a coal trader, Kishore Thakkar, from Ahmedabad and recorded his statement. The agency suspects that Thakkar had provided SIM cards to Naresh Gor, one of the two men arrested for murdering Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the explosives laden Scorpio found outside Ambani’s residence last month. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was investigating the murder case till NIA took over the related probe, had arrested Gor and a former policeman Vinayak Shinde in connection with Hiran’s murder. The state probing team however said that suspended Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze was the mastermind of the murder. “Thakkar had cleared in his statement about his relationship with Gor. He said he provided the SIM card in general friendship and was not aware about the serious crime. However, Thakkar was made the witness and NIA took his statement,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity. NIA had recovered a chit containing 14 numbers related to the SIM cards, five of which were handed over to Vaze by Gor. The prosecutor added that a meeting had taken place between Vaze and Shinde in which they allegedly hatched the conspiracy to commit the murder. Vaze, who is in NIA custody for allegedly planning the planting of the explosives-laden car outside Antilia last month, told a special NIA court last week that he was innocent, and had “nothing to do with the crime.” The electronic evidence recovered from the river was damaged, reportedly by Vaze, who was the initial investigator in the explosive-laden car case in his capacity as the head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch. An NIA officer said one of the recovered DVR was likely from Saket Complex at Thane where Vaze resided. He had purportedly collected the DVR and CCTV footage of the complex for the purpose of probe and under an official letter but had not included the same in the material seized the during the probe. The electronics have been sent to a forensic laboratory in Pune for retrieval of data. The NIA also found another high-end car allegedly owned by Vaze on Tuesday from Navi Mumbai. Preliminary probe has revealed that it was being used by a crime branch officer, assistant police inspector Prakash Howal, who reportedly purchased it from Vaze paying ₹1.50 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-mansukh-hiran-death-probe-gujarat-trader-s-statement-recorded-101617133489630.html

Choudhary, a former MLC, was the only prominent Hindu face of the PDP in entire Jammu region. Announcing his resignation from the party, along with other leaders including councillors in Nowshera municipal committee, panches and sarpanches, Choudhary accused the Mehbooba Mufti of deviating from the agenda of party founder and former chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. He repeatedly invoked the words of late Sayeed and said, “Mufti Sahib used to say that Na grenade na goli se, baat banegi boli se. Can Mehbooba Mufti with her hand on her heart tell us that she is still living by the words of her late father? She has been surrounded by land mafia and drawing room politicians.” He also said that he, along with his workers, were resigning out of their own will. “There is no need to defame those leaving the party by dubbing them as people of agencies or doing so under the pressure of agencies or the government. We are resigning on our own and not under pressure of any agency or the government because the party leadership has drifted from the agenda of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed,” he said. Choudhary said he would go back to his people in Nowshera and Sunderbani to hold parleys. “I will go by what they tell me to do. My people are my party. Without their consent, I will not take any decision,” he added. He was ‘annoyed’ with Mehbooba Mufti for not been given a suitable place in state body and parliamentary affairs committee recently constituted by the latter in Srinagar. PDP’s founding member and former J&K deputy chief minister Muzaffar Baig has already parted ways with the PDP and has joined Sajad Lone’s the Peoples’ Conference. It may be recalled here that the PDP had suffered a similar jolt last year after six of its senior leaders had quit the party. Barely two days ahead of DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, the PDP had received another shocker as three senior leaders — Dhaman Bhasin, Fallail Singh and Pritam Kotwal — resigned. On October 26, former PDP MP TS Bajwa, along with former MLC Ved Mahajan and former state secretary Choudhary Hussain Ali Wafa, had quit the party over Mehbooba Mufti’s “highly provocative” remarks against the Tricolour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/another-jolt-to-pdp-as-surinder-choudhary-108-others-officially-resign-from-party-101617133370247.html

Later, when the court was informed of other public interest litigations (PILs) also filed on similar issues, it directed the advocate general to see if all the petitions could be clubbed together to ensure there were consistent orders in all of them. Meanwhile, the PIL filed by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh was mentioned before the bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta for urgent hearing. It will be heard on Wednesday. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by Patil, was informed that the allegations made by Singh against Deshmukh were serious, and hence the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or any other agency should be directed to investigate them. The court also pulled up the advocate for the way in which the petition was drafted and observed that it seemed that the content was copy pasted from some other petition. The court stressed that the advocate should have drafted the pleadings properly and brought out the law point better. “Prima facie, we are of the opinion that such petitions are filled for cheap popularity,” said HC. Thereafter, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed that there were other PILs filed. He further submitted that the current petition was drafted shoddily without making any effort to find out the truth and veracity in the matter. The court then directed Kumbhakoni to explore whether all the petitions could be clubbed together to inconsistent orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allegations-against-home-min-hc-to-hear-ex-mumbai-top-cop-s-petition-today-101617133309624.html

Revellers embraced each other and also smeared colours at each other. No one wore masks or maintained social distancing, that too in the presence of police, said residents.A symbol of communal harmony, the Holi procession in Old City is an annual affair since the days of nawabs.

Similarly, Jawahar Tunnel area has been put under the same category. All districts of Kashmir province are under “green category”, except Srinagar which is in orange. The 10 districts of Jammu region have also been placed under the same category as well. “The categorisation has been done for the purpose of implementation of permitted activities in the districts,” read the government order. It stated that classification will be reviewed periodically. “All instructions relating to safety health, precautions, and social distancing continue to apply. All activities to be allowed outside containment zones till further orders,” it read. The government also said that the ceiling on number of pilgrims allowed at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine will continue to be 25,000 per day. “All DCs will keep focus on positivity rate of closed clustered spaces like public, private offices, schools, colleges, malls, markets and consider implementing staggered timings of operations in case weekly positivity rate goes beyond 10% in these spaces,” the order said. In red category districts, all shops in municipal limits will remain open from 9am to 7pm and only 50% of the shops will open on alternate days. This has to be regulated by DCs, the order added. Highest daily case count in UT in 102 daysJammu and Kashmir on Tuesday recorded 359 coronavirus cases, the highest daily count in 102 days that took the tally to 1,30,587. The death toll reached 1,990 with a fresh fatality in Kashmir division.As many as 266 cases were recorded in the Kashmir division on Tuesday, the highest daily count of the division after December 3, while 93 fresh infections were logged in Jammu division. Officials said Srinagar recorded the highest number of 150 new cases, while three districts, all of them in Jammu division, did not report any infection. For the past five days, the UT has been constantly reporting over 200 cases daily and the number went beyond 300 twice.The highest caseload seen earlier than Tuesday was on December 18 at 388.The number of active cases reached 2,293 in the UT. On Tuesday, 175 patients recovered, taking the count of recoveries to 1,26,304. The recovery rate stood at 96.72%. A faction of Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) on Tuesday said only 1% of the population in Jammu and Kashmir has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 so far. Just 5% has received the first dose of the vaccine, it added. “That means most of the people are still susceptible to the deadly infection,” said DAK president Dr Nisar ul Hassan.“As per the data, the UT has administered the first dose to 6,34,953 people as on March 30, 2021. The figure represents 5% of J&K’s population of 1.25 crore. Full vaccination (both doses) has been given to 1,42,895 people — 1% of the population,” he added. “We need to vaccinate around 70% of the population to bring to end the ongoing public health crisis,” the doctor said.Besides hesitancy, he said, another reason why the goal can’t be achieved is because children, who constitute a huge proportion of the population, are not being inoculated. “There are around 4.8 million children in J&K who cannot be vaccinated right now. Vaccine is the only way to stop the pandemic,” he added.

The agencies further stated that investigations would continue even after the trial starts. The court after accepting the statements said that such delays were unacceptable and that it would continue monitoring the investigations, as it wanted to get to the root of the conspiracies. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petitions of Smita Pansare and Mukta Dabholkar, relatives of the late activists, had on March 12 asked the investigating agencies to file a progress report on the probe by March 30. The petitioners’ advocate, Abhay Nevagi, had sought a court-monitored probe and said that it has been nearly eight and five years, respectively, since the murders, but the agencies had not been able to nab the conspirators or conclude the probe and begin the trial. Dabholkar was shot dead in Pune on August 20, 2013, while Pansare was shot on February 16, 2015, near his house in Kolhapur. He died four days later. The CBI is investigating Dabholkar case, while the Maharashtra SIT is probing the Pansare case. Nevagi also informed HC that the investigators in Karnataka had managed to nab the suspects in the murder cases of activists MM Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh, who were killed in 2015 and 2017, respectively. HC was informed that while CBI had filed three charge sheets in Dabholkar’s murder case, SIT made no progress in the Pansare case. On Tuesday, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CBI, submitted an investigation progress report in a sealed cover. Singh said CBI has withdrawn a plea seeking the stay on the trial in Dabholkar case. The report stated that CBI is ready for trial but would continue investigation of conspirators. Senior advocate Ashok Mundargi for the state SIT also submitted the probe status report in a sealed cover and informed that 10 persons have been arrested in Pansare murder case, while two are absconding. “It is stated in the said report that SIT is ready for trial, and the investigation is in progress with respect to two absconding accused, and to find out who are involved in the conspiracy to kill Pansare,” HC noted in the order. After hearing the submissions, the bench noted, “We do not even want the slightest of doubt that the probe is not properly done. We’ll keep on monitoring the cases. Find out what is remaining to be done and what steps have been taken by you. We’ll go to the root of the matter. If this is to happen in a modern state like Maharashtra, this court is certainly concerned.” HC has posted further hearing on April 15 and sought the status of the probe from the agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dabholkar-and-pansare-murder-trials-can-start-cbi-sit-to-bombay-hc-101617133009656.html

Seeking wholehearted support from private laboratories and hospitals, Sidhu stressed the importance to isolate and provide treatment to all suspected or confirmed Covid positive person, besides timely tracing of their contacts to break the transmission chain. “No private diagnostic centres should charge more than ₹2,000 for CT-Scan/HRCT test, inclusive of GST/taxes and documentation, and ₹900 for RT-PCR test,” the minister said, asking laboratories to strictly follow all the testing protocols laid down by ICMR, the central and state governments. The private laboratories have been directed to share their data pertaining to the results of Covid tests with the state government and upload it on ICMR portal. All private NABL and ICMR-approved laboratories have been instructed that patient information must be maintained with utmost confidentiality as per the laid protocols and strict action would be taken under the Epidemic Disease Act, Covid-19 Regulations, in case of dereliction in their responsibility, he said.

Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, who was present in the session as per protocol, has also in the past sought a ban on the RSS, claiming, “The RSS’ aim of a Hindu Rashtra is against the country’s interests.”The SGPC move comes five months after the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which controls the apex gurdwara body, parted ways with the BJP. The saffron party is one of the affiliates of the RSS and leads the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre. Passed during the budget session of the SGPC, the resolution reads, “India is a multi-religious, multilingual and multi-ethnic country. Its beauty is that the constitution gives equality to all faiths... and every religion has made great contribution to its freedom, especially the Sikh community, which has made more than 80% sacrifices. Sadly, for a long time now, freedom of other religions has been suppressed in the wake of the RSS’s attempts to make the country a Hindu Rashtra. Minorities are being intimidated and frightened through direct and indirect unnecessary interference into their faith.”“Such attempts were made in the 17th century by the Mughal Empire, which the Gurus strongly opposed. The ninth Sikh Master, Guru Tegh Bahadur, in particular made sacrifices to repulse attacks on the Hindu religion and set a distinct example in the religious history of the world,” the resolution says.The SGPC resolution states, “Today’s general session cautions the Government of India that...it should respect sentiments of followers of every religion and rein in elements, which attempt to suppress the voice of minorities. Religious rights of every religion’s followers must protected.”SIX YEARS AFTER BARGARI SACRILEGE, PASSES RESOLUTION AGAINST ITOn suggestions of SGPC members from the opposition, president Bibi Jagir Kaur allowed the passing of a resolution condemning the 2015 Bargari sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and sought exemplary punishment for the perpetrators. The resolution, passed six years after the incident, has sought strict punishment for accused police officers. In another resolution, the SGPC sought a unique monument for the ninth Guru and large-scale development of historic sites related to him. The day of martyrdom of the ninth Guru should be celebrated as ‘Religious Tolerance Day’.A resolution of appreciation was also passed with regards to the recognition of the identity of Sikh religion ‘Nishan Sahib’ as the ‘Sikh Flag Day’ to be marked on March 11 in the Connecticut state of the USA. All resolutions were passed unanimously. The two-hour budget session was conducted without any disturbance or verbal spats as the president allowed all to express their views. Honourary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami conducted the stage. Prominent among those who spoke from the dais were Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, Simajit Singh Bains, Kiranjot Kaur and Bhai Gurpreet Singh Randhawa Wale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-resolution-says-rss-suppressing-religious-freedom-in-hindu-rashtra-bid-101617132890265.html

Being an elected representative, he has every right to raise his voice against the political dispensation. But the elements supported by the Congress acted violently in the presence of police,” said Sihag.BJP leaders had a minor altercation after a few shopkeepers at Bazaar number-4, the main commercial area of Abohar, refused to close their shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shutdown-in-abohar-against-attack-on-bjp-legislator-101617132710264.html

Despite spending back home a year ago due to the Covid-imposed lockdown around the world, Rajesh has no clear idea about going back to China, as the latest statement released by the Chinese government gives no deadline on when the entry restriction for international students ends. In its March 22 statement, the Indian Embassy in Beijing clarified that the recent decision of the Chinese government, related to visa facilitation for foreigners visiting China, does not apply to foreign students. “Chinese authorities at various levels continue to maintain their position that on account of last year’s announcement by the ministry of foreign affairs of the People’s Republic of China to suspend temporarily the entry of foreigners holding valid Chinese visa and residence permits following the outbreak Covid-19 in many countries, the visa suspension on foreigners stays until further notice,” read the statement released by the embassy. Students are now worried about their future. A third-year student from Jianghan University in Wuhan, said, “Most of us want to withdraw our admission from China and continue our education elsewhere. However, the National Medical Commission (NMC) of India mandates that we finish our course from the institute we got admitted to.” Apart from theory, colleges in China are now holding practicals also online. “Our seniors are being taught surgery online,” she said. “I had already started my medical internship in January 2020 at the First Hospital of Jilin University when the Covid-19 situation in China started getting out of hand and everyone was asked to stay home. By February, our families back home started getting worried and most foreign national students flew back home by March as the country was under severe lockdown restrictions,” said Rajesh, a final-year student who has been home in Santacruz since March 2020. According to the rules in China, MBBS students finish their final-year course and immediately have to complete a 52-week physical internship in assigned hospitals to be awarded their MBBS degree. While the first, second and third-year MBBS students are currently attending lectures online, the final-year students are at a loss as their internship can only be completed once the lockdown restrictions are lifted. According to data from the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), in 2018 and 2019 China received around 500,000 international students each, the third highest in the world after the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Official data shows that in 2018, over 23,000 Indian students were enrolled in various programmes in China. Indians represent the fourth largest group of international students in China, after South Koreans, Thais and Pakistanis. While students in India are in constant touch with Indian Embassy officials in Beijing, many have now started support groups on social networking sites to reach out to other international students facing the same problem. “Out of desperation, many of us are sharing our stories on Facebook and Instagram, hoping to attract the attention of Indian as well as Chinese governments. With lockdown restrictions easing out slowly, even the universities in China can start allowing students in phases and insist on the 14-day quarantine period before starting physical classes,” said another student. Officials from Indian embassy are encouraging students to stay in touch with their respective universities for updates. “The embassy will continue to engage with Chinese officials to seek progress on the issue of movement of people between the two countries,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/year-on-medical-students-of-chinese-universities-yet-to-resume-physical-classes-101617132529574.html

Lush green mangrove zones have now been turned into massive deserts and sprawling wetlands have turned into barren lands at several places, the environmentalists said.“With concerned authorities remaining unconcerned over the relentless destruction of the fragile biodiversity, Bollywood producers might as well make use of the man-made deserts and barren lands for their shoots,” said BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation. “This is no exaggeration as innumerable complaints to the government and the orders from the environment department and even the high court-appointed wetlands and mangroves committees have not yielded any results to save nature in Uran,” he said.“The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO), which has all along been neglecting the environment, might as well be the nodal agency for booking film-shoot sites,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.

The memorial will come up at the plot where the city mayor bungalow was located at Shivaji Park in Dadar. The ceremony will be held on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti, which falls on March 31 as per the Hindu calendar (tithi), party insiders said. Sena leader and minister Subhash Desai, who is general secretary of the Balasaheb Thackeray National Memorial Trust, said that Thackeray will remain present at the venue of the ground-breaking ceremony in central Mumbai. “We wanted to make it a big scale event but looking at the rising Covid-19 cases, we decided to keep the number of people limited. Uddhav ji will remain present. Ajit Pawar and Balasaheb Thorat, our MVA partners will also be present,” Desai said. Sena minister and president of the trust, Aaditya Thackeray, will not be present at the event as he is home quarantine. He is however expected to take part in the event virtually. The project, this is being implemented by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), is divided into two phases: the cost of phase 1 is ₹250 crore, while the second phase will cost ₹150 crore. The erstwhile mayor’s bungalow on the proposed memorial plot is a Grade II-B heritage structure, and will remain untouched during the project. In the first phase, the architecture, aesthetics and construction of the building for the memorial will take place. Phase one will also include the construction of a parking lot for visitors and focus on the mechanism of rain water harvesting at the memorial. The second phase will consist of the technological part of the memorial. This will include preparation of digital mapping, films, audio visuals, etc, for the memorial to start its operations.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||NGO challenges MoEFCC’s move||Vanashakti, a city-based, non-profit environment group, has filed a petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the validity of an administrative circular issued by the union environment ministry last month, which allows ex-post facto approval of projects that have not yet obtained coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance under the CRZ Notification, 2011. “Bringing such projects and activities in compliance with the environmental laws at the earliest point of time is therefore essential, rather than leaving them unregulated and unchecked, which will be more damaging to the environment,” wrote Sujit Kumar Bajpayee, joint secretary, CRZ division, MoEFCC, in the office memorandum, dated February 19, which is addressed to the environment secretaries of all coastal states. “This circular empowers coastal authorities/MoEFCC to regularize all kinds of CRZ violations on a day-to-day basis making it easier for environmental violators to evade substantive law. It further encourages a “pollute and pay” principle rather than the “precautionary principle”. “A public interest litigation is filed by Vanashakti on the ground that this circular is arbitrary, wholly unconstitutional and in direct contravention of recent Supreme Court judgments,” Vanashakti said in a statement issued Tuesday. “As the project commenced construction and / or operations without a prior CRZ clearance, the respective Coastal Zone Management Authority shall assess the environmental damages caused by such an action and shall give specific recommendation in respect of activities, corresponding to the environmental or ecological damage assessed, to be taken up by the project proponent within a period of three years from the date of clearance, under Compensatory Conservation Plan (CCP) and a Community Resource Augmentation Plan (CRAP),” states the MoEFCC’s February 19 office memorandum, which has been reviewed by HT. This procedure will allow projects that are typically permitted as per CRZ, 2011, but did not seek requisite clearances prior to commencement, to become regularised subject to fulfillment of certain conditions. Experts, however, pointed out while the amended CRZ (2019) notification has come into force, contingent coastal zone management plans (CZMP) as per the same have not yet been finalised. Until such a time, CRZ 2011 rules should remain in force, Vanashakti’s petition clarifies, adding that neither notification allows for grant of “ex-post facto CRZ clearance”, which the MoEFCC’s office memorandum proposes to facilitate, they said. Vanshakti’s PIL is listed for urgent hearing on April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ngo-challenges-moefcc-s-move-101617131269659.html

According to the guidelines, principals have been asked to collect assignments of students for each subject between May 21 and June 10.Students will be asked to submit a practical exam journal, homework and projects for science, while multiple choice questions (MCQs) will be given for internal assessments of Mathematics. For social sciences, 20 marks will be given on the basis of internal assessments and homework. “Students need to be called to submit the assignments in a phased manner to make sure there is no rush. Classrooms and the entire school premises need to be cleaned regularly and all the norms with respect to Covid-19 should be followed,” stated the guidelines.This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown, schools have been asked to do away with science practicals and have instead been asked to conduct assignments, which can be collected from students and marked. For every 80 marks paper, students have 20 marks for internal assessments in the exam.Teachers said that while the assignments are a welcome move, multiple assignments for students can be a hassle for correction. “For instance, in a class of 80 students, if 20 marks are to be divided between three different assignments, it is a lot of work for teachers and students both,” said a teacher from a suburban school.While the HSC (Class12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, 2021, SSC(Class10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 3.3 million students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from the state board every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/guidelines-on-class-10-assessments-released-101617131211328.html

The revised CZMP drafts were formulated earlier this year, following public hearings in February, and were considered by the MCZMA in its 153rd meeting on March 18 (the agenda for which is available on the MCZMA website). While the minutes of the meeting are yet to be released, two officials with direct knowledge of the development (who did not wish to be identified) confirmed that the revised draft CZMPs have received the MCZMA’s assent, and are currently awaiting the state government’s nod before being sent to the Centre for final approval. “Public hearings were held in February to receive objections and suggestions on the previous iteration of the CZMP, which was published in January 2020. It was learnt that the main objection is with regards to the coastal mapping in which regulatory zones have been delineated. The maps have been revised keeping in mind public feedback. The Authority has given a go ahead on these changes, and the revised plans are now with the state government, who will forward them to an appropriate body under the MoEFCC,” said one of the officials. Environmentalists expressed concern over this development. “What are the specific revisions in draft? What is the methodology that has been employed in delineating these regulatory zones? The updated coastal maps have not been put in the public domain, even though they have been ostensibly revised on the basis of public feedback,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust, calling for increased transparency in the matter. A senior government official privy to the development, however, clarified that the updated coastal maps are likely to be included in the minutes of the MCZMA’s 153rd meeting. “If the National Coastal Zone Management Authority does not object to the maps being made public, they will surely be included in the minutes, which will be released soon,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mczma-gives-assent-to-revised-draft-czmps-for-mumbai-101617131209552.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||Is a new variant driving Maharashtra’s surge?||As Covid-19 infections continue to surge in the second wave of the pandemic, health department officials in Maharashtra, which has the highest daily case load in the country, said that there was not enough data to attribute the rise in numbers to the new double mutant variant found in the random community samples from the state processed for genome sequencing.A new variant of Sars-Cov-2 was detected in random community samples from Nagpur, the Union government said last week, confirming the presence of mutations that are being tracked. The Union health ministry said a novel variant with a combination of two mutations E484Q and L452R was found in 206 samples taken from Maharashtra since December. Both these mutations could make the coronavirus spread more readily and, at least to a degree, resist immunity from a past infection or triggered by vaccines, the Centre said.However, state officials said that while the double mutant variant could be one of the reasons for the spread, it was certainly not the main reason for the surge, which they attributed to a lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid-fatigue among citizens. State health officials in Nagpur also pointed out that the cases were being reported from areas that did not have many cases in the first wave.Also Read | Maharashtra rules out statewide lockdown for now, localised curbs possible“In any pandemic, it is a natural phenomenon for the viruses to mutate. So far, we have seen that only a small percentage of the newly infected people have been diagnosed with a mutated strain. Thus, it is not scientifically correct to call it as the main reason for the rise in new Covid-19 cases but just as one of the contributing factors,” said Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management.“People were suffering from fatigue and had put down their safety guards which gave an opportunity to the virus to spread further. But it is not as strong as it was in the first phase as the fatality rate is still under 1%. However, this can also be attributed to the growth of public awareness,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force.The state reported 27,918 new cases on Tuesday bringing up the total cases to 2,773,435. This signals a rise of 618,365 cases from March 1 to March 30, the steepest 30-day rise. The case fatality rate (the number of deaths per 100 positive cases), however, declined from 2.42% to 1.96% in the same period.Task force members said that while the virus circulating in the state could be said to be more infectious than the first wave but not as lethal, more data was needed to draw the correlation to the surge.“With lax behaviour, people have allowed the virus to enter their bodies and mutate and spread further. Even now people are least bothered about the rules,” Salunkhe said.“We are hardly genome sequencing only a percentage of the samples and so the results are not widely applicable. The currently reported double mutation could further go into more mutations,” he added.India is only genetically sequencing 0.1% of its positive cases, far below the United Kingdom’s 5%, so it is believed that these figures are an underestimate, experts said.Also Read | Govt warns surge in Covid-19 cases can overwhelm resources“The double mutant variant has been found in 206 samples in Maharashtra and in Nagpur, it is particularly high at 20% of samples, but there is not enough data yet to correlate this with the nature of the surge being recorded there,” National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) director SK Singh in New Delhi had said last week.Singh said that three known variants of concern (VOCs) were also found in Maharashtra: 56 of these were of the UK variant (B.1.1.7), five of the South African variant (B.1.351) and one of the Brazilian variant (P.1).Of the 220 samples from Mumbai sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for sequencing, only 22 of them had the B 1.1.7 variant. Of those, half the persons had a travel history, while the other half comprised close contacts.The NIV and National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, refused to comment whether any new information could be gleamed from samples sent across for genome sequencing. Thus, it is as yet unknown what the latest number of samples with the double mutant variant are and what proportion they constitute of all samples sequenced.Every week, Mumbai’s civic body sends 50 samples for genome sequencing of infected patients with travel history, from hot spots and families with higher infection rates. “It generally takes 15 days for the reports to come to us. So, we are yet to get the latest report. But so far, we haven’t found “double mutation” except for the UK variant,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.Also Read | WHO chief toughens tone on China with lab probe call“Only around 10% of the samples that were sent for analysis had the UK variant. All these patients have successfully recovered without any fatality. Other than this, we haven’t found any other mutated strains,” Kakani added, referring only to Mumbai cases.In health ministry’s weekly media briefing on Covid-19 updates on Tuesday, VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, also said that the situation was turning “from bad to worse”. Ten districts in our country currently account for maximum active Covid-19 case load, of which eight districts -- Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nanded, and Ahmednagar -- are in Maharashtra alone.Dr Shashank Joshi, Covid task force member said that the genomic data from NCDC did not establish a correlation. “They had said last week that 20% of the Nagpur population had the [new] strain. There is no clarity on it, and they have not been able to conclusively establish a link [between mutation and the surge. However, the possibility cannot be ruled about.”However, officials and medical practitioners across affected districts have noted that all members of a family are being affected. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director from Bharati hospital in Pune said, “It is true that everyone in the family is getting infected now, it could be either because of the mutated strain or because people are not strictly following the home isolation rules. We have seen even multiple families in the society getting infected.”“In this wave we can see that the spread is faster and that the entire family is being affected even if one member gets the infection which did not happen in the first wave. Earlier cases were coming from slums and congested areas now most of the newer cases are coming from societies and middle-class families,” said Salunkhe, who also got infected after receiving the vaccine.Also Read | World leaders eye global deal to tackle outbreaksOfficials are also noting cases of infections among those who have taken the vaccine.“We have also seen infections among those who got the vaccines. One of our health care workers who got the vaccine tested positive for the infection, but the symptoms were just mild to moderate. We have observed that none of those on ventilators or who currently require critical care in our hospitals have got the vaccine even once. Even after getting the second shot, it takes at least 28 days to develop complete immunity,” Oswal said.Dr HK Sale, executive director at Noble Hospital, Pune said, “I have also tested positive for the infection despite getting both doses of the vaccine. I have mild symptoms like cold and cough. For almost a year I worked throughout without a single holiday and now I have got the infection. We have noticed a trend this time that patients are coming in large numbers suddenly which did not happen last time. In a short span of time, we saw multiple people come for admission which created a load on the infrastructure. The entire family is testing positive and the beds which were earlier occupied by non-Covid patients are now being reserved for Covid patients. The strain circulating in Pune needs to be studied.”The Centre attributes surge in cases due to inadequate Covid-19 testing, lack of public health measures, and to specific events or places where crowding happens, or where a large number of people are in close physical contact, coupled with lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Dr Lancelot Pinto, a Mumbai-based pulmonologist and epidemiologist said variants were par for the course in any pandemic. “Variants are expected to evolve when a highly transmissible virus moves rapidly through a host population. Such new variants of the coronavirus could have escape mutations which help the virus evade the body’s immune system, thereby conferring the virus with a survival advantage. Escape mutations in the spike protein could result in infections among individuals who had existing antibodies to earlier strains of the virus.”Health experts claim that as the line of treatment for the mutated virus remains the same, the public don’t need to panic. The focus should be on three things—double masking, robust testing and mass vaccination.“The type of patients landing in a serious situation remain the same those aged above 50 and those with comorbidities,” Oswal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-enough-data-to-attribute-surge-in-covid-cases-to-new-double-variant-101617131149551.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 27,918 fresh cases||After six consecutive days of recording over 30,000 Covid-19 infections, Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 27,918 fresh cases, taking the tally to 2,773,436. The reduction in numbers has been attributed to marginally lower testing on account of a public holiday on Monday, officials said. In the past 24 hours, 129,876 samples were tested. Mumbai too saw lower numbers in comparison on Tuesday with 4,760 new cases. Mumbai was recording over 5,000 new cases daily since March 24.Maharashtra reported 139 fatalities, pushing its death toll to 54,422. Mumbai recorded 10 deaths, taking its toll to 11,675. Nashik district reported 22 deaths, while Dhule district added 16 deaths. Nandurbar and Ahmednagar added seven and nine fatalities, respectively. Out of the 139 deaths reported, 72 deaths occurred in the past 48 hours, and 45 in the last week. The remaining 22 deaths are from the period before last week.Maharashtra went past 600,000 cases in March so far, which is more than what the state clocked in September 2020—when it first peaked. The state has added 618,366 cases between March 1 and March 30. In September, the state had added 593,192 cases. The deaths, however, are significantly lower than September. So far, in March, 2268 deaths have been recorded, while the state had 12,079 deaths in September.Amid rising cases in the state, health minister Rajesh Tope said that a lockdown over the state would only be imposed as a last resort. He said that neither chief minister Uddhav Thackeray nor the ruling coalition wishes to impose a lockdown. The statement comes days after Thackeray directed officials to look at lockdown as step to arrest the rise in Covid-19 cases. Tope, however, said that the government will be left with no option of the number of critical patients increase rapidly and exhaust the health facilities created, putting heavy strain on the medical infrastructure. Tope refuted the speculations that there are differences within the government over imposing lockdown, and said, “Lockdown is not dear to the chief minister nor to anybody else. But looking at the increasing number of cases, we must ensure there is not shortfall of ICU beds, oxygen cylinders, etc. We have to keep an eye on the rising cases and bed occupancy. If there is going to be a shortfall and for some reason we are unable to increase the bed capacity, we are left with no option but choose the option of lockdown. Nothing is more important than a person’s life.”The health minister said that in the next step towards stricter curbs on people, the state could explore options including shutting down restaurants, bars, cinema halls, theatres, etc to stop crowding. “We don’t want to impose a lockdown like earlier. We have to look at migrant labourers as construction is a major sector, workers in industries cannot be asked to stop work... We will find a centre-point on saving lives and not stopping the wheels of the economy. The next step we can look at is asking 50% attendance in private offices, shutting restaurants, cinema halls, etc,” Tope said.The minister added the state has ordered oxygen manufacturers to supply 80% oxygen for medical use, while the remaining can be used for industries. “We are placed well in terms of ventilators. However, the demand for oxygen is increasing. We have ordered manufacturers to supply 80% oxygen for medical use, remaining 20% for industries. The Food and Drug Administration will ensure that all districts get adequate supply of oxygen cylinders,” he said. The number of deaths in the state is increasing marginally. Officials attribute this increase to late admissions in hospitals. Tope said Covid-19 positive patients arrive late at hospital in a bad condition, making it challenging to save the patients. “Of the total cases we get , around 85% are asymptomatic. Most of them are in home quarantine. I have asked the department to strictly move patients to institutional quarantine facility, if home quarantine is not possible due to the size of the dwelling. If this is not done then, people reach hospital at a very late stage. The quarantine facilities will give anti-viral drug, monitor oxygen saturation, temperature, etc. so the person recovers faster. Many young people too have faced such issues,” he said, appealing people to get tested if they have any symptoms.Chief minister Thackeray and ministers are expected to take a review of the Covid-19 situation, the availability of beds and other key parameters before deciding further restrictions. The health infrastructure in rural parts of Maharashtra could get exhausted with the rising cases in these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-27-918-fresh-cases-101617131150112.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Containment zones, sealed buildings doubled||As the number of cases in the city has gone up drastically in the last one month, the number of containment zones, sealed buildings and floors have more than doubled. However, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said that citizens do not need to panic about shortage of beds in the city as out of the 85,000 cases in the last 48 days, only around 15,000 were symptomatic patients and only 8,000 patients required a bed in the hospital. However, Chahal added that citizens need to show Covid-19 appropriate behaviour else authorities will have no option left but to act.In the context of another lockdown, Chahal said, “I cannot predict the future, but we need to ensure there is Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. I cannot predict about future now so I cannot comment on the lockdown. But if people do not behave and they continue crowding, the government or BMC will not have any choice considering we cannot allow people to die, and we have to act here.” At the moment, according to BMC officials, due to the night curfew in place between 8 pm to 7am, gathering of more than five people is restricted. However, trains and buses will continue, one can go in their private cars as far as they are not more than 5 persons.Emphasising that the situation is not out of control, Chahal who took the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday said, “We are detecting high number of cases as we have increased the number of tests. The number of tests will soon go up to 60,000 per day and the number of infected people can be as high as 10,000 per day. Of these, the number of people in need of a bed will be relatively small given the current situation. The mortality rate in Mumbai is also low now. For the growing number of patients, bed management is being done through ward war rooms as before.”Chahal added, “A total of 85,000 patients were found in the 48 days from February 10 to March 30. Of these, 69,500 patients were found to be asymptomatic. They were kept in isolation at home. The remaining 15,500 patients developed symptoms of which only 8,000 people had to be admitted to the hospital. Others had mild symptoms and were cured by medication either at quarantine centres or by home isolation.” According to BMC’s data, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli area have the highest number of containment zones followed by Andheri West, Oshiwara, and Mulund having the highest number of sealed buildings and floors. As per the data, there were 12 active containment zones in the city on February 26 that increased to 64 active containment zones on March 28 followed by sealed building count increasing from 127 on February 26 to 578 on March 28. Further, in case of sealed floors, the count increased from 1,849 to 7,475.As per the BMC’s protocol, when multiple cases are reported from a slum cluster or chawl, the entire chawl or slum settlement is declared as containment zone. Whereas in case of high-rises, the BMC seals a building completely, if more than five cases are reported in one building. If there are less than five cases, the BMC seals the entire floor on which the patient resides instead of sealing the entire building.In terms of overall data, the BMC has traced more than 5.2 million high-risk and low-risk contacts of positive patients in the last one year. Further, in city, overall more than 4.7 million citizens have completed their quarantine and around 0.4 million are in home quarantine.Meanwhile, on maximum cases being reported from high rises, Chahal said, “I would appeal to the managing committee of the housing societies, considering they are equally responsible for ensuring their societies are virus-free. Everything cannot be done by policing, and we need to ensure that there is Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-containment-zones-sealed-buildings-doubled-101617131089529.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||BMC to procure 1.5 lakh vials of Remdesivir||With the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has placed an order to procure 1.5 lakh vials of Remdesivir as a precautionary measure to avoid any shortage of medicines.In the last 15 days, the city has reported over 50,000 new Covid-19 cases with an average positivity rate of above 15%. At present, Mumbai has 49,167 active Covid-19 patients who are on treatment now.Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for treatment of Ebola and is used in the early stage of the infection to bring down the viral load in patients.As per the civic body, they already have 70,000 vials of Remdesivir in their stock. In addition to it, they are already in the process to procure another 70,000 vials this week. Along with this, BMC has floated another tender to acquire 1.5 lakh vials of the antiviral drugs. This will help push up the cumulative stocks of Remdesivir to around 3 lakh.“The overall load of active patients has been the highest since its outbreak last year. So, other than improving the infrastructure, we are also focusing on the procurement process of drugs and oxygen to avoid any shortages of medicines in the future,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. “Till now, we haven’t got any report of shortages of medicines,” he added.In November, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that Remdesivir doesn’t do much to improve the health of people hospitalized with Covid-19. Despite this, the antiviral drug is being used in all hospitals in treating moderately and severely infected patients on compassionate grounds. “The medicine needs to be provided at the early stage of diagnosis for better results. We have been able to save many critically-ill patients with the drug,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-to-procure-1-5-lakh-vials-of-remdesivir-101617131029491.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||Allow us to give Covid vaccine door-to-door: BMC to state||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has asked the Maharashtra government for permission to take its vaccination drive door-to-door across the city, in a bid to increase the number of beneficiaries vaccinated per day.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said, “The BMC currently vaccinates 40,000 to 45,000 beneficiaries per day. We have set a target of vaccinating 100,000 beneficiaries per day. We have asked the state government for permission to go door-to-door. Even without going door-to-door, we can meet our target of vaccinating 100,000 beneficiaries per day. The BMC has decided to take a few steps to meet this target.” Chahal was speaking at the jumbo Covid facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex, after taking his first vaccine dose on Tuesday afternoon.From April 1, the BMC will start vaccination of all citizens above the age of 45, regardless of whether they have comorbidities. Presently, as part of the latest phase of the vaccination drive, the BMC has been vaccinating senior citizens, and citizens above the age of 45 who have comorbidities.Overall, 4,000,000 Mumbaiites are above the age of 45, 2,300,000 Mumbaiites are senior citizens, and 300,000 are citizens above the age of 45 who have comorbidities, as per data collected by the civic body during it My Family, My Responsibility drive.With permission to vaccinate all citizens above the age of 45 regardless of comorbidities, the BMC hopes it will inch closer to its target of vaccinating 1,00,000 Mumbaiites per day. The measures announced by the BMC earlier to ensure Mumbai is able to meet this target include extending timings of vaccination centres from to 9pm, instead of 5 pm. The BMC has asked all private hospitals to extend timings, however, this is not mandatory.Chahal said on Tuesday, “The BMC has also asked the central government permission to allow vaccination centres at 26 other hospitals. We need permission so they can access the Co-WIN application. We have also asked private hospitals to vaccinate 1000 beneficiaries per day. Vaccination is low in private hospitals at present. Municipal hospitals are already vaccinating a total of 40,000 or so beneficiaries per day. If the active vaccination centres in private hospitals meet the target of 1000 vaccinations per day, we will be able to overall vaccinate 75,000 beneficiaries per day, even if we do not go door to door.” As of Tuesday, 108 vaccination centres are operating 245 sessions per day. A total of 538,169 beneficiaries above the age of 60 have been vaccinated in Mumbai, and 97,812 beneficiaries above the age of 45 years who also have comorbidities have been vaccinated in the city.When asked about the Central government denying permission to the civic body to go door-to-door, Chahal said, “Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan governments are doing this on their own. Maharashtra government is disciplined and hence asked the Centre for permission. But this has not been denied.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department, said on Monday, “Presently, the turnout in citizens above the age of 45 who also have comorbidities is low. Beneficiaries are afraid to bring medical certificates to validate they have comorbidities. They fear this will interfere with their health insurance systems at a later stage.”From April 1, as no medical certificates will be required to receive a vaccine shot for those above 45, the BMC hopes the turnout will increase. Moreover, most people from residential buildings to qualify for the latest phase of the drive have been covered, Kakani said. Those that remain to be vaccinated live mostly in slums, or are from lower socio-economic background. To help with registration, non-governmental organizations and a handful of large government and semi-government organisations have been roped in. Non-government organisations will help with the registration process, and government and semi-government organizations have been asked to encourage their employees to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-us-to-give-covid-vaccine-door-to-door-bmc-to-state-101617131030135.html
31-03-2021||Mumbai||Allegations against Anil Deshmukh: Maharashtra names retd judge to probe Singh’s claims||Maharashtra government on Tuesday appointed a single-member committee to probe former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations that home minister Anil Deshmukh ran an extortion racket and instructed his officers to collect up to ₹100 crore from establishments like bars, restaurants and hookah bars in the city. Singh made these allegations in a letter dated March 20, which was addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior bureaucrats and politicians. Deshmukh denied the charges, even as the Opposition BJP demanded his resignation following these allegations. The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government however, rallied behind Deshmukh and decided last week that a judicial probe will be ordered into the affair.The panel, which will comprise retired Bombay high court (HC) judge Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal, has been given a timeline of six months to submit a report. The high-level probe committee has not been constituted under Commission of Inquiry Act and thus the government is not required to make the report, or the actions taken on the basis of its findings, public.The panel has been tasked to examine whether Singh submitted proof to establish that Deshmukh or any staffer from his office committed any offence/ misconduct as alleged in the letter; whether specific allegations raised by Singh, citing the messages from assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil, and assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze had any truth and merited investigation by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau or any other agency; as well as to offer any recommendations that it deems fit.“The Hon’ble Home Minister expressed to Shri Vaze that he had a target to accumulate ₹100 crore a month. For achieving the aforesaid target, the Hon’ble Home Minsiter told Shri Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of Rs. 2-3 lakhs each was collected from each of them a monthly collection of Rs. 40-50 crores were achievable. The Hon’ble Home Minister added that the rest of the collection could be made from other sources,” Singh’s unsigned letter stated, referring to a purported meeting that took place in the home minister’s official residence Dyaneshwar in mid-February.Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his alleged role in planting explosives in an SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February. He is also suspected to be the mastermind in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to that SUV.Singh was transferred out of the Police Commissioner’s office on March 17, and made Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra state. Deshmukh told reporters that the transfer was not “routine” but owing to “serious and unpardonable mistakes” committed by a few officers in Mumbai police Commissionerate.Deshmukh refuted the allegations in a series of tweets as soon as reports of Singh’s letter surfaced.“When his involvement was getting clear in the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case as well as in the case of Mansukh Hiran’s death and possibilities of him getting linked [to both] directly [became clear], former police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me to save himself from further action.”The letter quoted a message exchange purportedly between Singh and ACP Patil regarding a meeting that allegedly took place at Deshmukh’s official residence, in which other officials, including the home minister’s personal secretary Sanjiv Palande, were also present. The home minister allegedly gave similar instructions to Patil and another officer, DCP Raju Bhujbal.“Shri Patil along with DCP Bhujbal were called at the official residence of the Home Minister for a meeting. While ACP Patil and DCP Bhujbal were made to wait outside the Home Minister’s cabin, Mr. Palande went inside the chamber of the Home Minister and after coming out took ACP Patil and DCP Bhujbal on the side. Palande informed ACP Patil that the Home Minister was targeting a collection of ₹40-50 crores which was possible through an approximate 1,750 bars, restaurants and establishments operating in Mumbai. I was informed by ACP Patil about the demand to make collections for the Home Minister,” the letter said regarding a meeting that purportedly took place on March 4.The letter further stated that senior politicians including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, and other senior bureaucrats were aware of some “misdeeds and malpractices” raised by Singh.Singh had first approached the Supreme Court and later the Bombay High Court seeking a probe by the CBI against Deshmukh. Earlier on Tuesday, the HC said it would hear on Wednesday the Public Interest Litigation filed by Singh.In a high-level meeting of ministers last week, it was decided that the probe would be constituted under the Commission of Inquiry Act. However, it wasn’t.“Since the probe is not constituted under Commission of Inquiry Act, it is not binding on the government to make the report or the actions taken on the basis of its findings public. During [Devendra] Fadnavis-led BJP rule, a report on the probe on allegations against former revenue minister Eknath Khadse was not made public as it similarly had no statutory obligation on the government,” said a senior state official.“The allegations made are not only serious but shocking. For the first time in the history of Maharashtra, a director general level officer has made such allegations and that too with chats in which demand for money was made. The chat is an evidence to what Singh has said. We are of the view that the home minister should immediately resign from his position and if he is not ready then the chief minister should take his resignation” Devendra Fadnavis had said, when the allegations first surfaced.Pawar however held two press conferences pointing out inconsistencies in the claims made in the letter. “In view of fresh evidence that proves that Deshmukh was not in Mumbai, it would not be fair to take his resignation… The BJP’s demand for home minister’s resignation has no substance… I am absolutely clear that allegations made against Deshmukh were incorrect as he was in Nagpur,” Pawar had said during one of the press conferences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allegations-against-anil-deshmukh-maharashtra-names-retd-judge-to-probe-singh-s-claims-101617130969585.html
31-03-2021||Bangalore||Jarkiholi case: Woman records statement||Days after filing a complaint of alleged sexual assault against former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, the woman, who purportedly featured in the alleged sex tape, on Tuesday recorded her statement before a magistrate’s court in Bengaluru. Later, she was also questioned by the special investigation team set up to probe the case.Soon after her statement was recorder, the woman’s advocate demanded the arrest of Jarkiholi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Gokak in Belagavi district. Speaking to reporters after the victim drove into the SIT technical cell in Adugodi to record her statement in South Bengaluru, her lawyer Jagadeesh Kumar said, “Immediately, the government and police should arrest the accused.”Kumar said her statement was recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).The recording of her statement before a judge at the Chief Metropolitan Court Complex comes nearly a month after allegations were first levelled against Jarkiholi and could spell trouble for the former water resources minister, who has spent much of March trying to clear his name and calling himself a target of a “sinister political conspiracy”.On Tuesday, the woman went into the court complex undetected by the tens of television news cameras and scores of police personnel lined up near the premises. She has not made any public statement so far.Kumar said the SIT had requested to record a statement and the victim’s side obliged to the same. He dismissed the claims that the victim was “handed over” to the SIT.“They have let the offender roam around freely. Why will they arrest her?” he questioned.The lawyer added that the police were helping to create an environment of safety for the victim, who has, on multiple occasions, stated that she feared for her life and that of her family members.The high-profile case has consumed much of prime-time news space in Karnataka and other places. The chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led state government has been defending the former minister against serious charges even before the SIT could record the woman’s statement.Earlier, the lawyers told the court that the victim did not trust the SIT investigating the sex tape case and because of that, she recorded her statement before the magistrate.The high-profile case has consumed much of prime-time news space in Karnataka and other places. The chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led state government has been defending the former minister against serious charges even before the SIT could record the woman’s statement.According to the complaints, Jarkiholi sexually harassed the victim on the pretext of getting her a government job. The victim has released at least two videos so far from unknown locations. The case has taken several twists and turns, including a political one, after the name of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K Shivakumar was associated with the case.The Bengaluru police on Friday registered an FIR against Jarkiholi on several charges, including “sexual intercourse by a person in authority” and “sexual assault”, based on a handwritten complaint filed by the woman.The court passed orders in the presence of the investigating officer, assistant commissioner of police P Kavitha, and said that after giving a statement before the magistrate the SIT could record the victim’s statement. The court also directed to ensure adequate security at the court premises and also to the woman.The victim left the SIT’s technical cell in Adugodi around 8 pm in a convoy of vehicles, escorted by the police. It is unclear where the victim is currently residing or if the police have made any arrangements for her stay.Jarkiholi, who reportedly visited a temple in neighbouring Maharashtra on Tuesday, could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jarkiholi-case-woman-records-statement-101617130249518.html

31-03-2021||Delhi||AAP-BJP lock horns on mosquito menace in Capital||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday trained its guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) for failing to control mosquito breeding in the city.The BJP, however, was quick to dismiss the allegations as “baseless”.“The BJP has transformed Delhi into ‘mosquito Capital’. Due to the miserable failure of the BJP-ruled MCDs, today Delhi is suffering from this mosquito menace. The AAP demands that the BJP-ruled civic bodies begin fogging within the next 48 hours or else the citizens of Delhi will take to the streets. To do fogging once across Delhi, it will cost the corporations around ₹100 crore. The BJP-ruled MCDs know that they will never return to power, so they have spent this money elsewhere already,” said the AAP’s in-charge of municipal affairs, Durgesh Pathak.While the AAP is in power in Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations that go to polls next year.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The AAP is a corrupt party and that is the reason they try to find corruption everywhere with such baseless allegations. Fogging operations are currently not being done in Delhi in the light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Fogging can cause breathing difficulties. As far as the funds are concerned, the annual budget for fogging for all the three MCDs put together is less than ₹50 crore. The AAP should stop misleading people and invest more in governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapbjp-lock-horns-on-mosquito-menace-incapital-101617129950823.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Empowering women at grassroots, via the anganwadi network||In order to strengthen the role of women in the state economy and help women entrepreneurs develop micro business enterprises, the Delhi government is ready to launch the Saheli Samanvay Kendra (SSK) scheme at 21 anganwadi (playschool) hubs beginning April 1. These hubs, on a pilot basis, will work as resource centres to enable socio-economic empowerment of women, nurture entrepreneurship, and act as local incubation centres.Delhi has over 10,700 anganwadis and, of these, around 390 have been clubbed to form around 110 anganwadi hubs – they combine resources of all nearby anganwadis to function as playschools. While children are currently away from anganwadis due to the pandemic, 21 of these hubs will be used for the SSK scheme.“Through discussions held under Saheli Samvaad, a need and aspirational mapping will be done to identity potential women and adolescent girls, their educational status, present level of skills and capacity, preference of work, ability to travel outside the community for livelihood trainings, availability of time, and stability of residence for continuity in the Mahila Samooh (women’s collective),” said a notice from the women and child department.These centres will also help create a database of traditional knowledge and local resources along with collaborating with agencies providing training in soft skills, entrepreneurship and livelihood skills. The aim of the scheme is to build women collectives, strengthen them, and to form district- and state-level federations in the longer run.Rashmi Singh, director, WCD, said, “These hubs will act as local incubation centres for individual startups and to promote self-help groups (SHGs).”The centres aim to be a “vibrant space for women and children to engage, receive services and information, build capacities and get sensitised on various issues”.Also read | Switch Delhi campaign to focus on youth in final weekDuring the Delhi budget this year, finance minister Manish Sisodia had announced that 500 such hubs would be set up across Delhi to “economically empower women” in nearby areas who would visit the centres for four hours every morning.Sisodia also cited a government survey which showed that the percentage of unemployed women in the city rose from 26% in February 2020 to 40% this year.Beginning next month, anganwadi workers will also engage in home visits and weekly meetings (with women and adolescent girls) for mobilisation, awareness, and sensitisation of the community. “The learnings can help in finalising the guidelines before scaling up the model in all projects,” Singh said, adding that the centres would be assessed in 10 days.The SSKs will also aim to find solutions to women-centric problems through locally available resources. Attention will be given to issues such as decreasing participation of women in workforce, social issues of women’s economic empowerment, and developing leadership skills among women.“These training sessions will also allow them [women] to become confident and raise their aspirations to undergo vocational training and skilling programmes to widen their choices and be self-reliant. In the process of upgrading their skills, the individual/group who shows inclination and potential to start up a micro enterprise will be supported and hand held through the Samriddhi initiative,” the WCD directive stated.Crèche services have also been proposed for working women under the scheme. A help desk – Mahila Sahayata Prakosht – will also be set up at these centres to connect women to the required legal, police, health, and financial assistance that they may need. Along with apprising women of various government schemes to help them, the scheme would also focus on the needs of vulnerable groups such as widows and the destitute.While welcoming the initiative, Madhu Bala, head programmes at NGO Jagori, which works on empowerment of women, said skills training alone will not lead to entrepreneurship or empowerment of women.“Covid-19 has impacted livelihoods and communities have been wanting such schemes from the government. But along with skills training, care must be taken to help these women with the capital needed to start their small businesses. Channels to subsidies or easy loan schemes must be worked out to facilitate entrepreneurship among women from low-income groups,” she said.Bala also pointed to the division of skills between men and women. “Generally, women opt for traditional skills like sewing, beautician courses among others. If the government takes steps to introduce non-traditional skills such as driving, repairing auto parts or others, it could also help in addressing the gender inequality in certain jobs,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/empowering-women-at-grassroots-via-the-anganwadi-network-101617129949525.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Switch Delhi campaign to focus on youth in final week||The eighth and the final week of the Switch Delhi mass awareness campaign will focus on sensitising the youth about the benefits that electric vehicles have to offer, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Tuesday.The Switch Delhi campaign aims to sensitise, inform and encourage Delhi’s youth to opt for electric vehicles (EVs).“The youth of Delhi can play a huge role in making the EV movement in Delhi a mass movement. I appeal to the youth to pledge that the first vehicle they purchase will be an electric one. They can drive change and be the torchbearers of this movement, especially since at least 65% of India’s population are below 35 years of age. The Delhi government will engage with the youth via the Switch Delhi campaign and motivate them to adopt electric vehicles and contribute to a cleaner and greener Delhi,” said Gahlot.The minister said by switching to electric two-wheelers that have very low operating costs, a person can save approximately ₹22,000 annually as compared to a petrol bike, that will entail an expenditure of at least ₹20,000.“An electric two-wheeler provides a lifetime saving of 1.98 tonne of carbon emissions as compared to petrol-driven two wheelers, which is equivalent to planting 11 trees,” said Gahlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/switch-delhi-campaign-to-focus-on-youth-in-final-week-101617129950174.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Man out on bail nabbed for killing CA in Adarsh Ngr during ‘robbery bid’||Delhi Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 22-year-old man, who had a past criminal record, and claimed to have solved the murder of a 45-year-old chartered accountant (CA), who was shot dead at an under-construction building in north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar two weeks ago.The arrested suspect, identified as Jai Kumar Singh, allegedly killed the CA during a robbery attempt. Police said the killing came just ten days after Singh was released from a Delhi jail on bail. He has previously been involved in nearly 14 cases of robbery, snatching, kidnapping, rape and property theft, the police said.While deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said that Singh failed in his robbery attempt, the family members of the CA, identified as Anil Aggarwal, claim that a gold chain that he was wearing has been missing. The police are now trying to ascertain if the arrested man has been lying about the missing chain or someone else picked it up from the crime scene in the commotion that had broken out after the firing.“My brother-in-law’s gold chain has been missing. We spoke to the police about it. They told us that their investigation is on. My sister was called by the police to identify the arrested man. I shall ask her if the police officers have told her anything about the chain,” said Aggarwal’s brother-in-law, Mohit Goyal on Tuesday.On March 16, Aggarwal, who worked as a CA in a private firm in Noida, and his wife Anju Aggarwal had gone to meet labourers at their under-construction building, which is nearly a kilometre away from their present residential address in Majlis Park. Around 10am, an unidentified man, wearing a helmet arrived on a two-wheeler, parked the it outside the building, went inside and shot Aggarwal near his neck, said a police officer associated with the case.“Aggarwal’s wife and a couple of labourers were present there, but everything happened so quickly that nobody could intervene. Aggarwal was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” said the officer.A murder case was registered and scrutiny of CCTV cameras revealed that the suspect had followed the couple to their new building on a scooter, whose front wheel guard had red and blue marks. Investigators further learnt that the scooter was stolen from Patel Nagar on February 8. The same scooter was used in three-four snatching incidents reported from west and north-west Delhi by the same suspect. Through police informers, the suspect was identified as Jai Kumar Singh, but he was found missing from his Delhi addresses, the officer said.“Singh had come out of jail on bail on March 6. Teams conducted raids at his native village in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda, but learnt that he had fled to Delhi. We arrested him on Saturday from Inderlok. Singh has confessed to the crime and his interrogation led to the recovery of the two-wheeler used in the offence,” said DCP Rangnani.Singh, the DCP said, disclosed that he had procured the pistol from his associate, one Aryan alias Rahul, and returned it to him after Aggarwal’s murder. “We are trying to arrest Aryan and recover the gun,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-out-on-bail-nabbed-for-killing-ca-in-adarsh-ngr-during-robbery-bid-101617129889497.html
31-03-2021||Delhi||Govt to ramp up Covid-19 beds as Capital adds 992 fresh infections||With Covid-19 cases on the rise in the national capital, the state government has decided to increase the number of beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection, as the city added 992 fresh cases of the infection, at a positivity rate of 2.70%.Nearly 29% of all beds reserved for Covid-19 treatment were occupied as on Tuesday evening, according to the state government’s Delhi Corona app.There are currently just over 5,800 Covid-19 beds in the city, of which over 2,000 are Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds. Nearly 33% of the ICU beds were occupied as on Tuesday evening, according to the app.While the city added fewer cases of the infection on Tuesday as compared to the previous day, this was primarily due to far fewer tests on account of Holi. According to Tuesday’s bulletin, which reflects data from the previous day, 36,757 Covid-19 tests were conducted in the city, down from 68,805 samples collected on Monday.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday tweeted about the increase of Covid-19 beds, and added that there was no cause for worry.The number of hospitalisations in the city has doubled in less than two weeks – from 794 persons admitted as on March 18 to 1,584 on March 30. According to senior officials from Delhi’s health department, the number of beds will be augmented in both public and private sector hospitals.The city had nearly 18,700 beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection in November when Delhi witnessed its third and worst surge in the number of cases, reporting 8,593 cases in a day at its peak. The beds were slowly freed up for the treatment of other ailments as the number of cases in the city dropped and the positivity rate dipped below 1% in December-end.Also read | Delhi among top 10 worst-hit districts, says Union health ministryAn official of at least one major private hospital in the city said they are in the process of increasing the number of beds. It is, however, unclear whether they have received any orders from the Delhi government.With the positivity rate on the rise, experts believe that the increase in the number of cases in the city is likely to continue. The positivity rate remained high at 2.70% on Tuesday. The average positivity rate for the last seven days stood at 1.8%, up from 0.9% the week before, and 0.56% the week before that. The positivity rate – which is indicative of the ongoing spread of the infection – had remained below 1% consecutively for 82 days between December 28 and March 19.“The number of cases is likely to keep increasing for at least seven to 10 days now, especially after Holi. The increase in the number of cases happened mainly because of two reasons: First, the people who had protected themselves by staying at home during the previous surges started coming out when the number of cases had gone down in December and January. Second, everything opening up gave a signal to those who travel to the city for work or education that it is safe. This floating population increased the pool of people susceptible to the infection,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.With four people dying of the viral infection according to the Tuesday bulletin, the daily fatality count remained lower than the seven deaths reported each day on average during the last seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-ramp-up-covid-19-beds-as-capital-adds-992-fresh-infections-101617129831032.html

31-03-2021||Other||Artificial intelligence, game-based techniques to take lead in new education board||New Delhi The Delhi government plans to introduce the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and game-based techniques for continuous assessment of students under its new state school education board, officials said after the board’s first general body meeting on Tuesday. The Delhi Cabinet approved the setting up of the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) on March 6 with the society for the board being registered on March 19. The board is likely to become functional for up to at least middle-level classes (up to Class 8) from the upcoming academic session.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who is the head of the board, said that students will be assessed holistically on the basis of their knowledge, attitude, and skills. “ DBSE will employ effective modern technology available today to ensure a personalised learning experience for our students. Artificial Intelligence and game-based assessments will be put to use to create a system where every student is regularly evaluated on the basis of his/her strengths and enters the next phase of their life with a deep understanding of their unique strengths,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. Shailendra Sharma, the principal advisor to the Directorate of Education (DoE), said that the new education board will focus on assessing students on the basis of their skills and not just classroom learning. “Conventionally, board assessments are designed as pen and paper tests only. They test subject knowledge which is to be recalled by students in one sitting exam. However, in this time and age, we also need to assess the application of knowledge, the extent of understanding, and attitudes like empathy, teamwork, collaboration, problem-solving abilities. For this, we plan to use new technology — such as artificial intelligence and game-based tools,” he said.Artificial intelligence will be used in the educational assessment process to provide real-time learning feedback of students to teachers. Under game-based assessments, students will be given situations or be involved in activities to evaluate their skills and understanding. Sharma said that the government will also look at assessment models followed by other countries. “The purpose of setting up the Delhi board is not to replicate the existing models. We are basically looking at how assessment can complement the teaching-learning process in class across all grades, and that is why we will explore the most contemporary models followed across the globe,” he added.Educationalist Meeta Sengupta said that the use of AI and game-based tools in assessment is a refreshing change but was likely to be challenging. “Using game-based and AI tools that we have at our command to understand the learning and progress of a student is a great idea. However, it’s also an incredibly complex process where one has to be very careful about ethics and empathy. It should be used without intruding on privacy and without making bad assumptions.” Principals of several government schools too welcomed the idea. Awadesh Kumar Jha, head of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “There is a requirement of reforms in the existing assessment process. We need to evaluate students holistically in order to make them understand their strengths and weaknesses. The game-based assessment will of great help, especially for the younger students.”Aparajita Gautam, president of Delhi parents association, said that the government should create awareness about changes it was planning to bring in the education system among parents . “It is a great idea. But the government needs to inform parents about it by roping in the school management committees . These are things that parents might not understand easily,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/artificial-intelligence-game-based-techniques-to-take-lead-in-new-education-board-101617129769502.html

Except for the two fatalities, no more accidents were reported this year. There were 23 road accidents reported during Holi celebrations in 2020 and 28 in 2019. This effectively means that the total accident cases this year have come down by 91%, when compared to last year. The city had witnessed seven deaths because of mishaps in 2019, data showed.Apart from road mishaps, incidents of violations of traffic rules also saw a sharp decline from the previous years, as only 3,446 fines were issued during Holi celebrations on Monday, which was almost 30% less from 2020 when 4,918 such challans were issued on the day of Holi. Of the total challans on Monday, 1,255 were for riding without helmets, 170 for triple riding, 100 for drink driving, 121 for dangerous driving while 1,800 were for other traffic violations, the data said.Police officers attributed this decline to heavy deployment of their personnel on the streets and restrictions imposed in the city following the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA’s) Covid-19 guidelines that banned Holi celebrations and gatherings in public places. Owing to massive awareness campaigns through newspapers, news channels and social media, there was better compliance observed this year, officers said. As far as action taken for violations of DDMA guidelines regarding Covid-19 is concerned, 72 cases were registered for celebrating Holi in public places. As many as 871 people were prosecuted or arrested for various violations such as drinking in public places, disturbing peace, obstructing or annoying people on streets, not wearing masks and not following social distancing, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said.“We also impounded 1,696 vehicles. No major incident was reported during Holi this year. Delhi Police takes this opportunity to thank all stakeholders for extending their cooperation celebrating Holi while observing Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Biswal.Apart from the police, the Delhi government also issued challans for mask and social distancing-related violations. According to government’s data, a total of 2,758 challans were issued by all the 11 revenue districts on Monday with north revenue district topping the chart by issuing 607 fines. The lowest fines — 74 in total — was issued by the central revenue district, the data shows.The government collected ₹51,24,910 from all the challans issued.Although no major untoward incidents were reported on the day, a video was circulated on social media in which a crowd is seen alleging that the police interrupted a Holika Dahan in east Delhi’s Krishana Nagar by dousing the flames with water. It was also alleged that two people had been detained.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram, however, refuted the allegations by saying that the incident was not related to Holika Dahan but was of a normal fire that had spread to an overhead wire, a tree and signboards of nearby shops. “The fire was timely doused by the policemen with the help of locals. The allegations against the police are false. Nobody was detained,” said Sathiyasundaram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/total-mishaps-during-holi-down-by-91-shows-police-data-101617129710957.html

The entire process will take 4-5 more months. Meanwhile, we have started issuing allotment letters for the remaining flats that are located mainly in Jasola Vihar and Dwarka.”Also read | Delhi to increase normal, ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients: CM KejriwalThere are 348 two-bedroom, Middle Income Category (MIG) flats in Dwarka’s sector 16B which were put on sale in DDA’s housing scheme that was launched in January this year. The draw of lots for the scheme was held on March 10.Prodded about why half-finished flats were put on sale, a senior DDA official said, “These flats were nearing completion. Some basic finishing work and a few necessary permissions from various government agencies are pending. We decided to include this in the recently launched scheme, as they were almost ready. Else we would have had to wait for the next housing scheme. Learning from our past experience, we have decided to delay the allotment, as we don’t want any inconvenience to be caused to the allottees. We have informed the allottees about the same.”The 348 MIG flats, built on an area of 1,320 sqft to 1,430 sqft (approx) in Dwarka’s sector 16B are priced between R1.16 crore and R1.27 crore.Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA priced its High Income Group (HIG) flats at ₹2.1 crore -- the costliest till date. There are 254 flats in the HIG category located in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini and Dwarka. While 215 flats in Jasola have been put on sale for the first time, the remaining were flats that were returned by allottees of the previous housing schemes.

31-03-2021||Delhi||EDMC to face strict action for Ghazipur landfill fire: Rai||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said “strict action” will be initiated against the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) for its alleged apathy in preventing a fire that broke out at the Ghazipur landfill on Sunday.Addressing the media, Rai said the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) inspected the landfill and prepared a detailed report that showed lapses on the part of the EDMC. “The report states the EDMC made no efforts or arrangements in preventing the fire. Strict action will be initiated against the civic body,” said Rai on Tuesday adding that such fires were responsible for deteriorating the pollution levels in the Capital.A portion of the Ghazipur landfill in east Delhi caught fire around 5.30pm on Sunday, which lasted nearly for an hour. Seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the blaze. Officials from the Delhi Fire Service said toxic chemicals from the heap of waste aggravated the blaze and it took longer to douse the fire completely.Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), who had inspected the site after the blaze had called the fire a “natural phenomenon.” The EDMC spokesperson did not respond to calls and messages requesting comment.Meanwhile, while higher temperatures and improved wind speeds kept the air quality mostly in the moderate category last week, a dust storm caused the air pollution levels in the city to spike to the ‘poor’ category on Tuesday.Also read | Dusty winds add to pollution, mercury may rise from Apr 2The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Tuesday was 232. An AQI reading of 101-200 is considered to be moderate.Rai said the DPCC has written to various agencies, asking them to monitor such sites, where chances of fires breaking out are higher due to rising temperatures.“Delhi has been making efforts...Two organisations -- IQAir and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)-- have acknowledged that air pollution levels in the city have reduced,” he said.According to IQAir’s report, Delhi has succeeded in reducing pollution levels, especially PM2.5 levels, by 15%. A CSE report says PM2.5 levels in Delhi have reduced by 25% since 2014-15, said the minister.IQAir is a Swiss group that measures air-quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5. It is also a manufacturer of air purifiers.“Delhi is the first state to shut down thermal power plants. We have identified pollution hotspots and taken specific action. All industrial units are now operating on piped natural gas. We are the first state to launch an electric vehicle policy,” said Rai, listing the steps taken by the government to curb pollution levels in Delhi.“However, pollution in Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Bhiwadi, also affects Delhi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/edmc-to-face-strict-action-for-ghazipur-landfill-fire-rai-101617129709590.html
31-03-2021||Noida||Positivity rate spikes in GB Nagar and Ghaziabad||The monthly number of positive Covid-19 cases per 100 samples tested in Gautam Budh Nagar where it crossed 1% for the first time this year, and is rising in Ghaziabad. The trend is in keeping with the rise in cases at a national level, including neighbouring Delhi.Officials said they expected the rise as people began ignoring health protocols in the run-up to Holi and also the arrival of more people from other states. According to official figures, the sample positivity rate in Ghaziabad in March (till date) was 0.71% (554 positive reports out of 78,363), while it was about 1.06% (606 positive reports out of 57246) for the same period in GB Nagar. In February, the sample positivity was 0.31% (179 out of 57,779) for Ghaziabad and 0.37% (202 out of 54064) in GB Nagar. Sometimes patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than positive cases in the districts. Officials from GB Nagar said that they had chalked out a four-pronged strategy to deal with rise in positivity. “We will be focussing on micro-containment zones and rapid response teams have been tasked to take up sealing in clusters where we have more cases. We have also formed a dedicated team under an additional chief medical officer for tracing of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts for speedier testing and isolation. The testing is also being scaled up and four private hospitals have been put on standby besides two of our government hospitals already working as Covid hospitals,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. Ghaziabad district administration officials said they were re-opening the Covid-19 hospitals to prepare to treat more people. The state has a three-tier hospitalisation system for Covid-19 -- L-1 for asymptomatic patients, L-2 for patients with mild symptoms and L-3 for severe cases.“In wake of rising cases, we have decided to open our L-2 dedicated Covid facility at Sanjay Nagar Hospital on April 1. The hospital has 100 beds. Our L-3 facility at Santosh Medical College is already operational with 400 beds. Besides, we have 12 private hospitals which are ready with 464 beds. We will also be focussing on micro-containment zones and the area of containment zones may also be extended depending on the severity and number of cases,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The district also increased the testing teams to 30, while 800 teams are undertaking surveiling operations. The UP government has sought reports on those people testing positive ever after two vaccine doses in six districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. “We have only one positive case of a 68-year-old man who tested positive after his vaccination on March 9. Although the cases are rising, the severity is less. About 90% cases in March were asymptomatic while the rest were mild or moderate symptomatic,” said an officer from the Ghaziabad district health department. “We are expecting cases to rise due to two major reasons. One is due to mixing of population during Holi and other festivals and second is due to arrival of people back home during the festivalsSo far, we have not detected presence of any new Covid strain.”The officials from the district health department in GB Nagar said that they came across two post-vaccination positive cases in March.Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad) said that positive cases among the vaccinated population was not surprising. “It takes six weeks after the second dose to get full immunity. Even after this, the beneficiary can test positive, but the effect should be mild. The authorities should aggressively test and increase contact tracing to contain the surge,” he said.” A lockdown or creation of large containment areas may not be recommended as there may be opposition to this. However, the strategy of micro-containment would be useful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/positivity-rate-spikes-in-gb-nagar-and-ghaziabad-101617129649538.html

For a week after the opening, the authority will not charge users either till the Union ministry of road transport and highway approves the rates.The DME’s 14-km phase 1 (Akshardham-UP Gate) and 22-km phase 3 (Dasna-Hapur) are already operational. The 19 km phase 2 links UP Gate and Dasna while the 32 km phase 4 links Dasna and Meerut.“For a more efficient tolling system, we are currently testing the linking of automatic number plate reader (ANPR) to the FASTag system,” said Mudit Garg, NHAI project director. The ANPR is a system of high definition, high speed cameras installed throughout the DME that was meant to catch traffic violations. FASTag is a system that would enable digital transaction of toll. In February, the central government had made FASTag mandatory on all vehicles.Also read | EDMC to face strict action for Ghazipur landfill fire: RaiCommuters will have to keep in mind the varied speed limits, as decided by the local authorities.

In phase 2, work on 17 out of 18 underpasses was completed. NHAI officials said the remaining underpass near ABES College will be opened in another week.The NHAI has installed about 5000 streetlights on all four phases.During a visit by an HT team, some of the stretches from Bamheta to Crossings Republic had non-functional streetlights at night, while jaywalkers at two major points near Vijay Nagar posed an accident risk.“At Vijay Nagar we are installing 1.5-km long additional fencing (of five feet high) on either side to check jaywalkers. Some of the street lighting is still being tested and about 5-6 kms of our power cables were short-circuited after farmer protesters at UP Gate drew on it to run their gadgets. We have taken up the issue with the local administration,” Garg added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he held meeting with NHAI officials and will take up steps to ensure that the DME gets operational without any hindrance.“We will also ensure that there is no law-and-order situation at UP-Gate where farmers are protesting,” he added.The DME will provide 14 lanes connectivity under phase 1 and 2 while six-lane expressway will start from Dasna under phase 4. The 14 lanes will comprise of three expressway lanes each side while the four outer lanes each side will be highway lanes.“The work for a major rail over bridge will take some time and is likely to extend to December 2021. Otherwise, the other major works are complete, and commuters can move easily up to Meerut from April 1,” Garg added.The March 31 deadline was set after ‘Pragati’ meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/delhimeerut-expressway-to-open-fully-from-april-1-no-toll-for-a-week-101617128449402.html
31-03-2021||Pune||Residents divided over installing gym equipment and paver blocks on Mhatoba tekdi||The forest department is caught in the crossfire of residents who are divided over the idea of beautification and conservation of tekdis around the city. A fortnight ago, the forest department began their work on the Nakshatra garden project on the slopes of the Mhatoba tekdi, which is within their perimeters, however objections were raised after the forest department decided to lay paver blocks. Some residents are against the use of cement and concrete on the tekdi. “The Nakshratra garden was in the plan of beautification of the tekdis and in the creation of a green cover. We will be planting trees according to the moon signs, and after insistence of residents were also adding paving blocks as a boundary to every tree so that people can rest or exercise or do yoga under these trees. We are not using any cement but simply putting in interlocking paving blocks to hold the pattern together during monsoon,” said forest range officer, Deepak Pawar. Rohidas Sutar, Kothrud resident and businessman is one of the regulars to the tekdi, who was part of the team who visited the forest department to request for the gym equipment. “There are plenty of walkers and those who exercise wanted this equipment and we had visited and requested to the forest department to set it up in their area. They gave us permission orally to set up the equipment,” he said. “Following the orders from the forest department, we have not used any cement or concrete to fit these equipment instead have used rock crevices to hold them” he added. “We have been coming here for 22 years to the Mhatoba tekdi, as the temple is of our gram daivat. We come here to plant trees and nurture them and there are many who come for regular walks and exercises. Some of the regular visitors approached us stating that some gym equipment would be helpful,” said Sachin Mokate, a resident of Kothrud, and part of the Mhatobagad Sevak Sangh. On the other hand, some of the environment and tekdi lovers were aghast after seeing photos circulated on social media of these paving blocks and gym equipment jutting out on slopes. “They want the hills to be left alone. How does one make the forest department understand that ‘forest’ and ‘concrete’ are antonyms? Are the concrete pavers meant for sitting? It is quite unexpected and actually unbecoming of the forest department,” said Ashutosh Pradhan, member of the Save Vetal tekdi group. While Uma Dongre, a resident of Pashan and a regular tekdi visitor said, “These gyms can be set up in amenity spaces and footpaths. Let the forest land be dedicated for trees and wildlife with minimal human intervention. Sadly, the PMC is selling off amenity spaces. Not only that, but the roadside gyms are also rusted and broken, there is no maintenance. Instead of setting up new gyms they should maintain existing gyms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/divide-over-installing-gym-equipment-and-paver-blocks-on-mhatoba-tekdi-101617118609063.html
31-03-2021||Pune||Suez Canal cleared but Maharashtra grape growers still worried||Despite the stranded ship in the Suez Canal afloat again, the grape exporters in western Maharashtra are trying to assess its impact on export to the European grape market in the peak of the season. Every year, the two months between February 15 to April first week are considered as the peak export season to Europe and exporters mainly from Nashik area of North Maharashtra supply the grapes. Because of the blockage in the Suez Canal for almost a week, exporters fear supply of the grapes in European market may partially be hit adversely affecting rates in the countries looking for Maharashtra grapes. One reason, according to exporters is ships couldn’t reach last week will now arrive in various European countries when additional vessels carrying grapes planning to depart will also land there, resulting in oversupply compared to the steady demand. “Every week 800-900 containers are going from Nashik and Sangli to Europe but mainly from Nashik. The total economy of the grapes depend on this market rate. Because of the Suez situation approximately 800 containers haven’t been able to reach in a week. Another 800 containers will be shipped this week. Approximately 1,600 containers may reach the European market at the same time. We fear that the rates will come down from existing 10 euros per 5 kg box to 7-8 Euros. This is the last active week,” said Vilas Shinde, director Sahyadri Farms Nashik and grapes exporter. As the ship which was blocking the Suez was afloat again, exporters have taken a sigh of relief. However, there could still be a delay in reaching the shipments at the destination port, experts say that the situation could have been worse if there was a further delay. “The traffic movement has started in the Suez. A schedule is given to the buyers in the European market. If a vessel is delayed then the scheduled vessel and the next vessel reach at the same time, leading to a drop in rate as a result of excess supply,” Sachin Korde, manager (technical) Mahagrape, a co-operative partnership firm. Javindar Mhaske, a grape producer from Tasgaon in Sangli district claimed he had to divert produce to other markets due to the Suez blockage. “My family has been doing this business since 1972. Because of the Suez situation two vessels got cancelled. So, our produce was diverted to other areas such as Dubai and Bangladesh,” said Mhaske. Jagannath Khapre, president, All India Grape Export Association said that despite the ship has been moved, it will take few more days to clear the traffic in Suez Canal.“So, we have to take this delay into account. All the shipments could reach at the same time in the European market, and it could impact the rates. Mostly, the shipments are sent to Rotterdam port since it is the main distribution centre for Europe. Whenever the vessels will start moving from Suez it will take 10 more days to reach there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/suez-canal-cleared-but-maharashtra-grape-growers-still-worried-101617118489234.html
31-03-2021||Pune||36% of Pune district’s Covid tests conducted using RAT method||PUNE As per data compiled by the district collector’s office, of the 2.839 million Covid19 tests conducted in the district, 36% have been done through Rapid the Antigen Test (RAT) method, in spite of the state government’s recommendation to maintain a 75%-25% ratio between RT-PCR and RAT test. This recommendation came in December 2020.Despite having the highest per million testing numbers in the nation, the higher proportion of RAT tests in the district raises questions about the effectiveness of the ongoing tests. RAT tests are often known to report false negatives.The state had also recommended an increase in the proportion of RT-PCR tests. The RT-PCR testing proportion must be increased gradually from 65% as of December to 75% as of February 2021, the state had said. As per data compiled until March 29, of 28,114 samples that tested negative through RAT, 3,592 or 13% were followed up by RT-PCR tests as they were symptomatic samples.The district conducts 1,43,348 tests per million, which it claims is the highest in the country. Maharashtra tests 71,971 tests per million and India’s average is 88,936 tests per million. Of the 2.839 million tests, 1.449 million tests were done by PMC, 0.783 million tests were done by PCMC and 0.606 million tests were done by the Zilla Parishad. The district collector Rajesh Deshmukh in his presentation to the chief secretary stated that Pune needs to increase its RT-PCR testing capacity as NIV and other Central government labs have reduced their RTPCR tests for the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/36-of-pune-district-s-covid-tests-conducted-using-rat-method-101617115068926.html
31-03-2021||Pune||First-person account: In search of a hospital bed for an 81-year old Covid+ father||The real Covid-care challenge in the city has begun to emerge as finding a bed in a hospital for a critical patient. Sharing his story, Amit Phansalkar, an IT manager, said that he has struggled to find a bed for his critical father who tested positive for Covid on Monday evening. “My father had non-typical symptoms like he was losing his balance. He is 81-years-old and has had diabetes for the last two decades. His kidney function is not normal and he has heart trouble. He was taken to the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital on Monday afternoon. He tested positive on Monday evening at 6pm,” said Phansalkar. The family feared that there may be no bed available at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital. “So we started calling nearby hospitals to check for beds. All the hospitals were full. I even called up hospitals from Hinjewadi to see if there were beds available. Some hospitals were not reachable. And others who were reachable, did not have any beds,” noted Phansalkar. Finally at 9:30 pm, Phansalkar was able to get a bed at hospital. “Through our neighbour, we were able to get a bed. But, we saw many other patients who were told that beds were not available. My father is in the ICU now,” said Phansalkar. What PMC saysSpeaking about the bed availability, Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said that the PMC has issued orders to acquire beds from private hospitals. “We have issued an order to acquire 80 percent of beds from 23 private hospitals across Pune to address the growing need for beds for critical patients,” said Agarwal. As per the dashboard for bed availability, there are 3,775 beds available as of Tuesday evening. Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of the health department at PMC said that in the next two days, more beds will be acquired.“”From private hospitals, Sassoon General Hospital, COEP Jumbo hospital and others, we will acquire 1,500 beds for critical Covid patients,” said Dr Bharti.He also added that patients with mild symptoms will be asked to self-isolate at home so that critical patients can get medical care in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/firstperson-account-in-search-of-a-hospital-bed-for-an-81-year-old-covid-father-101617113208817.html
31-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to see Covid peak around April 6, curbs extended till April 10||ChandigarhAs Covid cases and deaths continue to escalate with the UK strain emerging as the most prevalent in the state, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ordered the extension of curbs till April 10, while directing the health department to increase the number of vaccination sites to target the priority categories on an urgent basis. Reviewing the Covid situation with chief secretary Vini Mahajan and other top officials, the chief minister said all restrictions that were in place till March 31 will now remain in force till April 10, after which they will be reviewed again. 44 women in Nabha jail test positive He ordered the launch of a vaccination drive in prisons in the wake of 44 women in Patiala’s Nabha Open Jail testing positive for coronavirus. Testing and vaccination will be organised in busy market areas, the chief minister said, asking deputy commissioners and civil surgeons to identify places where mobile Covid vaccination centres can be set up, such as police lines, colleges and universities, bigger industrial units, bus stands, and railway stations, Punjab Roadways bus depots and marketplaces. The latest data shows the UK strain of the virus to be the most prevalent in the state. While 326 of the 401 Covid positive samples sent initially to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for genome sequencing were found positive for the UK variant, subsequently of the 95 samples sent to Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) for genome sequencing, 85 were found to be positive for the same. The principal secretary, health, shared projections presented by Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, showing a steep rise in the number of cases and peak around April 6. The number would be decreasing by mid or late May, according to estimates, which suggest that Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Mohali, Hoshiarpur and Kapurthala are expected to contribute more cases and positivity is likely to be high in the younger population of 40 years or less. Over 90,000 challaned and tested for Covid State police chief Dinkar Gupta said since the last meeting when the decision to challan Covid protocol offenders along with RT-PCR testing was taken, 90,360 people had been challaned and tested for Covid. He requested for a special vaccination drive in the police lines. Health workers to undergo weekly test if not vaccinated All districts have been advised to motivate healthcare workers and frontline workers to get themselves vaccinated and those who do not get vaccinated, should be strictly directed to undergo Covid testing every week to ensure that they do not get infected and thereby spread infection to others, the chief secretary said after the virtual meeting. Dr KK Talwar, health adviser to the Punjab government, has suggested routine non-Covid treatment in some of the selected private hospitals be deferred by two to four weeks, and more ambulances be made available to district hospitals where there are no medical colleges. The chief minister was assured that the health department is ready to increase RT-PCR testing to 35,000 tests per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-see-covid-peak-around-april-6-curbs-extended-till-april-10-101617102649117.html
31-03-2021||World||Now the hard part: Biden tax hikes face hurdles in Congress||US President Joe Biden's plan to pay for his $2 trillion infrastructure plan with higher corporate taxes faces hurdles in Congress from Republicans who say it will kill jobs and some of his fellow Democrats who want a bigger write-off for state and local taxes.The plan, which Biden will unveil at an event in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday, would hike the US corporate tax rate to 28%, from its current 21%, to secure more revenue from corporations that have used offshore tax shelters and other measures to reduce their tax burdens."President Biden's reform will reverse this damage and fundamentally reform the way the tax code treats the largest corporations," the White House said earlier as it released details of the plan.The Biden tax provisions quickly came under fire from American business interests and Republicans on a key tax committee in the US House of Representatives."The proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure," the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that warned the tax hikes would "slow the economic recovery and make the US less competitive globally."Unveiled along with Biden's infrastructure plan, the tax provisions would roll back many of former President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy.Biden's overall infrastructure plan charts a dramatic shift in the direction of the US economy, with investments in traditional projects like roads and bridges along with climate change and human services like elder care.The president hopes to draw bipartisan support from Republicans in Congress but will need solid backing from Democrats in the Senate and the House, if Republicans uniformly reject the legislation as they did his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package.But some moderate Democrats hope to reverse Trump's cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, which is felt most acutely in Northeastern states with higher taxes."We say, no SALT, no deal," three House Democrats from New York and New Jersey said this week.Democrats control the House by a margin of 219 to 211, so they will need to stay united if no Republicans support the plan. The party has not yet decided how to shepherd the package through Congress, a House Democratic aide said.Republicans on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee decried the initiative in a pre-dawn statement as "a series of job-killing tax hikes" that would saddle American companies with a higher tax rate that their competitors in "Communist China."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-the-hard-part-biden-tax-hikes-face-hurdles-in-congress-101617211698291.html

The cleric was returning home from attending a graduation ceremony. Three people were also wounded in that attack, Aser said.Separately, a bombing in northern Balkh province killed two people on Wednesday, including a child, and wounded 16. Adil Shah Adil, spokesman for the provincial police chief, said the bomb was placed inside a cart and was remotely detonated.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Takhar and Balkh bombings.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in a statement condemned the attacks.“Targeting religious scholars and killing civilians, especially children, is a crime against humanity and Islamic values,” said a statement released by Ghani's office. It blamed the Taliban, claiming the attacks show the insurgents “do not believe in peace.”The Taliban did not comment on the two bombings.Also Wednesday, the Taliban ambushed a military convoy on a main highway linking Logar and Paktia provinces, killing an army officer. The Taliban promptly claimed responsibility for that attack.Col. Faridoon Fayaz, unit commander of southeastern provinces, was on his way to his office when he was fatally shot in the ambush, said an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. The official said one of the colonel's bodyguards was wounded in the attack.Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks, but many go unclaimed, with the government putting the blame on the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/series-of-attacks-in-afghanistan-kill-4-including-religious-scholar-101617210945411.html

31-03-2021||World||Covid-19 was third-leading cause of US deaths in 2020, says CDC||Covid-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. last year, contributing to a 15.9% increase in the death rate from a year earlier, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an official report citing full-year data.The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was the underlying or contributing cause of 377,883 deaths in the US last year, according to the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System, which collects and reports provisional annual mortality data. Only heart disease and cancer were more deadly.American Indians, Hispanics and Blacks had the highest rates of death from Covid-19 by ethnicity, the study found. The death rate among White Americans was less than half that among Blacks and Hispanics, and the vast majority of the deaths from Covid-19 were in people aged 65 years and older, who accounted for almost 81% of deaths from the disease.In a second study, the CDC rejected the notion that many deaths from Covid-19 might have been over-counted or exaggerated. The health agency reviewed death certificates of people whose deaths had been primarily attributed to the infectious disease, but also listed another condition.In 97% of certificates that attributed the death to Covid-19 along with another condition, the latter diagnosis tended to be what’s called a “chain-of-event condition” such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, or a “contributing condition” such as hypertension or diabetes. That means those other conditions were either brought about by Covid-19 or made the disease all the more deadly, the CDC said.Only 2.5% of death certificates listed conditions that haven’t been associated with Covid-19, the study found. The CDC said the analysis supports “the accuracy of Covid-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates.”Still, the CDC suggested that the underlying cause of some deaths may not have been properly classified as Covid-19, given the limited availability of testing for the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-was-third-leading-cause-of-us-deaths-in-2020-says-cdc-101617203907237.html
31-03-2021||World||Russia wants to keep a stricter eye on its anti-Putin youth||The Kremlin is seeking to counter what it sees as foreign influence on Russia’s increasingly rebellious youth with a new law aimed at tightening state control over out-of-school activities.The upper house of parliament approved legal amendments that will compel providers of “educational activities” outside of traditional academic programs to coordinate with the government, the state-run Tass news service reported Wednesday.The vaguely-defined changes were introduced after last year’s constitutional amendments that allow Vladimir Putin to remain president until 2036 also added a reference to patriotic education. They will become law once Putin signs the bill.The push to regulate extracurricular activities comes as Russian authorities are already seeking to control access to online information following a surge in protests involving the young over the jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Regulators fined internet companies for not removing posts urging teenagers to join nationwide protests earlier this year, and in March slowed access to Twitter Inc. and threatened to block it entirely in a dispute over content.“Educational activity does not need external control and it is harmed by it,” said Sergei Popov, an astrophysicist member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He started a petition protesting the changes that has garnered 245,000 signatures. While the amendments don’t specify which activities will be regulated, “I think this law will be selectively applied,” he said.Rare ResistanceThe changes provoked a rare display of resistance in the lower house of parliament, where all three nominally opposition parties voted against the measure that was passed by the ruling United Russia party. Educators and cultural workers in Russia also condemned the legislation.“The Accounts Chamber opposed the law, three reference groups opposed it, and the Academy of Sciences asked the president not to sign,” said Communist deputy Oleg Smolin, who chairs the State Duma’s education committee. “The leaders of non-profit organizations see an attempt to limit their capabilities, and museums and libraries are also alarmed.”The non-partisan upper house of parliament voted 145 to one in favor of the amendments, with one abstention, Tass reported.Supporters of the new law say it is necessary to protect students from foreign meddling aimed at historical revisionism. Putin has repeatedly stoked patriotism in confrontations with the West to retain public support as Russians’ living standards stagnated under the impact of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic.“The lack of appropriate legal regulation creates the preconditions for uncontrolled use of a wide range of propaganda activities by anti-Russian forces in schools and among students under the guise of educational activities,” according to the amendment’s explanatory notes.Protests CallAs the Kremlin prepares for parliamentary elections in September, Putin’s popularity is flagging among a generation that has only known his rule over the past 21 years. Only 31% of Russians ages 18 to 24 want to see Putin remain president after his current term ends in 2024, compared to 57% who don’t, according to a March poll by the independent Levada Center.Navalny’s aides are preparing for a wave of protests in support of the opposition leader. A petition has gathered nearly 361,000 signatures from people pledging to join demonstrations, which organizers say will start once the total passes 500,000.The law’s broad phrasing has sparked fears it could be used to disrupt everything from language classes, exchange programs and summer camps to museum exhibitions and undesirable Wikipedia entries.Russia’s burgeoning ed-tech industry could also be hurt by the measures after experiencing rapid growth during the pandemic.“You have hundreds of thousands of tutorials, articles, videos that will be downloaded so officials can look at them and issue a permit,” said Alex Laryanovsky, a managing partner at online language school Skyeng. “In the worst case it will cause paralysis, and in the best case it will be a non-working law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-wants-to-keep-a-stricter-eye-on-its-anti-putin-youth-101617202899768.html

More than 200 other vessels from the Chinese flotilla have apparently dispersed to five other areas in the Spratly group of islands, including three Chinese-occupied artificial islands, they said.At least four Chinese navy ships were at Chinese-occupied Mischief Reef, the Philippine officials said. China took control of the reef in 1995, drawing strong protests from the Philippines and other claimant states.About 45 Chinese vessels were in the vicinity of the Philippine-occupied island of Thitu, which Manila calls Pagasa, the officials said.“The Philippines calls on China to immediately withdraw these vessels flying its flag,” the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea said in a statement. “Neither the Philippines nor the international community will ever accept China’s assertion of its so-called `indisputable integrated sovereignty’ over almost all of the South China Sea.”A patrol aircraft deployed by the Philippine military received a radio warning to stay away from one of the Chinese-occupied reefs but the pilot radioed back that the patrol would continue as planned, military officials said.The interagency body led by President Rodrigo Duterte’s national security adviser released surveillance photos of the Chinese flotilla in the disputed areas, which the Philippine government says are within its internationally recognized exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, where it has exclusive rights to fish and harness potential undersea gas and oil deposits and other resources.“Their swarming ... poses a threat to the peaceful exercise of sovereign rights of the Philippines in its EEZ,” the task force said.The Philippines regards the Spratlys, where it occupies nine islands and islets, as part of its western province of Palawan. But the resource-rich chain of islands, islets and atolls is also claimed by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. China has turned seven disputed reefs into missile-protected island bases, ratcheting up tensions in recent years.The United States has expressed support to the Philippines, its long-time treaty ally, and accused China of using “maritime militia to intimidate, provoke and threaten other nations, which undermines peace and security in the region.” Beijing denied the vessels were part of a maritime militia.Duterte has nurtured friendly ties with Beijing since taking office in 2016 and has been criticized for not immediately demanding Chinese compliance with an international arbitration ruling that invalidated Beijing’s historic claims to virtually the entire South China Sea. China has refused to recognize the 2016 ruling, which it called “a sham,” and continues to defy it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-demands-china-remove-vessels-at-6-islands-reefs-in-south-china-sea-101617200764466.html
31-03-2021||World||Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi in good health, lawyer says||Myanmar's ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi appears in good health despite two months of detention, her legal team said Wednesday, as diplomatic pressure on the military junta ramped up.Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups.The US State Department ordered the departure of non-essential diplomatic staff and their families from Myanmar, and Japan -- a top donor to the country -- halted new aid payments.The 75-year-old Suu Kyi has not been seen in public since she was deposed by the military and detained in the early hours of February 1.But a member of her legal team, Min Min Soe, was summoned to a police station in the capital Naypyidaw for a video meeting with her on Wednesday.Suu Kyi is facing a raft of criminal charges and conviction could see her barred from political office for life."The physical situation of DASSK (Suu Kyi) seemed good according to her appearance on video screen," her legal team said in a statement.Suu Kyi noted that during the meeting, police officers remained at the lawyer's side, and guards monitored her at her end, the statement said, adding that the Nobel laureate had asked whether this was legal.She faces a court hearing on Thursday, though another of her lawyers, Khin Maung Zaw, said it was likely to be fairly brief and deal with administrative matters.The junta is also probing Suu Kyi over allegations she took payments of gold and $600,000 in cash, but Khin Maung Zaw said these were not likely to become formal charges at this stage.Meanwhile, a group of ousted MPs from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), who have been working underground against the junta, said Wednesday they would form "a new civilian government" in the first week of April, without giving further details.The Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), the Burmese word for "parliament", also warned in a statement that "serious action" would be taken against those who are not part of the protest movement.Spiralling bloodshedThe US said it had decided to pull its staff out of the country to protect their safety and security.World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta figures with sanctions.Japan has halted new aid to the country, according to the country's foreign minister, but stopped short of imposing sanctions."What stance is Japan taking in terms of economic assistance? There is no new aid. We are taking this clear position," Toshimitsu Motegi told parliament on Tuesday.But so far the pressure has not swayed the generals.The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions.Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army -- on Tuesday threatened to join the protesters' fight unless the military reined in its violence.Brigadier General Tar Bhone Kyaw from the TNLA told AFP on Wednesday that they were mulling whether to end their ceasefire with the military, which he accused of "war crimes".While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible.The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes.Wounded cross borderAround 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes.Thai authorities say around 2,400 have returned "voluntarily" to Myanmar, and another 200 have also agreed to go back.Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik.The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-in-good-health-lawyer-says-101617200133543.html
31-03-2021||World||Wisconsin Supreme Court strikes down mask mandate issued by Governor Tony Evers||The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down Gov. Tony Evers' statewide mask mandate, ruling that the Democrat exceeded his authority by issuing the order.The 4-3 ruling from the conservative-controlled court is the latest legal blow to attempts by Evers to control the coronavirus. It comes after Republicans in the Legislature voted to repeal the mask mandate in February, only to see Evers quickly re-issue it.The court last May struck down Evers’ “safer at home” order, saying that his health secretary did not have the authority for such an order. Evers’ attempts to limit capacity in bars, restaurants and other indoor places were also blocked by a state appeals court in October.In the latest case, the court ruled that any public health emergency issued by Evers is valid for just 60 days and can’t be extended without legislative approval.“The question in this case is not whether the governor acted wisely; it is whether he acted lawfully. We conclude he did not,” Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority.Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment.Evers had argued that he can issue multiple health emergencies because of the changing nature of the ongoing pandemic. The mask order first took effect in August and Evers extended it four times since then, most recently on Feb. 4 immediately after the Legislature repealed it.Nearly 60 organizations opposed repeal of the mask mandate, including groups representing hospitals, doctors, nurses, EMTs, school administrators, businesses, children, unions, Milwaukee schools, American Indian tribes, pharmacists, firefighters, local health departments, senior citizens, churches and dentists.With no state order in place, it will be up to local governmental units to enact their own mask policies. Many communities had moved to enact local ordinances as the Legislature looked to repeal the mandate. Mask orders are in place in cities including Milwaukee as well as Dane County, home to Madison.When the court struck down Evers’ “safer at home” order in May it was controlled 5-2 by conservatives. In that ruling, conservative justice Brian Hagedorn sided with liberals in the minority in arguing the order should not be struck down.But during oral arguments in the mask case on Nov. 16, Hagedorn questioned Evers’ authority to renew health emergencies beyond the 60-day limit. He said it was an “extraordinary grant of short-term power to the governor” and that “it seems like the Legislature wanted to allow for only a very short period of time.”“Nobody’s questioning the governor’s sincerity in trying to do what he thinks is right here,” Hagedorn said then. “But he can only do what the power he’s been given to do.”The case challenging the mask mandate was brought by Jere Fabick, a major Republican donor in Wisconsin who has given more than $350,000 to Republican or conservative candidates in Wisconsin between 1994 and the middle of 2020, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.In 2016, Fabick gave $20,000 to conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley. Fabick is a board member and policy advisor for The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank, and also the president of a multi-state Caterpillar equipment and engine dealer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-down-mask-mandate-issued-by-governor-tony-evers-101617200369738.html
31-03-2021||World||Trump's close ally Matt Gaetz probed over sexual relationship with 17-year-old girl||Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, a prominent conservative in Congress and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, said Tuesday he is being investigated by the Justice Department over a former relationship but denied any criminal wrongdoing.Gaetz, who represents parts of western Florida, is accused of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paying her to travel with him, and he is under investigation to determine if he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a person familiar with the case told The Associated Press.The probe has been underway for nearly a year and Gaetz has been aware for months that he was under investigation, the person said. The Justice Department has also been looking into whether Gaetz, 38, may have also been involved in relationships with other underage girls, the person said.The person could not publicly discuss the details of an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Gaetz told Axios that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject of an investigation “regarding sexual conduct with women” but that he was not a target of the probe. He denied that he ever had a relationship with any underage girls and said the allegations against him were “as searing as they are false.”A subject is conventionally thought of as someone whose actions fall within the scope of a criminal investigation, whereas a target is someone whom prosecutors have gathered evidence linking to a crime. But during the course of an investigation, a subject can become a target.Gaetz's comments came shortly after The New York Times first reported the investigation. It is a federal crime to transport a minor over state lines for sex.Gaetz said that the allegations were part of an extortion plot by a former Justice Department official.“Over the past several weeks my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name,” Gaetz said in a statement.Gaetz said his family has been cooperating with the FBI and said his father was wearing a recording device, at the FBI’s direction, “to catch these criminals.” He demanded the Justice Department release the recordings.“No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation,” he said.The Times cited three people familiar with the matter, saying the scrutiny was part of a broader Justice Department probe into one of his political allies and fellow Florida politician, Joel Greenberg, who was indicted last summer on sex trafficking and other charges that he stalked a political opponent. A judge ordered the former tax collector back to jail earlier this month for violating the conditions of his release.“I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know, when I was a single guy,” Gaetz told Axios.“I have definitely, in my single days, provided for women I’ve dated,” Gaetz said. “You know, I’ve paid for flights, for hotel rooms. I’ve been, you know, generous as a partner. I think someone is trying to make that look criminal when it is not.”Gaetz has not been charged with a crime. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-close-ally-matt-gaetz-probed-over-sexual-relationship-with-underage-girl-101617199622224.html
31-03-2021||World||Warm weather in northwest Europe raises fresh Covid-19 worries||Much of northwest Europe is basking in unusually warm weather on Wednesday, prompting many people to throw caution to the wind despite a worrying uptick in coronavirus cases in parts of the continent.Temperatures in Belgium, which is facing a resurgence of the virus, have never been so high so early in the year, while those in England, where restrictions are being loosened following a dramatic fall in new cases, could on Wednesday nudge the all-time March high.In Belgium, the mercury has hit 24.5 degrees Celsius (76 Fahrenheit), prompting thousands of people to head to beaches and parks. The fine weather is expected to continue until Friday and the start of the Easter weekend.Good news for the 11.5 million Belgians craving sun after a gloomy winter, but a real worry for the government struggling to deal with a third wave of infections.Though it's proven that the virus is far less easy to catch outdoors, there are worries that traveling could lead rise to more infections.In response to the number of passengers on its trains, Belgium's national rail company, SNCB, has been forced to activate a “stop-and-go” system to prevent travelers in several train stations from boarding packed-out trains.Currently, residents in Belgium are banned from traveling abroad but can move freely across the country. A night-time curfew is in place.Many did not resist the appeal of a grand day out to North Sea beaches, especially after the government decided last week to shut down schools for an extra week before the Easter school break in a bid to slow infections.That move could ultimately backfire.“It's too crowded. And you don’t have to be a great scientist to predict that," Western Flanders Governor Carl Decaluwe told Het Niewsblad newspaper.Both Decaluwe and the SNCB are now advising against trips to the coast, but the situation in big cities is also a source of worry.In Brussels, for instance, crowds gathered in one of the city’s largest parks to enjoy al fresco drinks and outdoor games. Despite restrictions limiting outside gatherings to four people, bigger groups were spotted sitting on the grass. And although mandatory mask-wearing outdoors is in force, many did not bother with the rule.Brussels prosecutor's office issued a warning Wednesday following the announcement on social networks of two illegal festivals scheduled to take place on April 1 and 2 in two of the city's parks. The office said police will be deployed and that anyone breaching restrictions could be prosecuted.One of the parties is promoted by a collective called the Abyss. The group said it does not question the government's strategy but fights for citizens' rights to gather outdoors.“Some people say we have fallen into a health dictatorship," the group said. “We want to prove that it is still possible to live and therefore to celebrate even in the midst of a pandemic, as our grandparents did during the war."Belgium has reported over 876,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and almost 23,000 virus-related deaths. Hospitalizations due to Covi-19 have risen consistently in recent weeks, and the country's health authorities have warned that intensive care unit occupancy could reach a critical level by April 10 if the pace of infections does not slow down.Parks in the neighboring Netherlands also are getting crowded in the warm spring weather. In the city of Utrecht, authorities have begun painting circles on the grass in parks in an attempt to get visitors to maintain social distancing when they sit or lie in the sun.In Amsterdam, the municipality closed the city’s central Vondelpark, saying it was too busy and only letting people out.Coronavirus infections have been rising for weeks in the Netherlands, despite a months-long tough lockdown.Many parts of the UK are enjoying the turn of the weather, but the coronavirus backdrop in the country is very different to elsewhere in Europe. The rise in temperatures toward the all-time March high of 25.6 Celsius (78 Fahrenheit) recorded in 1968 has come at a time when restrictions on socializing have been eased following a near three-month lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines.Restrictions on gatherings were eased on Monday, and groups of up to six, or two households of any size, can meet in parks and gardens once more, while outdoor sports facilities can reopen. Face masks are not required in most outdoor settings in England.With the fine weather set to be short-lived, there is clear evidence that some people are stretching the rules to the limit.Adam Jones said he saw a “couple of thousand” people in Cannon Hill Park, to the south of the central England city of Birmingham, while out walking with his girlfriend on Tuesday evening.“We did one lap of the park and by the time we were leaving it looked like a festival,” the 27-year-old said.Local police said no fines were issued but that there would be extra officers in the area on Wednesday to ensure that the rules are being abided by.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to act responsibly.“We have come so far, don’t blow it now,” he said on Twitter.The easing was sanctioned after a dramatic fall in new coronavirus cases over the past few weeks that has seen the UK go from being the European country with the worst outbreak at the start of the year to one with one of the lowest rates of infection in the whole continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warm-weather-in-northwest-europe-raises-fresh-covid-19-worries-101617198719364.html

31-03-2021||World||2 years after commercial ties snapped, Pakistan clears import of sugar, cotton from India||The Pakistan government paved the way for resumption of limited trade relations with India by allowing imports of sugar and cotton from the neighbouring country on Wednesday, almost two years after commercial ties were snapped by bilateral tensions. The green signal for the imports from the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of Pakistan’s Cabinet reflected a recent thaw in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad after the armies of the two sides recommitted themselves to a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir last month. Pakistan’s finance minister Hammad Azhar, who was appointed to the position by Prime Minister Imran Khan only on Tuesday, told a news conference in Islamabad that the move will allow the country to cope with the rising price of sugar and a shortage of cotton. The Cabinet committee approved imports of up to 500,000 tonnes of sugar by the private sector and allowed imports of cotton up to the end of June to meet the needs of small and medium enterprises. “Following an increase in the price of sugar, we allowed imports from across the world but the prices around the world are also high, which means imports aren’t possible. In our neighbouring country India, the price of sugar is lower than the price in Pakistan,” Azhar said, speaking in Urdu. “So we have decided to allow trading in sugar with India, [with imports of] up to 500,000 tonnes by the private sector,” he added. The difference in the price of sugar in the two countries is estimated to be 15% to 20% and the imports will help cover a minor shortfall and reduce prices. “The benefits will go to the poor of Pakistan,” Azhar said. Noting that there is great demand for cotton in Pakistan as textile exports had increased and last year’s crop wasn’t good, Azhar said: “We had allowed cotton imports from around the world but not from India, and this makes a difference to SMEs or the smaller industries. The bigger firms can import cotton from Egypt or other countries and even at expensive prices, but this is needed by SMEs. “Today, on a proposal from the commerce ministry, the ECC decided that we will open imports [of cotton] from India till the end of June.” Azhar sidestepped a question from a reporter on the resumption of trade ties with India without addressing the Kashmir issue by saying: “If the burden on the ordinary man is reduced by trading with some country, there is no loss in it.” On the Indian side, Pakistan’s decision will benefit growers and merchants in Punjab, which has for long had trade relations with the neighbouring country and was a key source of vegetables, fruits and other agricultural products. Trade has invariably been hit whenever tensions spiked between India and Pakistan, and this was also the case when the 2019 Pulwama suicide attack triggered a military standoff. Pakistan’s National Security Committee had unilaterally suspended trade relations with India in August 2019 after New Delhi scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The move by the Indian and Pakistani armies to strictly adhere to the ceasefire on the LoC from February 25 was the outcome of behind-the-scenes contacts between the two sides and led to a thaw in relations. In recent weeks, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa has spoken of the need to “bury the past and move forward”, while Prime Minister Khan has said India will have to take the first step for improving ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for an atmosphere of trust and devoid of terrorism for better relations between the two sides in a message sent to his Pakistani counterpart on Pakistan Day on March 23, Khan responded by saying that his country desires peaceful and cooperative ties. “Creation of an enabling environment is imperative for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue,” Khan said in his response sent to Modi on Monday. Though external affairs minister S Jaishankar didn’t meet his Pakistani counterpart on the margins of the Heart of Asia ministerial conference in Tajikistan on Tuesday, both sides have dialled down the rhetoric amid indications that more steps are likely to be taken to normalise relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-years-after-commercial-ties-snapped-pakistan-clears-import-of-sugar-cotton-from-india-101617198893066.html

Around 150,000 people had received BioNTech shots in Hong Kong before the vaccinations were suspended.The Hong Kong chief executive’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SCMP story outside of business hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-like-to-resume-biontech-covid-vaccine-shots-next-week-report-101617196663326.html
31-03-2021||World||2 Capitol police officers sue Trump over January 6 riots||Two US Capitol Police officers have filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, saying he incited the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection and was responsible for physical and emotional injuries they suffered as a result.James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, an 11-year veteran, filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in US District Court for the District of Columbia seeking damages of at least $75,000 each."This is a complaint for damages by US Capitol Police officers for physical and emotional injuries caused by the defendant Donald Trump’s wrongful conduct inciting a riot on January 6, 2021, by his followers trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election," the lawsuit said.Trump has denied responsibility for the rioting, which left five people dead, including a police officer. His office did not immediately return a call for comment on the lawsuit.The lawsuit cites the former Republican president's conduct before and beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, which Democrat Joe Biden won, including comments in speeches, on Twitter and during presidential debates.It said Trump stoked violence throughout the 2020 presidential campaign and escalated his false assertion that the election was rigged after the election was called for Biden."During his 2016 campaign, and throughout his presidency, Trump had threatened violence towards his opponents, encouraged his followers to commit acts of violence, and condoned acts of violence by his followers, including white supremacists and far rightwing hate groups," it said.The lawsuit also cited Trump's encouragement to supporters to come to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and "Stop The Steal" in the months after the election, including a tweet on Dec. 19: "Big protest on D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild.""Trump’s December 19th tweet about the January 6th rally was taken by many of his supporters as a literal call to arms," the lawsuit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-capitol-police-officers-sue-trump-over-january-6-riots-101617196246768.html
31-03-2021||World||‘I won't say...’: Archbishop of Canterbury on Meghan’s claim of ‘secret’ wedding with Prince Harry||The Archbishop of Canterbury has dismissed the claims made by the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, that she got married three days before her grand royal wedding, according to an Italian newspaper la Repubblica. During a tell-all interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, made explosive revelations, including the claim that the couple had a secret marriage ceremony in their “backyard”, officiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby."You know, three days before our wedding, we got married," said Meghan. "No one knows that. The vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury," she added.Harry and Meghan publicly shared their vows during the grand marriage ceremony in Windsor on Saturday, May 19, 2018, before becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Welby, who led the couple in their public vows, told la Repubblica that the “legal wedding” took place on Saturday, backing the officially documented wedding.“I signed the wedding certificate, which is a legal document, and I would have committed a serious criminal offence if I had signed it knowing it was false," the archbishop was quoted by the newspaper as saying.However, Welby admitted that he had a number of “informal” meetings with the couple ahead of the wedding, adding that he won’t say “what happened at any other meetings”. Both Harry and Meghan had said it was “just the three of us” when they shared the personal vows."So, you can make what you like of that. But the legal wedding was on the Saturday, but I won't say what happened at any earlier meetings," the archbishop added.The most damaging allegation by the couple involved an unnamed member of the royal family who raised concerns about the potential skin colour of their son before he was born. Meghan told Oprah that the British royal family refused to make her son Archie a prince partly due to conversations about how dark his skin might be. Harry later clarified that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were never part of those conversations.“Neither his grandmother nor grandfather were part of those conversations. He did not tell me who were part of those conversations, as you can see I tried get that answer," Oprah said on a follow-up with CBS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-won-t-say-archbishop-on-meghan-s-claim-of-secret-wedding-with-harry-101617194549199.html
31-03-2021||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro fires armed forces chiefs after sacking defense minister||Commanders of Brazil’s army, navy and air force were fired on Tuesday after President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed his defense chief as part of a broader cabinet restructuring.The shake-up, precipitated by congressional allies who have been unhappy with the president’s pandemic response, displeased the heads of the military who received no advance warning about the replacement of Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva, according to two people close to the armed forces who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.The dismissal of the three commanders -- General Edson Pujol, Admiral Ilques Barbosa and Brigadier Antonio Carlos Moretti Bermudez -- happened during meetings with Azevedo e Silva and Walter Braga Netto, who will take over as defense minister in the coming days, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.The change was announced by the ministry in a statement, and replacements haven’t been named yet. The three had been in their posts since January 2019.“What happened was a rupture in the relationship between Bolsonaro and the institutional armed forces,” said Octavio Amorim Neto, a political scientist specializing in civil-military relations who teaches at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, one of Brazil’s top universities, in Rio de Janeiro. “This means one of the key pillars of his government is distancing itself from Bolsonaro.”Read More: Bolsonaro Ousts Top Ministers as Pandemic Spirals Out of ControlBolsonaro, a former army captain who’s not affiliated with any political party, has been under pressure to make room for allies from the centrist establishment he once disdained but now relies on to pass legislation and protect him from impeachment attempts.As his handling of the pandemic comes under fire, he has also sought more explicit backing from the armed forces. Earlier this month, fighting governors who had imposed restrictions to commerce and the movement of people, he said “my army won’t go to the streets to ensure obedience to governors’ decrees.”No CoupThe president also made comments on the possibility of declaring a state of siege, which would give him power over governors, but that would require backing from congress. That statement prompted a call from the Supreme Court justice seeking explanations, local media reported.Yet Azevedo e Silva often dismissed Bolsonaro’s moves, more than once publishing statements where he reaffirmed the role of the armed forces as a state institution rather than a government body. He had been at the helm of the defense ministry since the president took office in January, 2019.Read More: Bolsonaro’s Erratic Behavior is Making His Military Backers Nervous“During this period, I preserved the armed forces as a state institution,” Azevedo e Silva wrote in a terse statement following his dismissal on Monday.Bolsonaro on Tuesday night said he plays by the constitution. “I can’t decree a state of siege, that’s up to congress,” he told supporters in front of the residential palace.While the recent developments made clear there is a widening gap between Bolsonaro and the armed forces as the pandemic worsens -- on Tuesday, the country reported a record 3,780 deaths from the respiratory disease -- Brazil is not at risk of a coup, according to Amorim Neto.“Even though he has been working closely with Bolsonaro, general Braga Netto is attached to the rule of law and the Constitution. He’s a conservative but not a die-hard Bolsonarista,” he says. “One thing is a certain degree of tolerance with the political excesses of Bolsonaro. To endorse his adventurous ideas is something else entirely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-fires-armed-forces-chiefs-after-sacking-defense-minister-101617193139419.html
31-03-2021||World||BBC scribe flees China after threats over Xinjiang, Covid-19 reporting||A senior China correspondent for the BBC has moved to Taiwan following legal threats, pressure, and intimidation over reports on alleged Xinjiang rights abuses and the coronavirus pandemic.John Sudworth told BBC Radio 4 that he had relocated to Taiwan after nine years in Beijing as it was “too risky to carry on”. “We left in a hurry, followed by plainclothes police all the way to the airport through the check-in. The true grim reality for reporters here is being made clear all the way to the very end.”Sudworth’s wife, Yvonne Murray, the China correspondent of RTE, the Irish broadcaster, left with him, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) said.Sudworth’s relocation comes amid criticism of the BBC for its reporting on alleged forced labour practices targeting Uighur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang’s cotton industry in particular.The reportage was strongly criticised by the Chinese foreign ministry as well as state media outlets.The BBC confirmed Sudworth’s relocation after the tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday, he was “hiding” in Taiwan.Quoting unnamed sources, the tabloid accused Sudworth of “hiding in Taiwan” after he “…became infamous in China for his many biased stories” on Xinjiang and also the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.When asked about the development, the Chinese foreign ministry denied any hand in it. “We never threatened him,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. “We don’t know why he left because he didn’t say goodbye.”On the threat of legal notices on the reports, Hua said, “I think those people are trying to protect their own rights and interests through legal means, but such acts have nothing to do with the Chinese government.”In its statement, the BBC said, “John’s reporting has exposed truths the Chinese authorities did not want the world to know.”The FCCC said Sudworth “forms one of an ever-larger number of journalists driven out of China by unacceptable harassment”.In a statement shared on social media, the FCCC added that he had been kept on “a series of short visas, variously lasting one, three and six months”, putting pressure on his ability to raise his young family.“Sudworth left after months of personal attacks and disinformation targeting him and his BBC colleagues, disseminated by both the Chinese state media and Chinese government officials.”The club noted that attacks on Sudworth and the BBC escalated after the British broadcasting regulator revoked the licence of Chinese state TV channel CGTN in February. “We urge China to live up to its stated commitment to facilitate unhindered reporting in China. In particular, the FCCC calls for an end to dangerous, personal attacks on individual reporters and foreign media outlets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bbc-scribe-flees-china-after-threats-over-xinjiang-covid-19-reporting-101617193852686.html
31-03-2021||World||UK's Queen Elizabeth carries out first face-to-face engagement this year||Britain's Queen Elizabeth carried out her first face-to-face engagement this year on Wednesday, two days after the country's strict COVID-19 lockdown was eased.The 94-year-old monarch, who has continued to carry out her official duties by videolink since a lockdown was imposed at the start of the year, visited the Air Forces memorial in Runnymede to mark the centenary of the Royal Australian Air Force.Runnymede is close to Windsor Castle, west of London, where the queen has been staying with her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip, who recently spent four weeks in hospital for treatment for an infection and to have a heart procedure."It's been a long time since I've been here," said Elizabeth, who is also Queen of Australia, as she arrived.The last engagement she performed in public came in December at Windsor when she thanked local volunteers and key workers, and has rarely left the castle since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year.Earlier this month, the royal family was plunged into its biggest crisis in decades by the interview Prince Harry and his wife Meghan gave to Oprah Winfrey in which her grandson criticised his relatives for failing to stand up to what he regarded as abusive press treatment of his wife.Meghan said a member of the royal family had made a racist comment by asking how dark their son Archie's skin might be before he was born.In a statement, the queen said the royals were saddened by the "challenging experiences" of Harry and Meghan, and promised their concerns would be seriously addressed in private by the family, although adding "some recollections may vary".While the fallout from the interview continues to rumble on in the background and in the media, other members of the royal family have continued their official duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-queen-elizabeth-carries-out-first-face-to-face-engagement-this-year-101617193063532.html
31-03-2021||World||Biden to unveil $2.25 trillion spending, corporate tax hikes||President Joe Biden will unveil a $2.25 trillion U.S. infrastructure plan Wednesday -- paid for by steep tax hikes on businesses-- that his administration said will prove the most sweeping since investments in the 1960s space program.The four-part, eight-year plan dedicates $620 billion for transportation, including a doubling in federal funding for public transit. It would provide $650 billion for initiatives tied to improving quality of life at home, like clean water and high-speed broadband. There’s $580 billion for strengthening American manufacturing -- some $180 billion of which goes to what’s billed as the biggest non-defense research and development program on record -- and $400 billion to address improved care for the elderly and people with disabilities.Biden’s plan would increase the corporate income tax to 28% from 21%, and set a 21% minimum tax on global corporate earnings. The White House said tax increases will be “fully paying for the investments in this plan over the next 15 years.”But the plan faces a rough road in Congress. Garnering Republican support in either the House or Senate, both of which Democrats control by narrow margins, will be difficult, if not impossible. Corralling moderate and progressive Democrats will also be a challenge.“Like great projects of the past, the president’s plan will unify and mobilize the country to meet the great challenges of our time: the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China,” the White House said in a statement before Biden’s afternoon speech in Pittsburgh.What Biden lays out Wednesday is just the first part of his long-term economic program, with a second round of initiatives to be announced in mid-April. Those will focus on “helping families with the challenges like health care costs, child care, and education.”The program will prove far more complex to enact than the $1.9 trillion pandemic-relief bill signed earlier in March. Republicans are staunchly opposed to tax increases, and the breadth of measures will invite partisan and even internal Democratic battles. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has warned that efforts to improve infrastructure shouldn’t turn into “a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.”As seen with the Covid-19 bill, Biden’s initial plans are coming in much bigger than what economists had anticipated. The shift to a major expansion in fiscal policy has already driven up forecasts for growth this year, and sent Treasury yields climbing. While stocks have reacted with some volatility in recent weeks, the S&P 500 index hit a record high on Friday.Biden’s plan will create millions and millions of jobs, an administration official told reporters, while declining to provide a specific figure.Pittsburgh ModelBiden will present his “American Jobs Plan” Wednesday in Pittsburgh, a city the White House views as a prime example of an old manufacturing hub revitalized by new industries from health care to technology.The administration wants the same type of reorientation that Pittsburgh saw to provide fresh opportunities to working-class cities and towns across the country. The plan envisions an expensive political gambit carried out over the next decade to try to create well-paying jobs by both updating the country’s infrastructure and preparing for the coming weather patterns wrought by climate change.A major undercurrent through the infrastructure plan is addressing inequality and expanding help for segments of society that the administration judges have been left out in the past. For example, in addition to fixing the “ten most economically significant bridges in the country in need of reconstruction,” there’s $20 billion for a new program that will “reconnect” neighborhoods that were cut off by past investments, such as the I-81 highway in Syracuse, New York. And all lead pipes will be replaced, to address water-quality issues.Another key theme is bolstering U.S. competitiveness against China. There’s $50 billion earmarked for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and $40 billion more in upgrading research capacity in laboratories across the nation.Climate change is also a major target. The transportation funding proposed specifically directs $174 billion to electric vehicles, including sale rebates and tax incentives for consumers to buy American-made cars.While infrastructure has traditionally been a bipartisan endeavor, Republicans have warned they’re not in favor of the major tilt toward renewable energy in the administration’s approach. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell also said his party wouldn’t vote for tax increases.Outreach to GOPAdministration officials said Biden is open to input from members of Congress of both parties on what provisions should be in a final package and how to pay for them. The White House expects to have robust outreach to GOP lawmakers and is committed to a serious discussion with them, a White House official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s plans. That effort began with inviting Republicans from relevant committees to a Tuesday briefing with Brian Deese, the National Economic Council director.But Biden’s plans don’t necessarily need Republican support to become law. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could choose to fit many of the president’s proposals into one or more budget reconciliation bills, which require only a simple majority vote in the Senate. The challenge is, as Pelosi has already indicated, that not all elements could fit into such a bill, which sets certain requirements for inclusion.The infrastructure package doesn’t include any of the proposed tax increases on individuals that Biden talked about on the campaign -- like raising the top tax rate for individuals and increasing the levy on capital gains. That was purposeful, an administration official said, because White House aides believe corporate-tax reform should pay for infrastructure and the efforts to enhance the attraction of the U.S. as a place to do business.Potential LegacyTax experts and lawmakers expect the administration to try to raise taxes on the wealthy and their assets in the second package coming later this spring.If Biden does succeed in passing the bulk of the packages he introduces, it could put him in the pantheon with Lyndon Johnson or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, presidents who instituted sweeping changes through legislation on civil rights and the social safety net.“This really is transformational in a way we have not seen since the Great Society,” said Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank. “Like a lot of people, I underestimated Joe Biden. He was always in the background -- as vice presidents are supposed to be -- always in the center of the party politically. And he was clumsy. That is what we saw, and that is why I underestimated him. But I can’t quarrel with what he done since he took office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-unveil-2-25-trillion-spending-corporate-tax-hikes-101617190874724.html
31-03-2021||World||China didn’t withhold data on the origin of Covid-19 virus: Official||A top Chinese official on Wednesday dismissed accusations that China did not share all data with the World Health Organization (WHO)-appointed researchers tracing the origin of the Covid-19 virus.The denial comes a day after the publication of the WHO-China joint report on the origins of Covid-19, following which WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Beijing withheld relevant data from the team of scientists who visited Wuhan in January.Tedros was quoted as saying the investigation was “not extensive enough” and that experts had struggled to access raw information during their four-week visit to the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged in December, 2019.Additionally, at least 14 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, and the Czech Republic, raised concerns over the report released by the WHO on Tuesday into the origin of the coronavirus, citing delays and a lack of full access to data.Speaking on the report on Wednesday, Liang Wannian, co-leader of the joint study, said Chinese and international researchers had access to the same data throughout the probe period and that the claims about lack of access were not accurate. “Of course, according to Chinese law, some data cannot be taken away or photographed, but when we were analysing it together in Wuhan, everyone could see the database, the materials - it was all done together.”Rejecting complaints about the report being delayed, Liang said “every sentence, every conclusion, every piece of data” needed to be verified by both sides before it could be released. “Throughout, we always upheld the principle of “quality comes first”,” said Liang, chief of a Covid-19 experts’ committee set up by the China’s National Health Commission.Liang had earlier told state media that to “…accomplish the arduous task of scientific cooperation and exchange, the Chinese side brought together the relevant institutions and hundreds of scientists and did their best to collect and collate data and conduct a preliminary analysis”.Liang said the origin tracing of the virus is a continuous work, adding that further tracing will be carried out around the globe, based on the findings of the study in China.China was the first country to report Covid-19 cases, so the global tracing of virus origins was first conducted here, Liang said.Separately, the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday called on all parties to respect science and the opinions and conclusions of the WHO report that found it’s extremely unlikely the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The WHO said work could also be carried out in laboratories around the world if further evidence was available and needed, ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying said, adding that China hopes that other relevant countries will cooperate with the WHO in the same open and transparent manner as China has done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-didn-t-withhold-data-on-the-origins-of-covid-19-virus-official-101617190852429.html
31-03-2021||World||European Union delivers over 100 million Covid-19 vaccines in first quarter||The European Union will have delivered 107 million Covid vaccines by the end of this week, reaching the bloc’s targeted goal to ship 100 million doses in the first three months of the year.The milestone was confirmed by European Commission spokesperson, Dana Spinant to reporters on Wednesday and reported earlier by Bloomberg News. It was a revised goal that had to take into account multiple delays in the deliveries from AstraZeneca Plc.The drug maker, one of four suppliers authorized in the EU, had committed to providing 30 million doses by the end of this quarter, well below the originally planned 120 million shots. The other pharmaceutical companies have delivered on schedule.A spokesman for Astra said on Tuesday that the company was on track to ship 30 million doses to the EU by the end of March.The milestone is a rare vaccine win for the EU, which has been struggling to ramp up a sluggish inoculation campaign that lags behind western countries such as the UK and the US.The bloc expects to receive 360 million doses in the second quarter and is aiming to vaccinate 70% of its adult population by the end of the summer. Meanwhile, several large EU countries have reimposed lockdown measures, with Italy and France likely to announce additional restrictions on Wednesday, in the face of an onslaught of new coronavirus cases on the continent.The bloc has administered 15 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the UK has managed, according to Bloomberg’s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker.The European vaccine campaign faced another setback after Germany said it would halt the use of Astra’s Covid-19 vaccine for people younger than 60 after a handful of new cases of severe blood clots emerged.“These are findings that we cannot ignore,” Merkel told reporters late Tuesday, acknowledging that the latest development will increase public uncertainty. “We all know that vaccination is the most important tool against the coronavirus -- that we have different vaccines at our disposal is our good fortune,” she added.Germany’s vaccine agency reported a rare brain blood clot in 31 people who had been given the Astra shot, nine of whom died. With the exception of two people, all of the cases were women between the ages of 20 and 63. Around 2.7 million people in Germany have so far received the Astra shot, data from the RKI public-health authority show.The data from German health authorities suggest that there has been more than one case of the rare blood clot per 100,000 people vaccinated with Astra. That’s a higher ratio than would be expected in the wider population, according to analysis earlier this month by the agency that advises the German government on medicine safety.The European Medicines Agency has alerted doctors to the latest blood-clot data, and amended the vaccine’s information notice. It said it can’t entirely rule out a link between vaccination and blood clots, including unusual cases in which patients have low levels of blood-clotting platelets.Earlier this month, the EMA reviewed the blood-clot issue and concluded that the benefits of the Astra shot outweigh the risks. But it also recommended that a warning is added to make sure the public is better informed.The move comes as European countries weigh lockdown measures in the face of rising new cases. France and Italy may announce new or extended restrictions later Wednesday to try to curb the coronavirus spread.French President Emmanuel Macron, who speaks at 8 p.m. in Paris, may consider measures including a strict nationwide lockdown, closing schools and forced transfers of patients in intensive care to other regions, according to France Info Radio.The rules in Italy could centralize decisions on school reopenings in Rome and make it compulsory for health workers to get the Covid vaccine, according to people familiar with the plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-delivers-over-100-million-covid-19-vaccines-in-first-quarter-101617188379985.html
31-03-2021||World||Pfizer-BioNTech say Covid-19 vaccine 100% effective on youths aged 12 to 15||Pfizer announced Wednesday that its Covid-19 vaccine is safe and strongly protective in kids as young as 12, a step toward possibly beginning shots in this age group before they head back to school in the fall.Most Covid-19 vaccines being rolled out worldwide are for adults, who are at higher risk from the coronavirus. Pfizer’s vaccine is authorized for ages 16 and older. But vaccinating children of all ages will be critical to stopping the pandemic — and helping schools, at least the upper grades, start to look a little more normal after months of disruption.In a study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15, preliminary data showed there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared to 18 among those given dummy shots, Pfizer reported.It's a small study, that hasn't yet been published, so another important piece of evidence is how well the shots revved up the kids’ immune systems. Researchers reported high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, somewhat higher than were seen in studies of young adults.Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech in the coming weeks plan to ask the US Food and Drug Administration and European regulators to allow emergency use of the shots starting at age 12.“We share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. He expressed “the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year" in the United States.Pfizer isn’t the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected soon from a US study of Moderna’s vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds.But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to begin US studies in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6-month-old.AstraZeneca last month began a study of its vaccine among 6- to 17-year-olds in Britain. Johnson & Johnson is planning its own pediatric studies. And in China, Sinovac recently announced it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3.While most Covid-19 vaccines being used globally were first tested in tens of thousands of adults, pediatric studies won’t need to be nearly as large. Scientists have safety information from those studies and from subsequent vaccinations in millions more adults.One key question is the dosage: Pfizer gave the 12-and-older participants the same dose adults receive, while testing different doses in younger children.It's not clear how quickly the FDA would act on Pfizer's request to allow vaccination starting at age 12. Another question is when the country would have enough supply of shots — and people to get them into adolescents' arms — to let kids start getting in line.Supplies are set to steadily increase over the spring and summer, at the same time states are opening vaccinations to younger, healthier adults who until now haven't had a turn.Children represent about 13% of Covid-19 cases documented in the US And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, at least 268 have died from Covid-19 in the US alone and more than 13,500 have been hospitalized, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s more than die from the flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus.Caleb Chung, who turns 13 later this week, agreed to volunteer after his father, a Duke University pediatrician, presented the option. He doesn't know if he received the vaccine or a placebo.“Usually I’m just at home doing online school and there’s not much I can really do to fight back against the virus,” Caleb said in a recent interview. The study “was really somewhere that I could actually help out.”His father, Dr. Richard Chung, said he’s proud of his son and all the other children volunteering for the needle pricks, blood tests and other tasks a study entails.“We need kids to do these trials so that kids can get protected. Adults can’t do that for them,” Chung said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-100-effective-for-youths-aged-12-to-15-101617187845557.html
31-03-2021||World||Covid-19: French Prez Macron to address nation as third wave overloads hospitals||French President Emmanuel Macron will address the nation on Wednesday evening, his office said, as a fast-spreading third wave of Covid-19 infections threatens to over-run hospitals.Macron has sought to avoid a third large-scale lockdown since the start of the year, gambling that if could steer France out of the pandemic without locking the country down again he would give the economy a chance to recover from a deep slump.However, in recent weeks his options have narrowed as the highly contagious and virulent coronavirus variant first detected in Britain swept across France and much of Europe.The number of patients in intensive care breached 5,000 on Tuesday, the highest number this year and exceeding the peak hit during a six-week long lockdown in the autumn. Thousands of school classes have been closed down.Macron was holding a weekly Covid defence council on Wednesday morning. A government source told Reuters three scenarios were being examined: a massive operation to transfer intensive care patients from overloaded hospitals to lesser-hit regions; school closures; strict lockdown in the hardest-hit parts of France.France faces having to tighten measures just as neighbouring Britain slowly emerges from a lockdown imposed in early January.Macron had hoped France's Covid-19 vaccine campaign would reduce the numbers falling gravely ill. But the vaccine rollout is only now finding its stride three months after it began, with just 12% of the population inoculated.The president will deliver his televised address at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)."What we needed earlier was a strict lockdown and huge vaccination drive, but it's still not too late," Gilbert Deray, a senior clinician at the Pitie-Salpeterie hospital in Paris told Europe 1 radio.France used medical evacuations to ease the load on overwhelmed hospitals during the first two waves of the epidemic but there has been more resistance from families in recent weeks. The government source said the evacuations under discussion would not require family consent.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo told BFM TV that schools should be closed.Ten days ago, the government closed non-essential stores and limited people's movements in Paris and other regions ravaged by the virus. Mobility data analysed by Reuters showed those measures were having markedly less impact than prior lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-french-prez-macron-to-address-nation-as-third-wave-overloads-hospitals-101617186329963.html
31-03-2021||World||Thailand: 5 pro-democracy activists charged for violence against the queen||Five pro-democracy activists in Thailand were charged Wednesday with the rarely used criminal offence of attempting to harm the queen, over an encounter with a royal motorcade during a protest last year.If convicted, the group could face the death penalty or life in prison under a law that has not been used for decades and punishes any "act of violence against the queen or her liberty".The incident came as thousands of protesters marched from the Democracy Monument to the Government House in Bangkok in October last year.A motorcade ferrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti passed through the protest zone in the afternoon.Some protesters crowded around the vehicle, raising the three-fingered salute of defiance adopted from "The Hunger Games" books and films.Such an overt challenge of the monarchy is unprecedented in Thailand, where a draconian defamation law has been used to shield the royal family from criticism.Prosecutors formally charged the five on Wednesday.Their lawyer, Poonsuk Poonsukcharoen, sought bail and was prepared to put up a 300,000 baht ($10,000) bond for each.One of the accused, Bunkueanun "Francis" Paothong, 21, said he had no intention of harming the queen.He told reporters it had been a "wretched and excruciating five months" in legal limbo.The pro-democracy protests in Bangkok kicked off last July and called for the resignation of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha's government and a rewrite of the military-scripted constitution.But the most controversial demands have been for reforms to the monarchy, including the abolition of lese majeste, the royal defamation law.Close to 20 pro-democracy protesters and student leaders are on remand in prison while fighting lese majeste charges, sedition and other offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-5-pro-democracy-activists-charged-for-violence-against-the-queen-101617185836938.html
31-03-2021||World||China under pressure after WHO chief revives lab leak theory||China faced mounting pressure Wednesday over the investigation into the origins of Covid-19, after the WHO chief revived a theory it may have leaked from a Chinese lab and the United States led concerns over data access.A report by WHO and Chinese experts released on Tuesday had judged the lab-leak hypothesis highly unlikely, saying the virus behind Covid-19 had probably jumped from bats to humans via an intermediary animal.China warmly welcomed the report, seeing it as confirmation of its handling of the investigation following allegations it had tried to delay and then restrict it.The report also initially appeared to back China's firm rejection of theories that the pandemic may have been triggered by a leak from a virology lab in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged.But WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus on Tuesday reopened the lab leak theory, as he raised concerns about the level of access China provided to the experts during their visit to Wuhan in January."In my discussions with the team, they expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data," Tedros said.He called for "timely and comprehensive data sharing" in future investigations.Tedros also said that although the experts concluded the laboratory leak was the "least likely" hypotheses, this theory needed to be probed further."I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough," Teodros said of the possibility of a leak."This requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy."Tedros then emphasised that no theory had yet been ruled out."Let me say clearly that as far as WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table," he said.The pandemic has killed nearly 2.8 million people worldwide since it first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019.Throughout the pandemic, China has amplified theories that the virus may have surfaced outside of its borders or been imported on frozen food.China was heavily criticised by the Donald Trump administration and other Western nations for delaying access to the WHO experts.Joe Biden's administration has continued to raise concerns about China's handling of the probe.The United States on Tuesday released a statement with 13 of its allies -- Britain, Japan and Australia among them -- saying the inquiry lacked the data and samples it needed."We join in expressing shared concerns regarding the recent WHO-convened study in China," the statement said.- Diverging information -Beijing insists it was transparent with the scientists.It said it provided open access to wet markets, labs, patients and data from the first torrid weeks of the virus, admonishing critics for "politicising" a global health crisis.Health officials in Beijing are due to give a press conference on the WHO report on Wednesday afternoon.The reason for the diverging information from the WHO expert team was not immediately clear.On the laboratory accident hypothesis, the head of the investigation team, Danish scientist Ben Embarek told reporters on Tuesday that Chinese lab staff had acknowledged they initially feared a leak."Even the staff in these labs told us that was their first reaction," Embarek said."They all went back to their records... but nobody could find any trace of something similar to this virus in their records or their samples."Nobody has been able to pick up any firm arguments or proof or evidence that any of these labs would have been involved in a lab leak accident."That said, Embarek added: "We haven't done a full investigation or audit of any of the labs."Other WHO team members took to Twitter to defend the probe.Peter Daszak, who was effusive in praise of his Chinese hosts during the January probe, hit out at the "pure politics" being played with the findings led by elements of the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-under-pressure-after-who-chief-revives-lab-leak-theory-101617172063111.html

31-03-2021||World||US announces completion of H-1B cap lottery process for FY 2022. What’s next?||The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday announced the completion of the H-1B cap lottery process for the fiscal year 2022. The US immigration agency said in a statement that they have received enough e-registrations during the initial registration period to reach the H-1B quota of 85,000, including the advanced degree exemption, also known as the master’s cap.“We randomly selected from among the registrations properly submitted to reach the cap. We have notified all prospective petitioners with selected registrations that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition for the beneficiary named in the applicable selected registration,” the USCIS stated.The online accounts of H-1B registrants will now show one of the four statuses - ‘Submitted’, ‘Selected’, ‘Denied’, and ‘Invalidated-Failed Payment’. The ‘Denied’ status would show in case multiple registrations were submitted by or on behalf of the same registrant for the same beneficiary.What’s next?Detailed H-1B cap-subject petitions for those selected in the lottery process, including petitions eligible for the master’s cap, now have to be filed by the sponsoring employers from April 1, 2021.

The US and other countries say the WHO report lacked crucial information, access and transparency and further study was warranted.Kato called for additional investigation and analysis and said Japan will encourage WHO to consider additional investigation inside China.“We will further cooperate with other countries in carrying out additional studies that are still necessary,” Kato said.The report said the virus most likely came from bats and spread to an unidentified mammal before being transmitted to people. It called a laboratory leak an unlikely route of transmission that didn't warrant further study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-demands-further-probe-into-covid-19-origins-after-who-releases-report-101617179982577.html
31-03-2021||World||WHO team urges patience after first look for origin of coronavirus||An international team behind a long-awaited study of the possible origins of Covid-19 with Chinese colleagues on Tuesday called it a “first start,” while the United States and allies expressed concerns about the findings and China trumpeted its cooperation.Team leader Peter Ben Embarek of the World Health Organization presented the team's first-phase look into the possible origins of the pandemic that has killed nearly 2.8 million people and pummeled economies since it first turned up in China over a year ago.The report, obtained by The Associated Press on Monday and formally published on Tuesday, said transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal is the most likely scenario and that a lab leak is “extremely unlikely.” The WHO chief has said all hypotheses remain open.After the report's publication, the U.S. and over a dozen other countries expressed concerns about the study, pointing to delays and a lack of access to samples and data — without finger-pointing at Beijing directly. China responded by reiterating its criticism of efforts to “politicize” the issue.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration was still reviewing the WHO report, but said “it lacks crucial data, information ... It lacks access. It lacks transparency." She said the study did not rise to the level of the impact that the pandemic has had on the world.“That's why we also have called for additional forward-looking steps,” she said in a briefing with reporters. "It doesn't lead us to any closer (an) understanding or greater knowledge than we had six to nine months ago about the origin.”Separately, in what it called a joint statement by 14 countries, the State Department said they were calling for “momentum” for a second-phase look by experts and pointed to the need for further animal studies “to find the means of introduction into humans” of the coronavirus.The countries expressed support for the WHO's experts and staff, citing their “tireless” work toward ending the pandemic and understanding its origins to help prevent a future one. But they said the study had been “significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples.”Psaki said China has “not been transparent” with the U.N. health agency.Critics of China's government in Washington and beyond say it took too long to allow in the team members: Their roughly four-week visit to China in January and February came more than a year after the coronavirus outbreak was first noticed in the city of Wuhan.The European Union, in a separate statement, echoed concerns about the late start to the study, the delayed deployment of the expert team, and the limited availability of samples and data, but called the report “a helpful first step.”A statement on the Chinese Foreign Ministry's web site after the release pointed to China's cooperation with WHO and said the Chinese side of the team “offered necessary facilitation for the team's work, fully demonstrating its openness, transparency and responsible attitude.”It repeated China's frequent criticism of efforts to politicize the issue, saying that it will “jeopardize anti-pandemic cooperation, and cost more lives.” It also reiterated the Chinese government's belief that the study of the pandemic's origins “should be conducted in multiple countries and localities.”Ben Embarek said the team members faced political pressure from “all sides,” but insisted: “We were never pressured to remove critical elements in our report.” He also pointed to “privacy” issues in China that prevented sharing of some data, saying similar restrictions exist in many countries.Joined by several team members for a news conference, Ben Embarek said that “where we did not have full access to all the raw data we wanted, that has been put as a recommendation for the future studies.”That was a major theme for the WHO team: More needs to be done, and many questions remain unanswered.“This is only a first start -- we've only scratched the surface of this very complex set of studies that need to be conducted,” Ben Embarek said. "We have pointed to many additional studies that should be conducted from now on.”“This is a work in progress," he added, "and we all have to be patient.”Ben Embarek said it was difficult to know when -- if at all -- the precise origin of the pandemic will come to light. While the team members believe one hypothesis that the virus could have leaked from a laboratory was not likely, it was “not impossible” either, he said.“We haven't seen or been able to hear or see or look at anything that would warrant different conclusions from our side,” he said.But in its report, the team proposed further research in every area except the lab leak hypothesis — a speculative theory that was promoted by former U.S. President Donald Trump among others. It also said the role played by a seafood market where human cases were first identified was uncertain.Suspicion of China partially underpinned the theory that the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. The report cited several reasons for all but dismissing that possibility.“This is a dynamic process. Nothing is cast in stone. There are no firm conclusions," Ben Embarek said. "And I think that's how we should look at the whole outcome of this report — and this work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-urges-patience-after-first-look-for-origin-of-coronavirus-101617177699623.html
31-03-2021||World||Texas Senate approves abortion restrictions, bills move to house||The Texas state Senate passed six laws intended to restrict abortion on Tuesday, including one that, if approved by lawmakers in the lower chamber and signed by the governor, would prohibit the procedure once a fetal heartbeat was detected.The half-dozen bills mark the latest effort by right-leaning state legislatures to roll back abortion rights since former President Donald Trump's three appointments to the Supreme Court gave conservatives a 6-3 majority.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster in February signed a law outlawing abortion once a fetal heartbeat was detected. Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, quickly sued to have it overturned.The Republican-led Montana legislature has passed several measures limiting access to abortion and have asked voters to approve another that would essentially outlaw voluntary termination of a pregnancy.In Texas, where abortion is already illegal past 20 weeks gestation, one of the six bills approved on Tuesday would, like South Carolina's law, ban the procedure once a fetal heartbeat was detected.A second measure, written by Republican State Sen. Angela Paxton, would ban most abortions in Texas if the Supreme Court overturns its 1973 ruling that the procedure is protected by the U.S. Constitution."The life of the mother is incredibly important, as is the life of the unborn child. It's a difficult situation," Paxton said, according to the Austin American-Statesman.A fetus that is viable outside the womb, at around 24 weeks into the pregnancy, is widely considered the threshold at which abortion can be prohibited in the United States, where the issue remains deeply divisive.The Texas state Senate on Tuesday also voted to prohibit the use of abortion pills after seven weeks of gestation and to mandate that doctors make counseling available to women who are seeking to terminate their pregnancy.Lawmakers also banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy when a severe abnormality has been detected in the growing fetus.The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a bid by Kentucky's Republican attorney general to defend a restrictive state law, struck down by lower courts, that abortion rights advocates have said would effectively ban the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

His son, Thomas Liddy, confirmed the news of his father’s demise, according to US media. Liddy, who became a radio talk show host after his release from prison, remained unrepentant for the part that he played in the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of then US President Richard Nixon. "I'd do it again for my president," Liddy said years later.Born in New Jersey in 1930, Liddy lived in a German American neighbourhood where his first interactions with politics were with the radio speeches of Adolf Hitler. After a stint in the Army and graduating from Fordham university law school, Liddy joined the FBI. Later, he helped organise Nixon’s presidential campaign in New York. Owing to his participation in the campaign, he was named special assistant to Treasury after Nixon took office. He also participated in Nixon’s re-election bid.Liddy was known for his extreme ideas and harsh tone with opponents of Nixon. One of such ideas was the Watergate scandal - a plan to bug the Democratic National Committee offices. But the plan resulted in America’s biggest political scandal. Liddy and fellow operative Howard Hunt were arrested along with five others and indicted on federal charges three months after the break-in. Liddy spent four years and four months in prison which included more than 100 days in solitary confinement although he was sentenced to 20 years. His sentence was commuted in 1977 by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. "When I did Watergate, I probably had more fun doing that than I had doing anything else. I do and act and live as most men only dream," Liddy said.After his release, Liddy started a security firm and wrote several books. He also became a radio talk show host, a controversial and provocative one."I most of all go for the villain roles, I really like those," Liddy once said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gordon-liddy-unrepentant-mastermind-of-watergate-scandal-dies-at-90-101617174874975.html

He has pledged $100 million personally to the institute.Assuming the role of mission "commander," Isaacman in February designated St. Jude physician's assistant Haley Arceneaux, 29, a bone cancer survivor and onetime patient at the Tennessee-based hospital, as his first crewmate.Announced on Tuesday, Chris Sembroski, 41, a Seattle-area aerospace industry employee and U.S. Air Force veteran, was selected through a sweepstakes that drew 72,000 applicants and has raised $113 million in St. Jude donations.Sian Proctor, 51, a geoscience professor at South Mountain Community College in Phoenix, Arizona, and entrepreneur who was once a NASA astronaut candidate, was chosen separately through an online business contest run by Shift4 Payments.All four will undergo extensive training modeled after the curriculum NASA astronauts use to prepare for SpaceX missions.The Inspiration4 mission may mark a new era in spaceflight, but it is not the only all-civilian crewed rocket launch in the works.British billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic enterprise is developing a spaceplane to carry paying customers on suborbital excursions.SpaceX plans a separate launch, possibly next year, of a retired NASA astronaut, a former Israeli fighter pilot and two other people in conjunction with Houston-based private spaceflight company Axiom Space.Musk also intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon in 2023. Fees charged for those flights will help finance the development of Musk's new, heavy-lift Starship rocket for missions to the moon and Mars.Inspiration4 is about more than a billionaire's joyride through space, organizers say, promising the crew will conduct a number of as-yet undetermined science experiments during its brief voyage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seats-filled-for-first-all-civilian-spacex-launch-101617168776779.html

Since October 2018, more than a dozen caravans have left Honduras, heading north.Most of the migrants say they are fleeing violence and poverty in their countries, a situation that worsened in 2020 after two devastating hurricanes and the Covid-19 pandemic.Some 100,000 people were apprehended in February at the southern US border, including nearly 9,500 unaccompanied minors, a 28 percent increase over January.Biden's administration anticipates a 20-year high in migrant arrivals this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vp-harris-thanks-guatemalan-president-for-controlling-honduras-border-101617149701820.html
31-03-2021||World||Xi Jinping's shifting China is compelling investors to run, hide or hire||For any company doing business in China, the choice is now clearer than ever: Avoid commenting on any controversial subjects or risk losing access to the world’s second-largest economy.Over the past few weeks, President Xi Jinping’s government endorsed a boycott against retailers like Hennes & Mauritz AB and slapped sanctions on a range of organizations -- including a group of barristers in the U.K. -- over statements made on alleged forced labor in Xinjiang. Then on Tuesday, he signed off on sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s election system to give Beijing veto power over any candidates.China’s more aggressive stance, triggered in part by collective action by the U.S. and its allies to sanction Chinese officials, is forcing companies to quickly weigh what they will do to maintain access to 1.4 billion consumers with ever-more spending power. So far, with growth in the rest of the world anemic, most companies are either keeping their heads down or stepping up investments.While it used to be easier for companies to operate in China and manage corporate social responsibility, now it’s difficult to show that outside influence has any impact on changing the Communist Party’s actions, according to Margaret Lewis, a law professor and China specialist at Seton Hall University.“You end up in this dilemma of stay in and be complicit or pull out,” she said. “The middle ground between those two is increasingly difficult to find. It’s a starker decision now.”The best strategy for brands like H&M facing a boycott in China is to lay low and wait until the backlash “blows over,” Joerg Wuttke, head of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. Indeed, several companies pulled statements on Xinjiang off their websites.Complicated picture“It’s a complicated picture,” Wuttke said. “On the one hand, China saved the skin of many companies last year,” he said. “At the same time, you have of course this kind of political pressure that is on you, and again a topic like Xinjiang is a no-win situation.”Many foreign companies with good relations are expanding their presence in China, and Hong Kong’s finance sector is booming this year due to an influx of IPOs and work on SPAC listing deals. Companies including Baidu Inc. and Bilibili Inc. have raised almost $17 billion through first-time shares sales in the city so far this year, up nine times from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.New York-based Citigroup Inc. plans to hire as many as 1,700 staff in Hong Kong as it seeks to tap growing links between the financial hub and rising affluence in southern mainland cities such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen. A pandemic-induced hunger for technology stocks and the threat of U.S. delistings have been a boon for the financial hub, driving a surge in initial and secondary share sales.For some international law firms advising companies, however, the environment for working in Hong Kong just got a lot trickier. China’s retaliatory sanctions against the U.K. included the Essex Court Chambers, which a prominent lawyer warned could have much bigger consequences for investors.After being hit with the sanctions, the Financial Times reported that the chambers removed a reference from its website to a legal opinion by some of its lawyers implicating the Chinese government in alleged genocide in Xinjiang. The Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper said the action showed that China’s sanction were an “effective deterrent against rumors.”But Guy Sandhurst, formerly chairman of the Bar of England and Wales, said the move will affect “all British companies who do business with Chinese clients” because lawyers involved in dispute resolution for Hong Kong firms could be denied access to the territory. He called for the “Western world” to insist on dispute resolution mechanisms outside China for all future contracts.“Today it is the members of Essex Court Chambers who are sanctioned,” Sandhurst wrote on the website of the Society of Conservative Lawyers. “But tomorrow it might be Clifford Chance, Freshfields or some other major city law firm or Chambers of barristers which wittingly or otherwise offends the Chinese state.”Xi’s move on Tuesday to officially revamp Hong Kong’s election system could unleash another round of criticism and potential sanctions against Western nations, which have failed to change China’s behavior. The changes allow a small group of mainland and Hong Kong national security officials to vet every candidate standing for election, ensuring that only those loyal to Beijing are able to implement policy.Dangerous decisionsIn a letter printed on the front pages of several Hong Kong newspapers on Wednesday, leader Carrie Lam said the changes will help mitigate “excessive politicization” in society and allow the territory “to develop the economy and improve the livelihood of our citizens.” Former chief executive Leung Chun-ying echoed that in an interview on Tuesday.“A lot of opportunities,” he said when asked about Hong Kong’s economic future. “It is a question of opening our minds, our eyes and ears to these opportunities and then just share with the international community.”But while Xi’s actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang may look tough and Chinese officials are talking to the world “like now they have nothing to learn,” the moves actually reveal a paranoia that could end up backfiring among companies and countries, according to Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who’s authored several books on Chinese foreign policy.“It’s a kind of nervousness, which is a sign of weakness and a sign that they don’t feel secure,” he said. “And that’s worrisome, because when you’re insecure you may embark on dangerous decisions and actions toward others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-shifting-china-is-compelling-investors-to-run-hide-or-hire-101617168565253.html
31-03-2021||World||US trade war pushing China to steal tech, talent, Taiwan says||The China-US trade war is pushing Beijing to step up its efforts to steal technology and poach talent from Taiwan to boost China's semiconductor industry's self-sufficiency, the government of the tech-powerhouse island said on Wednesday.Washington has taken aim at China's tech industry during the bitter trade dispute, putting sanctions on firms including telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd, saying they are a threat to national security, angering Beijing.Chinese-claimed Taiwan is home to a thriving and world-leading chip industry, and the government has long worried about China's efforts to copy that success, through fair means or foul.Speaking at a parliamentary committee meeting on how to respond to the "red supply chain" - a reference to the colour of China's ruling Communist Party - Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the trade war had created new risks."Affected by the U.S.-China technology war, the development of mainland China's semiconductor industry has been obstructed, but they are still committed to the industry's development," she said."In order to achieve self-sufficiency in the supply chain, poaching and infiltration are the quickest way for mainland China to do this," Wang added.Taiwan's chip workers have deep experience and speak the same language, meaning they are a "natural target for poaching China has latched onto", she added.China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Hu Mu-yuan, deputy head of Taiwan's National Security Bureau, said China's efforts were a threat to not just Taiwan, but also Japan and South Korea, threatening global trade and fair competition."Moreover, the Chinese communists are stealing other countries intellectual property to boost their own power," he added.Taiwan has strict laws to try and prevent this from happening, but officials have warned China tries to skirt them by setting up front companies on the island, using Taiwanese headhunters and other methods."Preventing Taiwan's key technology and high-tech personnel from being infiltrated by the 'red supply chain' has become an important task to protect our industry's competitiveness and ensure our economic security," Hu said.(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Beijing newsroom.

31-03-2021||World||Myanmar junta deepens violence with new air attacks in east||The military launched more airstrikes Tuesday in eastern Myanmar after earlier attacks forced thousands of ethnic Karen to flee into Thailand and further escalating violence two months after the junta seized power.Thailand’s prime minister said the villagers who fled the weekend airstrikes returned home of their own accord, denying that his country’s security forces had forced them back.But the situation in eastern Myanmar appeared to be getting more, not less, dangerous.The Karen National Union, the main political body representing the Karen minority, said the airstrikes were the latest case of Myanmar's military breaking a cease-fire agreement and it would have to respond.The attacks came as protests continued in Myanmar cities against the coup Feb. 1 that ousted an elected civilian government and reversed a decade of progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian country. Hundreds of civilians have been killed by security forces trying to put down opposition to the coup.The U.S. State Department on Tuesday ordered non-essential U.S. diplomats and their families to leave Myanmar, expecting the protests to continue. The U.S. earlier suspended a trade deal and imposed sanctions on junta leaders as well as restricted business with military holding companies.Tuesday's air raids in eastern Myanmar killed six civilians and wounded 11, said Saw Taw Nee, head of the KNU's foreign affairs department.Dave Eubank, a member of the Free Burma Rangers, which provides medical assistance in the region, provided the same information on casualties.The KNU has been fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people. It issued a statement from one of its armed units saying “military ground troops are advancing into our territories from all fronts” and vowing to respond.“We have no other options left but to confront these serious threats posed by the illegitimate military junta’s army in order to defend our territory, our Karen peoples, and their self-determination rights,” said the statement, issued in the name of the KNU office for the district that was first attacked on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, speaking before the latest air attacks, said his country is ready to shelter anyone who is escaping fighting, as Thailand has done many times for decades. His comments came a day after humanitarian groups said Thailand has been sending back some of the thousands of people who fled.“There is no influx of refugees yet. We asked those who crossed to Thailand if they have any problem in their area. When they say no problem, we just asked them to return to their land first. We asked, we did not use any force,” Prayuth told reporters.“We won’t push them back,” he said. ’If they are having fighting, how can we do so? But if they don’t have any fighting at the moment, can they go back first?”The governor of Thailand's Mae Hong Son province, where as many as 3,000 refugees had sought shelter, said later that those still on Thai soil were expected to return to their own country in a day or two.Protests against the junta continued in several Myanmar cities Tuesday despite its lethal crackdown that killed more than 100 people on Saturday alone.Engineers, teachers and students from the technology university in the southern city of Dawei marched without incident.The number of protesters killed in the city rose to eight with the announcement of the death of a teenager who was shot by soldiers on Saturday as he rode a motorbike with two friends. According to local media, a hospital certificate attributed his death to “serious injuries as he fell from a motorbike.”Medical workers in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city, honored three of their colleagues who have been killed by security forces. The two doctors and a nurse were remembered in a simple ceremony in front of a banner with their photographs and the words “Rest In Power.”At a cemetery in the biggest city, Yangon, three families gave their last farewells to relatives killed Monday in a night of chaos in the South Dagon neighborhood. Residents said police and soldiers moved through the streets firing randomly with live ammunition.At least 510 protesters have been killed since the coup, according to Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which counts those it can document and says the actual toll is likely much higher. It says 2,574 people have been detained, a total that includes the deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy party was reelected in the November elections by a landslide.At Thailand’s Mae Sam Laep village along the Salween River, which forms the border with Myanmar, paramilitary Thai Rangers on Tuesday twice waved off a boat that had come from the other side carrying seven people, including one lying flat and another with a bandage on his head. But ambulances soon arrived on the Thai side and it landed anyway.Thai villagers helped medical staff carry the injured people on stretchers to a small clinic at a nearby checkpoint. One man had large bruises on his back with open wounds, an injury one medical staffer said could have been caused by an explosion.An elderly woman in the group had small cuts and scabs all over her face. Thai nurses in protective gear to guard against COVID-19 attended to her, testing her and others for the coronavirus.Another villager from the boat, 48-year-old Aye Ja Bi, said he had been wounded by a bomb dropped by a plane. His legs were hit by shrapnel and his ears were ringing, he said, but he was unable to travel to get help until Tuesday.The airstrikes appeared to be retaliation for an attack by guerrillas under the command of the KNU on a government military outpost in which they claimed to have killed 10 soldiers and captured eight. Tuesday's KNU statement charged that the strikes had been planned before that.About 2,500-3,000 refugees crossed into Thailand on Sunday, according to several humanitarian aid agencies who have long worked with the Karen.They said on Monday, however, that Thai soldiers had begun to force people to return to Myanmar.“They told them it was safe to go back even though it is not safe. They were afraid to go back but they had no choice,” said a spokesperson for the Karen Peace Support Network, a group of Karen civil society organizations in Myanmar.The army has restricted journalists’ access to the area where the villagers crossed the border.Myanmar’s government has battled Karen guerrillas on and off for years — along with other ethnic minorities seeking more autonomy — but the airstrikes marked a major escalation of violence.Political organizations representing the Karen and Kachin in northern Myanmar have warned in recent weeks that junta forces have been shooting protesters in their regions and threatening a response.They were joined Tuesday by the Three Brothers Alliance, which represent the guerrilla armies of the Rakhine, Kokang and Ta-ang — also known as Palaung. The alliance said if the killing of protesters did not stop immediately, they would abandon a self-declared cease-fire and join with other groups to protect the people.The statements from the various ethnic minority groups seemed to suggest their own militaries would respond within their home regions, not in the cities of central Myanmar where the protests and the junta's repression have been the strongest.Supporters of the protest movement are hoping that the ethnic armed groups could help pressure the junta. Protest leaders in hiding say they have held talks, but there have been no commitments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-deepens-violence-with-new-air-attacks-in-east-101617155168253.html
31-03-2021||World||Migrant kids crowded into Texas facility as space runs low||More than 500 migrant children were packed into plastic-walled rooms built for 32 people, sitting inches apart on mats with foil blankets Tuesday at the largest US Customs and Border Protection holding facility for unaccompanied children.Overall, CBP's main child processing center, a compound of white tents in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, held over 4,100 migrants, more than 3,400 of them children who traveled to the US-Mexico border alone and the rest of them families. It is designed for 250 people under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic.The Biden administration allowed journalists to see conditions for the first time since the facility opened Feb. 9 amid a spike in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border.It was a grim picture.A 3,200-square-foot (297-square-meter) space had been divided into several rooms for 32 children each under CDC guidelines, each separated by thick plastic walls instead of the chain-link fence used by previous administrations. Despite the health recommendations, one of the “pods" held nearly 700 kids, another had nearly 600 and others had just above 500. Everyone wore masks, but Covid-19 tests aren't done unless they show symptoms.Doors to the rooms were open for free movement but there was little room to roam and no one to play games. Most children just sat on the ground close together, chatting quietly. Some were wrapped in foil blankets. Lights are dimmed at night.Children, most of them between 13 and 17, are separated by age. Families occupied a separate pod that was less crowded than the jam-packed rooms for older children.A room for “tender age” children from 3 to 9 years old consisted of a walled playpen with mats on the floor and far more space than the eight pods for older children. An 11-year-old boy cared for his 3-year-old sister, and a 17-year-old cared for her newborn.“I’m a Border Patrol agent. I didn’t sign up for this,” Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, said while looking at the younger kids.The children are processed in the tent-like facility in the Texas border town of Donna before being taken to longer-term care facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor.About two dozen of some 270 children being transferred to HHS midday tested positive for Covid-19 — the only time they are tested unless they exhibit symptoms earlier. Escamilla said the overall positivity rate at the Donna facility was about 14%.As they prepared to leave, children who tested negative for COVID-19 played soccer in the outdoor recreation area, where they can go three times a day when their pods are being cleaned. Those who tested positive for the virus gathered around metal benches off to the side and will still go to HHS centers.The Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than HHS is taking, leading to a severe backlog. The Border Patrol is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but HHS lacks space.More than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days. One child had been there 20 days. The average stay was 133 hours.“The intent of the Border Patrol is not detention. We’re not in the business of detention,” said Escamilla, the official who supervised the media tour. “We’re forced into the business because we can’t turn them over to anybody.”HHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere.A large HHS facility is being built near the holding center in Donna, separated by a chain-link fence. Noise from construction equipment filled the air near seven buses that were to take children to other HHS facilities.About 250 to 300 children enter the Donna facility daily and far fewer leave, a “lopsided” difference that Escamilla said was leading to more crowded conditions. It has held as many as 4,600 migrants.More than 17,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. custody as of Monday, about 12,000 with HHS and the rest with Customs and Border Protection. On Monday, 446 children entered CBP custody but only 229 went to HHS.HHS, which opened a facility Tuesday for 500 children at Fort Bliss in Texas, is working to build up to a capacity of 13,500 beds, spokesman Mark Weber said.Several hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. President Joe Biden has declined to resume his predecessor's practice of expelling unaccompanied children.But his administration has continued expelling adults under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S.In some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually.Biden has faced intense pressure to bring more transparency to how large numbers of migrant children are being treated. In his administration’s first tour of the Donna holding facility, two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS shared text, photos and video with other news outlets as part of a pool arrangement.At the facility, children entered a tent with a dirt floor and three rows of bleacher-style seats. About 60 children waited to be admitted Tuesday, all wearing masks and seated close together.They then go into a small room for lice and scabies inspection and a general health check, including whether they have a fever. Their hair is hosed down.The facility is staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, who perform psychological tests, including asking children if they have had any suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces are removed to avoid harm to anyone.Amid the loud hum of air conditioning vents, children are led to a room for processing, with anyone 14 and older getting photographed and having their fingerprints taken. Younger kids don't.In another room, agents ask them if they have a contact in the U.S. and allow the child to speak with them by phone. Plastic shields separate the agents and the children, who are seated at tables. They get bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered, medical conditions and any other personal information.All children are given notices to appear in immigration court, clearing the way for them to be released to Health and Human Services. About 1,200 children were ready for release Tuesday but there was nowhere to send them, Escamilla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-kids-crowded-into-texas-facility-as-space-runs-low-101617152468250.html

The European Digital Media Observatory, which is a European Commission project set up last year and whose members include fact checkers and academic researchers, will evaluate and select the projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-contribute-25-million-to-new-eu-fund-to-fight-fake-news-101617167499861.html
31-03-2021||World||Hunter Biden says he wouldn't repeat work for Ukrainian firm||President Joe Biden's son Hunter says his service on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, which Republicans tried to turn into a negative during the 2020 presidential campaign, wasn't unethical and didn't represent a lack of judgment on his part.But the younger Biden wouldn't do it again if given a chance, he says in a new book, citing partisan politics.“I did nothing unethical, and have never been charged with wrongdoing," Hunter Biden writes in “Beautiful Things,” a memoir. “In our current political environment, I don't believe it would make any difference if I took that seat or not. I'd be attacked anyway."“What I do believe, in this current climate, is that it wouldn't matter what I did or didn't do,” he wrote. “The attacks weren't intended for me. They were meant to wound my dad.”In the memoir, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, the president's son chronicles a lifelong battle with alcohol and drug addiction and numerous stints in and out of rehab.Hunter Biden writes that his descent into darkness followed the death of his older brother, Beau, of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46. He ends the book where he currently is in life: sober, living in California with his second wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and their baby son, Beau. Hunter Biden also has three daughters from his previous marriage.During the 2020 campaign against Democrat Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, a Republican, and his allies repeatedly sought to make an issue of the younger Biden's work for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump alleged unspecified shady dealings by the Bidens despite the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing by either candidate Biden or his son.Trump ultimately was impeached by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House for pushing Kyiv to investigate the Biden family. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to keep Trump in office.Hunter Biden writes that his only misjudgment was not considering, back in 2014 when he joined Burisma's board to help oversee its corporate practices, that Trump would be in the White House three years into the future.A lawyer and former lobbyist, he joined Burisma's board around the time his father was vice president and helping conduct the Obama administration's foreign policy in eastern Europe.Trump and others had insisted without evidence that Hunter Biden was exploiting his father’s name, and they raised unsubstantiated charges of corruption.“Knowing all of that now: No, I would not do it again,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I wouldn't take the seat on Burisma's board. Trump would have to look elsewhere to find a suitable distraction for his impeachable behavior.”The book's title, “Beautiful Things,” is an expression Hunter Biden and his brother would use with each other after Beau's diagnosis and was meant to stress what was important in life.The memoir was in the works before Joe Biden became the front-runner in the Democratic presidential campaign. It was kept under wraps even as Hunter Biden’s business dealings became a fixation of Trump and his allies during the election, and his finances the subject of a Justice Department investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-says-he-wouldn-t-repeat-work-for-ukrainian-firm-101617167548761.html

The residential compound where the infections were found has been locked down.The city also ordered a crackdown on people who cross the border illegally, anyone who shelters them and those who organize such border crossings. It wasn't immediately clear how the outbreak started.China has largely eradicated the spread of the coronavirus and takes strict measures whenever a new cluster emerges. Ruili has closed all businesses except supermarkets, drugstores and food markets. Checkpoints were set up to restrict entry to epidemic-related vehicles.The first case was identified Monday, and subsequent testing of close contacts and others turned up the other ones, the Yunnan Health Commission said.Three of the infected people, all Myanmar nationals in their 20s, did not have any Covid-19 symptoms. Of the others, four Chinese and one Myanmar citizen were classified as mild cases, and the remaining Chinese person as a regular case. They ranged in age from 22 to 42 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-covid-19-outbreak-on-border-with-myanmar-101617167704842.html

That expansion will be powered by India and Bangladesh, helping South Asia regain its historical growth rate by 2022, it said.The success of South Asian nations in containing virus caseloads through lockdowns and other curbs and a combination of fiscal and monetary policy support helped improve the economic outlook for the region. But the recovery remains fragile and masks long-terms risks, the World Bank warned.“The pandemic is not yet under control,” said Hartwig Schafer, the bank’s vice president for the region. “South Asian countries need to ramp up their vaccination programs and invest their scarce resources wisely to set a foundation for a more inclusive and resilient future.”While the effect of pandemic-control measures such as school closures may not be evident for years, lack of access to education could amplify learning losses and result in a huge economic cost for South Asia, the lender said. An estimated 5.5 million children dropped out of school in the region, which could translate into more than $1 trillion dollars in lost earnings, it said.Here are some other key vulnerabilities highlighted in the report:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-bangladesh-to-aid-south-asia-s-historical-growth-by-2022-world-bank-101617166834612.html

A commentary published by People.cn on Monday described the incident as “unforgivable.” The website is run by the People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece.NASA lets net users sign up to send their name to Mars on a future flight. Taiwan appears as an option on a “country” drop-down box, as does the Vatican. It’s unclear how long Taiwan has been called a country on the website, but more than 18 million people have registered.An emailed request for comment sent to NASA outside regular business hours was not immediately answered.Foreign companies often get in trouble with the Chinese government over political issues. Chinese net users last week called for a boycott of Hennes & Mauritz AB over an undated statement on its website saying it won’t use cotton from the Xinjiang region.The retailer was also criticized by the Communist Youth League and the People’s Liberation Army. Western governments including the US accuse China of sending as many as 1 million Muslim Uyghurs to work camps in Xinjiang. Beijing denies the allegations, saying it is fighting religious extremism and providing jobs.In 2018, US airlines stopped referring to Taiwan as a country after pressure from the Chinese government.China’s Communist Party views Taiwan as its territory, which must be taken by force if necessary. The government in Taipei rejects Beijing’s claim, insisting Taiwan is already a de facto sovereign nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-is-the-latest-to-offend-china-by-calling-taiwan-a-country-101617166388530.html

That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism,” he said. “We don’t pretend these problems don’t exist or try to sweep them under the rug. We don’t ignore them. We deal with them in the daylight, with full transparency.”Also Read | US President Biden to let Trump’s H1-B visa ban expire in win for tech firmsIn the executive summary of the section on India, the report acknowledged progress in Jammu & Kashmir. “The government continued taking steps to restore normalcy in Jammu & Kashmir by gradually lifting some security and communications restrictions. The government released most political activists from detention. In January, the government partially restored internet access; however, high-speed 4G mobile internet remained restricted in most parts of Jammu and Kashmir.”The summary also included a long list of significant human rights issues in India, which were dealt with in some detail later in the report. It referred to “unlawful and arbitrary killings” by police; torture by some police and prison officials; “arbitrary” arrests and detentions; “harsh and life-threatening” prison conditions; political prisoners or detainees in certain states.It also referred to “restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or prosecutions against journalists, use of criminal libel laws to prosecute social media speech, censorship, and site blocking”.The summary went on to list “overly restrictive rules” on non-governmental organisations; “restrictions” on political participation; “widespread corruption at all levels in the government”; “lack” of investigation of and accountability for violence against women; “tolerance” of violations of religious freedom; crimes involving violence and discrimination targeting members of minority groups including women based on religious affiliation or social status; and “forced and compulsory child labour, as well as bonded labour”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-has-rights-issues-but-situation-improving-in-j-k-says-us-state-dept-101617163611602.html

All you need to know||An unknown brain disease has caused panic in the New Brunswick province of Canada after a string of cases were reported that involved memory loss, hallucinations and muscle atrophy, according to a report in The Guardian. People living in the province became cognizant of the disease after a memo from the province’s public health agency leaked last week which asked doctors to look for symptoms relate to Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). CJD is a rare brain disease which is caused due to abnormally folded proteins called prions.Here’s everything you need to know about the unknown brain disease that has worried the health experts and officials in Canada:1. Public health officials in the province have been tracking 43 cases of the unknown brain disease since 2015 when it was first identified, The Guardian reported.2. The province's health officials told CBS News that 24 cases of the disease were reported in 2020 and six cases have been reported in 2021 itself. Officials have also linked five deaths with the disease.3. The cases were first related to CJD as some symptoms of the rare disease like memory loss, vision loss, inconsistent jerking movements have been associated with it. Although, the link has not been confirmed till now. “We don’t have evidence to suggest it’s a prion disease,” said Dr Alier Marrero, the neurologist who is leading the investigation into the cases, according to The Guardian.4. The symptoms of the unknown disease include pains, spasms, behavioural changes and between 18 to 36 months, the patients are said to develop decline in cognitive abilities, wasting of muscles or atrophy and teeth chattering. Some patients experienced hallucinations as well.5. Although the health officials have not disclosed the location of the cases related to the unknown disease, most of the cases are being linked to the Acadian peninsula.6. Some researchers have also linked the cases to environmental causes. According to the report in CBS News, some possible suspects include B-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and domoic acid, toxins that can accumulate in fish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mystery-brain-disorder-in-canada-all-you-need-to-know-101617161050862.html
31-03-2021||World||New York on way to be 2nd-largest pot market in US, home growers to gain||New York moved toward creating the nation’s second-largest market for legal marijuana when the state Legislature passed Tuesday a bill that would impose special pot taxes and allow the licensing of dispensaries.The measure (S.854A /A.1248A) would allow cannabis storefronts to open as soon as next year, and would let home growers start cultivating their own pot. It would limit the number of licenses for large corporations, and impose sales and excise taxes that are estimated to eventually bring in about $350 million a year.The legislation would set in motion automatic expungement of records for people with previous convictions for activities that would no longer be criminalized when marijuana is legalized for use by adults 21 and older.The Senate voted for the measure 40-23. The Assembly cleared the bill by a vote of 100-49. Both chambers’ votes were largely along party lines.“There were many important aspects of this legislation that needed to be addressed correctly — especially the racial disparities that have plagued our state’s response to marijuana use and distribution as well as ensuring public safety — and I am proud that through strong collaboration, we have reached the finish line,” state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) said in a news release.Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has said he will sign the bill, which he negotiated with lawmakers in a handshake deal last week.Once New York’s program is fully rolled out, it’s anticipated to generate tens of thousands of jobs and about $4.2 billion in sales, surpassing Washington state and trailing only California, which had about $4.4 billion in sales last year.‘A Liability’Several lawmakers in both houses, mainly Republicans, brought up concerns with people under the influence of marijuana driving or going to work and using heavy machinery.“This legislation will be a liability,” said state Sen. Mario R. Mattera (R). “Our contractors are against this, the building trades are against this.”Mattera, who voted “no” on the bill, also expressed concern over the dangers of drug use, particularly for youth. He described experiencing this problem in his own family, and called marijuana a “gateway” drug.“This is a disaster waiting to happen,” he said.Taxes, RevenueThe legislation includes two kinds of new taxes: a 13% sales tax, with the money raised divided between the state (9%) and localities (4%), plus a distributor excise tax of as much as 3 cents per milligram of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, using a sliding scale based on the type of product and its potency.Tax revenue would be used to run and oversee the state cannabis program, with the remaining money divided between programs that try to help people rebuild their lives after marijuana possession arrests, as well as their communities. The revenue would also go to education and drug treatment in the state.Cities, towns, and villages would have until the end of this year to opt out from having dispensaries and pot cafes in their communities.Delivery, Pot CafesUp to 3 ounces of cannabis and 24 grams of cannabis concentrate would be legally permitted for personal possession outside of the home. Up to 5 pounds of cannabis will be allowed in a private residence, as long as it’s in a secure location out of the reach of those under age 21, according to the bill.The proposal allows for the personal cultivation of cannabis, with an adult 21 or older permitted to have up to three mature plants and three immature plants. Per household, the limit would be six of each kind of plant. Home cultivation would become legal in six months for medical marijuana patients and legal for others no later than 18 months after the first shops open, dependent upon state regulations.The legislation also would expand eligibility for medical marijuana.The bill would allow pot delivery services, with each licensee able to have the equivalent of up to 25 full-time employees. And it would allow for on-site pot consumption, as long as the cannabis cafes aren’t within 500 feet of a school, or 200 feet from a house of worship.Social Equity, LicensingNew York lawmakers also baked social and economic equity proposals into the legislation.A single company wouldn’t be allowed to handle all parts of a recreational transaction — cultivation, processing, distributing, and dispensing — with the exception of micro businesses. A cultivator or processor would be barred from having a direct or indirect financial interest in a retail dispensary.A state Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management would be required to take small businesses into consideration and prioritize “social and economic equity” applicants from communities disproportionately impacted when marijuana was illegal. Priority for licenses also would go to those who make less than 80% of their county’s median income, and those convicted in the past of a marijuana-related offense.The bill sets a goal of allocating half of the adult-use licenses to a minority- or woman-owned business, distressed farmers, service-disabled veterans, or “social and economic equity” applicants.The state would also create business incubator programs for social equity applicants, make low- and zero-interest loans available to them, and would be permitted to waive their licensing fees, according to the bill.“Passage of this bill will mean not just legalizing marijuana, but investing in education and our communities, and bring to an end decades of disproportionately targeting people of color under state and federal drug laws,” Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D) said in a news release. “Now, this legal industry will create jobs across our state, including for those who have had their lives upended by years of unjust drug laws.”Medical DispensariesCompanies that already have a medical license in New York could have a slight advantage over newcomers when the state opens up to recreational use. There are 10, five of which are among the U.S.’s largest multi-state operators; Acreage Holdings, Columbia Care, Cresco Labs, Curaleaf, and Green Thumb Industries.Adult-use cannabis could be sold at only three of a medical operator’s dispensaries, and they could be able to sell their own products at other retail dispensaries. They could also obtain a license to distribute, cultivate, and process cannabis, but they would only be able allowed to distribute their own products, according to the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-on-way-to-be-2nd-largest-pot-market-in-us-home-growers-to-gain-101617159078689.html
31-03-2021||World||Indian-American Congressman pushes for USD 10-trillion re-industrialisation plan||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has pushed for a massive USD 10 trillion investment plans over a decade to re-industrialise the country.On the eve of President Joe Biden unveiling his economic vision, Khanna, in an interview to 'Fox News' on Tuesday, said there was need for a massive investment to re-industrialise US."What we're saying is, let's at least have consensus on re-industrialising America. That's productive investment," he said. "Up to USD 10 trillion over 10 years to re-industrialise America, so that we're producing batteries here, electric vehicles here, and having critical manufacturing supplies here.""But I do think that we have to pay for it. I mean, we have to pay for most of it. A start would be to actually collect taxes from those who are evading taxes. Larry Summers has a proposal that, if we just enforced the tax on people who aren't paying tax right now, we could collect up to USD 1.2 trillion in 10 years. So, that's what I would say is the first starting point," he said.Responding to a question, Khanna said he was completely opposed to a mileage tax or a gas tax."That hurts working families. That hurts people in rural America who have to commute long distances. I think it would be tone-deaf to have that kind of a tax," he said."What I'm talking about in terms of collecting taxes isn't just going after fraud and abuse. Right now, a lot of business income is not disclosed. If you created a new IRS form that required banks to have the disclosure of input and output in terms of accounts, you would be able to collect a lot more," he added.Khanna supported Biden's move to raise rates on those making over USD 400,000, and raising top marginal rates on them."I would consider a financial transaction tax on speculation. I would rather our money be going to producing batteries. Right now, China is eating our lunch when it comes to lithium ion battery production. They get all of the cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo," he said."Don't we want America producing those lithium ion batteries? Don't we want to be producing the electric vehicles? Don't we want to be producing critical manufacturing supplies? We couldn't even have masks. I mean, in World War II, we armed our entire military," Khanna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-congressman-pushes-for-usd-10-trillion-re-industrialisation-plan-101617156553561.html
31-03-2021||World||'Can't be silent': Biden announces actions to respond to anti-Asian violence||US President Joe Biden has announced additional actions to respond to the violence and xenophobia perpetrated against Asian Americans.The announcements on Tuesday include reinstating and reinvigorating the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), with initial focus on anti-Asian bias and violence"We can't be silent in the face of rising violence against Asian Americans," Biden tweeted. "That's why today I'm taking additional steps to respond-including establishing an initiative at the Department of Justice to address anti-Asian crimes. These attacks are wrong, un-American, and must stop."The announcement also include allocation of USD 49.5 million from the American Rescue Plan to a new grant programme for community-based, culturally-specific services and programmes for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault who face additional barriers, such as language access barriers, to services and safety.Biden, who during his prime time address had said anti-Asian violence and xenophobia was wrong and must stop, also announced to set up a Covid-19 Equity Task Force committee on addressing and ending xenophobia against Asian Americans and establishment of a Department of Justice cross-agency initiative to address anti-Asian violence."A harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us," Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted.The president and "I will not be silent which is why our administration is taking steps to address the rise in violence against the Asian American community, including an initiative to combat anti-Asian violence," Harris said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that in the coming weeks, the administration will meet with AAPI leaders to hear their input in how it can play the most constructive role possible in the community.Biden will name a high-level Asian American member of the AAPI community to a position in the White House, she said."That's something we're working to do through consultation with a range of officials and elected officials as well. That person will be a commissioned officer and will be working on both policy and outreach," Psaki said."A big part of our effort has also been on taking actions to address the rise in anti-Asian violence and bias, and underscoring the commitment of our entire administration to working in partnership with the AAPI community," she said."The President announced that DOJ has launched an agency-wide initiative to address anti-Asian hate crimes and acts of violence. DOJ is taking steps to strengthen hate crimes data, reporting on AAPI violence, improve law enforcement training so that local law enforcement agencies can better identify anti-Asian bias," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-be-silent-biden-announces-actions-to-respond-to-anti-asian-violence-101617156532701.html

31-03-2021||World||WHO chief toughens tone on China with lab probe call||The WHO's chief, long accused of complacency towards Beijing, hardened his tone Tuesday, urging further investigation into a theory Covid-19 sprang from a laboratory leak.The director-general of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also rebuked China for sitting on key data.The theory that the new coronavirus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, the Chinese city where it was first detected in humans in December 2019, was a US favourite under former president Donald Trump.China has always flatly rejected the hypothesis.And the team of international experts sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization earlier this year to probe the pandemic's origins have also all but ruled it out.Their long-delayed report, written alongside the team's Chinese counterparts and published Tuesday, ranked four hypotheses in order of probability.They said the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 disease most probably jumped from bats to humans via an intermediary animal, judging a lab leak to be an "extremely unlikely" source.But Tedros said Tuesday the probe into Wuhan's virology labs had not gone far enough, adding that he was prepared to launch a fresh investigation."I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough," he told the UN health agency's 194 member states, in a briefing on the Covid origins report."Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions," he said."Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy."- More data call -Tedros also urged China to be more forthcoming with data -- a call echoed by several countries led by the United States, Britain and Japan.Tedros said the Wuhan mission found that the first detected case had symptom onset on December 8, 2019 -- but to understand the earliest cases, scientists would benefit from full access to data stretching back to at least September 2019.The team "expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data. I expect future collaborative studies to include more timely and comprehensive data sharing," said Tedros.Hitherto, the WHO chief has faced allegations throughout the pandemic of being too close to China -- notably from the former Trump administration, which zeroed in on the lab leak theory.Peter Ben Embarek, who led the international mission to Wuhan, said the report had "only scratched the surface" in the quest to find the origins of the pandemic, which has killed nearly 2.8 million people and battered the global economy.The WHO food safety expert said he was "optimistic" the team would discover more "and get closer to the final answer".- Lab leak 'first reaction'On the laboratory accident hypothesis, the Danish scientist said the natural initial reaction to the outbreak of the virus, in a city housing virology labs, was to make the connection between the two."Even the staff in these labs told us that was their first reaction," Ben Embarek told journalists Tuesday."They all went back to their records... but nobody could find any trace of something similar to this virus in their records or their samples."Nobody has been able to pick up any firm arguments or proof or evidence that any of these labs would have been involved in a lab leak accident."That said, Ben Embarek added: "we haven't done a full investigation or audit of any of the labs."He said there had been hours of discussions with laboratory staff and management. The documentation seen by the team had not led them to believe there was anything further left to explore.But the balance of the hypotheses could be reassessed as further leads come in, he added.The United States, Japan, Canada, South Korea, Australia, Israel, Britain and seven other European countries issued a joint statement voicing concerns that the investigation "was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples".Independent experts needed "full access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, research, and personnel", they said.China's foreign ministry said in a statement: "Actions politicising this search for the origins will only seriously hinder global cooperation in this regard, undermine the global anti-epidemic efforts and cause more loss of life."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-toughens-tone-on-china-with-lab-probe-call-101617153971298.html
31-03-2021||World||In Photos: Cautious appreciation as Japan's famous cherry blossoms bloom early||The cherry blossom season which is regarded as the traditional sign of spring in Japan, peaked at the earliest this year since formal records began around 1,200 years ago. The blossoms, which are called ‘sakura’ in Japanese, used to reach peak bloom in April. According to scientists, early flowerings are likely to be connected to climate change. In Kyoto, which experienced a warmer spring this year, the season peaked on March 26, according to data collated by the Osaka University. Similar patterns were seen in more than 12 cities across the country.Traditional importance of ‘sakura’The appearance of the blossoming of sakura has tremendous importance in Japan’s culture. Due to their nature of blooming en masse, they symbolise clouds, which is considered a metaphor for the transitory nature of life. Moreover, the trees bloom for a very short duration, about two weeks each year from first bud to all the blossoms falling off, a reflection of the ephemeral nature of beauty.The concept of awareness of the transience of things, which is called mono no aware in Japanese, is extremely pertinent to the country’s culture. Due to their importance in Japanese culture, the cherry blossoms are used in Japanese art, films and even represented on consumer goods.Earliest peak bloomEach year, the progress of the cherry blossom season is monitored in Japan by the country’s meteorological agency. This year, the cherry blossoms reached their earliest peak bloom ever based on formal records.The meteorological agency tracks 58 cherry trees across the country and this year 40 of the trees tracked have already reached peak bloom according to the agency. The agency also said that 14 of 40 trees have reached peak bloom in record time.“We can say it’s most likely because of the impact of global warming,” said Shunji Anbe, an official at the observations division at the Japan meteorological agency according to news agency Reuters.According to data provided by the agency, average temperature in Kyoto in March rose to 10.6 degrees Celsius (51.1 F) in 2020 from 8.6 C (47.5 F) in 1953, which is being considered as the major reason for the early peak blossoms.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-photos-cautious-appreciation-as-japan-s-famous-cherry-blossoms-bloom-early-101617154131820.html
31-03-2021||World||World leaders eye global deal to tackle outbreaks||Leaders of 23 countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday backed a plan to create an international treaty that would help the world deal with future health emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic.The idea of such a treaty, which would ensure equitable access to vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for pandemics, was floated by the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, at a G20 summit last November. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom then endorsed the idea at its governing body meeting in January, but formal negotiations haven’t begun, say diplomats.On Tuesday, the treaty proposal got the backing of the leaders of Fiji, Portugal, Romania, Britain, Rwanda, Kenya, France, Germany, Greece, South Korea, Chile, Costa Rica, Albania, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, the Netherlands, Tunisia, Senegal, Spain, Norway, Serbia, Indonesia, Ukraine and also the WHO.“There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone,” the leaders wrote in an opinion article in major newspapers. “We believe that nations should work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response.”Canada, meanwhile, has halted the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for people below 55, while Germany has paused its use for those under 60 due to concerns over blood clots, although a link is yet to be established.Pakistan’s top leadership has been hit by the coronavirus with President Arif Alvi and defence minister Pervez Khattak contracting the disease, just days after Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife tested positive for Covid-19.On Monday, Alvi tweeted that he had tested positive for the disease. “I have tested positive for Covid-19... Had the first dose of the vaccine, but antibodies started developing after the second dose that was due in a week,” he said. The exact date when Alvi, 71, contracted the disease was not made public.Sindh governor Imran Ismail tweeted that defence minister Khattak, 71, had also tested positive. PM Khan, 68, tested positive for the virus on March 20. His wife Bushra Bibi also tested positive the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-eye-global-deal-to-tackle-outbreaks-101617154110060.html
31-03-2021||World||‘I witnessed a murder’, recalls man at trial over Floyd’s death||Prosecutors in the trial of the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd have begun their case by calling several people who witnessed Floyd’s arrest on May 25, 2020 for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill.During the witness testimony, prosecutors played videos of the arrest to the jury taken from multiple angles, including teenager Darnella Frazier’s video that shows Derek Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for about nine minutes. Frazier, 18, said she began recording because “he was suffering, he was in pain”.Frazier grew emotional at times, breathing heavily and crying as she viewed pictures of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd. “I knew it was wrong. We all knew it was wrong,” she said.Donald Williams, 33, who was among the onlookers said he called 911 after paramedics took Floyd away. The 911 call Williams made after the arrest was played to the jury.Williams dabbed his eyes with a tissue as his distressed voice filled the room. “I believe I witnessed a murder,” Williams told the jury. “So I felt I needed to call the police on the police.”The footage, which prosecutors say show excessive force, led to one of the largest protest movements seen in the United States in decades. Many have held up Floyd’s death as an example of the brutality they say is routinely doled out by US law enforcement in encounters with people of colour.Lawyers for Chauvin, 45, argue that the policeman followed his training and is not guilty of the charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder or second-degree manslaughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-witnessed-a-murder-recalls-man-at-trial-over-floyd-s-death-101617153766662.html
31-03-2021||World||Pandemic delays gender parity by a generation: World Economic Forum||The pandemic has rolled back years of progress towards equality between men and women, according a report Wednesday showing the crisis had added decades to the trajectory towards closing the gender gap.A range of studies have shown that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women, who have lost jobs at a higher rate than men, and had to take on much more of the extra childcare burden when schools closed.The effects will be felt in the long-term, according to the World Economic Forum, which in its annual Global Gender Gap Report found that the goalposts for gender parity appeared to be moving further away.The organisation, which usually gathers the global elite in the plush Swiss ski resort of Davos each year, had found in its previous report, published in December 2019 right before the pandemic hit, that gender parity across a range of areas would be reached within 99.5 years.But this year's report shows the world is not on track to close the gender gap for another 135.6 years."Another generation of women will have to wait for gender parity," the WEF said in a statement.The Geneva-based organisation's annual report tracks disparities between the sexes in 156 countries across four areas: education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment.Workplace equality in 267 years On the plus side, women appear to be gradually closing the gender gap in areas such as health and education.But inequality in the workplace -- which has long appeared to be the stickiest area to fix -- is still not expected to be erased for another 267.6 years.And the pandemic has not helped.The WEF pointed to a study by the UN's International Labour Organization showing that women were more likely to lose their jobs in the crisis, in part because they are disproportionately represented in sectors directly disrupted by lockdowns.Other surveys have shown that women were carrying a greater share of the burden of increased housework and childcare during lockdowns, contributing to higher stress and lower productivity levels.Women were also being hired back at a slower rate than men as workplaces opened up again, according to LinkedIn data referenced in the report."The pandemic has fundamentally impacted gender equality in both the workplace and the home, rolling back years of progress," WEF managing director Saadia Zahidi said in the statement."If we want a dynamic future economy, it is vital for women to be represented in the jobs of tomorrow," she said, stressing that "this is the moment to embed gender parity by design into the recovery."Political gender gap growing It was in the political sphere that the march towards gender parity did the biggest about-face, with several large-population countries seeing the political gender gap widen, the WEF study found.Women still hold just over a quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide, and only 22.6 percent of ministerial positions.On its current trajectory, the political gender gap is not expected to close completely for another 145.5 years, the report found.That marks a 50-percent hike from the estimated 95 years in the 2020 report, WEF pointed out.Progress across the categories varies greatly in different countries and regions.The report pointed out that while Western European countries could close their overall gender gap in 52.1 years, countries in the Middle East and North Africa will take nearly 142.4 years to do so.Overall, the Nordic countries once again dominated the top of the table: the gap between men and women was narrowest in Iceland, for the 12th year running, followed by Finland and Norway.New Zealand took fourth place, ahead of Sweden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-delays-gender-parity-by-a-generation-world-economic-forum-101617151301581.html
31-03-2021||World||Biden administration declares Chinese actions in Xinjiang as 'genocide'||Amid escalating tensions with Beijing, the Biden administration on Tuesday (local time) declared Chinese actions against the Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang as 'genocide'.In a 2020 report on Human rights practices: China released on Tuesday, the US Department of State said: "Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang".Also Read: Canadian PM Trudeau slams Chinese sanctions over Xinjiang as ‘unacceptable’Former US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo first officially declared genocide in Xinjiang during the waning days of the Donald Trump administration. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken affirmed Pompeo's assessment during his confirmation hearing, but the word's inclusion into Tuesday's report formalizes the outlook as an official U.S. government assessment, Washington Post reported.The State Department said the crime includes the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians; forced sterilization, coerced abortions, and more restrictive application of China's birth control policies; rape; torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained; forced labour; and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement.The state department said Chinese government officials and the security services often committed human rights abuses with impunity."Authorities often announced investigations following cases of reported killings by police but did not announce results or findings of police malfeasance or disciplinary action," the report stated.The report has come amid heightening tensions between western countries and China. The recent escalation of tensions began after the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for atrocities against Uyghurs."There were numerous reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. In many instances few or no details were available," the state department read.Also Read: Chinese digital art mocks Western criticism of labour conditions in XinjiangIn Xinjiang, the state department said that there were reports of custodial deaths related to detentions in the internment camps and there were multiple reports from Uyghur family members who discovered their relatives had died while in internment camps or within weeks of their release.The State Department also highlighted an example of Abdulghafur Hapiz, an Uyghur man who was detained in a Xinjiang internment camp since 2017. Hapiz's death was formally confirmed by the Chinese government to the United Nations in October.The government claimed Hapiz died in 2018 of "severe pneumonia and tuberculosis." His daughter said she last heard from Hapiz in 2016; sources reported he disappeared no later than 2017 and was held without charges in an internment camp.According to the report, the government conducted mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang.China Human Rights Defenders alleged these detentions amounted to enforced disappearance since families were often not provided information about the length or location of the detention, the report read.The report noted that the authorities in Wuhan disappeared four citizen journalists, Chen Qiushi, Li Zehua, Zhang Zhan, and Fang Bin, who had interviewed health-care professionals and citizens and later publicized their accounts on social media in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown in Wuhan.While Li Zehua was released in April, Fang Bin's and Chen Qiushi's whereabouts were unknown at year's end. Zhang Zhan was indicted on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," and authorities tried and convicted her on December 28, sentencing her to four years' imprisonment. She was the first known person to be tried and convicted for her coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.Human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who has been disappeared on multiple occasions, has been missing since 2017."Using the term genocide in the report indicates profound concern in the administration about appalling Chinese government human rights violations against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other Turkic communities," Washington Post quoted Sophie Richardson, a China expert at Human Rights Watch, as saying.The move may also put further pressure on the Biden administration to punish China for its alleged actions. "The next step is to map out a strategy to back an independent investigation, gather evidence, and pursue accountability," Richardson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-declares-chinese-actions-in-xinjiang-as-genocide-101617150318065.html

Biden is opting not to renew it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision hasn’t been announced. The White House declined to comment.Biden’s decision will please business groups, which had pressured the administration to lift the ban ever since the new president took office. Executives have grown frustrated that the directive was not immediately revoked, arguing it hurt US companies.Trump’s restrictions on guest-worker visas, which also covered non-agricultural seasonal laborers, au pairs and others, had been under review by the Biden administration.Biden last month withdrew a related Trump executive order that stopped the issuance of new green cards, citing the pandemic -- a move that drastically cut legal immigration to the U.S. Trump had argued the policies were necessary to protect the American economy as it emerged from the pandemic-induced recession.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” Biden said in a presidential proclamation at the time. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.”The ban on guest-worker visas was not revoked at the same time. Temporary work visas are unpopular with labor unions and other worker groups who argue that they put American workers at a disadvantage to their foreign counterparts.Despite the Trump administration’s extension of the visa ban at the end of 2020, opponents of the restrictions had already found some success in court.A federal judge in California granted a preliminary injunction on Oct. 1 in a lawsuit brought by several large business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Chamber of Commerce. The groups argued Trump exceeded his authority by imposing immigration restrictions in his June 22 proclamation.The Trump Justice Department appealed that ruling to the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In February, the appellate court requested a status report from the parties by April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-let-trump-s-h1-b-visa-ban-expire-in-win-for-tech-firms-101617148136103.html

The attack wounded 20 people, including four church guards, and broke windows at the church and nearby buildings in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province.A Security Council press statement denounced the attack as a “reprehensible” act of terrorism and reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation.”The council reaffirmed the need for all countries to combat “threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-condemns-palm-sunday-terrorist-act-on-indonesian-church-101617147672047.html
31-03-2021||World||'Major' pain: Biden's dog involved in 2nd biting incident||President Joe Biden's younger dog Major this week was involved in his second biting incident of the month, the White House said Tuesday.The dog "nipped someone while on a walk" on Monday, said Michael LaRosa, press secretary to first lady Jill Biden, adding that the dog “is still adjusting to his new surroundings." The individual was seen by the White House Medical Unit “out of an abundance of caution” and returned to work without injury, LaRosa added.The dog had been seen by reporters on a walk around the White House South Lawn before the president and first lady traveled to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial early Monday evening.The german shepherd only just returned to the White House last week, along with his sibling Champ, after causing a minor injury to an employee of the U.S. Secret Service on March 8.After that incident, the president said Major was “a sweet dog.” In an interview with ABC News, Biden explained the biting by saying that the dog had “turned a corner, there’s two people he doesn’t know at all, you know, and they move and moves to protect.”Biden added at the time that “85% of the people there love him.”Major, a 3-year-old rescue dog, and Champ, who is 12, were moved to the Bidens’ Delaware home after the incident. The president said Major was being trained in Delaware but disputed the idea that the pup had been sent away after the incident. He said the dogs went to Wilmington because the first couple was going to be out of town.“He was going home,” Biden said. “I didn’t banish him to home. Jill was going to be away for four days. I was going to be away for two, so we took him home.”The dogs met the Bidens two weekends ago at Camp David in Maryland and came back to Washington on March 21. Last week, one of the two German shepherds waited on the balcony of the White House as Marine One landed on the South Lawn, having ferried the president back from a speech in Columbus, Ohio.“The dogs will come and go and it will not be uncommon for them to head back to Delaware on occasion as the president and first lady often do as well,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.This week's biting incident was first reported by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-pain-biden-s-dog-involved-in-2nd-biting-incident-101617148204187.html
31-03-2021||World||UN takes no action on latest North Korea missile tests||The UN Security Council took no action after a brief meeting Tuesday on North Korea’s latest ballistic missile tests, the first since US President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20 and a violation of UN sanctions.Council diplomats said all 15 members encouraged dialogue and negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program but disagreed on the need for a statement. Last Friday, the council unanimously adopted a resolution to renew the mandate of UN experts monitoring sanctions against the North. Hours earlier, the 15 council members discussed Pyongyang’s latest test firings at a sanctions committee meeting.On Tuesday, Russia and China both mentioned their proposed December 2019 resolution, UN diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. It would terminate sanctions on North Korean exports such as textiles, seafood and statues, “with the intent of enhancing the livelihood of the civilian population.”The Russia-China draft resolution has languished, and whether the Security Council takes any action remains to be seen.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told a group of reporters Tuesday “it’s still a time of assessment” of the recent missile tests.US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday the Biden administration is looking at “additional actions” that the United Nations might take to respond to the latest tests, but she wasn’t specific about what those actions might entail.Last week, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in defiance of UN resolutions banning such launches. Some experts said the launches, the first of their kind in a year, were aimed at applying pressure on the Biden administration which is finalizing a review on how to approach the reclusive north Asian nation.On Monday, North Korea accused the UN of a “double standard” over its reaction to the launches, warning of serious consequences.France’s UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere tweeted Tuesday: “Today at the Security Council, I recalled that North Korea’s recent ballistic missile launches violate Security Council resolutions. The continued development of #NKorea’s missiles and nuclear programs constitutes a major threat to international peace and security.”US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recently returned from Tokyo and Seoul, said Monday the US, Japan and South Korea are united in dealing with the challenges posed by Pyongyang.“What we’re seeing from Pyongyang in terms of these provocations does nothing to shake the resolve of our three countries along with allies and partners around the world to approach North Korea from a position of strength in order to diminish the threat that it poses to the region and beyond,” Blinken said.Past short-range missile launches by North Korea have typically drawn UN Security Council condemnations, but not fresh sanctions.North Korea has been hit with increasingly tough sanctions since its first nuclear test in 2006. The latest rounds in 2017 responded to its first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States and its sixth and strongest nuclear test.The sanctions have banned key exports including coal and the import of an estimated 90 percent of refined oil products including diesel and kerosene which are key to its economy. UN experts monitoring the sanctions have reported widespread violations by North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-takes-no-action-on-latest-north-korea-missile-tests-101617148284036.html
31-03-2021||World||Brazil military chiefs quit as Bolsonaro seeks their support||The leaders of all three branches of Brazil’s armed forces jointly resigned Tuesday following President Jair Bolsonaro's replacement of the defense minister, causing widespread apprehension of a military shakeup to serve the president's political interests.The Defense Ministry reported the resignations — apparently unprecedented since at least the end of military rule 36 years ago — in a statement released without giving reasons. Replacements were not named. But analysts expressed fears the president, increasingly under pressure, was moving to assert greater control over the military.“Since 1985, we haven’t had news of such clear intervention of the president with regard to the armed forces,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo.Bolsonaro, a conservative former army captain who has often praised Brazil's former period of military dictatorship, has relied heavily on current and former soldiers to staff key Cabinet positions since taking office in January 2019, but Melo said the military itself has so far refrained from politics.“Will this resistance continue? That’s the question,” Melo said.The announcement came after the heads of the army, navy and air force met with the new defense minister, Gen. Walter Souza Braga Netto, on Tuesday morning.Braga Netto's first statement on the new job showed he is alligned with Bolsonaro's views for the armed forces. The incoming defense minister, unlike his predecessor, celebrated the 1964-1985 military dictatorship that killed and tortured thousands of Brazilians.“The armed forces ended taking the responsibility of pacifying the country, facing the challenges to reorganize it and secure the democratic liberties that today we enjoy,” said Braga Netto, who did not discuss the departure of the military chiefs. “The 1964 movement is part of Brazil's historic trajectory. And as such the events of that March 31st must be understood and celebrated.”A retired army general who has a relationship with the three commanders as well as with Braga Netto told The Associated Press that “there was an embarrassing circumstance so they all resigned.” He agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name, expressing fear of retribution.Bolsonaro on Monday carried out a shake-up of top Cabinet positions that was initially seen as a response to demands for a course correction by lawmakers, diplomats and economists, particularly over his handling of the pandemic that has caused more than 300,000 deaths in Brazil.That included the replacement of Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva, who said in his resignation letter that he had “preserved the armed forces as state institutions,” a nod at his effort to keep generals out of politics.Bolsonaro has often bristled at the checks and balances imposed by other branches of government and has attended protests targeting the Supreme Court and Congress.He has also criticized the Supreme Court for upholding local governments’ rights to adopt pandemic restrictions that he adamantly opposes, arguing that the economic effects are worse than the disease itself.His recent slide in popularity, and the sudden likelihood that he will face leftist former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2022 presidential election, has analysts saying he is looking to the armed forces for support.Retired Gen. Carlos Alberto Santos Cruz, who previously served as Bolsonaro’s government secretary, appeared to refer to such concerns when he responded to early rumors of military resignations with a tweet saying, “THE ARMED FORCES WON’T GO ON AN ADVENTURE.”Since Brazil’s return to democracy in 1985, the armed forces have tried to keep a distance from partisan political quarrels.“The government has to give explanations to the population about the change in the Defense Ministry,” Santos Cruz added.Sen. Kátia Abreu, who heads the Senate's foreign relations commission, said it would be “prudent” for the new defense to minister speak to “calm the nation down about the impossibility of a military intervention."“I have a conviction that we built a strong democracy. The armed forces are part of the Brazilian state and they have the confidence of all of us,” said Abreu, a right-leaning Bolsonaro critic.Earlier this month, Bolsonaro began mentioning the armed forces in connection with his dispute with state governors and mayors over restrictive measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Latin America’s largest nation.“My army doesn’t go to the street to force people to stay at home,” Bolsonaro told reporters March 19.Thomas Traumann, an independent political analyst, told AP that it was the first time in living memory that all leaders of the armed forces had quit simultaneously.“He wants people who will do whatever he wants, and so it is extremely risky,” Traumann said. “He can put the army out to allow people to go to work. So the army would be in his hands, and not in the hands of the generals.”Bolsonaro saw his popularity rise last year, thanks to a generous pandemic welfare aid program. That popularity has dropped since the program ended in December, and there have been renewed protests against him as the nation's daily death toll surged to the highest in the world.Further clouding the outlook for Bolsonaro is the reemergence of da Silva after a Supreme Court justice annulled two corruption convictions and restored his political rights. Early polls indicate he would be a formidable challenger in next year’s election.In other Cabinet changes, Bolsonaro replaced Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, who was accused by some of impeding the supply of vaccines by making comments seen as insulting to the Chinese and by not aggressively seeking sources.Earlier this month, Bolsonaro also replaced his health minister, active-duty army Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, the third health minister to leave office since the beginning of the pandemic. Pazuello's tenure coincided with most of Brazil’s 317,000 COVID-19 deaths.On Tuesday, Brazil’s health ministry said a new daily high of 3,780 deaths related to COVID-19 had been registered in the previous 24 hours. The previous high of 3,650 deaths was recorded Friday.___Associated Press writer Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-military-chiefs-quit-as-bolsonaro-seeks-their-support-101617147619096.html
31-03-2021||World||Ever Given: Ship freed at last, probe begins into Suez drama||In the end, it took roughly six days and seven hours to undo the minutes of drama that exposed the vulnerability of global trade and captivated the world. It may take longer to figure out how to avoid it happening again.At just after 3 pm local time on Monday, the Ever Given was dislodged from a sand bank in the Suez Canal by tugboats pushing and pulling to rock it loose. To cheers from the dozens of crew working on the effort to refloat it and relief among Egyptian authorities, the enormous 21st century container ship that got stuck in a waterway first opened in 1869 was free. The backlog of about 400 ships started moving that evening.“Despite the difficult situation we’ve confronted, Egyptians stood beside their leadership and their country and endured the crises and registered their joy,” President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi declared at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Osama Rabie, the chief executive of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).Also read | Suez Canal races to clear shipping backlog at crucial maritime trade routeDutch company Boskalis, which played a key role in the rescue operation, said its “team of experts, working in close collaboration with the Suez Canal Authority, successfully refloated” the ship at 3:05 pm local time. The operation, carried out under time pressure and “the watchful eye of the world”, required 13 tug boats and the dredging of some 30,000 cubic meters of sand, said Peter Berdowski, CEO of Boskalis.The freed vessel was travelling north toward the Great Bitter Lake, through which the canal passes, “for an inspection of its seaworthiness,” said the Taiwan company Evergreen which operates the ship. “The outcome of that inspection will determine whether the ship can resume its scheduled service.”‘Enormous complexity’There could be significant damage to the ship, Capt John Konrad, the founder and CEO of the shipping news website gcaptain.com, said. Stuck for days across the canal, the ship’s middle rose and fell with the tide, bending up and down under the tremendous weight of some 20,000 containers across its 400-meter (quarter-mile) length. On Monday, when workers partially floated the ship, all that pressure came forward to its bow.Salvage crews have been working around the clock ever since the accident which has been blamed on high winds and poor visibility during a sandstorm, although the canal authority also cited the possibility of human error.There will be questions about speed, whether the Ever Given should have employed tugs and if it should have braved the journey through the wind at all. Egyptian investigators, led by a canal authority committee, will analyse recordings from the deck, including conversations among crew.When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted. Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly become an international morass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ever-given-ship-freed-at-last-probe-begins-into-suez-drama-101617139640094.html
31-03-2021||World||Germany imposes restrictions on AstraZeneca Covid-19 jabs for people below 60 years age||Germany will deploy AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine for general use only for over-60 year olds, ministers decided Tuesday, imposing restrictions for younger people after several severe clotting cases.Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following "consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis," said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears.Germany's decision came after the vaccine commission known as STIKO recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of "currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects" in younger vaccinated people.It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said.Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation.The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people.Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday.Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week.On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s "pending further analysis".The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride.Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright, and more than a dozen EU nations suspended shots in mid-March before most recommenced rollouts, albeit with a patchwork of age restrictions.France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s.Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-imposes-restrictions-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-jabs-for-people-below-60-years-age-101617132538724.html
31-03-2021||World||Turkey reimposes restrictions after sharp rise in Covid-19 infections||Turkey is re-introducing weekend lockdowns in most of its provinces and will also impose restrictions over the Muslim holy month of Ramadan following a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases.Infections in Turkey have soared less than a month after authorities divided the 81 provinces into four color-coded categories and relaxed restrictions in some provinces under a “controlled normalization” effort.The number of infections hit a record on Tuesday, with the Health Ministry confirming 37,303 new cases in the past 24 hours. The country of nearly 84 million also reported 155 deaths on Tuesday, up from around 65 at the start of the month.In a televised address following a Cabinet meeting late Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 58 out of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including Istanbul and Ankara, were now designated as “red” or “very high-risk” areas and would be subjected to lockdowns on both Saturdays and Sundays.Nighttime curfews that are in place across the country would continue, he said.Only 17 provinces were in the “red” category on March 2, when schools partially resumed face-to-face education, cafes and restaurants were allowed to operate at half-capacity and weekend curfews were eased in several cities.“The increase in the number of cases and patients as well as the increase in the number of deaths, is forcing us to review the existing measures,” Erdogan said in an address to the nation. “The number of our provinces which are in the red category, which constitutes the very high-risk category, has reached 58 — representing 80% of the population.”“We will have to make some sacrifices during the month of Ramadan,” he said, adding that restaurants and cafes would be allowed to serve takeout food only during the holy month, which starts on April 13 in Turkey.Mass gatherings for Ramadan meals held before sunrise and after sunset would be barred, he also announced.The Turkish Medical Association meanwhile, blamed the increase in infections on inadequate contact-tracing, the government's reluctance to impose measures in a timely manner out of economic concerns as well as the premature relaxing of the restrictions.“We, as healthcare professionals and society, are paying for these wrong policies,” the group said on Twitter.Erdogan has come under intense criticism for holding his ruling party’s congresses inside packed sport complexes across the country, despite a new surge of Covid-19 cases. He has been accused of double standards for disregarding the government’s own social distancing rules. In one such event, Erdogan boasted about the size of the crowds.Critics say the political rallies have likely contributed to the surge. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca told reporters Tuesday that he saw no benefit in “keeping the issue on the agenda.”Variants of the initial coronavirus now account for around 75% of the cases in Turkey, he said.The minister also said Turkey has received 2.8 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine and is set to receive 1.7 million more within the next 10 days.Turkey rolled out its inoculation program in January with the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac company. More than 15 million shots have been administered so far. Around 6.7 million people have received two doses.The total number of infections in the country since the start of the outbreak last year stands at more than 3.2 million. The Covid-19 death toll has reached more than 31,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-reimposes-restrictions-after-sharp-rise-in-covid-19-infections-101617132210836.html
31-03-2021||World||State police to probe Virginia Beach police shooting||Virginia Beach police have turned over their investigation of an officer-involved shooting of a former college football player to Virginia State Police after the Black man's death amid a rash of weekend shootings drew heightened public scrutiny.Donovon W. Lynch, 25, was shot by a Virginia Beach police officer in the last of three separate shooting incidents along the city’s popular oceanfront strip of hotels and restaurants. The shootings left one other person dead and eight others wounded.The case has drawn calls for a thorough and transparent investigation from such figures as Grammy-winning musician Pharrell Williams, who says Lynch was his cousin.“The Lynch family and the involved officer each deserve a comprehensive and thorough investigation into this incident, and we appreciate the public's patience as we pursue every facet of it,” Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said in a statement Tuesday.Both Lynch and the police officer who shot him are Black. That officer and another officer who saw Lynch's shooting have both said that Lynch had a handgun, police said Monday.The city's police department also said that a “separate, independent witness corroborated that Mr. Lynch was in possession of a handgun" earlier that evening. But the body camera worn by the officer who shot Lynch had not been activated for "unknown reasons,” according to police. said.“We would like to provide the community answers," the police chief said Saturday. “At this point we do not have them.”Neudigate said his department on Monday formally requested that state police take the investigation.That same day, Williams told his 10 million Twitter followers that Lynch was his cousin.“It is critical my family and the other victims’ families get the transparency they deserve. VA Beach is the epitome of hope and we will get through this,” said the singer, songwriter and producer. Williams is also a Virginia Beach native.Lynch, who lived in the coastal city, was an offensive lineman for the University of Virginia’s College at Wise during the 2017 and 2018 seasons and a 2019 graduate of the school.The officer who shot Lynch has been placed on administrative leave, police said. He has been with the department for five years and is assigned to its special operations division.The Virginia Beach chapter of the NAACP said in a statement Sunday that it wasn't surprised that the officer's body camera wasn't turned on. It said its members are "watching and listening for the department’s inquiry into this shooting and expect a thorough and expeditious report. The community is waiting!”Virginia House Del. Jay Jones, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, has called for the state AG to investigate.“We need far better accountability and transparency, and the families of those killed by police, in Virginia Beach and across this country, deserve answers,” Jones said Sunday.Lynch's shooting was one of three separate shooting incidents that police said occurred within minutes of each other along Virginia Beach's oceanfront.Police said a gun battle broke out late Friday night from what appeared to be a fight involving a group of people. Several people were wounded by gunfire in the densely packed area, and three men have been arrested. Each faces seven counts of malicious wounding, among other charges.Also killed in a separate weekend shooting was Deshayla E. Harris, 28, of Norfolk. Investigators said they believe Harris was likely a bystander struck by stray gunfire. No arrests were immediately made in her death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/state-police-to-probe-virginia-beach-police-shooting-101617131771339.html
31-03-2021||World||14 countries express ‘shared concerns’ over WHO report on Covid-19 origins||A group of 14 countries including the US, Britain, Japan, Australia and Canada has expressed “shared concerns” with a WHO-backed study on the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak in China and said they supported a “independent analysis and evaluation, free from interference and undue influence” of the pandemic.They also said the report was “significantly delayed” and added that it “lacked access to complete, original data and samples”, pointing to a lack of cooperation and transparency from China, with naming it.They did not, however, directly reject the report and said they remained committed to working with the World Health Organization.“Together, we support a transparent and independent analysis and evaluation, free from interference and undue influence, of the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the 14 countries said in a joint statement.The countries are Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, South Korea, Slovenia, Britain and the US.“In this regard, we join in expressing shared concerns regarding the recent WHO-convened study in China, while at the same time reinforcing the importance of working together towards the development and use of a swift, effective, transparent, science-based and independent process for international evaluations of such outbreaks of unknown origin in the future,” they added.The report released earlier on Tuesday suggests the deadly virus jumped from bats to other animals to humans. Interestingly, it discounts as “extremely unlikely” the possibility that the coronavirus escaped from a lab - a theory that many experts believe, including Robert Redfield, former US head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Noting the WHO’s mission to advance global health security, the 14 countries expressed full support for its staff and experts, saying that “with such an important mandate, it is equally essential that we voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the Sars-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples”.They added that “there must now be a renewed commitment by the WHO and all member states to access, transparency and timeliness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-countries-express-shared-concerns-over-who-report-on-covid-19-origins-101617128030086.html
31-03-2021||World||China tightens grip on Hong Kong with sweeping electoral shake-up||China on Tuesday approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong’s electoral system, tightening Beijing’s control over the city and cutting down democratic representation in the financial hub.Chinese President Xi Jinping signed presidential orders to formalise the Hong Kong electoral reform plan on Tuesday.“The goal of the overhaul is to make sure that the bodies of power in Hong Kong are run by patriots,” state media reported, adding that it was another major step in tackling the “loopholes in the city’s governance structure”.The changes to the electoral system essentially mean lawmakers standing for elections in Hong Kong have to be vetted for their loyalty to the mainland, thereby ensuring that only “patriotic” candidates run for office in the special administrative region (SAR).It could mean the end of opposition and democracy in the city, critics have warned about the sweeping changes.As a result of the changes, the number of seats in Hong Kong’s legislature will be increased from 70 to 90.Only 20 seats will be set aside for direct elections. Of the remaining seats, 40 will be chosen by a pro-Beijing election committee that currently selects Hong Kong’s chief executive and 30 will be picked by groups representing various professions and interests.The number of members on the election committee responsible for selecting the chief executive will go up from 1,200 to 1,500.Also read | India-China border row: Air forces hold formation in LadakhAlso, 117 seats previously given to community district councillors - who are elected directly by the public and deal with local issues - will be replaced by government-appointed positions.The changes follow the imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong last year, which has been criticised as draconian and said to have been brought in to crush anti-Beijing dissent.Beijing moved with speed to bring in the changes to get rid of what the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) thought were “loopholes and deficiencies” threatening national security during the pro-democracy protests in 2019.Beijing’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), had approved the plan during its annual session earlier in March.On Tuesday, news agency Xinhua reported that the country’s top decision-making body, the NPC standing committee, voted unanimously to pass it.The move amends the annexes of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the “Basic Law”.Under the changed system, a candidate qualification review committee of the SAR has been set up to vet and confirm the qualifications of candidates for the election committee members, the Chief Executive, and the legislative council members, Xinhua reported.The powerful vetting committee will monitor candidates for public office and work with national security authorities to ensure they are loyal to Beijing.Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, and the Basic Law was created under the “one country, two systems” principle. It had given the city more freedoms than the mainland, including freedom of speech, which are supposed to remain intact until 2047.China firmly believes the electoral reform and the earlier national security law for Hong Kong, as well as other potential reforms that could take place in the future, are “the right things to do and must be done”, whether the West likes them or not, analysts told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tightens-grip-on-hong-kong-with-sweeping-electoral-shakeup-101617103429344.html
31-03-2021||World||The Taliban is at its strongest since 2001. This needs a clear US response||With the May 1 deadline for an expected United States (US) military withdrawal from Afghanistan a little less than a month away, multiple avenues of diplomacy have been launched as the administration of President Joe Biden in Washington DC navigates the future of the US involvement in the 20-year-long war in the country.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s proposal made to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, made public via a leaked letter, has only added more to the complexities. Blinken’s curtly written outreach to Kabul has suggested a regional approach, involving Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and India to help in bringing the Afghan crisis to some sort of conclusion. On the other hand, Moscow convened its own roundtable, attended by both the Afghan government and the Taliban, along with stakeholders such as Iran, China, Pakistan and the US. New Delhi, notably, was missing, having not been invited due to its self-designed diplomatic and political distance from the Taliban.Also Read | Taliban threaten to re-target foreign troops if May 1 withdrawal deadline missedAs these events unravelled, India and Pakistan also announced their own ceasefire along the border regions. The ceasefire, which according to some reports was brokered by the United Arab Emirates, is also being seen from the lens of a broader regional architecture that the Biden administration is promoting to attain a viable US exit from the conflict, hedging its own risks at the 11th hour by magnifying some of the regional issues that have also played a latent yet significant role in exacerbating the turmoil in Afghanistan. And this includes the India-Pakistan rivalry, where Islamabad fears an over-reaching Indian hand in Kabul will deny it “strategic depth”, as highlighted by the former Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg in the 1980s, fearing an Indian encirclement of Pakistan.The US bringing in Turkey also adds another actor directly into the Afghan negotiations. The Biden administration inherited a fractured relationship with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally in Ankara. Now, suggesting that Turkey host talks in April where the likes of India, Iran, Pakistan, China and Russia are to sit across the table from the Afghan government along with the Taliban to look for a viable solution, may well have more to do with a potential rapprochement between Biden and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.From a distance, the Afghan negotiations now look like a multi-layered conclave, where the US is attempting to encapsulate its exit via the various intermediaries that have been involved around the Afghan peace process over the years but have limited to no agency on US troop deployments in the war. Turkey’s close relations with Pakistan also get factored in here, with both the Taliban and the Ghani government seemingly having a level of parallel comfort with Ankara’s involvement despite others, such as India and arguably Iran, potentially viewing Turkey’s role somewhat differently.Also Read | In Kabul, be ready for political uncertaintyTo add to the complexity, the US has sanctions in place against Iran, China and Russia, while also looking for their assistance to bring closure for itself in the conflict. While Tehran, Moscow and Beijing may have overlapping concerns with the US over the security situation in Afghanistan, beyond a point, all of them have significantly larger crisis points with the US. While discovering strange bedfellows is nothing new in geopolitics, short-term goals to find empty bylanes to speedily drift into an Afghan exit is only going to leave behind chaos.The US, while hedging its risks around an Afghan exit, should take into account the fact that the bedrock of any bilateral or multilateral talks around the Afghanistan question, irrespective of regional or international actors in play, will still be based around the February 2020 deal between the US and Taliban signed in Doha. A question still hangs over the future of the Doha process, and why Moscow and Ankara have become more prominent plays over the past few weeks.How the Taliban will react to the Biden administration possibly rescinding and keeping a residual force in Afghanistan remains to be seen; however, the insurgency has the Doha deal to refer to for the US to uphold its commitment over a May 1 withdrawal, irrespective of which presidency signed on the dotted line.Others, whether it be India or Russia, could play an important role to rudder Afghanistan after a political settlement is achieved, specifically financially considering a post-war long-term economic agenda is currently non-existent. But the US is not in a position to see other multilateral forums and “peace tables” as alternatives to the Doha process.American analysts have highlighted that the Taliban today is arguably in its strongest position compared to any point since 2001. This eventuality requires a robust and clear US-owned response, even within the framework of an exit.Kabir Taneja is fellow, Strategic Studies Programme, Observer Research Foundation, and the author of The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia.

Indian Air power grows further," the Indian Embassy in France tweeted earlier.With the arrival of the three jets, the size of the Rafale fleet has increased to 14.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of ₹59,000 crore.The formal induction ceremony of the fleet had taken place at Ambala on September 10 last.A second batch of three Rafale jets arrived in India on November 3, while a third batch of another three jets joined the IAF on January 27.The first Rafale squadron is based in Ambala air force station.The Indian Air Force is set to raise the second squadron of the Rafale combat jets in mid-April and it will be based in Hasimara air base in West Bengal, according to military officials.India is expected to get more Rafale jets from France in the next few months.The Rafale jets, manufactured by French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The Rafale jets are capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-rafales-land-in-india-iaf-thanks-uae-for-mid-air-refueling-101617214561574.html
31-03-2021||India||SC-appointed panel submits recommendations to court||The three-member expert panel constituted by the Supreme Court to study and recommend changes to the Centre’s three new farm laws has submitted its report, one of the members of the panel said.The top court is likely to take up the matter next week after the Holi vacation.“The Committee submitted its report to the Supreme Court on March 19 in a sealed cover. The report is based on the issues referred to it for consideration as per the January 12 order passed by the Supreme Court. We have given our recommendations. Now it is entirely up to the Supreme Court to act on our recommendations,” said panel member Anil Ghanwat. Ghanwat is the president of the Maharashtra-based farmer organization Shetkari Sanghatana.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by agri-businesses. The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.A three-judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, appointed the committee on January 12 for the evaluation of the new laws and stayed their implementation after several rounds of negotiations between protesting farmers and the government failed to break the impasse.“The negotiations between the farmers’ bodies and the Government have not yielded any result so far. Therefore, we are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” the court order said.The committee was asked to submit its report within two months. It held 12 rounds of discussions with farmer groups, farmer producer organisations of FPOs, intermediaries, academicians, experts, and private sector as well as state-owed agriculture companies. The committee was originally constituted with Bhupinder Singh Mann (National President, BKU and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (Agricultural Economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) and Ghanwat. Mann, however, resigned two days later expressing solidarity with the protesting farmer unions.Farm unions were quick to reject the panel, and it is not clear whether they will accept the recommendations. “We are not concerned about the Supreme Court committee’s report. We have already said that its members are pro-government. Our only demand is a withdrawal of the three laws,” said Gurnam Singh Charuni, a core member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading an ongoing agitation against the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scappointed-panel-submits-recommendations-to-court-101617213892805.html

On the front of testing, Punjab and Chandigarh were asked to effectively implement the "test, track and treat" strategy and to escalate testing till the positivity comes down below 5 per cent.They were asked to significantly increase testing in all districts with a minimum of 70 per cent RT-PCR tests and use of Rapid Antigen Tests as screening tests in densely populated areas as well as areas where cluster of cases are reported and mandatorily subject those who have tested negative in Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) to RT-PCR test, the ministry said."Regarding the vaccination, the state/UT were advised to ensure priority vaccination of the eligible population groups in districts reporting higher cases."Transfer unused vaccine doses from one district to another for optimum utilization of available vaccine doses," it said.They were asked to ensure no sedimentation of vaccine takes place at any level of cold chain storage, maximum utilisation of vaccination capacity in the public and private sector health facilities."There is no shortage of vaccination at the State/UT level. The Centre is regularly reviewing vaccine stock, and vaccine doses will be continually replenished by the Centre based on the consumption level of the states and UTs," the statement said.Regarding surveillance and containment, Punjab and Chandigarh were also advised that all district officers and the local administration should refocus on effective house-to-house surveillance to identify active cases with focus on timely testing, prompt contact tracing and swift isolation so as to break the chain of transmission.They were asked to identify clusters, focus stringent implementation of micro-containment zone approach.The Principal Secretaries (Health) of Punjab and Chandigarh along with deputy commissioners of the highly affected districts such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, SBS Nagar and Jalandhar shared their feedback on the activities being undertaken in the districts to break the chain of transmission, preparation of hospital infrastructure, clinical treatment protocols in hospitals to reduce mortality, and awareness campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-centre-tells-punjab-to-effectively-implement-test-track-treat-strategy-101617210751072.html
31-03-2021||India||NIA raids activists in Andhra, Telangana for alleged Maoist links||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday conducted raids at the premises of several Adivasi, Dalit and human rights activists in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for their alleged links with Maoists, people familiar with the development said.Among those being raided till late night include Chilika Chandrasekhar (general secretary of Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee), a senior lawyer in Hyderabad and an organisation involved in human rights work.HT had reported exclusively on Sunday that the central anti-terror probe agency has booked at least 64 people – mostly activists and a journalist – under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and sedition for helping Maoists in their activities.This is NIA’s second case against activists after the Bhima-Koregaon probe, in which several activists like Sudha Bhardwaj, Anand Teltumbde, Professor Hany Babu MT, Father Stan Swamy have already been arrested for allegedly being part of Maoists’ frontal networks to increase their influence.The prominent activists named in the NIA First Information Report are – Chilika Chandrasekhar, VS Krishna, Human Rights Forum (HRF) coordinator for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh – who have been speaking against Andhra’s anti-Naxal force – the Greyhounds – for allegedly raping 11 tribal women in 2007 in the Vakapalli incident; and Duddu Prabhakar (a prominent Dalit activist).Chandrasekhar told HT – “The NIA team is at my residence in Guntur without presence of any intermediary. My wife is at home alone. They have not allowed anybody to see anything”.It was not clear if Krishna’s premises were also being searched by the agency. Prabhakar is currently in jail after he was arrested by the Andhra Pradesh police a few weeks ago.A NIA officer, who didn’t want to be named, said most of the 64 accused named in the FIR are being raided to collect evidence of their involvement in the conspiracy.This officer added that the agency wants to unearth the entire ‘Urban-Naxals’ network.The latest case was registered by Andhra Pradesh police on November 23 last year after the arrest of a TV journalist from Visakhapatnam, Pangi Naganna (30). It is alleged that Naganna worked as a courier for Maoists and had been passing information to the ultras inside the jungle about police movement and as instructed by Maoist leaders he was involved in instigating villagers to stop the forces from combing operations, obstruct police from entering villages, revolt against police parties and hold rallies against the government. Revolutionary Maoist literature, press notes, medicines, wire bundles and other incriminating material was said to have been recovered from his bag at the time of arrest.During his interrogation, Naganna said he facilitated meetings between Maoists and civil society organisations.It was on the basis of Naganna’s confession that the state police had named VS Krishna as well as Akkiraju Haragopal – a senior Central Committee member of the CPI (Maoist). The state police had further alleged that Krishna had assured Haragopal of spreading Maoist ideology in urban areas. Haragopal too is named as an accused in NIA case.It is further alleged that Chilika Chandrasekhar also met Maoists, according to Naganna’s confession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-raids-activists-in-andhra-telangana-for-alleged-maoist-links-101617210233225.html
31-03-2021||India||'SOS call', 'confession of defeat': What BJP leaders said on Mamata's letter||A day before West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's assembly constituency Nandigram goes to the elections, a letter written by Mamata Banerjee urging several non-BJP leaders to be united against the BJP intensified political heat as BJP leaders considered the letter as a desperate call to be saved. In the letter, written on March 28, Mamata wrote the BJP wants to make it "impossible for non-BJP parties to exercise their Constitutional rights and freedoms". "It wants to dilute the powers of State Governments and downgrade them to mere municipalities. In short, it wants to establish a ONE-PARTY AUTHORITARIAN RULE in India," the letter said.Saying that everyone has a right to unite, BJP chief JP Nadda said the call to unite against BJP, however, signals something else. "In a democracy, everybody has the right to unite those who share a similar ideology. But at this time, to ask everyone to unite against PM Modi and the BJP shows clear indication in elections. There's a saying in English 'Save Our Souls (SOS) or Save Our Ship (SOS)'. It means their ship is sinking. It is clear now that Mamataji has admitted that her ship is sinking in Bengal and she is in trouble and people of Bengal have decided to give an overwhelming verdict to the BJP," Nadda said.Democracy shd be the last word in @MamataOfficial & @AITCofficial dictionary .

31-03-2021||India||More trouble for CM Yediyurappa as cabinet minister accuses him of being authoritarian||KS Eshwarappa, a cabinet minister in the Karnataka government on Wednesday accused chief minister BS Yediyurappa of interference by bypassing departmental rules and running an authoritarian administration among other charges.In a strongly worded letter to Karnataka Governor Vajubai Vala on Wednesday, Eshwarappa said that the chief minister had indiscriminately sanctioned funds to various MLAs and other people in violation of rules.“I want to bring to your kind notice, some of the recent actions of our Respected Chief minister relating to my Department, which amounts to direct interference in the affairs of Ministers-in-charge of Departments, in clear violation of Karnataka (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1977 and also against the established practices and procedures relating to the affairs of the state administration,” Eshwarappa, who is the minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj said in his letter.The developments add to Yediyurappa’s troubles, since the CM has recently found himself resolving one crisis after another since he took office in July 2019.Eshwarappa said that he has communicated these issues to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda, General Secretary (Organisation) BL Santosh and Karnataka in-charge, Arun Singh as well.Eshwarappa and Yediyurappa both are from the Shivamogga district and have shared a volatile relationship in the past.Eshwarappa said that work in his department worth crores were sanctioned bypassing the minister in charge.He said that he had registered his objections with the chief minister and that it had led nowhere and hence had brought it to the notice of the Governor “these serious lapses and authoritarian ways of running the administration” by the chief minister.Yediyurappa may have had better days since he faced a double-whammy on Wednesday; one from the High Court which vacated a stay that allowed a probe into a defection drama and the other in which a cabinet minister accused the 78-year-old of bypassing ministers and running an authoritarian administration.The Karnataka High Court vacated a stay on an order for quashing of an FIR against Yediyurappa who has been accused of engineering defections that led to the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019.Yediyurappa is alleged to have lured opposition legislators, in an exercise called “Operation Kamala”, promising them plum portfolios and other monetary rewards. At least 17 legislators from the coalition had defected and helped Yediyurappa to power after weeks and months of drama in the southern state.Recently, the Karnataka CM has been at the receiving end of dissent from within his own party and is also the target of opposition attacks. The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sex-scandal involving Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems. His second son, BY Vijayendra, is also accused of running a parallel administration and the chief minister is allegedly favouring a few ministers and legislators loyal to him, antagonising core-party MLAs and others.The three bypolls on April 17 in Karnataka had presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power. Yediyurappa has also taken it upon himself to bring the BJP back to power in 2023 on its own steam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-trouble-for-cm-yediyurappa-as-cabinet-minister-accuses-him-of-being-authoritarian-101617209213016.html

The price of different brands of English liquor has been increased by 15 to 20 per cent.There is no change in the excise duty and license fee of beer, but its prices are being reduced to increase the consumption of beer in Uttar Pradesh.The sale of beer was badly affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The sale at beer shops from April 2020 to November 2020 has been only 17.28 crore bottles in the state against 27.08 crore bottles last year, which is approximately 36 per cent less.Therefore, the government has decided not to change the annual license fee of retail shops of beer.As per the Excise Policy for the year 2020-21, the maximum retail price (MRP) of beer is higher than neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh like Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. The price of beer is also higher than those states which are prone to smuggling. Additionally, the yield charge on beer is higher than that of foreign wines, depending on the alcohol content.The increase in license fees by seven and a half per cent is the main reason behind this increase in the prices of domestic and English liquor from April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beer-to-be-cheaper-indian-english-liquor-price-to-rise-in-up-from-april-1-101617204245567.html

On Monday, the state reported 31,643 new infections and 102 deaths in 24 hours. The dip in the number in the previous two days can be attributed to a fewer number of tests in the state, owing to Holi festivities.Maharashtra rules out statewide lockdown for now, localised curbs possibleThe spike comes at a time when the state government is divided over imposing lockdown-like restrictions after a night curfew of 8pm to 7am has been imposed in the state. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said people should be ready for stringent measures in the coming days. However, many NCP leaders are not in favour of a lockdown and some Shiv Sena leaders too are not sure whether a lockdown will be the most effective.The Nagpur district, which is one of the highest contributors to the state's daily new Covid-19 cases, will come out of lockdown from April 1 as the district authorities have decided against extending lockdown restrictions again.

The Indian Oil Corporation Limited on Wednesday confirmed the reduction of ₹10 in the price per cylinder, news agency ANI reported.At present, an LPG cylinder in Delhi costs 819 after three hikes since the beginning of this year. In January, the price was ₹694, which was hiked to ₹719 in February. On February 15, the price was again hiked to ₹769 to be again increased to ₹794 on February 25. In March, the price was again hiked to ₹819.In Kolkata, a cylinder costs ₹ ₹845 while in Mumbai and Chennai, the prices are ₹819 and ₹835, respectively.While petrol and diesel prices have already been cut thrice in one week, cooking gas (LPG) price too will see a reduction in the near future, the official, who did not want to be identified, said.A drop in all the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG was being expected as international oil prices have softened, news agency PTI reported quoting a top official. "International oil prices, which are the benchmark for deciding retail rates, have softened over the past few days. Though there had been some firming up of prices on Tuesday, overall the trend has been of a decline, which should reflect in domestic retail rates as well," he said.The issue of petrol, diesel, LPG gas hike has become a political one amid the ongoing assembly election season as opposition parties accused the Centre of doing nothing to rein in the price hike. The Centre, however, said the price depends on the international markets and also the taxes imposed by state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lpg-to-be-cheaper-by-rs-10-per-cylinder-from-april-1-101617197124092.html

The farmers’ union has said that besides farmers and labourers, women, dalit-adivasi-bahujans, unemployed youth and representatives of every section of the society will participate in the march. The body has assured that the march, in protest of the three contentious farm laws, will be completely peaceful.The agitating farmers will come from their villages to the borders of Delhi through their vehicles, after which they will ‘paidal march’ or march on foot from the borders of the national capital. The exact date of the march towards Parliament will be announced in the coming days, news agency ANI quoted the umbrella body as saying.Also Read | Domestic LPG to be cheaper by ₹10 per cylinder from April 1The farmers’ leaders have also planned to form a committee to control the agitators in case there is police action during the march to avoid any unforeseen event as was witnessed on the Republic day.“We will form a committee to let the protesters know what to do in case there is police action during the march.,” Gurnaam Singh Chaduni told news agency PTI. “It will also be made clear to them that SKM condemns all kinds of violence. So the protestors will know that if there is any damage of property by them, they will have to serve the penalty," he added.The farmers leaders on Wednesday also announced multiple plans for the summer to protest the laws until they are repealed, including blocking the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway for a day, beginning from 11am, on April 10.The leaders said an event to honour the lives of those who died during the agitation will also be organised on May 6, including separate events to commemorate Labour Day on May 1 and Ambedkar Jayanti scheduled for April 14.“We will be doing this because the government has not been listening to us. It has been sleeping. This is to wake up the government,” PTI quoted another leader as saying.Also Read | Are you taking a flight in April?

31-03-2021||India||NIA probe in Mansukh Hiran’s murder confirms ‘smothering’ as cause of death||The National Investigation Agency’s initial findings in the murder of businessman Manuskh Hiran reveal that he was smothered to death before being thrown into the Thane Creek, which is consistent with the probe of the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), people familiar with the development said.“Several handkerchiefs had been stuffed into Hiran’s mouth and it appears his face had been covered ‘tightly’ with another big cloth, due to which he could not breathe. There was some struggle but seems he had been adequately overpowered,” said an officer who didn’t want to be named.The agency, however, doesn’t want to conclude anything yet till an official opinion is given by the team of medical experts, who are currently examining the post mortem report along with other evidence.The post mortem conducted on March 5 stated that Hiran’s “mouth was closed, tongue within mouth” and “foul smelling blood tinged fluid oozing from nostrils”. It added that there was ‘abrasion over the face on the left side at zygomatic area; abrasion over left nostril, upper part; abrasion over right side cheek along ramus of mandible up to chin on right side and abrasion over face 1 cm lateral to outer canthus of right eye”.Hiran’s body had been recovered from the creek along the Mumbra-Reti-Bunder Road on March 5.NIA investigations, about the motive of the murder, have so far revealed that arrested Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze decided to kill Hiran after the latter refused to take the blame for planting the explosive-laden vehicle outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25, as first reported by HT.The agency is also sure that Vaze was physically present at the murder scene, which is suspected to be Gaumukh Chowpatty, when Hiran was killed but it is gathering more evidence regarding his whereabouts at that time. Apart from Vaze, co-accused -- Naresh Gour (a bookie) and Vinayak Shinde (a convicted Constable) and several officers of CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit) are being interrogated on this aspect but they have been giving contradictory statements, which need further verification, according to the second officer.The systematic destruction of evidence after Hiran’s murder was in “panic”, according to the first officer, as ATS had taken over the murder investigation and NIA was knocking at the door.The central agency had taken over the Antilia bomb scare probe on March 8 and arrested Vaze on March 13. It has been found that Vaze made the whole plan to restore his lost credibility by solving a sensational case in record time and prove his worth to the Mumbai police brass, as exclusively reported by HT.“We are not rushing the probe. It’s clear that Vaze is the main conspirator in both the incidents. Those who helped him in Antilia explosive planting and then murder of Hiran are almost identified but we don’t want to jump to any conclusion till we have joined every loose end. We will unearth the entire conspiracy very soon,” said a third officer.NIA also wants to make sure if the whole CIU (Crime Intelligence Unit), which was then headed by Vaze, was aware of the plan to murder Hiran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probe-in-mansukh-hiran-s-murder-confirms-smothering-as-cause-of-death-101617195054930.html

In a high-level meeting to review preparations a day before vaccinations are being opened up for those 45 years of age and above, the ministry also directed the states to identify low vaccine coverage pockets, particularly in districts showing Covid-19 surge, and to take corrective measures.“Maintain vaccine wastage at less than 1% (present National Wastage Percentage being 6%). Regularly review vaccine wastage across all levels to minimise the same. Ensure timely utilisation of available stocks to avoid expiry of vaccines without usage. Timely updating of data of vaccine consumption to be ensured on CoWIN & eVIN portals,” the health ministry directed all the states.Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, and RS Sharma, chairperson, empowered group on Covid vaccination, held the online meeting with health secretaries, state mission directors of National Health Mission, and state immunisation officers of all states and Union Territories to review the status, pace and issues regarding Covid vaccination across the country as well as the preparations for April 1, 2021.Also Read | Over 84% of India’s daily Covid-19 cases reported from 8 statesFor vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, the states were asked to ensure that only eligible beneficiaries are registered and vaccinated under the category; archive incorrect entries or duplications on the Co-WIN; identify pockets of low vaccination coverage at health facility, professional associations, blocks and districts to take corrective action; and ensure saturation of vaccination of these groups on priority. The Centre assured states that there was no shortage of vaccines and no problem in storage and logistics of vaccines, and that it will continually replenish the stocks based on consumption trends.“…there is no value in conserving vaccines for the second dose and that states must promptly supply vaccines to all government and private hospitals where there is a demand,” Sharma told states.On the issue of vaccine stocks, the states were advised to ensure that there was no sedimentation of vaccine stocks at any level of storage; distribution was based on consumption to avoid overstocking as well as under-stocking at cold chain points and Covid vaccination centres (CVCs); and regular review of vaccine stocks and consumption is undertaken to identify gap areas and address the same.The health secretary reiterated the need for involving the private sector in Covid-19 vaccine delivery in a big way. As of now, only 6,271 vaccination centres are in the private sector out of 47,441 total centres offering Covid-19 vaccination across the country.Also Read | WHO team urges patience after first look for origin of coronavirusBhushan asked states to conduct regular reviews of vaccinations at private Covid Vaccination Centres with respect to their capacity utilisation; undertake geographic information system (GIS) analysis of vaccination centres to identify need for additional vaccination centres within states and Union Territories; and also to proactively address apprehensions of private Covid Vaccination Centres regarding vaccine supply, guidelines etc.India started its Covid-19 vaccination coverage on January 16, 2021, and has administered at least 63 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to date. Close to 50,000 beneficiaries above 60 years of age, and 7,000 beneficiaries above 45 years with co-morbidities, have so far been fully vaccinated in the country.Experts say immunising everyone will be the key to control the spread of infection.“Ultimately, we will need to get everyone, including children, immunised,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-holds-review-meet-with-states-uts-ahead-of-45-plus-covid-vaccination-101617193132524.html

31-03-2021||India||‘Unite against BJP’: Mamata writes to Sonia, Uddhav, Kejriwal, others||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, in a letter to several non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, accused it of trying to establish a “one-party authoritarian rule” in India, calling for a plan of action to be formulated against the BJP after the conclusion of the ongoing assembly elections.The three-page letter, dated March 28, was addressed to more than a dozen non-BJP leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv sena supremo and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Rashtriya Janata Dal’s (RJD) Tejashwi Yadav, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president MK Stalin, among others.Banerjee accused the BJP and its government at the Centre of “attacking democracy and constitutional federalism in India,” citing the recently-passed Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Bill as an example. “With this law, the Lieutenant Governor Delhi has been made the undeclared Viceroy of Delhi, acting as a proxy for the home minister and the prime minister. The government has snatched away practically all the powers of the democratically elected government of Delhi,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, known for her frequent face-offs with the BJP and the central government, wrote.She cited six other instances to highlight her point: "Governors functioning as BJP office bearers, use of investigating agencies against opposition parties and governments, withholding transfer of funds to non-BJP states, disbanding of the National Development Council, Inter-state Council, Planning Commission; amassing of unlimited resources by the BJP to topple non-BJP governments, and the Central government's reckless policies of privatisation of national assets."The Centre-state relations, and those between the ruling party at the Centre and the Opposition parties, have never been this bad in the history of India, Banerjee further wrote, remarking that the blame for this rests squarely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "authoritarian conduct.""Therefore, I strongly believe that the time has come for a strong and effective struggle against the BJP's attacks on democracy and Constitution, promising to work wholeheartedly with all similar-minded parties against the BJP," she added.The West Bengal chief minister concluded the letter stating that the battle can only be won by "presenting a credible alternative to the people of Indi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unite-against-bjp-mamata-writes-to-sonia-uddhav-kejriwal-others-101617186716586.html
31-03-2021||India||Supreme Court-appointed panel submits report on farm laws||The three-member expert committee formed by the Supreme Court to study the three farm laws passed by the Parliament and recommend changes has submitted its report to the apex court in a sealed cover. The court, which is currently closed due to Holi recess, is expected to take up the matter next week on reopening.Confirming the development, one of the expert members in the committee, Anil Ghanwat, said, “The committee has submitted its report to the Supreme Court on March 19 in a sealed cover. The report is based on the issues referred to it for consideration as per the January 12 order passed by the Supreme Court. We have given our recommendations. Now it is entirely up to the Supreme Court to act on our recommendations.” Ghanwat is also the president of the Maharashtra-based farmer organisation, Shetkari Sanghatana. At the heart of the dispute are the three farm laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. The laws were cleared by the Parliament and came into operation after receiving Presidential assent in September last year.The committee was originally constituted with Bhupinder Singh Mann (then national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Mann), and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati, (agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), and Anil Ghanwat. Two days later, Mann resigned expressing solidarity with the cause of the farmer unions opposed to the laws. Also Read | Modernisation need of hour in farm sector: PMPrior to January 12 when the committee was formed, several rounds of negotiations between the government and farmer unions ended in a deadlock with many farmer unions intensifying their stir at Delhi borders and demanding repeal of the laws. To break the impasse, a three-judge bench of the top court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde formed the committee and stayed the implementation of the three laws. The order said, “The negotiations between the farmers’ bodies and the Government have not yielded any result so far. Therefore, we are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”The court had directed the committee to submit its report in two months. Since its constitution, the committee received several suggestions and met farmer unions. Meanwhile, one of the farmer unions – Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) – approached the top court seeking removal of the three members alleging bias against them. The application filed by the union attached news clippings of the committee members openly expressing their support for the farm laws.On January 20, the court ruled out bias against the members of the committee and hit out against aspersions being cast on them based on their views on the subject. The bench led by CJI Bobde said, “We have serious objections on people whom we have appointed being called names and that this court has interest in selecting them. We will decide on the constitutionality of the laws, but we will not expose the members whom we appointed to such maligning based on public opinion decided by majority.” On bias, the court held, “Where is the question of bias when the committee is not given any power to adjudicate. We have asked them to hear the grievances of farmers and give us a report.”Also Read | Rahul Gandhi says government wants to ‘snatch’ farmers’ future via farm lawsSeveral petitions are pending before the Supreme Court on the constitutional validity of the three farm laws. One set of petitions has demanded scrapping of the three laws on the ground that they “surreptitiously” repeal similar laws passed by states which interferes with the state’s law-making power without an effective amendment to the Constitution. At the same time, another set of petitions in the top court supports the legislations as being beneficial for farmers.Among those who have challenged the farm laws include members of Parliament - Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, and farmers/farmer unions – Bhartiya Kisan Party, farmer from Madhya Pradesh DP Dhakad, Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice president Rakesh Vaishnav and P Ayyakannu, state president of National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-appointed-panel-submits-report-on-farm-laws-101617185872857.html

31-03-2021||India||French warships arrive in Indian waters for joint exercise with Quad navies||Two French warships are making a port call at Kochi ahead of the La Pérouse joint naval exercise, which will see France leading manoeuvres in the Bay of Bengal that will involve the navies of the four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. The Tonnerre, an amphibious assault helicopter carrier, and the Surcouf, a La Fayette-class frigate, will be in Kochi till April 1, and then sail to the Bay of Bengal for the joint exercise that will last from April 5 to 7. This is the first time the French Navy is conducting a joint drill with all four members of the Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – in regional waters, and the wargame comes weeks after the maiden Quad Leaders Summit on March 12. The drills will be followed by two crucial trilateral meetings between the foreign ministers of India and Australia and their counterparts from France and Indonesia, to be held on the margins of the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi next month. Also Read | ‘Will hold ground in Ladakh for as long as needed’: Gen Naravane on standoffThe Tonnerre and the Surcouf form the battle group Jeanne d’Arc, which left France in February for a five-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific to demonstrate France’s capacity to deploy assets in strategic areas and to strengthen interoperability with major partners in the region, particularly India, the French embassy said in a statement on Wednesday. The deployment will also help train a new batch of 148 French naval officer cadets. French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, who was in Kochi to welcome the two warships, said: “I am proud of the exceptional level of trust and interoperability that our navies have achieved. It is no surprise that India and the Indo-Pacific are at the heart of the training for the new generation of French Navy officers.” The La Pérouse exercise will be “a concrete demonstration of multilateralism at sea and our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific”, Lenain said. After the joint exercise, the two French warships will continue their deployment across the Indo-Pacific and sail to Japan, before returning to France in mid-July. During their voyage, the warships will sail through the South China Sea twice. China is locked in maritime disputes with several countries in the South China Sea and the members of the Quad have backed efforts to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in these waters. The first edition of the La Pérouse joint exercise, initiated by France in 2019, included warships from Australia, Japan and the US. This year, India is joining the wargame for the first time. Describing India as France’s “foremost strategic partner in Asia”, the French embassy’s statement said the “large-scale five-country naval exercise...will provide an opportunity for these five like-minded, high-end naval forces to develop closer links, sharpen their skills, and promote maritime cooperation throughout a free and open Indo-Pacific”. Varuna, the joint naval exercise by France and India, was first conducted in 1983 and it has grown steadily, especially in the past few years. In 2018, during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India, the two sides signed an agreement that enables reciprocal logistics support between their armed forces and provides mutual access to military bases, including naval ports. In the coming weeks, India and France will hold a large-scale Varuna exercise in the Western Arabian Sea that will involve a French aircraft carrier battle group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-warships-arrive-in-indian-waters-for-joint-exercise-with-quad-navies-101617181192220.html

In addition, the share of women in professional and technical roles declined further to 29.2 per cent. The share of women in senior and managerial positions also remains low: only 14.6 per cent of these positions are held by women and there are only 8.9 per cent firms with female top managers," the report said.Further, the estimated earned income of women in India is only one-fifth of men's, which puts the country among the bottom 10 globally on this indicator, it said.Discrimination against women is also reflected in the health and survival subindex statistics. With 93.7 per cent of this gap closed to date, India ranks among the bottom five countries in this subindex.Wide gaps in sex ratio at birth are due to the high incidence of gender-based sex-selective practices. In addition, more than one in four women has faced intimate violence in her lifetime, the report said."Conversely, 96.2 per cent of the educational attainment subindex gender gap has been closed, with parity achieved in primary, secondary and tertiary education. Yet, gender gaps persist in terms of literacy: one third of women are illiterate (34.2 per cent) compared to 17.6 per cent of men," it added.Among India's neighbours, Bangladesh ranked 65, Nepal 106, Pakistan 153, Afghanistan 156, Bhutan 130 and Sri Lanka 116.Among regions, South Asia is the second-lowest performer on the index, with 62.3 per cent of its overall gender gap closed."Within the region, a wide gulf separates the best-performing country, Bangladesh, which has closed 71.9 per cent of its gender gap so far, from Afghanistan, which has only closed 44.4 per cent of its gap."India is the third-worst performer in the region, having closed 62.5 per cent of its gap. Because of its large population, India's performance has a substantial impact on the region's overall performance," the report said.In South Asia, only Pakistan and Afghanistan ranked below India.The report stated that India, home to 0.65 billion women, has widened its gender gap from almost 66.8 per cent one year ago to 62.5 per cent this year.In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the income of an average woman is below 16 per cent of that of an average man, while in India it is 20.7 per cent, it said.As the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to be felt, the global gender gap has increased by a generation from 99.5 years to 135.6 years, the report noted.Now in its 15th year, the report benchmarks the evolution of gender-based gaps in four areas: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. It also examines the drivers of gender gaps and outlines the policies and practices needed for a gender-inclusive recovery.For the 12th time, Iceland is the most gender-equal country in the world. The top 10 most gender-equal countries include Finland, Norway, New Zealand, Rwanda, Sweden, Ireland and Switzerland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wefs-gender-gap-index-india-slips-28-places-ranks-140-among-156-countries-101617178122495.html

31-03-2021||India||Odisha cut 1.85 crore trees to widen roads in 10 years, planted only 29 lakh||The Odisha government on Tuesday said that it has cut over 1.85 crore trees in the last 10 years for widening of roads.Replying to a question of BJP MLA Mohan Majhi in the assembly, on the number of trees felled for widening of roads in Odisha between 2010 and 2020, forest and environment minister Bikram Keshari Arukh said the trees were cut for widening of national highways such as the Sambalpur-Chhatisgarh section of NH-6, four-laning of Bhubaneswar-Puri road, Panikoili-Remuli section and Remuli Rajamunda section.However, just about 29 lakh trees were planted in place of the felled trees at an expenditure of ₹66.17 crore. The total number of trees planted were about 16 per cent of the trees that were cut down. The Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change has authorized the state governments to grant General Approval under Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for diversion of forest land up to 5 hectare in each case for creation of critical public utility infrastructure by government departments involving felling of trees not exceeding 50 number of trees per hectare in Maoist-affected districts. As per Forest Conservation Act, 1980, for every tree cut on non-forest land for any developmental project, two trees have to be planted while the same for forest lands is 10.Expressing shock over the huge loss of trees due to road widening, environmental activists said the losses are irreversible. “The trees that were felled must be at least 20-30 years old. The trees were not just giving shades to pedestrians, but also sheltered a lot of birds and reptiles. Recouping the losses is a near impossible task. The government may have planted around 30 lakh trees to recoup the losses, but I doubt if more than 5 per cent trees would have survived. The government should have looked at alternatives rather than simply sawing the trees,” said noted environmental activist Hemant Sahu.Last month, while hearing a plea related to the cutting of more than 350 trees for the construction of road over bridges (ROBs) as well as widening of national highway in West Bengal, a Supreme Court bench headed by chief justice SA Bobde had said the top court may introduce a protocol so that there is minimum damage to the environment.Hearing another plea on cutting of trees for a road project in Uttar Pradesh, the Supreme Court in December last year had wondered why trees need to be cut more often than needed for the widening of roads. “Why do roads have to be laid in a straight line by cutting trees? Keep roads zigzag. It will reduce speed, lessen accidents on roads and save many lives,” a bench presided over by chief justice S A Bobde had said.But despite the SC glare on cutting of trees for road widening, several such projects are operational in Odisha. In Ganjam district of Odisha, at least 1,720 fully-grown and old trees of different species will be cut for the widening of a 40 kilometre stretch of the National Highway 59 there. The ₹126-crore project would widen the road to 12 metres from 7 metres between Ratanpur near Berhampur city and Mundamarai near Aska.“Phailin cyclone in 2013 uprooted several trees in Ganjam. But now all roadside trees will be wiped out to widen the road,” said Sudhir Rout, founder of Aryabhatta Foundation, an organisation fighting against tree felling.The large scale felling of trees have taken their toll on the forest cover of the state. As per the FSI-2011 report, Odisha had a forest cover of 58,136 sq km which came down to 51, 619 sq km in FSI-2019 report. The loss of forest cover has happened not just due to road widening, but due to successive natural disasters as well as several industrial projects.Cyclone Phailin, that struck the districts of Ganjam and Khurda in 2013, led to loss of 15400 trees while tree cover in 29 sq km area in reserve forest and protected areas were damaged. Cyclone Fani in 2019 uprooted 22 lakh trees, most of them fruit bearing trees in Puri and Khurda districts.In one of the largest-ever tree-felling exercises for an industrial project in recent times, over 17,000 trees were cut in December 2019 in Sambalpur district. An opencast coal mining project of central government-owned Neyveli Lignite Corporation coming up at Talabira area of Sambalpur district would result in diversion of 1,038.187 hectares of prime forest land, having trees like Sal, Mahul, Asan, Dhaura, Jamun, Mango and Char. By a conservative estimate, at least 1.3 lakh trees would be cut to make way for the Talabira coal blocks.“Talabira coal block would be among the projects in recent times when a large number of trees were cut. In case of highway expansion, the government could plant only 16 per cent of the trees cut and no one knows how many of the saplings survived. Talabira has one of the best Sal forests in Odisha and once 1.3 lakh trees are cut no one knows how many years it will take to regenerate the same tree cover,” said Sankar Pani, environmental lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cut-1-85-crore-trees-to-widen-roads-in-10-years-planted-only-29-lakh-101617172494818.html

The high court single judge bench of Justice Dama Seshadri Naidu, ruled that “mere difficulty or post-marriage discord” would not amount to ‘grave lack of discretion of judgment’ at the time of consent but rather it must be a severe or grave mental disturbance or disorder, which represses or severely limits an individual’s cognitive ability.”According to Church Law, also referred to as Canon Law, a marriage can be annulled only on a specific set of reasons -- if both or one of the parties is adjudged to “lack the sufficient use of reason; or suffer from grave lack of discretion of judgment concerning essential matrimonial rights and duties; or who are not capable of assuming the essential obligations of matrimony due to causes of a psychic nature.”In the present case, the husband sought the annulment on grounds that he was suffering from “a grave lack of discretion of judgment” and the marriage needed to be annulled. In Goa, owing to the Portuguese civil code, marriages between Catholics are governed under the Canon (Church) Law and the verdicts passed by the Ecclestical (Church) Tribunals are legally and civilly binding. However, the Bombay High Court at Goa in October 2019 struck down a section of the Portuguse Civil Code which had restricted the powers of the high court to supersede the rulings of the ecclestical tribunals, allowing litigants to now approach the high court with marriage disputes. The case dates back to 2012 when two divorcees, in their mid-40s, Francis and Maria (names changed) were introduced to each other and agreed to get married. Their marriage was solemnised and registered. When they entered this matrimonial bond, they were in their mid-forties. They live happily or normally for a few years. Later, however, there arose certain differences, which, according to the husband, are irreconcilable. So he complained to the Parish Priest, who tried to counsel both the wife and husband; he failed to bring about any reconciliation or rapprochement between them. The husband then applied for annulment in the marriage before the Ecclestical (Church) Tribunal alleging that “in my heart, I did not want to marry in haste without knowing the girl, but the situation forced me to consent to the marriage… [her] talk was so sweet that I was taken up by her and blindly did what she told me to do”. “She tricked and forced me into this marriage. She did not allow me to think or even consult anybody,” he claimed. The tribunal granted the annulment on grounds that the woman suffered from “grave lack of Discretion of Judgment”. The wife then appealed before the Metropolitan Tribunal where her appeal was rejecte. She then approached the high court. “We have seen… what amounts to a ‘grave lack of discretion of judgment concerning essential matrimonial rights and duties which are to be mutually given and accepted’. It must be a severe or grave mental disturbance or disorder, which represses or severely limits an individual’s cognitive ability. That is, the incapacity must be of a psychic or psycho-physical nature. Mere difficulty or post-marriage discord cannot come within the purview of [the relevant section of Canon law],” the high court ruled. The tribunals, in their judgement annulled the marriage on grounds that the marriage was celebrated without sufficient courtship; that the husband was in a confused state of mind when he consented to the marriage; the wife hurried the marriage; the couple contracted the marriage without due preparation as required by the Church Law; the wife prevented the husband from making satisfactory inquiries about her among other reasons. But the High court was not amused. “The reasons the tribunals below have given for allowing the husband to have the marriage annulled simply trivialise a sacrament. Secularly speaking, the decision shocks one’s sense of justice; spiritually speaking, it shocks one’s canonical convictions or conventions,” the high court added. “‘Consent’ is a voluntary act of a person with no cognitive impairment or psychic abnormalities or shortcomings. Not thinking wisely or not thinking leisurely does not vitiate consent,” the High Court ruled. The high court then proceeded to set aside an annulment that the Church tribunal had granted with expressing the hope that it “leads to the parties’ reunion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mere-discord-not-enough-to-annul-church-marriage-bombay-hc-101617168231686.html

We have started implementing it from March 16," CPRO of Western Railway, Sumit Thakur, told PTI.Southern Railway CPRO B Guganesan told PTI that these instructions are not new, but a reiteration of earlier orders of the Railway Board.In 2014, the Commissioner of Railway Safety had recommended that charging stations be switched off between 11 pm and 5 am, soon after a fire incident in the Bangalore-Hazur Sahib Nanded Express. The Railway Board had eventually issued such orders to all rail zones."In view of the recent incidents of fire, we have done the needful. It is a precautionary measure and even earlier the Railway Board had issued such orders. The power from the main switchboard for these points will be switched off from 11 pm to 5 am," Guganesan said.This comes after recent incidents of fire reported in some trains. According to railway officials, the decision to restrict the use of the charging ports was taken as a precautionary measure.In a report on the fires, officials suggested that the points used for charging mobile phones and other electronic devices should be switched off at night.Many incidents of minor fires, reported onboard long-distance trains, were caused due to overcharging of electronic devices, officials said.Recently a coach of the Dehradun-bound Shatabdi Express caught fire in a suspected case of a short circuit on March 13. Barely six days later, a fire broke out in the engine of a static goods train at the Ranchi station.The Railways has also announced a slew of initiatives against smoking and carrying inflammable items, which were apparently also the cause behind some of the recent fires onboard trains.The national transporter has instructed zonal railways to initiate an intensive awareness drive of seven days to educate all the stakeholders, including railway users and employees, about precautions to be taken against fire incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-charging-of-electronic-devices-in-trains-at-night-railways-101617163717623.html

They are safe, in good health, and have been working closely with all parties involved to re-float the vessel. Their hard work and tireless professionalism are greatly appreciated," the company said in a statement."BSM extends its deepest gratitude to all parties involved in the emergency response, including the Suez Canal Authority, SMIT Salvage and the crew on board, who worked tirelessly to free the vessel and to restore navigability in the Suez Canal," the statement further said.The experts are now probing the reason for the incident. When blame gets assigned, it will likely lead to years of litigation to recoup the costs of repairing the ship, fixing the canal and reimbursing those who saw their cargo shipments disrupted.Since the vessel is owned by a Japanese firm, operated by a Taiwanese shipper, flagged in Panama and now stuck in Egypt, matters quickly gained international attention.Experts boarded the Ever Given as it idled Tuesday in Egypt's Great Bitter Lake, just north of the site where it previously blocked the canal. A senior canal pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media, told The Associated Press that experts were looking for signs of damage and trying to determine why the vessel ran aground.The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez, on March 23. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip - a 5,000-kilometer detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-indian-crew-onboard-ever-given-in-good-health-says-company-101617162607905.html

If cases increase rapidly, the healthcare system would be overwhelmed," Paul warned.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who accompanied Paul at the briefing, said that eight of the top 10 Covid-19 high-burden districts of the country are from Maharashtra and that Delhi, taken as one district, is also on the list.He said the 10 districts with maximum active Covid cases are Pune (59,475), Mumbai (46,248), Nagpur (45,322), Thane (35,264), Nashik (26,553), Aurangabad (21,282), Bengaluru Urban (16,259), Nanded (15,171), Delhi (8,032) and Ahmednagar (7,952).Bhushan stressed that efficient implementation of "test, track and treat" remains the only proven strategy for control of transmission.The active cases - which show the number of patients infected with Covid-19 right now - have been increasing for more than 20 days and now comprise 4.47 per cent of the total infections, while the recovery rate has further dropped to 94.19 per cent, the health ministry has said.According to some experts, the relatively low count of new cases (56,211) on Tuesday could be because of lower testing on account of Holi festival on Monday. India has been recording a daily spike of over 60,000 cases for a few days until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-53-480-new-cases-of-covid-19-351-fatalities-in-24-hours-101617161525606.html

In fact, organisations working for the scheduled castes and tribes have already been given this facility. This can be extended to the groups working for Divyaangs,” Shivaji Kumar, disabilities commissioner, said.Letters in this direction have been sent to the electricity department and the managing director of the North Bihar and South Bihar Power Distribution Companies a couple of days ago and they have been asked to submit a compliance report by April 16, he added.Vinod Bhanti, an expert in artificial limb making, said many institutions start working for physically challenged people but fail to sustain after some time and one of the main reasons is the high electricity charges on commercial rates. “The population of Divyaangs in the state is quite high and even in this population, the percentage of disabled children is quite high. We need more and more institutions and organisations to work for them,” he said.The percentage of disabled persons in the state out of the country’s total population of physically challenged is 8.69%, as per the Census 2011. And in the population of physically challenged, 12.48% are children (0-6years) which is the highest in the country, Bhanti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institutions-for-physically-challenged-people-in-bihar-to-get-subsidised-power-101617162471600.html

Earlier, Nitish Kumar had written to Puri in December regarding increased connectivity, renaming of airport, transfer of air force land, development as international airport besides cargo facility while raising security concerns.In his letter to Bihar CM, Puri has assured to construct a new civil enclave once the land is handed over to Airport Authority of India (AAI).“Once the land is available, the new terminal building would be constructed,” stated the letter. AAI has taken up the project, worth ₹20 crore, to provide night landing facilities at the airport. As of now, limited night landing facilities are available here but their operation is not possible due to limitations imposed by the IAF, it added.In another development, a multi-disciplinary team of AAI has rejected the state government’s earlier proposal to hand over 31 acres for development of a new civil enclave as the identified site near NH-57 was not found suitable due to inadequate depth to properly accommodate all airport facilities.According to the latest communication sent to the Bihar government by the AAI chairman, a team of experts, along with state administration, had inspected another site of 54 acres, to be considered for a new civil enclave.The AAI has requested the state government to provide 54 acres for development of permanent civil enclave and another 24 acres for installation of CAT-1 approach light for uninterrupted operation during bad weather.The existing infrastructure is not capable of handling the massive demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expedite-land-acquisition-for-darbhanga-airport-hardeep-puri-to-nitish-kumar-101617160732480.html

31-03-2021||India||KCR takes u-turn, orders purchase of paddy through 6,400 procurement centers||In a u-turn, the Telangana government has decided to procure paddy from farmers during this rabi season by setting up as many as 6,408 procurement centres in the rural areas all over the state. A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level review meeting called by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday night. According to an official statement from the chief minister’s office, the decision was taken in the wake of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic.The decision comes at a time when the farmers in many parts of the country have been agitating for several months against the contentious central legislations on agriculture that allow the farmers to sell their crops anywhere in the market and the state government won’t have to open purchasing centres to procure agriculture commodities. Though the Telangana government initially opposed the central laws, it changed its stand later and declared that it won’t procure agricultural produce anymore. KCR, as the chief minister is known, announced in December last year that the process of sale and purchase of agricultural produce should be left to the market. He went to the extent of saying that his government was not a business organisation or trader; neither a rice miller nor a dal miller. “Sale and purchase are not the responsibility of the government. It is not possible to set up a purchase centre in the village from next year onwards,” the chief minister said then. But on Monday, the Telangana chief minister reverted to his old decision and announced procurement of paddy from the farmers this year, too, as was done in the past. He directed that the authorities make arrangements for procurement of paddy during the summer season through 6,408 centres in the villages all over the State. He instructed principal secretary (finance) Ramakrishna Rao to make all arrangements to give bank guarantee for ₹20,000 crore towards paddy procurement. He asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to conduct an emergency videoconference with all the collectors for the setting up of the procurement centres. He asked agriculture minister Niranjan Reddy to monitor the setting up of the procurement centres and the procurement of paddy. He also instructed the minister and the chief secretary to take all precautions so that farmers were not put to any difficulty during procurement.Out of 6,408 procurement centres, there will be 2,131 Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP) centres (rural markets), 3,964 primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) and 313 other smaller markets. KCR also instructed that Minimum Support Price (MSP) be implemented and ensured while farmers bring their paddy to the centres. He asked the farmers to ensure that the paddy to be brought to the procurement centres should have not more than 17 per cent moisture. The farmers should ensure that the moisture percentage is less and they should follow conditions of the MSP. The chief minister also instructed the officials to keep the 20 crore gunny bags ready at the procurement centres. This summer season, paddy has been cultivated in 52.76 lakh acres, and it is expected that the yield would be 1.17 crore tonnes of the coarse variety Paddy and 21 lakh tonnes of fine variety paddy, the official note said. KCR also asked the chief secretary to identify lands to be given on lease to the Central Ware Housing Corporation who are ready to construct additional warehouses to store the food grains. The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the chief minister’s decision to procure paddy from the farmers, but said the decision was politically motivated. “The government’s decision is a fallout of the agitations taken up by the Congress party in the last few months. We undertook padayatras and conducted farmers’ rallies all over the state and the chief minister has realised the seriousness of the situation,” Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said. He also suspected that the decision was taken to appease the farmers in the wake of the ensuing bye-elections in Nagarjunsagar assembly constituency which has more than two lakh paddy farmers. The election is scheduled for April 17. BJP official spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said KCR had earlier tried to ignore farmers on the pretext of central laws. “Now, he has gone back on his words only to woo farmers in the wake of bye-elections in Nagarjunsagar. In any case, we welcome the decision, as it gives relief to the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-takes-u-turn-orders-purchase-of-paddy-through-6-400-procurement-centers-101617158691103.html
31-03-2021||India||Bombay high court to hear Param Bir Singh's plea seeking CBI probe against Anil Deshmukh today||The Bombay High Court will on Wednesday hear a petition filed by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh seeking a probe by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh has claimed that Deshmukh asked police officer Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Singh initially filed a plea in the Supreme Court, which called the matter serious but asked the former Mumbai top cop to approach the high court. He then filed the criminal Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Bombay high court on March 25.In his petition, the IPS officer has also raised the issue of alleged corruption in police transfers and postings in Maharashtra.On Tuesday, senior counsel Vikram Nankani, appearing for Singh, mentioned the petition before a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice G S Kulkarni and sought urgent hearing.Chief justice Datta asked Nankani about the prayers sought in the petition and if the PIL is maintainable."We will satisfy the court with arguments on the maintainability of the petition," Nankani said.The high court then posted the PIL for hearing on Wednesday.Singh made these allegations in an unsigned letter dated March 20, which was addressed to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior bureaucrats and politicians. He said that Deshmukh told Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of ₹2-3 lakh each is collected from each of them, a monthly collection of ₹40-50 crore is achievable.Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his alleged role in planting explosives in an SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February.In his PIL, Singh also accused Deshmukh of routinely interfering in police investigations and putting pressure on him to implicate BJP leaders in the case of suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar.Claiming that Deshmukh met Vaze at his residence in mid-February, Singh also sought a direction from the high court to the CBI to secure CCTV footage of the minister's residence before it was "destroyed".The Maharashtra government has, meanwhile, appointed a single-member committee to probe Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh. The panel, which will comprise retired Bombay high court judge Kailas Uttamchand Chandiwal, has been given a timeline of six months to submit a report.Deshmukh denied the charges and the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has rallied behind him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-to-hear-param-bir-singh-s-plea-against-anil-deshmukh-today-101617158245343.html

A number of incriminating documents were also seized from the occupants of the vessel.”“Image of a flying horse was found on all the heroin packets, which is a usual practice of drug trafficking syndicates to brand their drugs. Further, investigations so far indicate that an unknown vessel carried the Heroin and arms consignment from Chabahar Port, Iran and handed over the same to Sri Lankan fishing boat Ravihansi in the high seas near Lakshadweep,” read an NCB statement.All the six Sri Lankan crew members -- LY Nandana, HKGB Dassppriya, AHS Gunasekara, SA Senarath, T Ranasingha and D Nissanka – were taken into custody on Saturday and they have been remanded to judicial custody.“The intelligence inputs and the investigations so far indicate that a Pakistan based drug trafficking network is involved in the current seizure. There have been seizures of huge quantity heroin in the Arabian Sea by both Indian as well as other enforcement agencies which are believed to have trafficked by the same network. This seizure also unveils the nexus between narcotics trafficking and extremist elements,” the NCB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/300kg-heroin-found-on-lankan-boat-ncb-101617152645899.html
31-03-2021||India||Wife has right to pick court in matrimonial disputes, says HC||The right to choose the location of a court for adjudication of a matrimonial dispute lies with the wife, the Punjab and Haryana high court observed as it ordered the transfer of a case from Bhiwani family court to Mohali on Tuesday.A bench of Justice Arun Monga was hearing the transfer plea of a woman when he said: “Only in a case where the wife is residing outside India, the husband can institute proceedings where he is residing. Whereas, the wife can, in any case, file a petition in a competent court, within whose limits she is residing. The said right has been exclusively conferred on a wife so as to keep her convenience in mind in matrimonial matters.”In her plea, the woman had sought transfer of the 2020 case from Bhiwani to Mohali, where she last lived with her husband. The husband, who lives in the United States, had argued that his wife had sufficient means and could easily appear before Bhiwani court.The wife, however, claimed that she was residing with her parents in Mohali, which was 250 km away from Bhiwani. She added that her father was a heart patient and as both her brothers were married and living elsewhere, there was no one to accompany her to the court for hearings.During the hearing, the court observed that ethos as manifested under Article 51-A of the Indian Constitution envisaged that it will be the fundamental duty of every Indian citizen to uphold the dignity of the women. As per Article 15 (3), power was also conferred on the state to make special provisions for women and children in such matters. It was perhaps in this spirit that an amendment was inserted in 2003 in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-has-right-to-pick-court-in-matrimonial-disputes-says-hc-101617150819082.html

There is no question of shielding anybody who is indulging in such kind of malpractices.”On handing over the paper leak case to the CBI, the Army Chief said: “When these cases came to light we realised that there are other parties involved, civilians involved, transactions made to a bank, call records that need to be looked into. We do not have the authority to do this kind of investigation. So we decided to give it to CBI.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naravane-warns-of-strict-action-against-guilty-in-recruitment-corruption-case-101617149676550.html

This is the third case filed against the central agency.The latest case is based on the statement of one of the accused in the smuggling case Sandeep Nair in which he alleged that he was under pressure to implicate the state government and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He is in custody under COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act).Also read | PM steps up attack on DMK, says LDF ‘betrayed’ KeralaThe ED approached the high court on Monday to quash the FIR against its officials.

Later, many officials were arrested for helping the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-third-case-filed-against-ed-101617146052750.html
31-03-2021||India||India debates zero emission target: What is at stake?||India’s climate policy establishment is engaged in an intense debate on a key policy question which will determine the future development and environmental trajectory of the nation — will, and should, India join the elite club of nations that have announced a net zero emission target by the mid-century in the run up to the UN climate change conference (COP 26) in Glasgow this November?Though a net zero target may sound reassuring when the severe impact of the climate crisis is already being felt, experts point out that it is difficult to achieve and will have long lasting implications for India’s economic story.Enhanced global pressureAround 58 countries have announced net zero emission targets so far, according to Climatewatchdata.org. Achieving the target implies that all remaining human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are balanced out by removing GHGs from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal. This may be achieved by various modes, including restoring forests or through direct air capture and storage (DACS) technology, according to the World Resources Institute.The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the US on an “irreversible path” to a net zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 in order to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“Yes, India will participate in the summit. But I haven’t heard any plans of announcing a net zero emissions target. It requires complete transformation and could derail our development plans. India cannot take on net zero target at the moment... The world will be better placed to declare any new targets when global stocktaking process concludes in 2023,” said a senior official of the environment ministry, on condition of anonymity.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said in Rajya Sabha on March 15: “India continues to uphold the need for equitable access to carbon space as among the key principles guiding implementation of the Paris Agreement, as well as the achievement of the larger goal of sustainable development in keeping with the needs and aspirations of its people.”Is net zero a panacea?India is under diplomatic pressure to join the net zero club. But, there are two issues to consider.One of them is whether a net zero emissions target can actually secure the planet from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. Dave Elliott, an emeritus professor of technology policy at the Open University in UK, wrote in Physicsworld that the net zero formulation does not usually specify how net zero emissions are achieved; so, in principle, any project will be acceptable if it can claim to avoid, or compensate for, carbon dioxide production. These can include carbon offset and carbon removal projects, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency schemes.Experts have raised concerns about whether India should bet on such long term uncertain strategies. “Rather than jumping on the bandwagon by setting far-off, false targets, India has the opportunity to lead with real zero actions that radically reduce emissions, rapidly green its economy, tackle air pollution at home and help achieve climate goals globally,” said Harjeet Singh, global climate lead at ActionAid.Idea of climate justiceThe other dimension to net zero targets is that it brushes over one of the most important principles of 2015 Paris Agreement — “common but differentiated responsibility”. This requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them. Linked to this is the concept of climate justice, which underlines that the devastating impacts of the crisis will not be borne out equally by the rich and poor.Shyam Saran, former special envoy and chief negotiator on climate change, said: “For India... it is important that mitigation does not overshadow other key elements of the Paris Climate agreement... The consequences are already upon us and even with the most ambitious mitigation action, will continue to impact the world since greenhouse gases accumulated in the earth’s atmosphere diminish only gradually. Adaptation should have equal billing with mitigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-debates-zero-emission-target-what-is-at-stake-101617139314016.html

31-03-2021||India||India-China border row: Air forces hold formation in Ladakh||As India and China negotiate a complex disengagement process to pull back their troops and weapons from friction points in eastern Ladakh, the air forces of both countries remain to be deployed in the theatre just as they were when the border row was at its peak last year, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.“There has been no change in the posture or the deployment of the Indian Air Force in the Ladakh sector. Nor have we noticed any change in the deployment of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF),” said one of the officials cited above.India and China have held 10 rounds of military talks so far to resolve border tensions that began last May. The 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies took place on February 20 after the completion of disengagement on strategic heights on both banks of Pangong Tso.

Dates are yet to be announced for the 11th round of military talks that are expected to focus on outstanding problems with the PLA at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra.As India and China prepare for those, little is likely to change for the air force deployments, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“IAF’s air defence assets, unmanned aerial vehicles, transport and helicopter fleets will continue to be on station in Ladakh. Our fighter airbases within 350 km of eastern Ladakh will remain on standby. Same will be true for China. The situation will change only after some political settlement is reached,” said Chopra. Apart from deploying fighter jets at bases in the Ladakh-Tibet theatre, PLAAF has also positioned a large number of radars and missiles in the sector, a second official said.IAF has projected its capability to carry out day-and-night, all-weather combat missions in the Ladakh sector, with front-line fighter jets, attack helicopters and multi-mission choppers deployed there. It also deployed its new Rafale fighter jets in sector as part of India’s overarching plan to strengthen its military posture in the region.Watch | ‘Not an inch has been lost…’: Army chief on India-China disengagement in LadakhThe air force’s MiG-29 fighter jets, Sukhoi-30s, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters are among the platforms that have operated in the Ladakh sector.At a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on February 20, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in a “steady and orderly” manner.

31-03-2021||India||Govt warns surge in Covid-19 cases can overwhelm resources||The surge in Covid-19 cases across the country at present has the potential to overwhelm India’s health care infrastructure, the Union government said in a warning to states on Tuesday, even as the national positivity rate crossed 5% for the first time since October, indicating the severity of the ongoing second wave.The government urged states to take immediate steps to limit the outbreak and strengthen hospitals and enhance intensive care capacities.During the weekly briefing, the Union government officials separately identified the current hotbeds (10 districts in particular, of which eight are in Maharashtra) and said immediate steps must be taken to improve testing of people and isolation of those infected in order to control a situation that one expert described as going from “bad to worse”.“Since the past few weeks, the situation is going from bad to worse, which is a serious cause for concern. In some states in particular, there is a huge cause for worry, so no state, no part of our country, no district should be complacent. What the trends show is that the virus is still very active, can penetrate our defences, and when we think we have found ways to control the virus, it strikes back. It has done so in our country; it has done so in other countries,” said VK Paul, member (Health) of Niti Aayog.Paul was speaking at the briefing where the Union health secretary gave new figures that underscore the worsening trend. Among them was the average positivity rate for the country, which has risen above 5% for the first time since October 22.“The weekly national average positivity rate is 5.65%. Maharashtra has a weekly average of 23%, Punjab has a weekly average of 8.82%, Chhattisgarh 8%, Madhya Pradesh 7.82%, Tamil Nadu 2.50%, Karnataka 2.45%, Gujarat 2.2% and Delhi 2.04%,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Also read | 14 countries express ‘shared concerns’ over WHO report on Covid-19 originsIn a letter to states, he separately wrote: “…the current rise in cases is of concern and has the potential of overwhelming health care systems, unless checked right now.”Ten districts in the country currently account for the majority of active Covid-19 cases, with eight of them in Maharashtra alone, the officials said at the briefing.While testing has been low over the past two days due to the weekend and the festival of Holi, the daily average of cases added across the country over the week till March 29 was around 58,000, the highest since October 20.The surge, Bhushan said, was due to inadequate Covid-19 testing, lack of public health measures, and because of specific events or places where crowding happens.“The need is for states to exponentially increase Covid-19 testing, especially, the proportion of RT-PCR testing should be increased up to at least 70%. The rising cases also highlight public health measures are not being taken as per requirement such as implementation of containment strategy, effective contact tracing, appropriately physically isolating positive cases, etc,” he added.The districts with high active case loads are Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Bengaluru Urban, Nanded, Delhi, and Ahmednagar.To be sure, India’s vaccination drive is just picking up momentum. A total of 62.3 million vaccine shots have been administered till Tuesday at 7pm, with 9 million people having received both shots, and 44.3 million one. The drive is expected to kick up a hear from April 1 when anyone over the age of 45 years becomes eligible for a vaccine.Also read | With 27,918 Covid-19 cases, Maharashtra’s tally at 2,773,435In Maharashtra, officials have floated the idea of a lockdown in order to contain the outbreak, but added that they will first explore regional restrictions and curbs such as closing restaurants and theatres before considering a blanket shutdown.In Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said more hospitals beds were being set aside for Covid-19 patients.On Saturday, the Centre released a list of 47 districts across the country that are currently reporting an unusual surge of Covid-19 cases.“Some districts that saw a high number of cases in August-November are again seeing a high growth rate of cases. In addition, a number of new districts that saw a limited prevalence earlier, are worryingly, showing a surge in Covid cases. States/UTs and districts that have current low levels of cases, however, cannot be complacent,” the letter read.The government outlined five areas for the districts to focus on: improving testing and tracing, ensuring proper isolation of infected people, strengthening health care capacities, enforcing appropriate behaviour in public places and prioritising vaccinations.The government also asked to states to demarcate containment zones with stringent controls in place and improve surveillance by mapping cases and reviewing statistics from different areas (including indicators such as the rate of test positivity, growth of cases, case fatality, and the doubling time of cases). “All districts with high case loads and fast growth of cases must ensure 100% saturation vaccination of the priority age group of 45 years and above in the coming two weeks,” the letter read.Experts said this phase is critical in controlling the outbreak.“How we act at this stage will make a huge difference in how the disease progresses. Vaccination and following Covid-appropriate behavior is the key in controlling the disease,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-warns-surge-can-overwhelm-resources-101617137225192.html
31-03-2021||India||2 days ahead of Mahakumbh, Rishikesh and Haridwar emerge as Covid-19 hotspots||Amid the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the state with several instances of a significant number of tourists testing positive especially in the town of Rishikesh, experts say Haridwar and Rishikesh are emerging as the hotspots of the infection in Uttarakhand. The fear was evident with the incidents including one Covid-19 infection at a five-star hotel in Rishikesh where about 76 people tested positive for the virus leading the administration to shut down the hotel for three days for sanitisation. Similarly, before that, 22 tourists part of a 50 member contingent from Gujarat who came to Rishikesh, tested positive for Covid-19 leading to panic among the locals in the town. In another incident, 11 staff of a yoga resort also tested positive for the virus a few days ago. Besides the apprehension that Mahakumbh could emerge as a superspreader, the incidents are worrying the hoteliers and people related to the hospitality industry in Rishikesh who fear that if tourists continue to test positive in the town, then it may severely affect their business-like last year’s lockdown. Also, many people who are coming to Mahakumbh are either visiting Rishikesh, or staying there given better hotels and accommodations there. Government should conduct random testing of guests: Hoteliers Greater Rishikesh Hotels and Resorts Association president Vijay Bisht said, “The rising number of cases among tourists is obviously a matter of concern for us. As more cases get reported, the more tourists will refrain from coming to Rishikesh, affecting our business which already hit a low last year due to lockdown during peak tourism season.” Urging the government to conduct random Covid-19 tests on guests coming to the town and isolate them if found positive, Bisht said, “Shutting down a hotel if guests test positive is not the solution. It not only damages the reputation of the hotel but also sends a negative message among the tourists to not visit the place fearing the infection.” “Instead, the government should isolate the people turning positive instead of creating a hype about the spread. The government should create fear but aware the people on taking precautions so as to curb the infection,” said Bisht adding that the hotels at their level are also taking all the necessary precautions. He said that the hotels in the town are focusing on keeping their staff safe while asking them to follow all precautions strictly. “We cannot ask all the guests to bring mandatory Covid-19 RT-PCR negative test report as it will discourage them from coming which will then hamper our business,” said Bisht. Another hotelier and founding member of Rishikesh Hotel Association, Sanjiv Goyal said, “The business is already down this season too.” Goyal said, “Our business last year was almost nil as the hotels were closed due to the lockdown. This month too after Covid-19 cases have increased again, our business is dipping with most of the bookings being cancelled in the last few days.” He said that usually during Holi, all the Rishikesh hotels are full, “But this year it didn’t happen.” Goyal also said that, “There is also no business for the Char Dham Yatra so far” Rishikesh is considered to be the gateway to Char Dham Yatra, but so far there have been no bookings for it on hotels. We are fearing a repetition of last year’s business situation if the cases continue to rise.” Government needs to strictly implement precautions: Experts Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases, experts said that the government needs to “implement the precautions more strictly”. Anoop Nautiyal, social activist who had been keeping an eye on the Covid-19 situation in Uttarakhand since last year’s lockdown said, “The surge in the cases again in the state is a big worry.” Nautiyal said, “In what many experts are calling as the second wave of infections, the government have to take this seriously and make the people adhere to precautions like in last year’s lockdown especially in Rishikesh and Haridwar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-days-ahead-of-mahakumbh-rishikesh-and-haridwar-emerge-as-covid-19-hotspots-101617136371900.html

His reference may have been to the circumstances surrounding the chief minister’s ascent to the top job but it sparked an outrage. Stalin himself warned his partymen to maintain the decencies of debate, and Raja has apologised for the comment.The PM also took a swipe at the DMK over dynastic politics, saying the “crown prince” sidelined many senior leaders of that party, referring to the ascent of Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi.The Prime Minister sought to reiterate his respect and affinity for the Tamil language. “One of the greatest moments of my life was when I could speak in a few words in the oldest language in the world, Tamil at the United Nations,” he said.Palaniswami was also present at the rally with his deputy O Panneerselvam and other coalition leaders.Later in the day, the PM addressed a rally in Kerala’s Palakkad. The BJP has fielded E Sreedharan, the former chief of the Delhi Metro and one of India’s most respected technocrats from the constituency.The PM targeted Kerala’s ruling LDF over the gold smuggling case, allegedly involving the former principal secretary to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, saying the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led government “betrayed” the people of the state just as Judas did Jesus for a few pieces of silver.“Judas betrayed Lord Christ for a few pieces of silver. LDF has betrayed Kerala for a few pieces of gold,” the PM said.Reacting to his remark, the CPI(M) said it did not need a certificate from the PM.Also read | No Prime Minister has ever done this: Trinamool moves EC over PM Modi’s Bangladesh visit“All central agencies are under him. Let him ask his agencies to speed up probe and find real beneficiaries of the gold smuggling [case],” said state party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The PM said that the politics of the state is seeing a major shift driven by aspirations of young who have questioned the “match-fixing” politics of the LDF and the opposition UDF.“...For many years, the worst kept secret of Kerala politics was the friendly agreement of the UDF and LDF. Now, the first-time voters of Kerala are asking- what is this match fixing?” Modi said.“Five years one loots, five years the other loots. People are seeing how the UDF and LDF misled the people,” Modi said as he expressed hope that the chain of alternating power between two fronts will be broken this time.The two parties have alternated in power since 1982.“Only the BJP can ensure fast development to the state,” he said.At the rally in the Union territory of Puducherry, the PM targeted the “non-performing” Congress government (which collapsed just ahead of the polls) over the years in Puducherry.“In the long list of non-performing Congress governments over the years, the previous Puducherry Government has a special place.

The country can fight any adverse situation and challenges coming our way. We have fared better than many countries."Elaborating on how the success on the front of Covid-19 can be replicated in India's fight against TB, the Union Health Minister said, "Another goal in front of us is to eliminate the TB by 2025. Our efforts of testing, tracing, and treating in COVID-19 can be replicated for the treatment of TB. The experience from the pandemic can be used to achieve the goal of eliminating TB by 2025."According to the Union Health Ministry, the document is a chronicle of the response to the pandemic for the period January 2020 to November 2020.Expressing immense pleasure on the comprehensive response of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, he said, "This is a historical moment for all of us. On January 30, we had our first case, and today after 1 year and 2 months, we have chased more than 1.2 crore COVID-19 cases. But these are the cases that we have chased. There may be many other cases that may not be in our record. But the matter of happiness is that out of the 1.2 crore cases, 1.13 crore people have recovered."He further highlighted how this unprecedented pandemic of global magnitude was converted into an exceptional opportunity."The hindrances that were faced in the initial days of the pandemic were resolved. We used to import PPE kits initially. Now, we not only manufacture sufficient kits for India but we are exporting them to other countries. The labs which started from just 1 in January 2020 have now expanded to 2,433 across the country. We are also exporting vaccines to many countries," he said.The Union Health Minister noted the need to publish this chronicle of the response to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/success-in-tackling-covid-19-can-be-used-to-achieve-goal-of-eliminating-tb-by-2025-harsh-vardhan-101617130330980.html
31-03-2021||India||Bolster airport checks, consider spot fine: DGCA||Aviation regulator Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday told airport operators to increase surveillance at airports and levy spot fines against those not following Covid-19 protocols, a move aimed at slowing the raging second wave of the pandemic, even as the number of air travellers continues to increase.This the first time the aviation regulator has recommended fining people for flouting Covid-19 protocols and it comes at a time when the industry as well as the administration expects a significant uptick in air travel. According to the summer schedule of flights operations approved for 2021 on Tuesday, an average of 18,843 departures per week has been approved -- a significant jump from the roughly 14,500 weekly average seen in December.“During the surveillance of some airports, it has come to notice that compliance (of Covid-19 protocols) is not satisfactory. All airport operators, therefore, are requested to ensure that the instructions on Covid-19 protocol from the standpoint of wearing face mask properly, covering nose and mouth, as well as maintaining social distance norms within the airport premises are followed scrupulously,” DGCA said in an order to airport operators on Monday.According to the DGCA, at least 15 passengers till date have been charged for violating Covid-19 norms in domestic and may be put on a “no-flying” list for a period of three months.“The possibility of taking punitive action, such as levy of spot fines in accordance with law, shall also be explored with the local police authorities so as to serve a deterrent for violation of Covid-19 protocol,” DGCA added in the order, issued Tuesday.The regulator’s latest order comes even as the number of Covid-19 cases in the country continues to rise sharply. the seven-day average of cases as on March 29 was 58,424, up from a low of 10,988 on February 11. It also comes as the number of air passengers continues to increase.According to DGCA data, the number of passengers carried by domestic airlines in February 2021 was 15.5 million compared to 7.7 million in January. Though departures and kilometers flown are still under pre-pandemic levels, they have continuously been improving.In December, the latest period for which such data is available, 64,002 departures took place -- translating to roughly 14,452 a week on average. Over the summer period, which DGCA considers as extending from the last Sunday of March to the last Sunday of October, the aviation regulator has cleared 18,843 per week.The aviation regulator also reiterated on Tuesday its older order issued on March 13. in which it directed airport authorities and airlines to take strict action against those not complying with Covid-19 protocols at airports and inside planes. Those found flouting rules may be offloaded and handed over to security agencies, it added.“The Airport Director/Terminal Manager, as applicable, must ensure that passengers are wearing masks properly and do maintain social distance at all times within the Airport premises. In case, any passenger is not following “COVID-19 Protocol”, they should be handed over to security agencies after proper warnings. If required, they may be dealt as per law.”Also read | Maharashtra rules out statewide lockdown for now, localised curbs possible“Our fight against COVID continues.Advisory issued to all airports to ensure compliance of COVID19 Protocol. People must wear face masks (covering nose & mouth)& maintain social distance. We are moving in direction of punitive action by police against passengers who don’t comply,” civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri tweeted.The March 13 order came days after the Delhi high court issued a set of guidelines that empowered airline crew to offload any passenger not wearing masks (or not wearing them properly) and put them on the no-fly list if they exhibited “stubborn reluctance”. The judge took note of the callous attitude of passengers at airports and passed directions to DGCA.Soon after, DGCA also informed the Delhi High Court that action was being taken against passengers not wearing masks properly despite repeated warnings and that they would be de-boarded from planes before departure and treated as “unruly passengers”.On March 16, four passengers on board Alliance Air flight 91 614 from Jammu to New Delhi were deboarded for not following COVID-19 protocols inside the flight, according to DGCA. The passengers were charged as “unruly/disruptive passengers” and handed over to security agencies at Delhi Airport.Last week, union Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the government has no plans to curtail flight services further amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). However, plans to restore full-fledged flight schedules from April 1 have been postponed amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.

The process is, when any drug or a vaccine is given emergency use authorization by the drugs controller general of India, its shelf life is determined by the stability data that is furnished by the manufacturer at that point in time when approval for an EUA is sought. As the drug or the vaccine becomes older, there is addition to the data and further extensions are given on the basis of stability and sterility data. The initial shelf-life of six months was approved based on the earlier stability data,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.Also read | Govt to ramp up Covid-19 beds as Capital adds 992 fresh infectionsConcerns regarding Covid-19 vaccine wastage were raised as SII began production of the Covid-19 vaccine before being granted emergency use authorisation for use in India on January 3. The company began manufacturing Covishield around October last year, and the product had a shelf life of six months.However, experts at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) said that vaccine wastage was not the criterion for extending the shelf life.“It is not done because of reducing vaccine wastage; that is a different matter altogether. Approving increase of shelf life is done under a due process based on the stability data that a manufacturer furnishes at the time of seeking emergency use approval and updating it at subsequent intervals such as 9 months, 12 months or even more depending on the type of product, and the duration for which it is in use,” said a CDSCO official, requesting not to be identified.“The data is analysed by experts to see if the efficacy of the product continues to remain the same during the extended interval. In future as the product gets older, if the company provides updated stability data for seeking further increase in expiration period, the experts will consider that too,” said the CDSCO official.The government on Tuesday reiterated that both Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in India -- Covishield and Covaxin -- are safe and effective against mutant variants of Sars-CoV-2.“Both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines are effective against the UK and the Brazilian variants of coronavirus, while the work against the South African strain was on at several laboratories,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Of 11,064 genome samples sequenced in the country, the UK variant of the virus was detected in 807, the South African variant in 47 and the Brazilian variant was found in one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-shelf-life-extended-from-6-to-9-months-govt-101617130309502.html
31-03-2021||India||Heat wave, dust storm hit NW India||Several parts of north-west India recorded heat wave conditions on Monday, which abated on Tuesday after dry, dusty winds started blowing over most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains, according to India Meteorological Department scientists.Most parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains also recorded poor air quality and visibility due to strong dust-laden winds blowing at 30 to 40kmph from the westerly and north-westerly direction.IMD scientists said loose soil combined with strong westerly winds led to these conditions. There is a 42% rain deficiency in March (till March 30) over northwest India, data showed. East and West Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi recorded “large deficiency” in rainfall, which is over 60% below normal rain.“There were hardly any western disturbances in January and February. In March, there was an intense WD but we still have large deficiency. So, there is loose soil which is making the air dusty,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to IMD scientists, dust-raising winds are affecting the entire Indo-Gangetic plains region. “Our models are showing that similar strong winds will prevail for 2-3 days. There is no moisture incursion over the region. Winds are blowing from dry regions to the west and northwest. Heat wave conditions were recorded over parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi on Monday because of clear skies, uninterrupted solar radiation and low wind speed but we do not expect temperatures to go up now because of the winds. Maximum temperatures will shoot up again from April 2 or 3,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Also read | Dusty winds add to pollution, mercury may rise from Apr 2Heat wave conditions were recorded in many pockets of northwest India on Monday, with severe heat wave observed over West Rajasthan and heat wave conditions in isolated pockets over Himachal Pradesh and East Rajasthan. Maximum temperatures of more than 40 degrees C were recorded in most pockets of West Rajasthan and Vidarbha; in many pockets over West Madhya Pradesh and Odisha; in some pockets over East Rajasthan, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Marathwada and in isolated pockets over Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gangetic West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra, Telangana, North Interior Karnataka, Rayalaseema and Tamil Nadu. The highest maximum temperature of 43.3 degrees C was reported at Churu in West Rajasthan and Brahmapuri (Vidarbha). Highest temperature of 42.4 degrees C was recorded at Jamshedpur on Tuesday.Maximum temperatures are likely to fall by 3-5 degrees C over the plains of northwest India during the next 2-3 days, leading to abatement of heat wave conditions over Rajasthan. Another heat wave spell is likely over the plains of northwest India from April 3, IMD said in its bulletin on Tuesday. Dust-raising strong surface winds (speed reaching 30-40kmph) are very likely to prevail over Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, West Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, north Madhya Pradesh, East Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal during March 30 to April 1.A severe heat wave affected Delhi on Monday as the maximum temperature was 40.1 degrees C, 8 degrees C above normal, which is also the highest March temperature after March 31, 1945 .According to IMD, heat wave is recorded when departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 4 degrees C to + 5 degrees C or more for the regions where the normal maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees C. Another criterion for IMD to declare heat wave is when departure of maximum temperature from normal is + 5 degrees C to + 6 degrees C for regions where the normal maximum temperature is 40 degrees C or less. (Heat wave is declared only when the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees C for plains and at least 30 degrees C for hilly regions).A heat wave can also be declared when the actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees C or more for a day irrespective of normal maximum temperature, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heat-wave-dust-storm-hit-nw-india-101617130189485.html
31-03-2021||India||Took the vaccine to prove to hesitant friends it is safe: 75-yr-old resident||Brij Mohan Vasishta, 75, was walking towards the hospital’s waiting area after taking the first dose of Covishield on March 6 when he turned around. He had forgotten to get himself clicked. He hurried back, whispered a special request in the nurse’s ear and was in the queue a minute later.The elderly man eased himself into the chair, pulled up his sleeve, struck a fearless pose and looked into the camera as the nurse obliged by pretending to inject him. His wife, Smita, followed suit.“Many of my elderly friends were apprehensive about taking the vaccine. I know at least four friends who registered for the vaccine immediately after seeing my photo. That’s why I did it,” said Vasishta, a retired property developer in Faridabad.He waited just 10 minutes; the shot felt nothing more than a prick, and the 30-minute examination after the injection passed by smoothly. “If you told me during the peak of the pandemic that vaccination would be such an easy exercise, I wouldn’t have believed it,” he said.He had read about some cases of recipients battling side effects but wasn’t concerned. “When hundreds of millions of people are getting vaccinated, a few deaths could even be of natural causes,” Vasishta said.Having lived through the first wave of infections that ravaged the national capital region last year, Vasishta was thankful to have a way out. “I had expected it to take at least three years for the vaccine to develop,” he said.He suffers from a host of age-related ailments such as blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid. And, he was quick to understand the threat posed by the disease that has claimed 160,000 lives in India. “Covid-19 is a death ticket”.But Vasishta was keen to live – and hence instituted a strict protocol for his family of eight, who share a four bedroom house in Faridabad.“For the first six months, my wife, 15-year-old grandson, and I did not step out of the house even once. Family members who left the house for essential services had to follow a strict sanitisation protocol on return. My eyes would always be on the door to see if anyone was leaving unnecessarily. The younger members of the family would be agitated by my strictness, but I was unrelenting,” said Vasishta.The caution paid off. There were a couple of virus scares but no one in his family was infected.As the months passed, his lifestyle turned sedentary, he put on weight, missed his social circle, and grew a French beard.He also patiently waited for the vaccine to arrive, following the development of the shots worldwide. And when it did, some people around him questioned its safety, but Vasishta said he imposed his faith in the medical fraternity.A few relatives dissuaded him from taking the jab early on. Vasishta heard about how the vaccine was not tested properly, it caused complications in people with co-morbidity and that it wasn’t effective in the first place.“On March 1, when the Prime Minister got vaccinated, all my doubts were dispelled. The next day, my children booked my appointment and I turned to my hesitant elderly friends to convince them to take the vaccine,” he said.Vasishta initially hoped to get Covaxin, the shot manufactured by Hyderabad-based firm Bharat Biotech in association with Indian Council of Medical Research.His preference was determined by media reports that said Covaxin (81%) was marginally more effective than Covishield, the shot made by Serum Institute of India has an efficacy rate of 70-75%. “Moreover, the Prime Minister was administered Covaxin,” Vasishta said.But on the day of his appointment on March 6, a doctor told him to avoid Covaxin because he was on blood thinners. Hours later, he was sitting in the vaccination centre, receiving Covishield.Vasishta is now waiting for his second dose, due in four days, going by the 28-day gap rule. Until then, he isn’t letting down his guard, except for one day last week when he took the scooter for a spin in the neighbourhood. “I felt I was flying,” he said.From April 1, India opens Covid-19 vaccination to all people above 45. Taking the shot is important, especially as the country battles its second wave of cases. The vaccination drive has been dogged by hesitancy, despite the shots being rigorously tested to be safe. In a new series, HT asks people who are eligible to take the jab, and busts misinformation surrounding the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-the-vaccine-to-prove-to-hesitant-friends-it-is-safe-75-yr-old-delhi-resident-101617130129525.html
31-03-2021||India||India supports UN initiative for ceasefire in Afghanistan, says Jaishankar||India backs a UN-led regional process to achieve a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan as the situation in the war-torn country continues to cause grave concern, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.Jaishankar made the remarks in Dushanbe while speaking at the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process, a regional initiative of 15 countries, including China, Russia, Iran and Central Asian states, to find a lasting solution to the situation in Afghanistan. This was the first reaction from the Indian side to the UN-led initiative proposed by the Biden administration.Addressing a gathering that included Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Jaishankar also said durable peace in Afghanistan requires a “genuine ‘double peace’” or “peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan”. He added, “It requires harmonising the interests of all, both within and around that country.”India’s backing for a regional process on Afghanistan convened by the UN – first suggested by US secretary of state Antony Blinken in a letter sent to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in February – came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that the country has been kept out of other processes such as Russia’s “extended troika”.Jaishankar said: “India welcomes any move towards a genuine political settlement and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan. We appreciate the international recognition of foundational principles that will determine their contours.”He added, “We support a regional process to be convened under the aegis of the United Nations. UN stewardship would help to take into account all relevant UN resolutions and improve the odds for a lasting outcome.”Also read | S Jaishankar, Ashraf Ghani exchange views on peace process in AfghanistanIn his letter, Blinken outlined four elements as part of a high-level diplomatic effort involving regional countries and the UN to move quickly toward a settlement in Afghanistan. One of these four elements is a meeting to be convened by the UN of foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US to forge a unified approach on Afghanistan. The date for this meeting is yet to be finalised.Jaishankar said the situation in Afghanistan continues to be a “cause for grave concern”, as violence and bloodshed are “daily realities and the conflict itself has shown little sign of abatement, whatever may be the promises”.Noting that the past few months have witnessed an escalation in targeted killings of civil society, he said that “2020 sadly marked a 45% increase in civilian casualties in Afghanistan over 2019”, while “2021 does not look very much better”.“The continued involvement of foreign fighters in Afghanistan is particularly disturbing. Heart of Asia members and supporting countries should, therefore, make it a priority to press for an immediate reduction in violence leading to a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire,” he said.According to a UN report issued last year, some 6,500 Pakistani fighters, including members of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jasih-e-Mohammed, were active in Afghanistan.A declaration adopted at the Heart of Asia meeting expressed concern at the “continued relations between the Taliban and international terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida” and emphasised the importance of ensuring that Afghan territory isn’t used as safe haven for any terrorist group, including Islamic State, al-Qaeda or other regional groups.The declaration supported all efforts for continued negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, and recognised the importance of neighbouring countries. It also supported the UN’s enhanced role in the peace process and said “any political settlement must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities”.A lot of speculation regarding Jaishankar’s visit to Dushanbe focused on whether he would meet his Pakistani counterpart Qureshi, but there was no such meeting.Jaishankar said that ensuring Afghanistan is free of terrorism, violent extremism and drug and criminal syndicates is a “collective imperative”. He added, “A stable, sovereign and peaceful Afghanistan is truly the basis for peace and progress in our region.”India has supported all efforts to accelerate dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, including intra-Afghan negotiations, and attended the inaugural virtual session of the Doha talks last year, he noted. “If the peace process is to be successful, then it is necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, with a serious commitment towards reaching a political solution.”At the same time, Jaishankar reiterated India’s interest in preserving the gains made over the past two decades in Afghanistan, including the democratic framework under which elections are held through universal suffrage, sovereignty in domestic and foreign policy and protection of the rights of women, children and minorities.Also read | In Brussels, Blinken offers boost for NATO, cooperation on AfghanistanIndia is also committed to the development partnership with Afghanistan, which involves pledges of $3 billion, including more than 550 community development projects covering all 34 provinces, in order to ensure a self-sustaining nation.As the lead country on trade, commerce and investment CBMs under the Heart of Asia process, India will continue to work on improving Afghanistan’s connectivity through projects such as Chahhabar port in Iran and dedicated air freight corridors between Indian and Afghan cities, Jaishankar said. Excellencies,A lot of speculation regarding Jaishankar’s visit to Dushanbe has focused on whether he will hold a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Qureshi. However, there was no official word from the Indian or Pakistani side about such a meeting.Ahead of the ministerial meeting of the Heart of Asia process, Jaishankar held talks with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Monday night and shared India’s perspectives on the peace process. He also met his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif and discussed bilateral cooperation, including for Chabahar port.Jaishankar held a separate meeting with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu and discussed “Afghanistan-related developments and our bilateral relations”, he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-supportsun-initiativefor-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-says-jaishankar-101617129829505.html
31-03-2021||India||Myanmar coup: Manipur retracts order to ‘turn away’ refugees||The Manipur government has withdrawn its earlier order directing authorities in districts bordering Myanmar to “politely turn away” refugees fleeing the neighbouring country where the military seized power last month.A fresh letter by H Gyan Prakash, special secretary (home), government of Manipur, was issued on Monday to deputy commissioners of Chandel, Tengnoupal, Ukhrul,Churachandpur and Kamjong.“The fresh letter was issued on Monday which directed the deputy commissioners in four districts to disregard the earlier letter issued on March 26,” Prakash said over phone from Imphal.In an advisory issued on March 26, Prakash’s office initially directed authorities and civil society groups not to open camps to provide food and shelter to refugees fleeing the neighbouring nation. It also asked them to immediately stop the Aadhaar enrolment exercise in the state, suggesting that there was the possibility of some of the refugees signing up for Aadhaar numbers.“People trying to enter/seek refuge should be politely turned away,” the initial advisory read.It added that in case of “grievous injuries” sustained by Myanmar nationals, medical attention “may be provided on humanitarian considerations”.Also read | Myanmar insurgents sense growing conflict, call for international interventionMonday’s advisory, however, claimed that the earlier one was misinterpreted and that the Manipur government has been providing all aid to Myanmar nationals who entered India via the borders with the state.Prakash too maintained that the Manipur government has been taking all necessary humanitarian steps, including ferrying some of the injured refugees to the state capital for treatment.In order to avoid further misunderstanding, the earlier directive has been withdrawn, the advisory released on Monday said.According to AFP, at least 520 people, including women and children, have been killed across Myanmar in the last one month. The military seized power on February 1 over alleged election irregularities following Aung San Suu Kyi-led NLD’s landslide victory in the general polls.On March 10, the Ministry of Home Affairs wrote to the chief secretaries of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh and the Assam Rifles guarding the Indo-Myanmar border, to check the influx of people from Myanmar and also to identify the illegal migrants and deport them.The Mizoram government, however, refused to turn away the Myanmar nationals. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18, Chief Minister Zoramthanga said that since the people of his state shared ethnic ties with the refugees of the Chin community of Myanmar, they cannot remain indifferent to their plight.According to officials in Mizoram, at least 1,000 Myanmar nationals have entered the state since the coup last month, news agency PTI reported . “As per the home department’s record, 1,042 Myanmarese nationals have entered the state till Monday. While most of them are staying in border villages and are being provided with relief and shelter by local NGOs, some are living with their relatives,” an official told the news agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/myanmar-coup-manipur-retracts-order-to-turn-away-refugees-101617129830287.html

31-03-2021||Today's||What the battle of Nandigram says about Bengal’s politics||All eyes are on Nandigram. The constituency will see a high-stakes electoral battle between West Bengal’s chief minister (CM) Mamata Banerjee and her friend-turned-foe Suvendu Adhikari, purported to be the most influential strongman in the region. This has rapidly turned into a battle of egos and perception for Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Adhikari’s new political home, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While it is easy to get caught up in the media frenzy, a close look at how the contest in Nandigram has unfolded offers clues into the changing pattern of West Bengal’s politics.As I have argued earlier, much of the state’s politics is predicated upon the control of the gram panchayats. This system, perfected during Left rule, ensures that the access of citizens to the State is mediated through a powerful gram panchayat, effectively requiring significant territorial control of villages for large-scale policy implementation.To understand the importance of Adhikari in this system, it is useful to look closely at the organisation or “disorganisation” of the TMC. Left rule in West Bengal was unique in India’s party system due to its level of organisational strength and professionalisation. While it employed local strongmen and had its share of charismatic faces, the Left sought to instil devotion to the party above all — so much so that voters would mockingly call Left rule in Bengal a dalatantra (“rule by party”).When the TMC surged to power in the 2011 state elections (but really in the 2008 panchayat elections), it had to manufacture a model of stable territorial control without the organisational coherence of the Left. What emerged was an inchoate collection of strongmen and their factions coalescing around the charismatic persona of Banerjee who could guarantee such ground-level control. Adhikari was among the best at this job. In the 2018 panchayat election, Adhikari ensured that the TMC was elected unopposed in 23% of gram panchayat ward-member seats, and that it had a strike rate of 79% in contested seats in his East Midnapore district. In 2019, even as the BJP swept surrounding areas en route to 18 out 42 parliamentary constituencies, it only managed to win two out 20 assembly segments in the parliamentary constituencies of Tamluk, Kanthi, and Ghatal — where Adhikari wields significant influence.Given the strong anti-incumbency faced by the TMC on the ground, it may seem odd that the BJP has been so welcoming of Adhikari and other “tough elements” from the TMC. But the BJP’s willingness to take in defectors is acquiescence to the need for ground-level control to win in West Bengal.When Adhikari switched sides to the BJP, and Banerjee forced a contest against him, it became natural to wonder to whom Nandigram’s TMC supporters were beholden. In 2019, the TMC won 63% of the vote in Nandigram as compared to 30% for the BJP. Is Adhikari so important to the TMC on the ground that he can take 15-20 percentage points of vote share with him to the BJP?Given the large-scale defections from the TMC to the BJP in the run-up to the election, this question is relevant for us to understand the extent to which such defections can dent the TMC. Indeed, the Congress too has a well-chronicled history of internal factionalism and party defections, something the BJP has readily taken advantage of in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Tripura.But the TMC differs in one key respect — the party structures its political appeal around the charisma of Banerjee (not unlike the modern-day BJP around Narendra Modi at the national level), whereas the Congress remains factionalised at the state level. This is something Adkhikari seems to have understood as well. While his campaign started with focusing on his previous work in the constituency, it soon became apparent that Banerjee’s larger-than-life image could not be defeated.Fighting for his political life, Adhikari and the BJP have turned to Hindu-Muslim polarisation, with Adhikari claiming that the re-election of Banerjee as CM will turn the state into a “mini-Pakistan”. This is all the more shocking as Adhikari was highly popular in the Muslim community as he presided over a TMC organisation with significant Muslim presence. This is to say nothing of the farmer protests in Nandigram that led to the ouster of the Left, which were also seen as a picture of Hindu-Muslim unity.Like so many politicians before him, Adhikari has cynically understood the political power that comes from communal division. Today, the fact that a quarter of Nandigram’s population is from the Muslim community and detailed “demographic” calculations in Nandigram — namely the significantly larger Muslim population in the larger Nandigram 1 block as compared to Nandigram 2 block — are splashed across newspapers in India. With just 16.5% of the population of Nandigram from the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe population, it is a sign that this polarisation has moved past its “subaltern” phase. This is also a sign that the BJP will seek to manage the internal contradictions of political defection and caste division through explicit Hindu-Muslim polarisation. I cannot predict who will win Nandigram, but I can predict one thing: Nandigram will never be the same again.Neelanjan Sircar is an assistant professor at Ashoka University and senior visiting fellow at the Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-the-battle-of-nandigram-says-about-bengal-s-politics-101617191813083.html
31-03-2021||Today's||China’s plans on Tibet and border infra will pose a threat to India||Tibet is under the spotlight after the Lianghui, or “Big Two”, as the plenary sessions (March 4-11, 2021) of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) are referred to. Among the documents approved at this session are the 142-page, 70,000-character 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025) and the Long Range Objectives through the Year 2035 for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China. The document, whose English version is yet to be released, sets out China’s national strategic intent and identifies core areas of national security and development with a definite focus on strategic science and technology programmes in the frontier areas. It approves projects of specific significance to India, shifting them from the realm of speculation, or potential concern, to imminent threats. These will put India under additional military pressure. The recent plenum decisions also reveal that China is turning Tibet into a military redoubt which, within some years, will become a centre of long-term pressure on India.Setting at rest speculation regarding China’s plans for the Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo), the document confirms that a number of hydroelectric projects will be built along the river’s lower reaches and that a massive dam — three times the size of the Three Gorges Dam in Sichuan province — will be constructed on the Great Bend on the Brahmaputra. The dams to be constructed on the young and fragile Himalayas will pose an ever-present danger to those living downstream, and adversely impact the livelihoods of millions of people who reside in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The related construction activity, as well as a huge influx of labourers, technicians and engineers, will raise temperatures on the Tibetan Plateau and accelerate the retreat of Tibet’s glaciers, which are the source of the Indus and a number of rivers that feed into the Ganga.One consequence will be the reduced flow of water. The Mekong River will be similarly impacted.Notwithstanding the ongoing talks for reducing tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and rebuilding of ties, the 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025) and the Long Range Objectives-2035 mentions a number of strategic military projects that are planned for completion. Many of these will reinforce China’s existing border defence infrastructure in Tibet and directly augment the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The G219 and G331 national highways are to be upgraded and extended to run parallel to the G318 Sichuan-Tibet Highway, which will also be upgraded and runs along China’s borders with India. The transportation network and Tibet’s links to the mainland will be expanded with the completion of the new Chengdu-Lhasa railway line and development of Shigatse (Rikaze), Tibet’s second largest city, as a rail transportation hub. The Chengdu-Lhasa railway will be the second strategic one connecting Tibet to the mainland and will be a high-speed railway.At least 20 new border airports are planned to be built by 2025. Identified among these are airports at Tashkurgan and Longzi. Tashkurgan is at the extreme west of China and the last stop before the Karakoram Pass. It comes under the jurisdiction of the Hetian Military Sub-District, subordinate to the South Xinjiang Military District. The construction of the airport signals that China is increasing its capabilities in this area. It elevates the level of threat to Daulet Beg Oldi and the Depsang Plains. The additional airport at Longzi in Shannan County will similarly add to the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF)’s capabilities in the middle sector of LAC and the Yadong area. India will have to contend with a much-improved strategic border defence infrastructure and considerably enhanced Chinese military presence that will pose a long-term potential threat. China’s 14th Five Year Plan and the Long Range Objectives—2035 clearly point to a fraught and possibly dangerous period in India-China relations that lies ahead.Jayadeva Ranade is former additional secretary, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India, and president, of the Centre for China Analysis and StrategyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/chinas-plans-on-tibet-and-border-infra-will-pose-a-threat-to-india-101617191632382.html
31-03-2021||Editorials||The scars of 2020-2021||Fiscal year 2020-21, which ended on March 31, has been a time of unprecedented economic disruption due to the pandemic. The Indian economy is expected to contract by 8% in 2020-21, its largest-ever contraction on record. To be sure, growth rates have recovered — from a 24.4% contraction in the June 2020 quarter to a 0.4% growth in the December 2020 quarter. But the economic pain caused by the pandemic is lingering. Poverty levels and inequality are likely to have gone up. Labour force participation rates have gone down. The gender gap among workers has worsened. The employment intensive sectors have shown less growth compared to others. And there remains lack of clarity about the pandemic’s adverse impact on the tax base.But even though the domestic economy suffered a big shock, the external environment remained benign in the past year. Oil prices crashed, which allowed the government to reap a tax windfall without stoking inflation. Since major economies increased their public borrowing and fiscal deficits, global finance did not penalise any country for what would have been seen as an unacceptable deviation in normal times. This favourable environment might start receding in 2021-22, as growth picks up in advanced countries and commodity prices start rising. External factors will be more of a constraint this year. India is also, now, staring at a delayed, but strong, second wave of Covid-19 infections. The last fiscal year began with a complete lockdown, but a second national lockdown is not feasible. At the same time, rising infections will not just take a toll on human lives but also impact productivity and economy. Bringing down infections, through enhanced and aggressive vaccination, has to be top priority from both a public health and economic perspective. But India will also have to do much more to both boost growth — by ensuring that there is indeed public investment as promised in the budget, and creating a more enabling climate for private capital — and ensure equity, given that there is real concern that the next phase of growth will sharpen inequality and there is a dip in planned welfare expenditure. How India gets back its growth, while taking care of the marginalised, will be the big test of 2021-22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-scars-of-20202021-101617191394535.html
31-03-2021||Editorials||The thaw on the India-Pakistan front||Responding to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s letter greeting Pakistan on its national day, Pakistan’s PM, Imran Khan, has claimed that his country seeks “peaceful, cooperative relations with all neighbours, including India”. Mr Khan also said that durable peace and stability in the region was contingent on resolving all issues betwe-en India and Pakistan, “in particular, the Jammu and Kashmir [J&K] dispute”. He then added that the creation of “an enabling environment” was “impera-tive for a constructive and result-oriented dialogue”.There are two ways to interpret this letter. The first, sceptical, view can see it as an attempt by Pakistan to hold the ties hostage to the J&K issue yet again, without confronting the issue of terrorism. The logical conclusion of such a reading would be that there is little merit in engaging with Pakistan. A second way to read the letter is to focus on why Mr Khan has said what he has, and what he has not said. A reference to J&K is imperative for any Pakistani leader to survive domestically. The fact that despite relentless propaganda over the past year-and-a-half against India’s moves in J&K, Pakistan has not made any tangible demands other than mentioning an “enabling environment” leaves space for diplomacy. This reading would lead to a different conclusion — of the merits of engagement. While India must have minimal expectations from Pakistan’s establishment and be prepared on the security front, there is a definite churn in Pakistan. Mr Khan’s letter, which would have been approved by the army, is an attempt to signal Pakistan’s willingness to engage, as is Islamabad’s decision, on Wednesday, to resume limited trade with India. While sticking to its redlines, Delhi should be open to building on the ceasefire pact and resuming a comprehensive dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-thaw-on-the-india-pakistan-front-101617191272290.html
