25-03-2021||News||In Kabul, be ready for political uncertainty||Afghanistan’s foreign minister, Haneef Atmar, was in Delhi this week to brief the Indian authorities on the recent spurt in diplomatic activity as the Joe Biden administration approaches the May deadline for United States (US) troops to exit Afghanistan. The problem is that the intra-Afghan peace talks have barely moved forward since the Doha agreement signed a year ago between US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban deputy leader Mullah Barader, and violence levels have been steadily rising, especially since last October.Biden is the third president to deal with the challenge of bringing US troops back home. In 2009, Barack Obama described Afghanistan as “the necessary war that the US must win”. He approved a surge in troop presence, from 55,000 to over 100,000 soldiers, and also quadrupled the number of drone attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but failed to blunt the Taliban insurgency. By May 2011, when Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Obama realised that the real failure lay not in transforming Afghanistan, but in changing Pakistan’s policy of continuing to provide sanctuaries to the Taliban, even while it claimed credit as a major US partner in stabilising Afghanistan. Frustrated, Obama reduced the troop presence to 8,500 by the time he left office in 2017.Announcing his policy in August 2017, Donald Trump said that though his “original instinct was to pull out”, he had been persuaded by the Pentagon to push for “an honourable and enduring outcome”, and added 5,000 troops while easing restrictions on the use of airpower. However, after a year, he too changed track and Khalilzad was appointed to open negotiations with the Taliban — this led to the February 2020 deal. By the time Trump left, US troops were reduced to 2,500.The title of the deal — Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognised by the US as a state and is known as the Taliban and the US — showed that the Taliban’s ideology had not changed and the deal was doomed to failure. Yet, such was the willingness to suspend disbelief that Khalilzad successfully persuaded everyone that it was “a peace deal” and not a “US withdrawal deal”, and that the mouse he pulled out of the hat was a rabbit. A year later, that uncomfortable reality can’t be denied. While no American soldiers have died in combat in Afghanistan in the last 12 months, the monthly death toll is 800 Afghan security forces and 250 civilians.The Biden administration is, therefore, seeking a “responsible withdrawal”. In an interview last week, Biden said that it is difficult for the US to leave by May, and a short extension may be needed. A new peace plan has been developed and Khalilzad retained to pull another rabbit out of a hat.The new plan envisages replacing the present government with a transitional government that includes the Taliban, and establishing a 21-member commission (including 10 Taliban nominees) to draft a new constitution. The Taliban and the government should reach an agreement for a 90-day “significant reduction in violence” to create a conducive environment for diplomatic efforts. To energise the stalled Doha talks, Turkey has been invited to host a meeting between the Taliban and the Afghan government and other representatives to work this out. A United Nations (UN) conference (on the lines of the Bonn Conference in 2001 that worked out the political road map for a post-Taliban Afghanistan), involving the US, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and India, along with the Taliban and other Afghan groups is proposed to discuss a unified approach.The UN secretary-general has announced the appointment of veteran French diplomat, Jean Arnault, as his personal representative to lead the UN’s efforts and prepare for the international conference. Arnault knows Afghanistan well, having been there from 2002 to 2006, as deputy and then head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.Last week, Moscow hosted a meeting of the expanded troika (US, China, Pakistan and Russia) with the Taliban and the Afghan government and other leaders led by Abdullah Abdullah, head of the High Council for National Reconciliation. While the intra-Afghan talks were contentious, the four extended troika states issued a joint statement recognising the Afghan people’s desire for peace, calling for a reduction in violence on all sides, expediting negotiations for a political settlement, urging Taliban not to launch a spring offensive and underlining that they do not support a return to the Islamic Emirate system.President Ashraf Ghani is unwilling to step down to make way for a transitional government, suggesting early elections instead, but the Taliban are not interested in the electoral route. The last two elections in Afghanistan were marred by controversy, which was resolved only because the US leaned heavily on Ghani and Abdullah to share power instead. A number of prominent Afghan leaders, unhappy with Ghani, have supported a transition as have Russia, Iran and Pakistan, leaving Ghani with no options. The political reality is that the Taliban had more loyal and consistent backers in Pakistan and the Inter-Services Intelligence, while the Kabul government steadily lost legitimacy because of its own incompetence and disunity, and because its backers in the West eventually lost patience and interest. By end-2021, the US may have ended its longest war, but for Afghanistan, the uncertainties are only increasing.Rakesh Sood, a distinguished fellow at Observer Research Foundation, is a former diplomat who served as ambassador to Afghanistan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-kabul-be-ready-for-political-uncertainty-101616682865210.html
25-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG assigns official to tackle encroachments||The charge of enforcement for clearing encroachments in all areas of Gurugram district came under a single official, with the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) giving the charge of enforcement to the district town planner (enforcement) of the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) on Tuesday. Officials said that this would ensure that violators do not use the multiplicity of agencies as a loophole to evade actionWith the development, RS Bhath, who also holds the charge of planning for MCG, holds the charge of enforcement for DTCP, MCG, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM). While the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has separate wings to deal with violations, officials familiar with the matter said that violations are few in HSVP sectors as most of these are planned constructions.MCG officials said that the decision to appoint Bhath as enforcement officer of MCG will help in curbing violations and illegal constructions in MCG areas across the city. With several private colonies such as Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok 1 and others coming under the jurisdiction of MCG for maintenance, it is important that the enforcement should either be handled by a single agency or official, said officials. MCG commissioner, Vinay Pratap Singh said that the suggestion to give charge of enforcement to Bhath was put forward by councillors in a recent House meeting. “Apart from this suggestion, the work done by the enforcement wing of DTCP led by him in private licensed colonies also led to this decision. The enforcement activities need to be streamlined in the city and having a single officer across agencies will help greatly,” said Singh. Over the last year, the enforcement wing of DTCP carried out over 150 demolition drives and got over 35 FIRs registered against the violators. The department also cleared illegal colonies from around 300 acres. After taking the charge, Bhath said that violators and illegal colony developers were taking advantage of the fact that the writ of multiple agencies runs in the city and they were able to use it as a loophole to evade action. “We can now take a comprehensive view of encroachments and illegal developments and these would be curbed across the city,” he said.The primary focus is to ensure that prime plots of the civic agencies that are encroached are reclaimed, Bhath said. “We have already identified prominent sites and visited three of them on Thursday. Likewise, a comprehensive plan is being chalked out so that encroachments and violations are brought to a minimum,” he said.The MCG areas form the core of the city, surrounded by HSVP sectors and private colonies, while the developing sectors along the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) and Dwarka Expressway comprise the rest of the area. “Each area has different issues and problems, but they need to handled in a centralised manner so that there is no loophole left to be taken advantage of,” he said, adding that a spate of demolition drives would be planned in coming weeks in all these areas after analysing the data. “The message is clear. As the government wants to boost affordable housing and housing for the poor, the city cannot become a hub of illegal colonies,” he said. When asked about the sealing properties in MCG areas, Bhath said that in future, the properties would be de-sealed only after the violators submit an affidavit and provide guarantees. The violations have to be restored as well, he said. On Thursday, Bhath also launched a drive to remove encroachments from MCG plots and visited three sites are earmarked for developmental works. The enforcement team took stock of illegal hutments, temporary structures and other encroachments that have come up on plots located in Vyapar Sadan of Sector 14, besides in sectors 53 and 52A. “Notices were issued, announcements were made and occupants asked to clear the sites within three days. If this does not happen, then a large-scale demolition drive will be carried out and the land cleared,” said Bhath. MCG officials, meanwhile said that illegal encroachments at the three sites halted developmental works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-assigns-official-to-tackle-encroachments-101616695884622.html
25-03-2021||Gurugram||Villagers cry foul over waste dumping on Aravalli land in Pali||Residents of Pali village in Faridabad alleged that civic agencies of Faridabad and Gurugram are illegally dumping municipal solid waste on Aravalli land, in violation of court orders, near their village on Wednesday. A complaint in this regard was filed with the police on Wednesday and the residents are likely to hold a mahapanchyat on the issue on Friday.Officials of the municipal corporations of Faridabad and Gurugram said that no further waste would be dumped and that they are working towards finding a space for remediation of waste accumulated at the Bandhwari landfill.Yashpal Yadav, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) said, “The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram sought support from us for finding an alternative land where refused derived fuel waste could be stored as they were finding it difficult to treat legacy waste at Bandhwari landfill due to lack of space. So, we provided this land near Pali crusher zone, where the waste was dumped.” “It was brought to my notice today (Thursday) that a case regarding this land, which was dismissed earlier, has been restored and after learning about the development, we have communicated to the corporation that this land has status quo. So, no further waste should be stored there and it should be stopped,” Yadav said. Dhiraj Kumar, the joint commissioner for Swachh Bharat Mission, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), said, “It is known that we need new land for remediation of waste already accumulated at Bandhwari and we are working in collaboration with MCF, but I would not be able to comment on it more as the matter is sub judice.” A complaint to the Pali police station on Wednesday states that in 1992, the MCF took over patti shamlat land (land which is for the common use of villagers with their ownership rights) from the villagers without compensating them. The villagers earlier moved the high court, which, in 2018, stated that either the land be returned to the villagers or that they must be compensated for the same. On January 6, 2020, the case was dismissed by the high court due to default, but a petition was filed in the matter after it was dismissed. Hearing the petition on January 21, 2020, the court noted, “For the reasons recorded in the application, which is accompanied by an affidavit of the counsel for the petitioner, the same is allowed. Order dated 06.01.2020 is recalled and the writ petition aforesaid is ordered to be restored to its original number. Let the main petition be listed as per roster.”Jitendra Bhadana, a Pali resident who filed the police complaint, said, “On Wednesday, officials from the corporation secretly dumped around 10-15 truckloads of household waste on Aravalli land near crusher zone in Pali village. They said that refuse-derived fuel waste is being dumped, but we saw that plastic and household waste was dumped. This has to be stopped. Else, it will soon become a dumping site like Bandhwari,” Pali residents will hold a mahapanchayat on Friday to discuss the land issue, which they say is their common land and that the matter is sub judice in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “Officials also cut trees there to make way for trucks carrying waste. Although waste is not being dumped after we raised the issue, it is a contempt of orders as the court already said that this land must either be given back to the villagers by the MCF or that villagers must be given compensation,” said Bhadana. The police, meanwhile, said that no action was taken against those who dumped the waste. Om Prakash, sub-inspector, in-charge of Pali police chowki where the complaint was filed, said, “Those dumping waste at the said land had permission from the MCF. So, no action was taken against them. We have further not received any communication from the corporation to stop dumping of waste.” The National Green Tribunal (NGT), while hearing a case on clearing of legacy waste from Bandhwari landfill site, on March 9 said that it was giving a last opportunity to authorities for ensuring meaningful action on the ground. Calling the treatment of legacy waste “insignificant”, the court also said that only 2% of the 3.3 million tonnes of legacy waste was remediated at the Bandhwari landfill site in over one year, indicating “that seriousness of the concerned authorities is lacking.” The Bandhwari landfill receives around 2,000 tonnes of waste every day from both Gurugram and Faridabad. Municipal solid waste from both these cities is being dumped at the landfill since 2015. As per a report by the Central Pollution Control Board submitted to the NGT in September 2020, the height of the dumpsite increased to 36 metres from 27 metres (as recorded by CPCB in February 2020) and the total waste dumped stood at 3.1 million tonnes, approximately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/villagers-cry-foul-over-waste-dumping-on-aravalli-land-in-pali-101616695884094.html
25-03-2021||Gurugram||Protesting farmers at Jaisinghpur Khera call for day-long Bharat bandh on Friday||Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border will be observing Bharat bandh on Friday, on the call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). Protesting farmers said that through the 12-hour bandh, they wanted to let the government know that farmers will neither give up nor retreat until the central three farm laws are rolled back. Traffic on the National Highway 48 is likely to be affected due to the blockade that will be in place between 6am till 6pm.Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the centre in September last year. According to the protesting farmers, the new laws might leave them at the mercy of private corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops.Sanjay Madhav, a member of the SKM — the umbrella body of farmers’ unions protesting at the national Capital’s borders— and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that while farmers had earlier called for bandhs for three to six hours, the day-long bandh on Friday is intended to scale up the agitation. “We will be closing the slip road and other key stretches at the protest site. Markets, stations, all public places will remain shut on Friday. We will ensure that there is a complete blockade on NH48 where we are camping, besides other places where farmers are in numbers,” said Madhav. He said that farmers’ groups had plans on escalating the movement in the coming weeks. “The government is under the impression that farmers will retreat if it stops engaging with them. They are underestimating the will of farmers. Farmers from different parts of the country are on the road for over four months now and the government is least concerned. The bandh will make the government realise that it cannot ignore the legitimate demands of farmers,” said Madhav. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that protesting farmers will ensure that various public markets at Rewari and Shahjahanpur remain closed as part of the bandh. “We will ensure that Bawal city remains shut on Friday. The Bawal market will not be open for business. Similarly, farmer groups in Shahjahanpur and Rewari will implement similar measures in their areas,” said Sohlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/protesting-farmers-at-jaisinghpur-khera-call-for-day-long-bharat-bandh-on-friday-101616695824099.html

Akhlaq’s son Danish, then 22, was seriously injured while trying to save his father.The victim’s family could not appear before the court on Thursday, the first day for the trial, after the charges were framed against the suspects on February 25 this year for the September 28, 2015, incident.The matter is being heard in the court of Dr Anil Kumar Singh, additional district judge, Fast Track Court – 1.“The charges were framed against the suspects recently. The defence lawyers moved discharge applications but they were rejected by the court. Now, the trial has begun in this case. The victim’s kin and witnesses are required to testify in the court for evidence,” said Yusuf Saifi, counsel for Akhlaq’s family. Saifi added that his clients did not receive the court summon for appearance. “They may attend the next hearing on April 14, once they receive summons,” he said. Akhlaq’s daughter Shaishta, son Danish, and wife Ikraman, are among the key witnesses in this case. Of the 18 suspects, two persons have died and three suspects were juveniles at the time of the incident. The court has framed charges against the 13 adult suspects. The accused who were minors at the time of Akhlaq’s killing will be tried by the Juvenile Justice Board , said Saifi. The government has given security to Akhlaq’s elder son Sartaj and brother Jaan Mohammad.Akhlaq was beaten to death and his son severely assaulted on September 29 by a mob in his village which accused him of eating beef. The mob -- which gathered following a public announcement from a nearby temple -- attacked Akhlaq and his son, Danish, even as family members kept screaming that the meat was not ’beef’. Later, a report by a veterinary officer with the Uttar Pradesh government revealed that the meat found in Akhlaq’s house was not beef. “The suspects have denied the charges. The court will begin the trial now,” said Ram Saran Nagar, counsel for the accused Hariom and Bhim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fasttrack-court-begins-trial-five-years-after-akhlaq-s-murder-101616695704142.html
25-03-2021||Noida||Supreme Court directs a comprehensive traffic management plan for Kaushambi||The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday ordered Ghaziabad district to prepare a comprehensive traffic management plan for Kaushambi within three weeks. It directed the formation of a committee of nine officers to prepare the plan.Kaushambi highrises are located next to heavy traffic areas, two interstate bus terminals -- Delhi’s Anand Vihar and one in Kaushambi itself -- and the Ghazipur landfill site. These factors played a role in increasing pollution in the area, especially during winters when winds are calm. The court said the committee will comprise the Ghaziabad’s district magistrate and police chief, Ghaziabad development authority chairperson, commissioners from the city’s municipality, the East Delhi municipal corporation and the Meerut division, chairperson of the UP state road transport corporation, a nominee of the Delhi Police commissioner, and the Delhi government transport secretary. Ghaziabad district magistrate will act be the nodal officer, the court said.“Experience shows that a direction by the court to the law enforcement machinery may result in some action, even high-handed action for a few days, until the position is restored to the original status which becomes the new “normal”. Hence, a comprehensive traffic management plan has to be drawn up to deal with the situation. This will be in addition to the directions issued by the NGT (national green tribunal) and will not detract from them or from the supervision by the NGT,” a three-judge bench said in its order.The court was hearing a petition from the Kaushambi residents’ welfare association (KARWA) against pollution.On Wednesday when different issues were presented, the court decided to take up the problem of traffic management in the first instance. The court observed that to resolve the traffic issues, a “unified approach” is required from officials in Delhi and UP.“After filing a number of petitions since 2015 and directions issued by the NGT, we moved Supreme Court. With the court’s directions, we expect that measures will be taken up by concerned authorities,” said VK Mittal, president of KARWA.The court also elaborated that the traffic plan would also cover all incidental aspects including arrangements for regulating traffic and earmarking adequate land for parking of public service vehicles.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond on the issue.“During the course of hearing, we maintained that none of the industrial units in Ghaziabad were using pet coke or furnace oil as fuel. We will abide by all directions of the court,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UPPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supreme-court-directs-a-comprehensive-traffic-management-plan-for-kaushambi-101616695224151.html
25-03-2021||Noida||Residents seek action after garbage set afire in Sector 63||Noida: Residents of Bahlolpur village have demanded strict action against dumping of solid waste on the roadside at Sector 63, after unidentified miscreants set fire to a pile of trash lying near the Hanuman Mandir on Wednesday. According to residents, the blaze burnt some trees in the premises and produced a lot of smoke, affecting the people in the village nearby.Residents said that while the Noida authority collects solid waste from Bahlolpur village and other residential areas in the neighbourhood, illegal garbage dumping continues along the road connecting Sector 63 and Parthala circle. They added that the roadside, which was supposed to be maintained as a green belt, had several pits where scrap dealers and factories located nearby allegedly dumpe waste and later set it afire.“In August last year, a massive plantation drive was undertaken on the same road, which already had a few trees. However, there is no trace of the saplings now. Even the trees are half-burnt due to continual dumping and burning of garbage. We have been complaining for months but no action has been taken so far,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur Resident Welfare Association (RWA), Sector 63.He added residents had to call fire tenders to douse the blaze on Wednesday.“Smoke from the fire not only choked people living in nearby houses but also damaged green cover in the area. What was supposed to be a green belt has now turned into a spot that reeks of garbage. None of the saplings that were planted in August last year have survived,” said Paramveer Sing, president of Bahlolpur RWA.In the past, the health department of the Noida authority has advocated for more awareness to control such fires.When contacted, officials at the Noida authority said they will look into the matter.“We inspect the area to ensure that solid waste is not dumped anywhere, but these days people tend to set afire dried up leaves. However, we are not aware of the recent incident but will get the spots checked and if there had been illegal dumping, remove it,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty, health, Noida authority.Officials of the horticulture department of the authority, meanwhile, claimed that the saplings were in good condition.“We have been maintaining all roadside saplings in the area, however, if there had been any incident or report of the plants being damaged, we will look into it,” said Mahendra Prakash, deputy director, horticulture department, Noida authority.Noida generates around 700 tonnes of domestic waste daily. The door-to-door garbage collection service run by the authority covers 1,40,000 apartments across 220 high-rise buildings, about 98 RWAs having 40,000 houses and about 70 small and big villages within the city, said officials. After collection, the garbage goes to 21 different ‘transfer stations’ of the authority where waste is segregated manually by ragpickers and later sent to the main storage facility at Sector 145. However, the menace of roadside dumping of waste still persists in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-seek-action-after-garbage-set-afire-in-sector-63-101616695165300.html
25-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic body starts to clean 11 untreated drains||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has begun cleaning the water in 11 major untreated drains before it discharged into the Hindon river.“In first phase, we are physically cleaning the drain at Pratap Vihar. We have built check dams at different locations that will help improve the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels by getting the water to mix with the air. We will also mechanically pump in 100 litres of oxygen per minute with the help of machines,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.The civic body has deployed several teams that will visit every section of the drains and remove debris in them with the help of earthmovers.Twocheck dams have been built atPratap Vihar with more likely to come up based on requirement, and 10 pumps will inject air at each drain. The authority will also deploy algae into the drain water, which have the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen but also is a major food source for aquatic life.The city discharges almost 286 million liters a day (MLD) of sewage into the Hindon, which eventually joins the Yamuna. The untreated water reduced the river’s DO leve to less than 2 milligram per litre (mg/l) of water and made aquatic life almost impossible. But the civic body hopes that its efforts will help the DO level rise to between 5 to 8mg/l.The 11 drains identified under the project are the ones located at Arthala, City Forest, Dasna, Hindon Vihar, Karhera, Kaila Bhatta, Nandgram, Pratap VIhar, Rahul Vihar, Indirapuram and Brij Vihar besides their sub drains.The project will cover all drains in the next three months, officials said.UP pollution control board (UPPCB) statistics showed annual average DO levels in the river Hindon at 1.67mg/l in Karhera, 1.25mg/l in Mohan Nagar and 0.38mg/l in Chijarsi in Ghaziabad.For the purpose of implementation and monitoring, the corporation has also formed an environment cell that includes officials and experts roped in specifically for the project. To filter waste from entering the river, the drain outlets will also be covered with iron grilles.“We have decided to use different methods which have been identified in consultation with experts and renowned institutes. We will introduce diatoms (a type of algae) that we will culture in our laboratories into the 11 drains. We will also introduce other micro-organisms collected from upper regions of the river. These will help increase DO levels,” said Dr Umar Saifi, an environmental planner roped in by the corporation for the project.A floating islandBut too much algae can be a problem too as it would be a sign that the water is rich in nutrients that plants take up and cover the entire waterbody, blocking its flow.In an effort to achieve the dual objective of removing pollutants and enhancing life, the drains will also have floating islands -- natural or artificial surfaces that will have water-based plants.According to Dr Umar, the roots of the plant will be underwater and take up the nutrients. This way it takes out excess nutrients.“This will help reduce odour in drains and also act as habitat for aquatic life. We are also planning small ponds near drains that will get treated water,” he said.Experts said that the processes taken up by the corporation will help in increasing the DO levels in the river.“The processes taken up for cleaning of drains will work up to a certain level but the water in drains should be devoid of any chemicals, pesticides or any industrial waste. Otherwise, it will kill micro-organisms. The revival of Hindon and its tributaries is pending for long, and it needs collective efforts by all districts in western UP,” said river activist Dr Chandravir Singh, retired scientist from a state pollution board.Singh filed several petitions with the National Green Tribunal regarding the polluted state of river Hindon and also its effect on groundwater in villages of western Uttar Pradesh.“If the processes give better results, they should be implemented in upstream districts too. The monthly data released by UPPCB also indicates that the river is faring poorly on various parameters like DO and others,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist and member of ‘Hindon Jal Biradiri.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-body-starts-to-clean-11-untreated-drains-101616695104099.html
25-03-2021||Noida||Pollution level spikes in Hindon, finds UPPCB report||Noida: The pollution levels in river Hindon have worsened in January as compared to December last year, as per the latest report of the state pollution body released on Thursday. The river continues being rated under category ‘E’, making it unfit for drinking, bathing or propagation of aquatic life despite conventional treatment and disinfection, the report said.According to environmentalists, the poor state of Hindon is due to illegal discharge of untreated effluents in the river by the industries and several unauthorised residential colonies built at its floodplains in Ghaziabad and Noida.While the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) report does not mention the data for industrial effluents like amount of hard metals -- mercury, chromium iron, arsenic, cadmium, lead, etc. -- the UPPCB has tested water on basic parameters and found the pollution levels very high. UPPCB analysis of the samples collected from downstream of Kulesra in Noida, for January 2021, found the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels to be 45 milligrams per litre (mg/l) against 30mg/l in December last year, which is 15 times the permissible limits of up to 3 mg/l. Similarly, the total coliform has been detected to be 28,00,000 most probable number (MPN)/100 ml (against 14,00,000 in December), which is about 5,600 times higher than the maximum allowed levels of 500 MPN/100 ml. The faecal coliform was found to be 22,00,000 MPN/100ml (11,00,000 in December) which is about 880 times the max permissible levels of 2,500 MPN/100 ml, the UPPCB report said. The higher levels of the total coliform shows that high volume of sewage is flowing through the river.The report also said that dissolved oxygen level for the river was nil against the minimum requirement of 5mg/l. Dissolved oxygen level is the life of a river, which being nil means that the river is virtually dead with water unfit for any consumption. UPPCB officials said they are ensuring that the industrial effluents are under check, while the current status of the river is based on several factors, including illegal residential areas discharging the untreated effluents.“There could be many factors behind the pollution in the river such as the total flow, status of its source and the districts it passes through. In Noida, we have ensured that the industrial effluents are kept under check and we also inspect the industries to see if their effluent treatment plants are functioning. It’s the untapped sewage that needs to be checked,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.According to Akash Vashishtha, a Ghaziabad-based environmentalist who in 2015 took the matter of pollution in Hindon to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the current state of the river is a clear indication that no orders or judgments of the NGT are being complied with. “In the 2017 judgement by NGT, there were common direction and principles for rejuvenation and revival of Ganga as well as Hindon being a tributary of Yamuna. However, the current state of the river is itself a clear violation of the NGT’s order,” said Vashishtha.He further points out that the river fails to meet even bathing water quality norms while no wildlife or fisheries can thrive in it. “More and more illegal constructions are being facilitated by government agencies on Hindon floodplains in Ghaziabad and Noida, which discharge their sewage directly into the river. It is pertinent to say here that the UPPCB has tested only the basic river parameters and has not tested the industrial effluents at all,” Vashishtha added. Hindon comes from Saharanpur and enters Greater Noida from Chijarsi border after passing through Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, and Ghaziabad. Throughout its 50km of length across Gautam Budh Nagar district, it disappears in almost equally polluted Yamuna at Momnathal in Tilwara village of Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/pollution-level-spikes-in-hindon-finds-uppcb-report-101616695044630.html

One of the suspects, Manoj (identified by single name), has been acquitted for want of evidence. The quantum of punishment in this case will be delivered Friday.Bhati and his accomplices were undergoing trial in the court of Dr Anil Kumar Singh, additional district judge, Surajpur. “The court has convicted 12 persons, including Sunder Bhati, while one suspect has been acquitted,” Brhamjeet Bhati, district government counsel (DGC criminal) Gautam Budh Nagar, said.Pradhan was murdered while he was on a visit to a neighbouring village to attend the wedding of the daughter of his friend Prakash Bhati, at a venue located under the Site V police in Greater Noida. His security guard, Sharma, was accompanying him. When they were about to get into their car the criminals sprayed bullets on Pradhan and Sharma, killing both of them. Sharma also opened fire in self defence during which one of the assailants was killed, later identified as Jatan Khatri, an alleged sharpshooter of the Bhati gang.The case had been pursued by Pradhan’s younger brother Ravindra Nagar. He had filed a complaint against Sunder Bhati and his gang members under Section 302 (murder), Section 147 (rioting), Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) at the Site V police station.Ravindra’s advocate Lalit Mohan Gupta said that this is the first case in which Sunder Bhati has been convicted. “In several other cases in which he has been accused, Bhati was acquitted due to lack of evidence as witnesses did not testify against him due to fear. In this case, the court had strong evidence and they were convicted,” he said.Police sources said that Sunder Bhati is presently lodged at the Sonbhadra district jail. Pradhan’s widow Bevan Nagar, on February 9, 2021, had filed a fresh complaint alleging Bhati gang members had been pressurising Ravindra to withdraw the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sunder-bhati-11-others-convicted-in-harendra-pradhan-murder-case-101616695044097.html
25-03-2021||Noida||2 involved in vehicle thefts for 20 yrs held||Noida: Two members of a gang involved in vehicle thefts for over 20 years were nabbed by Noida’s sector-24 police from the washroom of a compressed natural gas (CNG) refilling station in sector-53 on Thursday morning. The suspects were identified as Mustaqim and Iqbal, natives of Bulandshahr and Meerut respectively. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail. Police said a search was on to trace two more members of the gang who were on the run. Police said one of the suspects on the run was a scrap dealer who was planning to stand for the elections for the post of panchayat pradhan (headman) in Meerut. Police have identified four of his properties bought with the money obtained by selling the stolen vehicles. Police have recovered five cars --- two Santros, a WagonR, an Alto, and an i10-- along with two keys (used to break into vehicles), three car engines, tools used for thefts and a country-made pistol from the arrested suspects. “The group mostly targeted small vehicles. We have CCTV footage of the suspects stealing parked vehicles from 24 different locations n Noida and Central Noida. They mostly committed the thefts during daytime. Mustaqim confessed that he felt the parked vehicles told him to take them away,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1. According to police, the gang stole 20 to 25 vehicles per month on an average from Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Delhi. The ACP said the gang had stolen a car from sector-37 last week. Mustaqim used the profits from the thefts to help his wife win an election for the position of a block chief in Bulandshahr. “The vehicle models older than 2008 were stripped and the parts sold, for which they fetched ₹30,000-40,000. In case of newer models, they changed the engine and chassis numbers, procured fake registration certificates and then sold the vehicles for ₹70,000-80,000,” said Verma. The Noida police have identified dozens of cases against the suspects. The police teams from nearby districts will also question them. The call details of the suspects have been obtained as evidence of their involvement in the vehicle thefts. This is the second such case of vehicle thefts to be busted in less than a month in Noida. Three members of a gang were nabbed on March 2 from whom the Noida police recovered four vehicles, several keys and number plates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/2-involved-in-vehicle-thefts-for-20-yrs-held-101616694984061.html
25-03-2021||Gurugram||Residential sales back on track in first quarter, state realty reports||Sale of residential houses in the first quarter of 2021 has shown significant recovery in terms of volume, according to the latest reports released by two real estate consultancies that pegged the recovery between almost 90% of the sales during the same period last year to a 29% increase, before the pandemic affected the sector.As per the reports released by private consultancies JLL and Anarock, the maximum sales were recorded in the mid-segment and affordable categories, while the prices of properties increased by 1-2%.“Housing affordability will potentially remain extremely favourable throughout 2021. If the current sops and incentives continue, we will see sustained vibrancy in the upcoming quarters as well and end-users will drive maximum demand,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock property consultants. While the JLL report pegged the recovery in this quarter at 90% of the sales last year, the Anarock report stated an increase of 29% from the sales in the first quarter of 2020.City-based developers also indicated that sales had witnessed a spurt, particularly in completed projects, wherein a majority of the buyers were end-users. The low interest rates offered on bank loans and availability of finished houses have boosted sales, they said. However, they said that property tax in the state, coupled with high circle rates, need to be rationalised to give further impetus to the market.The report released by JLL on Thursday stated that residential sales in the first quarter of 2021 showed a recovery of more than 90% of the volume witnessed in the first quarter of 2020 in the top seven markets of Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bengaluru, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Delhi-NCR. MMR accounted for maximum residential sales, with 23%, followed by Delhi NCR, which accounted for 21% of the total sales across the country.The JLL report stated that 25,583 units were sold across the top seven markets, compared to 27, 451 units sold between January and March last year.“The sustained growth in sales presents clear signs of demand and buyer confidence coming back to the market. This has been on the back of historically low home loan interest rates, stagnant residential prices, lucrative payment plans and freebies from developers and government incentives, such as the reduction of the stamp duty in some states,” said Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research, JLL.The report released by Anarock on Wednesday was also bullish on housing sales in the first three months of 2021. Besides stating a 29% increase in sales, a 51% increase was recorded in new launches compared to the same period last year. It stated that 58,290 houses were sold in the top seven cities compared this year to 45,200 houses sold in the first quarter of last year.The mid-segment housing saw the maximum new launches in the quarter with a 43% overall share, with the affordable housing segment accounting for 30%, the report said.Praveen Jain, a city-based developer and vice-chairman of the National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), said that the sale of houses witnessed a spurt but there was a need to reduce taxes and that the recent hike in stamp duty, particularly, should be rolled back. “Under-construction projects, which were witnessing almost no sales, are also being sought by buyers, who are looking to invest their money or want possession a few years later. The market, however, is being driven by end-users,” said Jain.Another developer said that apart from rationalising taxes, the authorities must also make the registration of properties easier. “The new registration process takes a lot of time and needs to be streamlined on an urgent basis, particularly in new Gurugram, where the issue of property IDs has slowed down everything,” said Kamaljit Singh, vice-president, Bestech Developers.The Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), which has the majority of developing sectors in its jurisdiction, said that a nodal officer was appointed on Thursday to resolve the issue of property IDs. Munish Sharma, the municipal commissioner of MCM said that they would resolve the issue on a priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residential-sales-back-on-track-in-first-quarter-state-realty-reports-101616694925407.html

It was the second round of plot allotments to the affected farmers who are from Nagla Chhitar village, officials said, adding that the plots were allotted via lucky draw.On March 6, 238 plots were allotted under first round of allotment to farmers of Nagla Ganeshi village.“We have allotted the plots so that the farmers build their houses at an airport township in Jewar Bangar,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, GB Nagar.The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) is developing the township and providing basic facilities like road, water, sewage, and power connections under the “Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013”. Yeida is investing ₹350 crore on development of the well-planned township for farmers, the officials said.“Today, 767 eligible farmers got plots in Jewar Bangar.

25-03-2021||Noida||Noida: Random RT-PCR tests to be conducted in border areas||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has started random testing and decided to conduct RT-PCR tests in the border areas having more caseload to assess the trend of the surge in Covid-19 cases. A team of health officials randomly tested 205 people in the Ashok Nagar and Botanical Garden areas on Thursday. None of them tested positive for the virus. District magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar Suhas LY said the administration has adapted a micro-containment strategy to control the spread of the viral infection in the worst-affected areas of the district. “We have started random testing to assess the spread of the infection following a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in the district. Estimating the actual prevalence of Covid-19 in a population can help in issuing further advisories to employers and organisations, where a large number of people work and commute between G B Nagar and the nearby areas. Though no one tested positive during the random rapid antigen testing on Thursday, we’ll continue this operation at two different locations every day for a week,” he said. The district magistrate further said since the positivity rate in rapid antigen tests was mostly negligible, a decision has been taken to conduct reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in the critical pockets. “It’ll give us the exact picture of the infection spread and help us in keeping a record of the case positivity in the district,” he said. Echoing similar views, Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of Gautam Budh Nagar (CMO), said district health officials have been continuously testing at least 3,500 people per day, right from the first day that the infection was detected in India . “Despite a sudden surge in the adjoining states, the situation in Gautam Budh Nagar is still under control. Even the vaccination rate of the district is second in the state. Of the total 65,048 beneficiaries targeted for March, 60,587 (93.14%) people above 60 years and those between 45 and 59 years with comorbidities have been inoculated in the third phase of the vaccination drive month till March 25. This indicates that we will cover more beneficiaries than the target set for this month,” said Ohri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-random-rt-pcr-tests-to-be-conducted-in-border-areas-101616694924058.html

Based on that, orders will be issued,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner. Home minister Anil Vij, who is also the health minister, took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce a ban on celebrations in the open and gatherings due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the state. Residents across the city expressed concern as 256 new cases were detected on Thursday in Gurugram, taking the active case count to 1,339, while the number of active cases in the state crossed 6,700. “The Holi party planning started almost two weeks ago. Initially, the plan was to hold a rain dance party, DJ night and dinner for residents. Given the announcement by the home minister, all plans were cancelled on Wednesday night. Holika dehan on March 28 has also been scaled down. Not more than 50 people will be allowed, while other residents can watch the ceremony through Zoom Live,” AK Singh, president and chief executive officer of Enviro that looks after facilities management of Vatika township. He said that a circular was issued to all residents stating that no visitors will be allowed in the society on Holi. “Unless there is an emergency or senior citizens are coming to meet their children, visitors’ entry has been prohibited,” said Singh. Similarly, Ridgewood Estate RWA also restricted the entry of visitors. “People are being encouraged to invite a limited number of visitors, not more than five. If visitors come in large numbers, they won’t be allowed to enter. Advisory has been issued that parents should not send their kids to the park for playing Holi. Instead, they should celebrate it inside their homes with dry colours,” said Gurpreet Singh, president, Ridgewood Estate RWA in DLF Phase-4, adding Holika dehan on March 28 will be a low-key event. Members of the Qutub Enclave RWA said that the Holi milan get-together, which is held every year at the community centre, has been cancelled. “There will be no celebration in public spaces. Security guards and RWA staff will check if any rules are being violated. Residents have been told to limit visitors,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson. Rahul Singla, director, Mapsko, the developer of Casa Bella in Sector 82, said, “We have requested the RWA and residents to abide by social distancing norms and avoid large gatherings in case they celebrate Holi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rwas-ban-holi-celebrations-restrict-entry-of-visitors-101616694864606.html
25-03-2021||Gurugram||256 new Covid cases, highest daily spike since Dec 13||The uptick in Covid-19 cases continued on Thursday with at least 256 new cases being reported -- the highest single-day jump in the month of March so far and also the highest since December 13 when 275 cases were reported. With the health department expecting a further spike in new cases after Holi (Monday), it has decided to step up testing to more than 5,000 a day. The health department on Thursday conducted 5,275 Covid-19 tests -- the last time the department had conducted these many tests was in December. “This will be further increased as cases are expected to climb further in the next few days. Overall testing has been increased with the mass antigen testing planned in different parts of the city to check for the prevalence of infection,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Of the 5,275 tests, at least 524 were rapid antigen tests that were done at various camps in densely populated areas of the city. The daily positivity rate — proportion of samples testing positive among the total tested — also climbed to nearly 6% on Thursday. On March 22, the positivity rate was 3%, which increased to 5% on March 23 and 4.5% on March 24. The positivity rate has been escalating as testing has been increased, officials said. If the positivity rate remains below the 5% mark consistently for two weeks, experts believe that it is indicative of the Covid spread being under controlTo control the positivity rate, increased testing is required to identify cases and isolate them. Data shows that in the past seven days, more than 29,000 tests were done, as compared to 23, 895 tests done in the week before that. According to the district health bulletin, Gurugram, in the past one year has conducted over 910,528 tests after two waves of Covid-19. In December 2020, due to a dramatic increase in cases, almost 6,000 to 10,000 tests conducted daily. On December 13, a total of 275 Covid cases were reported in a single day, the highest daily spike before this Thursday’s.Due to resurgence of the infection, the active case count has now reached 1,339, while the total count is 61, 458, according to the district health bulletin. Among the active cases, nearly 93% are home isolated and at least 90 having moderate to severe illness are undergoing treatment in private hospitals. The death count in the district remains at 362.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/256-new-covid-cases-highest-daily-spike-since-dec-13-101616694864005.html
25-03-2021||Noida||Focused testing for Covid-19 reveals low positivity in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Focused testing to detect the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in the Ghaziabad district reveals that the positivity is about 0.23% (45 positive cases from a total of 19,615) in the samples taken from March 13 to 23. Officials said that the spread of virus is limited to some pockets of the district and that the severity of the disease is low at present, with most cases turning out to be asymptomatic.The drive, initiated on orders of the Uttar Pradesh government, will go up to March 27 during which samples will be taken up for random testing covering high case load areas, construction sites, street vendors, schools and colleges, domestic travellers, pan and cigarette shops, bus stands, sweets shops, liquor shops, malls, markets and also at shops selling Holi-related items, among others. Official records of the health department indicate that 7,187 RT-PCR tests resulted in 41 of the positive cases while 12,428 rapid antigen tests yielded only four positive cases during the drive up to March 23. “Focused testing is taken up randomly for different groups in order to assess the spread of the disease. The positivity right now is low, like it was during a similar testing taken up before and after Diwali festival last year. There has been a minor rise in the number of cases recently as compared to last month and this could also be due to people commuting to nearby states,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to repeated calls for his response. During the pre-Diwali focused testing, the health department, from October 29 to November 12 last year, had conducted 20,852 tests which resulted in 139 positive cases ( about0.65%). Back then, auto-drivers, beauticians and staff of malls, sweet shops, etc, were tested. Likewise, about 21,801 overall tests were conducted post-Diwali, from November 19 to November 30 last year, and these resulted in 257 positive cases (about 1%). The groups tested during the period included observation homes, urban slums and jails among others.“To check the spread of the virus, we have also expedited contact tracing and working on strategies for tracing, testing and treatment. During the last 14 days (March 10 to March 23) we have identified an average of about 27 contacts per patient. A majority of positive cases are asymptomatic,” said an officer from the district health department, requesting anonymity. The experts said that all precautions and Covid-19 protocols must be observed and more so during the upcoming festival of Holi. “It is time that contact tracing is taken up on priority and 30 contacts or more should be traced for a positive patient. This will be of great help in controlling Covid-19. The disease in patients at present is not so severe and patients are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. The official records indicate that from March 1 last year to March 23 this year, the district recorded a total of 27,073 positive cases and the health department completed contact tracing of 26,983 (about 99.66%) of positive cases. The figures reveal that a total of 499,984 contacts of the 26,983 positive cases were identified at an average of about 18.52 contacts per patient. The UP chief secretary in his recent directions on March 23 had asked to trace 25-30 contacts per positive case within 48 hours and to get them tested at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/focused-testing-for-covid-19-reveals-low-positivity-in-ghaziabad-101616694744093.html

Give consent on DL application now||: To bridge the gap between organ recipients and donors, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) and transport department have taken an initiative of making a response mandatory by applicants in the declaration related to ‘organ donor’ option available in driving licence application form in Uttar Pradesh.The step, officials believe, will promote organ donation in the state.Director Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences professor Radha Krishna Dhiman said,” The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road traffic accidents per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die every year. These people die an untimely death and can be potential organ donors but are left uninitiated due to lack of documented proof of consent of the deceased. In order to ensure the documented proof of consent and to boost the deceased organ donor pool in Uttar Pradesh this initiative is being taken, he said.”“I am thankful to the transport department which welcomed the initiative and proposed the idea of making a response mandatory by applicants in the declaration related to ‘organ donor’ option available in driving licence application form in Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, I have mooted the idea of pledging of organ donation on driving licence in Chandigarh which became the second UT in the country to do so,” he said.Transport commissioner, Dheeraj Sahu and additional transport commissioner Devendra Kumar, immediately gave nod to the concept of making a response mandatory by applicants in the declaration related to ‘Organ Donor’ option available in Driving License application form in Uttar Pradesh.Thereafter appropriate government orders have been issued to ensure that from now on for every applicant, through suitable modifications in online portal for application, it would be made mandatory for the applicant to exercise their option of being willing to donate organs in the event of death, upon their free will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sgpgi-transport-dept-joint-initiative-wish-to-donate-organ-give-consent-on-dl-application-now-101616694263996.html
25-03-2021||Lucknow||Holi in police station for possible trouble-makers in Bareilly zone||The Bareilly zone police have come up with an interesting idea to maintain peace on Holi day – they will “invite” people named in disputes to celebrate the festival at police stations of their respective areas to rule out the possibility of any law and order problem. Additional director general (ADG) of police (Bareilly zone) Avinash Chandra said “people named in disputes, who can cause law and order problem, will have to celebrate Holi at police stations.” The ADG has directed all police stations of Bareilly zone, which includes Bareilly, Rampur, Pilibhit, Badaun, Shahajahnpur, Moradabad, Sambhal, Bijnor and Amroha districts, to make arrangements for gulal and gujias and sweets for the “guests”. “It has been observed, over the years, that most of the law and order problems on Holi are caused because of disputes. We want to avoid it this time by calling members of both parties to the police station on the festival where they can meet each other in presence of police officials. The duration for which they will be asked to stay at the police station has been left to the discretion of local police officials,” Chandra said. Acting on the orders, the district police chiefs in the zone have asked all police stations to make a list of individuals who are known to have long standing disputes in their areas. The police will then inform such people to report at the police station on Holi day to celebrate the festival there itself. While the exercise of collecting names is still on, it is expected that close to 500 people will be called to the police stations in the zone on Holi.Beside this initiative, local police are also in touch with political and religious leaders to ensure peaceful festivities. Meetings of peace committees were also conducted recently at police stations across the state. The police in the region have taken similar steps in the past also to ensure peace during festivals. In some districts, police issued pink cards to people who were known to cause trouble during festivals, warning them against disturbing law and order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/holi-in-police-station-for-possible-trouble-makers-in-bareilly-zone-101616694144027.html

The delegation held talks with the Indian team led by Indus Water Commissioner Pardeep Kumar Saxena in New Delhi, after two-and-a-half years, with the last meeting held at Lahore in August 2018.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Indus Water Commissioner Syed Mohammad Mehr Ali Shah paid obeisance at the Golden Temple in Amritsar before going back. Terming the two-day meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission, held in New Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday, as a success, Shah said options for such bilateral meetings should always remain open.Pakistan had raised objections to the designs of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir; India had said that the projects were fully compliant with the treaty. “Our meeting is proof of the implementation of the Indus Water treaty. The treaty is being implemented and our ways of communication are open,” Shah told reporters at the Golden TempleHe added, “We are trying to resolve issues and objections related to the treaty via bilateral talks. We hope that the dialogue related to the treaty will continue, and our potential problems will be solved.”Arun Pal, Punjab Police’s protocol officer at the Attari border, said the delegation returned to Pakistan about 1.30pm. The IWT, signed in 1960, mandates the two commissioners to meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan. Last year’s meeting to be held in New Delhi in March was cancelled, a first, in view of the coronavirus pandemic, and the impact of India’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019.The IWT also stipulates that the water of the eastern rivers—Sutlej, Beas and Ravi—is allocated to India for unrestricted use. The waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab—has been assigned largely to Pakistan. As per the treaty, India has been given the right to generate hydroelectricity through run-of-the-river projects on western rivers, subject to specific criteria for design and operation. The treaty also gives rights to Pakistan to raise objections on the design of Indian hydroelectric projects on western rivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pak-delegation-on-indus-treaty-leaves-says-meeting-a-success-101616692884863.html

The inquiry was given to SP (Railway, Lucknow) as no one has been posted as SP (Railway) in Jhansi.Singh said the inquiry would deal with the all the aspects of the case, including the mental trauma caused to the nuns and the postulants. The inquiry was ordered hours after Union home minister Amit Shah assured at a public rally in election-bound Kerala that strong action would be taken against those who harassed the nuns. The issue snowballed into a major controversy after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took the nuns’ case up at a time the BJP was reaching out to the Christian community, which accounts for 16% of the electorate in Kerala.The nuns and postulants of the Sacred Hearts Congregation, New Delhi, were traveling by Utkal Express on March 19. The two young women accompanying the nuns were returning to their native place Rourkela in Odisha after completing their course at the centre.ABVP leaders also travelling on the train suspected that the young girls were being taken for conversion. A leader identified, according to inspector (GRP Jhansi) Sunil Singh, as Ajay Tiwari informed the Railway Protection Force (RPF) control room. As the train reached Jhansi railway station, the RPF personnel got into the train.A video that has surfaced and went viral on social media shows the policemen allegedly threatening and misbehaving with the nuns who were also forced to show their Aadhaar cards. A GRP official said the local GRP team reached the train on getting information about the commotion.“On reaching there, it found the nuns and postulants had already been taken off the train; since the GRP is a reporting thana, the ABVP leaders gave a written complaint on which inquiry was done and accusations were found false,” he said.“At the time our men reached, 20-22 people were there and charged up. The nuns and postulants were brought to the GRP station at 8pm. On being asked, the young women said they were Christians by birth,” he said, adding that then the officials of St Jude’s Church Jhansi also showed their baptism certificates to police officials.The nuns and the postulants remained in the police station for three hours before they were released in the custody of church officials. They spent the night in Jhansi before leaving for Rourkela the next day on March 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alleged-harassment-of-nuns-sp-railway-rushes-to-jhansi-for-formal-probe-101616692403920.html

25-03-2021||Lucknow||UP govt to help migrant workers set up own businesses||The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to introduce the Chief Minister’s Pravasi Rozgar Yojana in the state to provide livelihood and social security to lakhs of migrant workers. Under the scheme, the government would provide employment and self-employment opportunities to the migrant workers, between 18 years and 59 years of age, in their own towns, villages and residential areas, officials said. The migrant workers will be able to start their own enterprises by contributing only 5% of the total cost under the scheme, the officials said, adding that the financial help would be given based on the academic qualification of the applicant. “The data of migrant workers is already there with the employment directorate. Only those who have passed at least class 8 will be eligible for applying for self-employment offers under the scheme. Passing class 10 (high school) will be mandatory for projects exceeding ₹10 lakh. However, the academic qualification rider won’t apply to those migrant workers who will not apply for bank loans,” the official said. “Under the scheme, the academically qualified migrant workers would be able to set up their units worth up to ₹50 lakh. Of the total amount, 70% of the project cost can be availed from banks, while 25% will be borne by the state government in the form of a grant,” the officials said.“Through this scheme, the government will facilitate setting up of self-employment units for all the workers who are skilled. Someone could be a skilled electrician or a mechanic, or plumber, tailor, driver, among other things. If they want to start their own thing, the government will facilitate them,” an official said. “These projects will be financed through banks. Labourers and workers will have to submit a 5% contribution of their own. Such workers will also be a part of the scheme who decide to borrow money from their personal sources rather than from the banks. A margin money grant of 25% will be provided by the state government under this scheme. In this way, the project will be set up by providing loans from banks at 70% of the project cost. Interest will be payable only on the loan amount,” the official said.Under the scheme, the beneficiaries could also purchase light commercial vehicles for goods transportation.HOW TO APPLYThere will be an online system of application. After dispatch of application forms under the scheme, the workers will be imparted 10-day skill training through the Skill Development Mission, Entrepreneurship Development Institute, ITI and training institutes of the state and the Centre.“The margin money will be made available by the department on the lines of Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarozgar Yojana after sanction of loans and disbursement of first instalment by banks,” an official said. “The margin money amount will be deposited in the bank and will be adjusted in the beneficiary’s account after successful operation of the unit for one year. The bank will only charge interest on the loan amount,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-to-help-migrant-workers-set-up-own-businesses-101616688983763.html
25-03-2021||Patna||LJP seeks ‘immediate explanation’ from MLA who backed JDU nominee for deputy speaker||Embarrassed by its lone MLA who voted in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for the post of deputy speaker in Bihar assembly, Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has sought an explanation from Raj Kumar Singh on why he voted for the JD(U) candidate. LJP’s national secretary-general Abdul Khaliq served a letter to Singh, an MLA from Matihani constituency in Begusarai district. Singh has been asked to explain the reasons that prompted him to vote for the JD(U) candidate. “The party has learnt that you have voted in favour of JD(U) candidate Maheshwar Hazari during the election held for the post of Bihar legislative assembly’s deputy speaker on March 24 without consulting the party in this regard,” Khaliq said in the letter. “Such an act is not expected of you. Taking the matter seriously, the party directs you to give your ‘explanation’ immediately in this regard,” the letter further stated without specifying any time-frame. JD(U) candidate Maheshwar Hazari was elected as the deputy speakers in an election boycotted by the opposition on the last day of the budget session of Bihar assembly on Wednesday. Talking to the media, Singh said that he merely followed the party’s directive given during the election held for the post of Speaker in November 2020. “I had sought direction from the party leadership during the speaker’s election and I was told that since we are part of the NDA, we have to vote for the ruling coalition. I just followed the same directive and voted in favour of the NDA nominee for the deputy speaker’s post. I was not aware if the party’s policy has suddenly changed,” Singh said. Singh, after the voting, had praised the chief minister while extending his greetings to Hazari upon his victory. LJP’s lone MLA’s siding with the NDA candidate has come as a huge embarrassment to the party which had been at the loggerheads with the JD(U) ever since the Bihar assembly polls in November 2020. The LJP had fielded 143 candidates during the assembly polls, which caused huge damage to JD(U) on many seats. This is not the first when an LJP MLA Singh tried to be friendly with the JD(U). A month back, he sparked speculations of joining the JD(U) following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister. The LJP’s lone MLC, Nutan Singh and wife of BJP minister Neeraj Kumar Singh also quit the party and joined the BJP, last month. Chirag Paswan-led LJP, of late, had witnessed heavy defection with over 200 party leaders and office-bearers joining the JD(U) last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ljp-seeks-immediate-explanation-from-mla-who-backed-jdu-nominee-for-deputy-speaker-101616688024217.html

The notice, issued by LJP’s national secretary general Abdul Khaliq on Thursday, reads: “The party has learnt that you have voted in favour of JD (U) candidate Maheshwar Hazari during the election held for the post of Bihar Legislative Assembly’s deputy speaker on March 24 without consulting the party in this regard.”“Such an act is not expected from you. Taking the matter seriously, the party directs you to give your ‘explanation’ immediately in this regard,” the letter further says, without specifying any deadline.The election for deputy speaker was boycotted by the Opposition.Talking to media persons, Singh, who is MLA from Matihani in Begusarai, said he merely followed the party’s directive given during the election held for the post of Speaker in November 2020. “I had sought direction from the party leadership during speaker’s election and was told that since we are part of the NDA, so we have to vote for the ruling coalition. I just followed the same directive and voted in favour of the NDA nominee for deputy speaker’s post. I was not aware if the party’s policy has suddenly changed,” he said.After the voting, Singh had also praised chief minister Nitish Kumar and extended his greetings to Hazari upon his victory.Its lone MLA siding with the NDA candidate has come as a huge embarrassment to the LJP, which had been at the loggerheads with Nitish Kumar since the Bihar Assembly polls in November 2020. LJP had fielded 143 candidates, which damaged JD (U) on many seats. LJP MLA’s move is not entirely unexpected. A month back, he had met the chief minister. LJP’s lone MLC, Nutan Singh, who happens to be wife of BJP minister Neeraj Kumar Singh, also quit the party and joined the BJP last month. The Chirag Paswan-led LJP, of late, has witnessed heavy defections, with over 200 party leaders and office-bearers joining the JD (U) last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ljp-seeks-reply-from-its-lone-mla-who-backed-jd-u-nominee-as-dy-speaker-101616686224613.html

He appealed to the Opposition leaders to let him move out of his chamber, but it was not allowed and what unfolded thereafter was not acceptable,” he said.Earlier, when asked if action would be taken against policemen manhandling legislators, as seen in viral video, additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad on Thursday said the police acted with full restraint.“The Legislative Assembly premises is under the control of the Speaker. The police went there to extend support after direction in this regard. Any inquiry can be done only on the order of the Speaker,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/speaker-seeks-report-on-indecency-with-mlas-101616686163495.html

Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday said the shutdown had been called against the autocratic attitude of chief minister Nitish Kumar and the way police were allowed entry into the Assembly to evict legislators protesting against the Bill. “The state police have become Janata Dal (United) police. The police were deployed inside Assembly to get a Bill passed which would give them unbridled powers,” he said at a press conference. Yadav also hit out at the CM for trying to justify the police action inside the Assembly by reasoning that police were called because of the chaos created by Opposition members. “Doesn’t the Opposition have the right to protest inside the House over a bill or any issue. That does not mean police would be called to evict MLAs and drag out even women legislators. I have footage of how the police and others behaved on that day inside the Assembly,. All democratic values and ethics were thrown to the wind,” said Yadav. Highlighting precedents of laying siege to the Speaker’s chamber, Yadav said, “In 1974, socialists had occupied speaker’s chair and conducted the proceedings during Congress regime but police force was not called inside the Assembly.“Not only this, Karpoori Thakur as CM had referred a bill to select committee after stiff protest from opposition in 1978,” Tejashwi said.In 1986, when Nitish Kumar was himself a member of the House, Karpoori Thakur had sat on dharna for three consecutive days in the Assembly, the 31-year-old son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjd-allies-call-for-bihar-bandh-today-101616686164078.html

The FIR was registered nearly 10 months after the alleged incident in June 2020. In the mean time, the inspector was transferred from Lucknow to some other district, said officials. In her complaint, the woman had alleged that Dheeraj Shukla, along with three other policemen, barged into her house in Sector K, Aliganj on June 2, 2020 and took her husband into custody. The woman stated that Shukla threatened to frame her husband in a case and demanded ₹50,000 to spare him, said a police official. He said the woman mentioned that Shukla even forcibly took away ₹20,000 kept in her house and asked to pay the remaining ₹30,000 in 24 hours. The woman also stated that Shukla again visited her house on June 7, 2020 and tried to molest her. The complaint read that Shukla threatened her with dire consequences and she could not lodge a complaint due to fear as at that time the inspector had already sent her 20-year-old son to jail by framing him in a case of Gangster Act, he added. The woman reportedly approached the CJM court in the matter after her complaint was allegedly not attended by the city police.Inspector of Vikas Nagar police station, Anil Singh, said the FIR was lodged under IPC sections 452 (criminal house trespass after preparation to hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest) and 384 (demanding extortion in the matter).

Rajesh Parashar, additional district and sessions judge (Pocso Act) Bulandshahr, on Wednesday, awarded death sentence to the three accused. The three culprits - Dilshad, Zulfikar and Israel - had abducted the Class 12 student on January 2, 2018, from near her residence. The trio gang-raped the girl in a moving car and thereafter killed her and dumped the body in Dadri canal. Forty-eight hours after the incident, the cops recovered the body. All three were arrested on January 10 with the help of CCTV footage recovered from the Dadri toll plaza. After 104 hearings and testimony of 14 witnesses, the court awarded death sentence to all three. The court also imposed a fine of ₹2.10 lakh on the culprits. Parents of the girl were also present in the court when the verdict was pronounced. Death sentence for rape, murder accused In another case of rape and murder, additional sessions judge (Pocso court), Jaunpur, Ravi Kumar Yadav, on March 8 awarded death penalty to a rape and murder convict. Bal Govind had kidnapped an 11-year-old girl, raped and killed her by disfiguring her face with acid. After nearly seven months of trial, the court awarded death sentence to Bal Govind. As the culprits in both cases may challenge the court order in high court, legal experts feel that the judiciary must deliver speedy judgment in these cases to ensure justice to victims. “Speedy justice in such cases of heinous crime proves to be a deterrent for others.

The police suspect a theft of over ₹30 lakh in all the cases.While only one case has been registered, the incident was reported from ATMs at least three other locations, including Deccan, Vimannagar and Gultekdi area between March 14 and March 20.One of the four incidents was at the ATM kiosk of a bank located at Fergusson College road in Shivajinagar. The theft happened within 25-30minutes between 7:35pm and 8pm.“They were both wearing masks and caps to cover their faces. This is new to us and we have reported it to the cybercrime cell. There is no trace of these transactions. In fact, the man withdrew cash from the ATM, and the woman entered after he left,” said police inspector (crime) V Goud of Shivajinagar police station. The man installed something at the back of the ATM, withdrew ₹1,00,000 around 7:30pm and left. Later, the woman visited the ATM and made multiple transactions (more than 20) of ₹10,000 each and withdrew a total of ₹4,00,000, according to a complaint lodged by an assistant manager at the Shivajinagar branch of the bank.“The head office of the bank contacted the local branch that a suspicious activity has been reported from these locations. Meanwhile, the accused removed the device and left from the kiosk,” said Goud.A case under Sections 420 (cheating), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(c) and 66(d) of Information Technology Act was registered at Shivajingaar police station.“This is a case of ATM jackpotting. It is rare is India but is reported in foreign countries. A kind of trojan is installed at the ATM machines using USB. It provides remote access. Once the software is installed, you can access it remotely. This is a possible explanation for what may have happened,” said Rizwan Shaikh, a cybersecurity expert and chief technology officer at Prestine InfoSolutions Pvt Ltd.“ATMs running on Windows XP are more vulnerable to this attack. Windows OS (operating system) should be updated to newer versions. In India, a considerably large amount of ATMs are running on Windows XP. It is high time that these ATMs’ OS are updated. Also, communication between cash dispenser and ATM core software should be encrypted,” reads a part of a skeletal report on ATM jackpotting published by a government agency called National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Center (NCIIPC) which is run by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO). The NTRO was formed in 2004 and is under the ambit of the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), according to its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/multiple-atms-of-private-bank-jackpotted-over-rs-30-lakh-cash-withdrawn-in-pune-101616682263225.html

With the number of new Covid cases refusing to slow down, Pawar will interact with officials, along with public representatives, to take a call on additional curbs in the city and rural parts of the district. Pawar, who is also guardian minister of Pune district, along with health minister Rajesh Tope, on Thursday evening, met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at his official residence “Varsha”, to discuss the situation in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra, and possible curbs. “I am meeting public representatives and officials in Pune tomorrow to review the Covid situation there. We all know that cases are continuously rising in Pune. However, there is difference of opinion among public representatives on a complete lockdown,” said Pawar in Mumbai on Thursday afternoon. Earlier this week, Tope, during his visit to Pune, warned if the Covid tally doesn’t stop rising, then as a last resort the city could be locked down. Multiple districts in Maharashtra, including Nagpur, Amravati, Beed and Nanded have faced a lockdown due to a sharp spike in numbers during second week of March. On Wednesday, Pune district reported a major spike with 6,754 fresh Covid positive cases, the highest tally since the beginning of pandemic last year. With the daily caseload crossing the 5000-mark over the past one week, Pune is reporting the highest number of cases across country, with daily positivity rate above 25 per cent. When asked about possibility of lockdown, Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol resisted the idea saying it is not a reasonable option when there are alternatives. “The cases are increasing, but most of the patients are in home isolation. We are working on increasing bed capacity. TCS-Prayas report had also indicated that a lockdown is not the solution. We can implement current restrictions with more efficiency. If need be more restrictions could be imposed. We are working on increasing the health infrastructure. We are also working on increasing vaccination. A complete lockdown is not appropriate. but we can think of a partial lockdown,” Mohol said. Earlier, on Wednesday, when asked about the possibility of the lockdown in Pune, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had said that important issues would be discussed in the Covid review meeting on Friday. “The Covid review meeting is scheduled on Friday. Elected representatives and officials will be present at the meeting. We will take a review of the Covid situation and will discuss it,” Rajesh Deshmukh had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ajit-pawar-to-decide-on-lockdown-at-covid-review-meet-on-friday-public-officials-divided-over-necessity-101616681844554.html

However, the event got cancelled after a government order in the wake of increasing coronavirus cases in Punjab.The book, which was launched virtually in November 2020, is an anthology of testimonies, fictional stories, and poems penned by patients’ care-givers, providing gestalt understanding of the condition, which is still stigmatised.A patient herself, Singh, has been suffering epileptic seizures since the age of two after being dropped by a nurse.“How many people know that epilepsy is vernacularly called mirgi? Patients more often than not hide their condition fearing that nobody will marry them or hire them if their illness is disclosed. This is a far-cry from how cancer and diabetes patients are treated. One in every 26 people have the disease but very few confess to having the condition,” she says.The book, as its title suggests, urges patients to come out of the shell they have burrowed in after being unfairly snubbed by the society.Singh, practices what she preaches. She had walked out of a 14-year marriage along with her daughter. “I wanted to live life on my own terms,” she says.Singh has interviewed eight epileptic warriors, including an army officer and a Marathi actor, about their struggles.While researching for the book, she diligently and painstakingly verified the authenticity of each interviewee to weed of those merely seeking the spotlight.Her fictional stories also include romances. Each story deals with some aspect of the disease, the effect of alcohol, disco-lights and overdose to raise awareness while also engaging the readers in the plot.It also includes a chapter penned by her daughter describing Singh’s personal growth over the years.Singh also writes about the challenges she faced, including almost being raped while having a seizure.Singh has a helpline number 9872340169 and an email id preetisingh71@gmail.com to counsel fellow patients.

Cutting trees and erecting artificial ones to teach awareness is just plain ironic. I think we should use that money to start sustainable living initiatives and environmental friendliness classes for the PMC officials, who are the main culprit of the environmental blunder of our tekdis (hills),” said Siddharth Kulkarni, a resident of Kothrud.“Going forward, we need AI, we need everything that science provides, but not at the cost of destroying natural beauty. The same money can be used for tree plantation projects and maintaining the already existing trees, and protecting them, “said Asira Lele, environment lover and member of the Save Vetal Tekdi.“In 88 lakh, PMC can invest in German machines that do a superb job of re-plantation of an entire tree - with absolutely no harm to the tree itself,” said Lele.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/activists-nature-lovers-object-to-pmc-s-ai-trees-proposal-worth-rs-88-lakh-101616676742783.html

Sisodia’s criticism of the Central government came a day after the GNCTD (amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed in the Rajya Sabha amid protests from the Opposition. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Sisodia said the BJP is indulging in negative politics and alleged that the saffron party’s model is that of “theft and cheating”. “PM Modi is insecure about the rise of Kejriwal. Across India, the demand for Kejriwal’s model of governance is increasing, which can be seen in the recent panchayat and municipality elections that took place in several BJP-ruled states in the country. Kejriwal has a vision of development which is now posing a challenge to the BJP. But Kejriwal is a fighter. He will fight back,” he said.

Till then, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) plans to politically attack the BJP through protests. “Gradually, Kejriwal is being seen as an alternative to Prime Minister Modi. People are saying that if Kejriwal keeps working this way then one day he stands a chance to become PM. Unlike the BJP, Kejriwal does not believe in tokenism. From free water and electricity to bus rides for women, the chief minister has shown the country how Kejriwal’s model of development works. The BJP is bringing this law to stop Kejriwal from gaining popularity. It is meant to stop Delhi’s and the country’s development,” he said.According to the bill, “government” in the national capital would mean the “Lieutenant Governor” (L-G) in the context of any decision taken by the administration. It also states that all executive actions taken by the Cabinet or individually by the ministers will have to go through the L-G. Sisodia alleged the Centre is also stopping the government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme. He likened the Prime Minister to the father of the nation. “The PM’s position is like that of the father. He should facilitate states to excel and do better for their people. Instead, they are doing negative politics. This should not be done as it does not suit you,” he said.On Wednesday night after the Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha, Kejriwal took to Twitter and said: “RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill.

She did not give up. Sahu’s persistence paid off when she was among 13 transgender persons recruited this month as constables following an examination a year back.“No one in my family came to my rescue that day. My brother and father beat me just for applying and mentioning my gender,” said Sahu, 23. “I was in a pool of blood for hours in my room. I then called my friends, who admitted me to a hospital... Since then, I never returned home,” said Sahu. Sahu added her ordeal started when she applied for this job in 2017. “Things got worse after I declared myself a transgender person. But after my brother hit me, I decided to focus on the exam and show the world that I can be successful. They have thrown me out of the house and never acknowledged me.” Sahu said she started living with her partner, who played an important role in motivating her.Also Read | Chhattisgarh bars Holi Milan events in Raipur, quarantine must for outsidersHer partner, with whom Sahu has been in a relationship for eight years, said she would wake up early in the morning to prepare for the exam. “She is the one who worked hard. I always stood by her. Now I am very happy.”Sahu said she has deleted the phone numbers of her family members. “I have heard that they know about my selection, but they did not call me...”The story of Shimaya Patel, 26, another transgender person selected as a constable, mirrors that of Sahu. Patel, too, had to leave home in 2017 because her brother and father thought her sister was unable to get married because of her.“ I started living alone and started working as a maid...[my employers]...never understood transgender person. They used to laugh at me and used to keep me away from the kitchen. In 2018, when I went for work for a store, the owner called me at midnight and harassed me,” said Patel. “I begged, danced, and did all menial jobs to survive over these three years... But I never gave up”Patel said she called her ailing mother, who blessed her. She added the attitude of her neighbours also changed after her selection. “A person who had bullied me when I was in school came to meet me and appreciated me. He also regrets what he had said to me.”Krishi Tandi, 22, another constable, said people who would ridicule her and pass comments called and congratulated her. “There is a radical change in the peoples’ behaviour in my locality.”Patel said her father was a rickshaw-puller and her mother a maid. “I lost them within a year. My sister and brother never supported me. I worked as a sweeper and prepared for this exam,” Tandi.Sonia Jangel, another recruit, said her family was not supportive due to social pressure. “They are still not 100% with me but deep down they admire my effort... My mother was the happiest person when she learned about my selection.”Vidhya Rajput, an activist, thanked the Chhattisgarh government for recruiting transgender people in the police force. “This will sensitise people...”DM Awasthi, the state police chief, said the recruitment of transgender people is a moment of pride for them. “I personally congratulate the transgender people who got selected.”In 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the right of transgender persons to self-identify their gender and directed states to uphold this without mandating any form of bodily transition like surgery or hormonal therapy.In 2017, the Chhattisgarh police made transgender people eligible for recruitments.Earlier, only two transgender persons were recruited in police forces in India — one in Tamil Nadu, another in Rajasthan. The Bihar government has also decided to recruit transgender people to the police force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/against-all-odds-transgender-persons-to-join-police-force-in-chhattisgarh-101616673983352.html
25-03-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Blooming tabebuias and drooping jacarandas||Have you seen ‘Wild Karnataka’, the film? It just won the national award, even though as one naturalist, rather snarkily, said, “It should have been called Wild Kabini—not Karnataka.”That’s the thing you see. Not many people know this but Bengaluru is a city of nature lovers, tree huggers and flower peckers (the bird, not the human). They hike to Rangaswamy Betta, Savandurga, Nandi Hills and many of the rocky outcrops that are part of the Precambrian Deccan Plateau upon which Bengaluru sits. At 3,000 feet, Bengaluru is as high as Caracas and shares its temperate climate. Its citizens take the natural bounty available to them almost for granted.Calling Bengaluru an IT city is both true and a disservice to the state that it is the capital of. Subsumed by the startups and tech businesses that have made Bengaluru famous, Karnataka abounds in wildlife. Beyond the Bandipur, Kabini and Nagarhole national parks, which are justly famous for their tigers, leopards and elephants, there are the Kali Tiger Reserve and Kudremukh peak. The magnificent Western Ghats traverse this state. Botanical artist Nirupa Rao illustrates the trees of the Western Ghats in her book by the same name. Wildlife filmmakers like Amoghavarsha and Sandesh Kadur chase frogs, tigers, wild dogs and the wild Kali river all in one film. Shaaz Jung has immortalised the black panther in his photographs and Rohini Nilekani sings its paeans in her writing. So please, don’t call Bengaluru just an IT City. Walk through its avenue trees and change your mind.Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: Of hostage negotiators in city marketsThis month, the tabebuias are blooming everywhere, pink-faced and blushing in their beauty. Jacarandas—plump and violet—droop over the streets and fall to the ground. As the short summer wanes, gulmohars will flower. Fragrant millingtonias that look like long jasmine buds will attract barbets and orioles, mynas and busy sunbirds that will dip their beaks into bud. The flowering trees of Bengaluru are the subject of TP Issar’s books and naturalist Karthik’s excellent journal that you can read at wildwanderer.com.Several folks contributed to the flowering trees of Bengaluru ranging from a dynamic forest officer SG Neginhal, who worked with former chief minister Gundu Rao to increase the number of trees in the city. But if I had to pick, I would pick a German and a Sultan for changing the landscape of the city. In 1760, Hyder Ali, who was generally “rough and tough” to use a Bengaluru phrase, was so enamoured by the Mughal gardens that he set aside 40 acres to create a park called Lalbagh. His son, Tipu Sultan, added 30 more acres. The British tripled it.Today, Lalbagh sprawls over 240 acres in Jayanagar. The routine is that you walk or jog in the morning and repair to a darshini or MTR for a filter coffee and thindi (tiffin) after. Every second Sunday, a birdwatchers’ group gets together in the morning to spot flycatchers and shrikes. Ecoedu.com regularly organises educational walks that focus on the countless creepers and other quirky plants that make their home in Lalbagh. But the thrill of Lalbagh for geologists is that just beyond its main entrance lies a three-billion-year-old Peninsular Gneiss, one of the oldest in the world.It was a German horticulturist who took Hyder Ali’s vision to near-poetic heights. Handpicked by Maharajah Krishnaraja Wodeyar to landscape the palace gardens, Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel left his stamp all over Bengaluru. It was Krumbiegel’s idea to flank the boulevards with sequentially flowering trees: red silk cotton in January, pongams in February, pink tabebuias and purple jacarandas in March, Cassia javanica in April, scarlet gulmohar in May, pink bauhinias in June, rain tree in July, Colvillea racemosa in August, golden cassia in September, Amherstia in October and November, and fragrant white millingtonia in December. Then there are the Nagalinga flowers, which enshrine what looks like a Shivalinga, that flower through the year.For me, the pleasure of Bengaluru is its trees. Upright and noble, they offer shade without discrimination. They allow you to pause and ponder under their life-giving arms. And, they are the lifeline of what will now become the catchphrase, Wild Karnataka.This state advertises itself as “One State Many Worlds.” It isn’t nearly as catchy at Kerala’s “God’s Own Country,” but probably more accurate. Where else can you go white-water rafting on the Kali river, or climb Kudremukh peak, or visit the place where coffee originated (Baba Budangiri). Bengaluru is a hub, not just for IT but for many worlds, as it were.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bangalore-talkies-blooming-tabebuias-and-drooping-jacarandas-101616673503448.html

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde passed the order while agreeing to hear a petition filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) against BBMB and the Punjab government’s move to close two gates of Bhakra Nangal for repairs. The repairs will curtail 25% of the water supply to Delhi.Looking into the urgency of the case as it concerns water to the national capital, the bench agreed to hear the petition on Friday while issuing a notice to BBMB and Punjab.“Since it is a matter of fundamental right to water, we will not entertain any technical objections and if required, we may appoint a commissioner to visit the spot.”Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for DJB, informed the court that the top officers of the agency visited the site. He added they requested BBMB to postpone the repairs to July and August as the demand for water peaks in April.Also Read | ‘Kejriwal can be an alternative to PM Modi’: Sisodia on NCT Amendment Bill“If the repairs are integral to the water channel; we would not stop them,” the bench said.Singhvi said the repairs can be carried out later as well.

Vaze was arrested four days later. On Wednesday, the NIA has also invoked the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against him which allows the federal agency to seek his custody for a maximum of 30 days, not 14.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh who represented the NIA at Thursday’s hearing to decide on his custody said the NIA had seized 62 bullets from his house which he had not been able to account for. Also, Singh said Vaze was issued 30 bullets by his department but the NIA was able to find only five of them from his house.Singh also told the judge that Vaze, during the time that he was tasked to investigate the discovery of explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, had allegedly collected and destroyed CCTV footage of several places and used a fake identity card.Further, the federal agency also said it has collected forensic evidence such as burnt clothes, traces and samples from the five cars seized by the agency. These have been sent for forensic analysis and DNA profiling.Vaze refuted the NIA’s accusations in court.“I was the investigating officer for one-and-a-half days and I did what was required to investigate the case... Not only me, all crime branch officers and Mumbai police did (what was required), Vaze told the court.“But suddenly something changed and when I went to NIA on March 13, I was put under arrest by NIA officials,” Vaze claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/made-a-scapegoat-sachin-vaze-tells-judge-stays-in-nia-custody-till-april-3-101616672490412.html

The Maharashtra anti-black magic act was invoked against the godman at Walchandnagar police station. Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti members claim that multiple other people have also approached them with similar complaints against the man.The godman was identified as Uttam Lakshman Bhagwat, a resident of Gholapwadi in Walchandnagar area near Indapur in Pune district, while the complainant was identified as Dadasaheb Tamhane (45), a farmer in Aasu village in Phaltan region of Satara district.Along with Tamhane, there are six others who have lodged their complaints against Bhagwat in the case, according to members of ANiS, an organisation started by slain rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar. The transaction happened between Tamhane and Bhagwat through multiple online transfers between April 15, 2015 and February 20, 2016.Tamhane was first introduced to the “godman” by his friend in April 2015 when the drip irrigation system on his farm was destroyed by someone in an overnight attack, according to his complaint.“He kept telling us that a family member will suffer physical harm if we do not pay him so he could perform puja for us,” said Tamhane.The man also allegedly told the victim that they should not reveal anything about the puja rituals to anyone if he wanted it to be successful. “The godman has offered to find the person who had damaged the pipelines of drip irrigation in the complainant’s farm. He then told him that someone had performed black magic in order to damage his farm. The farmer believed him and agreed to get a puja done,” said Nandini Jadhav, Pune district head of ANiS.When asked why the case was registered five years after the incident, Jadhav claimed that the people in the village in Satara are scared of the man and refuse to file a complaint even though he has duped scores of them.“There are six other people who have each lost multiple lakhs. It is an open secret in this village that he has duped scores of people over multiple years. We have more and more complainants approaching us. The police were not registering a case before. I hope, with this FIR, more people will come forward,” said Jadhav.“This is the first registered case against him. One other complaint of cheating of ₹4 lakh in the past, before lockdown. But some outside financial settlement was done, from what I have learnt. Yesterday (Wednesday) we got the evidence and now we have a case against him. He has fled from his house, but my team will find him soon,” said police inspector Dilip Pawar of Walchandnagar police station.A case under Sections 420 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code along with Section 3(2) of Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013 was registered at Walchandnagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/godman-dupes-pune-farmer-of-rs-12-lakh-by-promising-to-find-why-his-cows-were-not-producing-milk-101616670982972.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||With stakes high, Himachal CM takes charge of BJP’s Mandi campaign||The elections to the four municipal corporations in Himachal Pradesh on April 7 are being seen as precursor to the assembly elections due next year as they will reflect the public mood in the hill state. After its victory in the two byelections in Pacchad and Dharamshala and in the recent panchayat elections, the BJP is looking to continue its victory march, while the Congress is grappling with factionalism. Though crucial for both the parties, the stakes are higher for chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, which is why he has taken charge of the local body elections along with BJP top brass to ensure victory of his party’s MC candidates on his home turf of Mandi. Thakur flew to Mandi from Shimla on Wednesday evening and held a series of meetings with party workers. The elections to the Mandi Municipal Corporation are being held for the first time but the saffron party is facing rebellion in almost half a dozen wards of the total 15. Pressure points in Mandi BJP leaders are trying to pacify voters of the rural areas that have been merged with the municipal corporation this time. The rural people, most of whom have farmlands, are opposed to the merger, while building owners resent the taxes that will be imposed on them by the municipal corporation. The BJP is also facing embarrassment with Mandi legislator and former minister Anil Sharma, who has refused to campaign. Sharma was side-lined by the party after his son Ashray contested the last Lok Sabha elections from Mandi on the Congress ticket. Sharma, who held the power portfolio in the Jai Ram Thakur ministry, was forced to give up his cabinet berth ahead of the general election. He had been lying low and maintaining a distance from the chief minister ever since. However, during the recent budget session, Sharma’s anger was visible when he cornered his own government over issues related to development in Mandi. Sharma, along with son Ashray and father Sukh Ram, had switched to the BJP ahead of the 2017 assembly elections. A three-time MLA from Mandi and a former Rajya Sabha member, Sharma had served as minister of state in the Virbhadra Singh ministry from 1993 to 1996 and had resigned from the council of ministers after Sukh Ram was arrested in the telecom scam. He later joined the Himachal Vikas Congress floated by Sukh Ram after his expulsion from the Congress in 1997. This time, Anil’s son Ashray, who is the Congress general secretary, is actively campaigning for the party. Word of caution for Anil Sharma The BJP has entrusted the responsibility of the Mandi campaign to Sharma’s rival and jal shakti minister Mahender Singh Thakur. Sharma was not included in any of the panels constituted by the party for deciding on candidates for the municipal corporation elections. State BJP chief Suresh Kashyap warned Sharma of action if he worked against the interest of the party. In reply to a question during a press conference in Mandi, Kashyap said: “The party will definitely take action against Sharma.” He, however, downplayed the dissidence after local leaders at the forefront of the party were denied the party ticket for the MC elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-stakes-high-himachal-cm-takes-charge-of-bjp-s-mandi-campaign-101616670142919.html

The probe was ordered after the church media commission said Bajrang Dal men confronted the nuns when they were on their way from Delhi to Odisha on the train on March 19 for Easter celebrations. The church said the nuns were verbally abused and the men tried to attack them after accusing them of taking the postulants accompanying them for religious conversion.Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in poll-bound Kerala on Wednesday, assured action over the harassment. The assurance came after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation.

25-03-2021||Pune||Taste of life: In a dog fight for a puran-poli||The year was 1862, and the month probably March. A feast was organised by one Mr Vidwans who lived in Sadashiv peth, on the completion of some religious rituals by his wife. Fifty-one priests and 21 couples were the guests of honour. There were a hundred other guests who were invited for the feast which was to follow the puja in the morning. The venue was the narrow lane in front of Mr Vidwans’ house. Puran-poli (flatbread stuffed with a sweet filling made from skinned split bengal gram, jaggery, cardamom and nutmeg) was served to the guests. One could imagine the guests relishing hot puran-polis drenched in homemade ghee. The feast went on till late afternoon after which the lane went silent. Leaf plates, half eaten puran-polis and other leftovers were strewn all over. A few men and children were now busy rummaging through the heaps of plates. They belonged to the so-called “lower castes” and were allowed to gather the leftover food after the feasts were over.That night, Mr Vidwans was woken up by the incessant barking of dogs. Assuming there was a thief trying to break in, he went out to take a look and was surprised to find a terrified woman trying to pick a puran-poli from a heap of leaf plates. She already had one in her hand. The dogs, wanting to have a bite as well, were trying to chase her out.Tattered copies of “Jnanaprakash” from the archives of the Savitribai Phule Pune University tell us about a mini scandal that broke after the woman was found competing with dogs for a puran-poli. Though the newspaper does not reveal her identity, it mentions that she was an “upper caste” widow who lived with her in-laws nearby. She had heard the men of the house talk about the feast and had sneaked out in the night to have the leftovers.She was not supposed to be seen outside her home in the night. She was not supposed to be anywhere near the feast. Her presence was considered a bad omen. And yet, there she was.She was 18. And hungry. She had not eaten for two days.Widows in colonial India were routinely subjected to several dehumanising practices. They were forced to tonsure. They were allowed to cook in some households, but had to use a separate stove and utensils for cooking their own food.The easiest and most brutal way of controlling someone is through food, by restricting what they can or cannot eat. Widows in India were hit where it hurt the most.They were to eat only once a day. They were allowed to have some puffed rice and milk for dinner. They would sit on the floor in the kitchen for their meals, with their faces towards the wall. There was a long list of don’ts: No meat, no onion and garlic, no spices, no red lentils.Some widows were not allowed to eat salt. Cucumbers and bananas were out of question too, because of their phallic shapes. These were also considered “heaty” foods that would ignite their passions. Passion was not allowed in the husks of womanhood that widows were supposed to be.Widows often had to rely on other women of the household to satiate their hunger. Women of the family ate after men finished their meal. They had to manage with leftovers most of the time. Their meals rarely comprised vegetables. The skin of different vegetables like pointed gourd, bottle gourd and ridge gourd were roasted with sesame seeds and peanuts and eaten with rice. Women were bound to consume everything, since the best was always kept aside for men. But, widows were often denied that privilege too.Adherence to these practices persisted even after the Hindu Widows’ Remarriage Act of 1856, which reversed the hateful convention of forbidding widows from remarrying, and the British outlawing of sati, the horrifically theatrical practice of making a widow self-immolate on her husband’s funeral pyre. The stigmas around widowhood did not die with these formal, legal mandates. They still flourished in private. Even as these reforms were taking shape in colonial Maharashtra, women were still collateral damage.A small debate ensued after Mr Vidwans apprehended the woman with a puran-poli in her hand. The orthodox were quick to point out that the liberals were behind such outrageous acts and, that widows had to be controlled with more diligence. A few wrote about the ill practices surrounding religious feasts. No one spoke about the woman’s hunger.There are only a few issues of the newspaper in the archives and they do not mention the woman with a puran-poli again.I just hope she could eat the puran-poli that night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-in-a-dog-fight-for-a-puranpoli-101616669002917.html

25-03-2021||Bhopal||Munawar Faruqui case: Co-accused comedian takes to working as labourer to make ends meet||Bringing smiles to the faces of people was his passion and watching hundreds of people gather to attend his programme was among his reasons to live. An incident turned his life upside down and forced 25-year-old Nalin Yadav to quit his passion as a stand-up comedian and work as a labourer. Yadav is co-accused in a case of famous stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. He was arrested along with five others including Faruqui and he spent 57 days in Indore jail. The arrest took place on January 1, Faruqui, the comedian from Gujarat, was arrested by police along with four others on the complaint filed by Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of BJP MP, for allegedly hurting religious sentiments by making indecent remarks against Hindu deities during his comic show in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. These 57 days changed his life to an extent that a comedy star of the city is now working as a labourer in an industrial area in Pithampur of Dhar district to earn ₹200 per day. “In my childhood, friends and neighbours used to say that I have a very good sense of humour and I have the talent to make people laugh. I took these words very seriously and decided to become a comedian. I didn’t feel bad when I used to receive appreciation of one or two people on my jokes but now after doing hard work, today I am left with nothing but to do petty jobs to make ends meet,” said Yadav who has been doing comedy show for the past 5-6 years in Indore. Yadav said, “I lost my father a few years ago and mother four months ago but my friends, relatives and neighbours showered immense love on me and my 17-year-old brother Akash. We never felt alone.” “Even when I was in jail, I didn’t feel felt bad and depressed because of the support of people and four friends - Prakhar Vyas, Edwin, Sadaqat Pathan - and a minor, who used to support me in organizing the comedy shows,” said Yadav. Yadav thought when he would come out of jail, people would sympathise with him and support him, instead, many broke all ties with him and his brother. “In the past 25 days, hardly anyone called me to know my condition. Neighbours saw me as if I am a dreaded criminal or some obscene person. A few friends, who really helped my brother with collecting money for my bail, don’t want to support me anymore,” he added. “After coming out of jail, I contacted some café owners in Indore where I used to perform as a comedian and earn money but nobody is even ready to talk to me. They requested me not to call them because they don’t want anyone to know that they are associated with me in any manner. Now, I have lost hopes. Three days a week, I spend convincing people that I didn’t do anything wrong and four days I work as a labourer at an industry. My younger brother is also doing a private job to restart life,” said Yadav. People asked me to upload the video on the whole incident but I don’t want to take advantage of a situation that only took things away from me, he added. Recalling January 1, when Yadav was arrested with five others, he said, “My whole hard work went in vain because a few people got confused and lodged a ‘fake’ ‘complaint without any proof. On that day, I gave an opening performance of five minutes for Faruqui and when he came upon the stage, people created ruckus and attacked us. Many people ran away from the venue but we five chose to stand by Faruqui to keep the tradition of comedy show alive in the city and to save the honour of the city.” “When we were taken to the police station, we thought that we were the victims but late in the night, we came to know that we were the accused and will be sent to jail,” he added. He said, “I don’t know whether I will continue in this city or not. But I am afraid of losing my confidence, facing people and having doubt on my words that spread smiles on the faces of people for five years”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/munawar-faruqui-case-co-accused-comedian-takes-to-working-as-labourer-to-make-ends-meet-101616666662841.html
25-03-2021||Patna||Day after police files FIR over assembly ruckus, Tejashwi Yadav says 'not scared of batons'||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday slammed the Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar over the Special Armed Police Bill, 2021. Asserting that the protests against the bill will continue, Yadav said "they will not be scared of batons" referring to the chaos in state assembly two days earlier."Bihar Police has become Janta Dal-United's and Nitish Kumar's Police. Officers and the chief minister should realise that we aren't Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) that will be scared of batons," news agency ANI quoted Yadav as saying. "Nitish Kumar will have to take back the black law or amend it," he added.On March 23, the state assembly passed a Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 while the opposition staged a walkout. The bill sparked major chaos in the assembly as police in heavy riot gears were seen evicting the lawmakers. Marshals were also called to the premises to prevent the agitated legislators from getting physical with those in the treasury benches.As the opposition is targeting the state government over calling police to the assembly, state chief minister Nitish Kumar has defended it saying, "It's in Speaker's hands that he can take any help to control the situation. Everyone knows how the Speaker's chamber was gheraoed and what was done in front of his Chair in the House."Meanwhile, state police registered a First Information Report (FIR) RJD leaders including Yadav, Tej Pratap Yadav, and other unnamed party workers on Wednesday, news agency ANI reported.The Bihar Special Armed Police Bill seeks to give more teeth to the state police and if enacted successfully it will change the military police to special armed forces that can be deployed to secure industrial units in the lines of the Central Industrial Security Force. The opposition has criticised the bill saying that it gives police to arrest anyone without a warrant. However, the state government has termed it as "need of the hour."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/day-after-police-files-fir-over-assembly-ruckus-tejashwi-yadav-says-not-scared-of-batons-101616666368420.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh moves Bombay HC, seeks CBI probe against Anil Deshmukh||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday moved the Bombay High Court in a criminal PIL seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the alleged corruption charges against Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.Singh, who was shunted out as Mumbai Police Commissioner in the wake of the Antilia bomb scare case, has also challenged the government's order transferring him from the post.The ex-Mumbai top cop met a setback for his case yesterday, when the Supreme Court refused to entertain his plea on the same and asked him to approach the Bombay High Court instead. The top court had said that the allegations and counter-allegations between Singh and Deshmukh are "serious" but the case should be heard by the High Court first.The Mahavikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra, led by the Shiv Sena, the NCP, and the Congress, has been facing turmoil after Singh alleged that the state's home minister gave a target to cops to collect ₹100 crore every month.In his petition to the Supreme Court yesterday, Singh had claimed that the Maharashtra home minister "pressurised" him to probe the role of certain BJP leaders and to "somehow implicate" them in the case of the death of MP Mohan Delkar.Noting that the High Court is competent enough to deal with this issue, the top court had pointed out that the concerned parties were "quite hunky-dory" in the past but were now making allegations against each other after a fallout.Singh had reportedly written a letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray claiming Deshmukh's involvement in severe "malpractices". The Maharashtra home minister, for his part, refuted all the allegations made against him by former Mumbai top cop. Deshmukh said that the police officer made these false allegations to save himself from legal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-moves-bombay-hc-seeks-cbi-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101616663713394.html

The incident took place in Barkela village under Chaibasa muffasil police station (PS) in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand on Wednesday, the police said on Thursday.Sonaram Gope, in his late twenties, had been absconding since a case (No: 161/20) on charges of raping a minor girl was lodged against him in Chaibasa muffasil PS in November last year.“Rape accused Sonaram Gope tried to slit his throat after locking himself in a room in his house in Naxal-hit Barkela village under Chaibasa muffasil PS when a police team reached the village with the dakua (village head). Police rescued him by breaking open the door of the room and rushed him to Chaibasa Sadar Hospital (CSH). He was then taken to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital (MGMMCH) in Jamshedpur and was later referred to Ranchi RIMS,” Dilip Xalxo, Chaibasa (Sadar) sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), said.The SDPO said Sonaram was wanted under POCSO Act for raping a minor girl in November last year and had been absconding for the past four months.“The court has also issued an attachment warrant against him. But he was dodging the police all this while. On a tip-off, the police team went to arrest him on Wednesday. The area is highly sensitive because of the presence of Naxals and he was exploiting this. He is, however, out of danger now according to the doctors,” added Xalxo.On the other hand, Sonaram accused the police of entrapping him in a fake rape case. “I was being harassed by the police continuously. I am not involved in any rape case, including the case that has been lodged against me. The police have trapped me in a fake case. I was so panicked that I decided to take my life when I saw the police in the village to arrest me,” Sonaram alleged.SDPO Xalxo said no rape accused admit their crime. “Does any accused say that he has raped, murdered or stolen things when they are arrested? However, we have all the records and evidence against Sonaram,” asserted Xalxo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-rape-accused-tries-to-slit-his-throat-fearing-arrest-101616663782747.html
25-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi man poisons wife, her family with thallium||The Delhi Police have arrested a resident of south Delhi’s Greater Kailash for allegedly administering thallium to his wife and her family. Police said the man had poisoned his in-laws’ dinner on January 31 this year, which killed his mother-in-law and sister-in-law and left his wife comatose. The man’s father-in-law and the household help also had to undergo treatment. Senior officers said that police recovered a small glass bottle with thallium from the arrested man’s house. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said on March 22, Inderpuri police station was informed that a woman named Anita Devi Sharma died at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital; thallium was detected in her blood and urine samples. The woman had been under treatment for over a month. Also Read | Man assaulted, forced to chant slogans in Khajuri Khas; one held“Since thallium is a poisonous substance, efforts to trace the source of thallium administered to the woman were made. During preliminary enquiry it was found that the woman’s older daughter Divya, married to one Varun Arora, who lived in Greater Kailash Part-1, was is also admitted in the ICU ward of the same hospital with thallium poisoning. She is on ventilator support,” the DCP said. Goel said further probe revealed that Divya’s younger sister Priyanka also died of thallium poisoning while undergoing a treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15. “We also found that Anita’s husband Devender Mohan Sharma also showed symptoms of thallium poisoning. A maid who was working in the couple’s house had also been treated at RML Hospital for similar symptoms. We realised that the family was possibly poisoned with thallium at the same time,” she said. The bodies of the two women were shifted to RML Hospital and a detailed autopsy was conducted by a board of doctors. A forensic and crime team also reached the couple’s house to carry out a detailed inspection. Goel said, during initial questionings, it was found that Divya’s husband Varun Arora had visited the Sharma family on January and cooked them fish. He served the fish to the entire family except his Divya’s twins. “Since the chain of events was triggered after the dinner, Arora was detained for questioning. When he was confronted with facts, Arora admitted to have procured thallium and administered it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and Priyanka, his sister-in-law. He revealed that he had poisoned them to take revenge as they had been allegedly repeatedly humiliating him,” the officer said. Arora told the police that after his father’s death last year, his wife Divya had conceived. “He believed that his father was being reincarnated as his son. However, Divya developed some complications and aborted the child on the advice of her parents and sister, against Arora’s wishes. “He also said that since he was not doing any job, his in-laws used to repeatedly taunt him,” the DCP said.The DCP said at Arora’s instance, the thallium used in the murders was recovered from his house in Greater Kailash. “We have also recovered his mobile phone that he had used to procure the thallium,” she said. During Arora’s interrogation, police found that he had searched the Internet on “how to make someone very sick”. “That is how he got the idea of using thallium. When our teams searched his laptop, we found his search history was deleted. So far we did not find any evidence of him having got the idea from Saddam Hussain,” Goel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-poisons-wife-her-family-with-thallium-101616662942938.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||'Have sought time from governor to discuss issues': Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar||Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government have sought appointment from Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to discuss the “current issues” in the state. The governor, however, is out of town they will make an appointment when he’s back, he added.The leaders are expected to discuss issues, including extortion claims levelled against state home minister Anil Deshmukh by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh, and the corruption allegations by the opposition in police transfers.The plan to meet the governor comes a day after a delegation of opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders led by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis met the governor. They submitted a memorandum to Koshyari requesting him to send a report on the current situation in Maharashtra to President Ram Nath Kovind.The deputy chief minister also said that Thackeray has sought a report on the illegal phone tapping issue, adding that chief secretary Sitaram Kunte is likely to send it in today itself.“Phone tapping can be done only after getting permission from the additional chief secretary (ACS), home and Kunte was working as ACS, home when phones were tapped, hence he is also aware of the facts," Pawar said.This comes after former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the government of not taking action on a report by former DGP Subodh Jaiswal about corruption in transfers of police personnel.The report on records of phone tapping by former Commissioner of State Intelligence and IPS officer Rashmi Shukla is based on intercepted phone calls of six people. It has names of senior politicians, middlemen, and police officers, who as the report claims were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up names of politicians such as Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their alleged conversations.The NCP countered Fadnavis’ remarks alleging that Shukla illegally tapped the phones of police officials and politicians in Maharashtra.The drama in the state gradually unfolded after Singh, who was recently removed from his post, wrote to Thackeray alleging Deshmukh contacted now suspended police officer Sachin Vaze to extort ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai. Vaze has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case.Following the letter, Fadnavis said that this is not the first time corruption charges have been levelled against the state home minister and cited the phone tapping report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-sought-time-from-governor-to-discuss-issues-maharashtra-deputy-cm-ajit-pawar-101616661774243.html

25-03-2021||Mumbai||There’s no need for Anil Deshmukh to resign, says Shiv Sena||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday said there is no need for state home minister Anil Deshmukh to resign even as the latter faces charges of running an extortion racket. Raut accused the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of playing “dirty politics” over the matter and added they do not want to fall prey to it. Therefore, no resignation was sought as it would set a wrong precedent, added Raut.Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh made the allegations against Deshmukh in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday and plunged the state’s Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government into a crisis. Singh accused Deshmukh of “corrupt malpractices” for instructing police officers to “carry out official assignments and collection schemes including financial transactions”, as well as setting targets for them “to collect money” from establishments such as hookah bars and restaurants.Deshmukh, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, has denied the allegations.Also Read | Congress not upset over demand that Pawar should head UPA: Sanjay RautRaut reiterated that a retired high court judge could probe the matter. He dismissed doubts whether an impartial probe is possible with Deshmukh still occupying the post. “There is no such tradition [of resigning]. Who said there cannot be an impartial probe till one is on the post? If a retired high court judge probes, there is no need to resign,” said Raut. “There are doubts on several aspects of that letter… There are doubts whether Param Bir Singh wrote the letter, or someone wrote it and he signed it.” He said the “issue has ended for them”.Raut questioned whether BJP-ruled states have taken action against any minister without a probe. “From day one, the home minister asked for a probe. The chief minister said a probe should be done. Only the opposition did not want a probe and wanted Deshmukh to resign before a probe.”BJP leader Pravin Darekar said Raut is speaking like an NCP spokesman. “When [Shiv Sena minister] Sanjay Rathod faced allegations [of alleged links to a woman’s death], that time Raut did not say that there is no need for resignation before a probe. He seems to have forgotten to defend Shiv Sena leaders and workers but is defending an NCP minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/theres-no-need-for-deshmukh-to-resign-says-sena-101616660902375.html
25-03-2021||Bhopal||MP government plans to bring law to ease tree felling on private land||Madhya Pradesh state government is coming up with a new tree plantation promotion law which will allow felling of trees on private forest land and degraded forest of about 10 lakh hectares without any permission from the government, said an official. The law, experts said, could harm the state’s frail green cover and movement of wildlife animals.In Madhya Pradesh, 10 lakh hectares of forest area is under private ownership and 4 lakh hectares belong to standing forest while 6 lakh hectares belong to the degraded forest. The state’s total forest cover is 94,689 sq km.Under the new law, the state government is going to relax the norms for cutting trees on private land and motivate plantation for doing timber and minor forest produce business, the official said.The new law would also allow people to transport and do business of timber with private people without obtaining permission of the forest department, said an officer of the MP Forest department. The law aims to remove red-tapism and allow people, especially farmers, to plant trees to generate extra sources of income, another forest department official said. The forest department has sent the draft of the bill to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and once approved by the CM, it would be put before the cabinet for its nod, another official said.As of now, MP has two rules to allow people to cut trees on their private land. According to the MP Land Revenue Code 1959 section 240 and 241, a farmer needs to obtain the permission of the tehsildar /sub-divisional magistrate before cutting down a tree. Under the Lok Vaniki Act 2002, farmers need to take permission of divisional forest officer to plant plantations and cut trees on the area of more than 10 hectares of land. MP’s principal chief conservator of forest, Rajesh Shrivastava, said, “This new law will change the life of farmers. It will help those farmers who don’t want to do farming but want to do timber or minor forest produce business and also to farmers who want to do farming with timber business.” However, experts feel that it will affect the green cover of the state and can also spoil the corridor between national parks.Retired forest officer and environmentalist, PN Saxena, said, “This will be a very good law for farmers, but my concern is that of orange areas that are claimed by forest and revenue departments and is used by farmers.”“There is no clear demarcation of forest land and degraded forest areas owned by farmers so how will the forest department ensure that legality of timber which is being sold or transported by farmers? Similarly, if farmers concentrate more on felling than plantation, how will the government ensure the green cover?” he asked.Retired principal chief conservator of forest, wildlife, SK Mandol, said, “This is good that MP government wants to motivate timber business, which is a lucrative one, but there are chances of deforestation of private forests, which are being used as a corridor by tigers and other wild animals between Kanha, Satpura, Pench and Bandhavgarh tiger reserves to travel from one place to another, and it will have an adverse effect on wildlife. The state government should consider this while finalizing the draft.”Wildlife activist and advocate Anshuman Singh said, “In 2019, I filed a petition when the MP forest department de-notified about 60 species of plant and allow farmers to cut and sell these species in an open market. MP High Court stayed that order of forest department to save ecology. Now, they are coming up with a new law. This will be disastrous to give a free hand to farmers for cutting of trees. Forest department principal secretary Ashok Varnwal said, “The new law might increase felling of trees initially but in long term, it will definitely increase the green cover. Who doesn’t want to earn money easily? The people will themselves plant trees in the rotation to earn money and unlike farming, plantation for timber doesn’t need much care after some months. Why only timber, they can use their land to grow medicinal plants and minor forest produce which are in demand nowadays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-government-plans-to-bring-law-to-ease-tree-felling-on-private-land-101616659403954.html

There were speculations that the meeting took place to discuss the Congress leadership’s unhappiness about the demand. However, Raut dismissed that rumour.Also Read | Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut says Sharad Pawar should lead UPAThe Congress leadership is not upset over the demand that Sharad Pawar should head UPA, Raut said. “In fact, we get such suggestions from the Congress that UPA should be strengthened. It can be Sonia Gandhi’s stand as well. Sonia Gandhi has led UPA resolutely for a long time. But she has been unwell and there are [political] developments happening in the country. At such a time, several regional parties have demanded that UPA should be headed by a person outside the Congress. UPA, currently, is in a handicapped state,” the Sena’s chief spokesperson said.He added that several regional parties who are not a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance or UPA should be taken under the aegis of the UPA. “There is no question of how many MPs are backing Pawar saheb. Almost all [political] parties besides the BJP have demanded that UPA should be reconstituted and there should be a change in UPA leadership. It is not just our demand,” he said.Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said, “UPA constituents have decided who should head UPA. I had asked the chief minister two days ago if he (Sanjay Raut) is the spokesperson of Sharad Pawar. Our only suggestion is that they should not discuss things that are not related to them... Shiv Sena is not a member of UPA, they should know this. One who is not a member [of UPA] must not enter into this discussion. There is no question of being upset over it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-not-upset-over-demand-that-pawar-should-head-upa-sanjay-raut-101616659402394.html

However, when the need arises, we will not hesitate in giving more money for the project,” she added.Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said artists from Rajasthan, Lucknow and other states were being contacted for the work. “Everything will be finalised soon,” he said, adding that the corporation had reached out to a sculptor from Rajasthan for the project.“We are working on the theme of the statue. The LMC (Lucknow Municipal Corporation) will also construct a gallery which will portray all the facts of Lord Lakshman, his story, his sacrifice, his devotion towards Lord Ram, his ethics, his simplicity etc. Not only that, we will also have a daily light and sound show about his life at the location where the statue would be installed. The aim is to display our culture and heritage,” said Bhatia.But the corporation hasn’t taken a call on the location of the statue.When the municipal corporation cleared a similar proposal in 2018, it had voted to install the statue at a crossing out of one of the city’s oldest and most prominent mosques, Teele Wali Masjid. The plan met with stiff opposition from clerics and historians, who linked the move to the 2019 general elections. It didn’t move forward.Sanyukta Bhatia, who had also piloted the aborted 2018 proposal, said the site would be finalised after fresh discussions with municipal corporators. This time, she said, a “collective decision” would be taken.The opposition to the 2018 plan came against the backdrop of a claim by veteran BJP leader Lalji Tandon in his book that Teele Wali Masjid, the city’s biggest Sunni mosque built during Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, was constructed over Lakshman Teela, a raised platform named after Lord Ram’s brother.Tandon, who died last year, said in his 2018 book that Lucknow was originally called “Laxmanavati, then Laxmanpur and after that Lakhnavati, before finally being named Lucknow”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/151ft-high-lakshman-statue-to-be-built-in-lucknow-says-mayor-location-unclear-101616656822250.html

Police said the accident took place near Gopalsar, 150 km from the Sriganganagar district headquarters. Station house officer (SHO) Vikram Tiwari said havildar Dev Kumar, havildar SK Shukla and subedar Mamger died on the spot. Five other jawans were rushed to the military hospital in Suratgarh, where their condition is stated to be out of danger. According to preliminary investigation, the army Gypsy overturned and caught fire after the driver lost control. “It was either due to the glare of the headlight from a vehicle headed in the opposite direction or after the vehicle was hit by an animal. Soon after the Gypsy overturned, it caught fire and the three personnel trapped inside died on the spot,” the SHO said. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot expressed grief over the mishap.

Their US-based mother had moved the high court last year for their custody, contending that her estranged husband had brought them to India for a two-week trip in August 2019, but did not return to the US thereafter, in complete breach of consent shared-custody order of US court.Also Read | Bombay HC refuses woman’s petition to withdraw workplace harassment caseShe pointed out that on her plea, a US court granted sole custody of both their daughters to her and also initiated contempt of court proceedings against her estranged husband. It was argued on her behalf that her husband, by his conduct, had demonstrated that he had scant respect for the rule of law and therefore, continuing the daughters in his custody cannot be considered in the best interest of the girls.The high court, however, rejected the argument. Apart from the apprehension and desire of the daughters, the judges also took into consideration the fact that the girls were studying in India and there were no doubts over the financial capacity of their father to take care of their requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-us-based-woman-s-plea-for-daughters-custody-101616643262531.html

25-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt proposes annual licence for party venues to serve liquor||The Delhi government has proposed introducing a new annual licence system allowing banquet halls, farmhouses, motels and other such party venues to serve liquor at events, like it is done in hotels.The government report on the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, has also recommended doubling the one-time P10 licence to ₹10,000 for hosting in-house parties — a permit which is extensively applied for by the general public to serve alcohol in private parties hosted at home or any other non-licenced premise.The report, seen by HT, talks about starting a new liquor licence specifically for banquet halls, farmhouses, party lawns and other such venues, the fee for which will depend on the carpet area of the premise. For venues having a carpet area of up to 5,000 square feet, the annual liquor license fee will be ₹5 lakh, ₹10 lakh for those above 5,000 sqft and up to 15,000 sqft and ₹15 lakh for places having more than 15,000 sqft area.“No separate P10 license will be required at any event being conducted at these venues once the yearly licence is acquired. The area will be calculated basis the entire usable carpet area, which is leased out for events and gatherings. In case of venues with multiple floors, the carpet area of each floor will be calculated,” read the report, prepared by a group of ministers, headed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.It further stated that venues that conduct multiple events will have to take this mandatory licence in order to serve liquor on their premises.Delhi has around 300 banquet halls, and most of them have multiple halls within their premises taking the total number of halls to over 1,000.But the government has also not completely done away with P10 licence as people who are organising a relatively smaller party of, say, about 50-100 people, may not want to book a banquet hall or such formal set up.“For an in-house party or any function in any community centre, the P-10 fee will be applicable at Rs.10,000/- irrespective of the number of guests. To serve liquor in banquet halls, party places, farmhouses, wedding/ party/event venues, the one-time P-10E licence fee will be ₹50,000/- per event, if the said venue does not hold a regular annual licence,” the report said.At present, P10 licence can be obtained on payment of Rs. 5,000/- to serve liquor in any party, function, marriage and so on at non-licenced premises, anywhere in Delhi, excluding public parks. The existing P10 licence fee for motels, banquet halls and farmhouses is ₹15,000 per event.Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association of Delhi said the move is in favour of owners of such venues. But he said it could turn out to be an expensive proposition for the general public or the hosts of the parties.“Even though they have increased the P10 license fee by at least 233%, the move is still favourable for us. This is because all banquet halls, farmhouses and other such party venue owners will shift to the annual licence system as it is a cheaper and more hassle-free option. It will allow us to charge for alcohol and the service provided to serve it — which means the cost of alcohol will be relatively more expensive at our venues, just like it is charged in hotels. The cost will be higher than the MRP of the bottles at our venues not only because of the service provided, but also because we will have to recover the annual licence fee paid to the government,” he said.Mandeep Singh, the owner of Bel-La Monde hotels private limited, which also owns several farmhouses and banquet halls, said the process will now be tension free for party hosts.“Many banquet halls or venue owners at present ask the hosts to themselves arrange the P10 licence and get their liquor bottles from retail stores at MRP. This licence is available online or can also be taken from an authorised liquor store from where the bottles are being procured. Most people are unaware of the procedure and used to feel hassled by the unnecessary paperwork. So, now those who are willing to pay slightly more, can just pay us and get the entire liquor part of the party or event taken care of by us,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-proposes-annual-licence-for-party-venues-to-serve-liquor-101616629369104.html
25-03-2021||Bangalore||10-year-old lynched over suspicion of stealing snacks in Karnataka||A 10-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries seven days after he was beaten up by four people for allegedly stealing snacks from a grocery store in Uppanashi in Karnataka’s Haveri district, police said on Wednesday.According to the police and the boy's family members, the boy was allegedly held captive on March 16 for several hours, beaten up by the owners of the shop, and released only after his mother pleaded with them. Later that night, when the boy’s condition worsened, he was rushed to a hospital in Haveri, from where the doctors referred him to Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi, where he died on Tuesday.The post-mortem examination report is still awaited, a KIMS spokesperson said. A second official at the hospital said on condition of anonymity said that boy developed a fever while undergoing treatment, and died due to brain haemorrhage. What led to this will only be found in the post-mortem report, he added.A case of murder, wrongful restraint, and assault, was registered on Tuesday against four people -- shopkeeper Pavan Karishettar, his mother Basavannevva Karishettar, his uncle Kumar Haveri, and his maternal grandfather Shivarudrappa Haveri. They are all absconding, police said.In a video shot at the hospital before this death, the boy named the four people, and recounted what happened during his alleged captivity. He said that he was first locked up in a room. After a while, the old woman (Basavannevva) in the house took him out of the room and made him sit outside. “An old man came and hit me twice. He asked me not to move from there. Then, the shopkeeper came and took me to the backyard, where two others joined. They hit me on my legs, neck, and legs. Pawan made me bend down and hit me with a stone,” he said.The statement has been recorded by the police.According to the police complaint lodged on March 17by the boy’s father, Nagayya Hiremath, their son was sent to the store to buy some groceries. When he did not return home for over two hours, Hiremath went to the store. He found that the boy was in the shopkeepers’ custody, and was being beaten on the suspicion of the theft. He requested the shopkeeper to release the boy, but Pavan Karishettar told Hiremath that he wanted to teach him a lesson. At around 3pm, the boy’s mother went to the shop and pleaded with him, but the owners first asked her to come back at 5pm. Only after she fought and pleaded with the shopkeepers, did they release the boy, the complaint said.Rani Hiremath, a relative of the boy’s family, said that police did not register an FIR on March 17. She said they just took a written statement from the boy’s father.When asked about this particular complaint, SP Devaraju said he would “look into the allegation”.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were 94 instances involving the murder of children, and 107 children were killed in 2019. Sabhiya Saldana, a Bengaluru-based child rights activists said that the police not filing an FIR on the day of the incident was a matter of concern. “Filing an FIR only after the child has died means the police did not take assault seriously,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/10yearold-lynched-over-suspicion-of-stealing-snacks-in-karnataka-101616619298656.html

25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Parking to cost more at Chandigarh’s 57 lots by March end||The municipal corporation has decided to roll out parking charges on hourly basis at 57 parking lots across the city by the end of March.The parking fee for the first four hours – ₹5 for two-wheelers and ₹10 for four-wheelers – has not been changed. However, these will be doubled post four hours. The charges will be further doubled if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours. Entry for pick and drop in the first 10 minutes will entail no fee.Parking lots in the city have been divided into two zones: 32 in Zone 1 and 57 in Zone 2. The civic body had auctioned both zones for around ₹10 crore annually. Lots equipped with smart facilities In October last year, MC had directed parking contractors to offer smart facilities at all 89 parking lots within one month. New parking charges were contingent on that. However, despite multiple deadlines, the contractors failed to fulfil the requirement.“Now, the contractor of parking lots in Zone 2 has installed the smart features. A committee has inspected and substantiated this. The contractor will be authorised to charge on hourly basis after the final approval from the MC commissioner,” said SK Jain, additional commissioner, MC.The smart features include e-payment, HD night-vision CCTV cameras at exit/entry points, and smart card-based daily and monthly passes, besides LED display of real-time occupancy at entry points and online booking of parking space through app.“MC has floated the tender for the app’s development. While MC will award the contract, the parking contractor will pay for it,” said Jain.The app will allow online booking of parking space and provide updates related to the lots. It is expected to be ready in a month’s time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/parking-to-cost-more-at-chandigarh-s-57-lots-by-march-end-101616618720041.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||MC polls: BJP, Cong face rebellion in Palampur, Dharamshala||The BJP and Congress are caught on a sticky wicket in Palampur and Dharamshala ahead of the municipal corporation elections after some of their leaders, who were denied a ticket, decided to contest independently. In Palampur, Sanjeev Soni, a former BJP block party president, filed nomination papers as an Independent. The disgruntled leader said he started his political career with the BJP in 1990 and had also been the pradhan of a local panchayat but he had been overlooked. “My wife has also served as the village pradhan. However, the party gave the ticket to someone else. This is a ploy to ruin my career!” he alleged.Soni said he had urged the party to reconsider its decision but did not get any response. “Thus, I have decided to contest as an Independent. If the party continues to ignore its dedicated workers, how will it win the civic body polls,” he said.In Dharamshala too, a party leader and outgoing BJP councillor has filed nomination papers as an Independent. The BJP had replaced the sitting councillor from Sidhpur ward Sarv Chand with a fresh face. Chand termed the decision ‘an injustice’ and cited the work he had done for the party.Industries minister Bikram Thakur, who is BJP in-charge of elections in the Palampur municipal corporation, said there was no revolt in the party. “Its an internal matter and will be resolved through dialogue,” he said. Dharamshala convener Chander Bhushan Nag said if anybody contests the election against the authorised candidate, it will be viewed as indiscipline.Meanwhile, the Congress is also facing a rebellion in the McLeodganj ward where the outgoing councillor Maya Devi is contesting as an Independent after being denied a ticket.Former Dharamshala MLA and AICC secretary Sudhir Sharma said everyone had the right to raise their voice. “If anyone is dissatisfied, the issue will be resolved through dialogue. The situation will be clear after the withdrawal of nominations,” he said.319 candidates in fray for 64 wards
25-03-2021||Delhi||Teachers back on Covid duty in Delhi as cases spike||With Covid-19 cases spiking once again in the national capital, teachers of government and municipal schools are back on pandemic-related duty, causing several schools to raise concerns over the deployment of teachers for non-teaching work at a time when practical exams of board classes have begun and the evaluation process of the other classes is underway.On Wednesday, Delhi reported 1,254 cases of Covid-19 — the highest single-day spike since December 18 last year.In January, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had directed chief secretary Vijay Dev to issue an order to reduce the number of government schoolteachers deployed on Covid-19 duty to ensure that teachers are re-engaged in academic work, following which a large number of teachers was released from pandemic related work.With cases increasing again, teachers, as well as other government employees, have been asked to undertake a door-to-door mobilisation for the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive. For instance, in Shahdara district, around 124 teachers have been asked to join the survey work on Sunday. Similarly, teachers from different districts have been assigned duties at the airport in the past few days.For instance, as many as 100 teachers of the east municipal body-run schools were deployed at the Delhi airport on Covid duty last week.The deployment has not gone down well with schools, however. A principal of a government school in old Delhi said their only physical education teacher has been called back on Covid-19 work on Tuesday. “We have our class 12 physical education practical exam on Friday. How will we do that without our internal examiner? Besides, at least seven teachers who were busy uploading internal marks of students on to the directorate of education (DoE)’s portal have been assigned survey work and duty at the airport,” the principal said, without wishing to be named.Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of government schoolteachers’ association, said, “The government should not allow the district administrations to deploy teachers on Covid-19 duty at such a crucial time -- the academic session is ending and students need teachers the most right now.”The principal of another government school in Jhilmil Colony said their only IT professional had been deployed at the airport last week. “Our staff are completely dependent on the IT person for uploading student marks and preparing results. The government has already asked schools to declare results up to class 8 by March 31. How will we finish the work in such a situation?” the principal said, also on condition of anonymity.Similar concerns were raised by heads of municipal schools. A principal of the East Delhi municipal body in Gandhi Nagar said, “The result of the classes where teachers are on duty is not prepared yet. Another teacher will have to finish the work of his/her class first and then complete the work of others. So, half the students will be getting their results soon while the other half will have to wait a while.”A senior official at the Delhi government’s education department, requesting anonymity, said, “The government will ensure that teachers of important subjects and those teaching board classes are not deployed on Covid-19 duty.”Similarly, officials of the east municipal corporation’s education department said that they will look into problems caused by the deployment in their schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-back-on-covid-duty-in-delhi-as-cases-spike-101616617256578.html

Another farm leader, Sanjay Chauhan, said, “If the government does not intervene in time, it will be difficult to save horticulture in the state.” Himachal Kisan Sabha Himachal president Kuldeep Tanwar said there is an urgent need to ensure minimum support price (MSP) for fruits, vegetables and grain. “We have demanded that the government declare apple a special product and impose 100% import duty on the apple imported through the south Asian free trade area (SAFTA) and all other countries,” Tanwar said. “The MSP of apple should be ₹50 per kg and the government should also declare MSP for all fruits and vegetables,” said Tanwar, adding that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) should procure maize, wheat and pulses from the hill states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fruit-growers-from-valley-hp-u-khand-demand-repeal-of-farm-laws-101616618360031.html

He will also pay ₹1 lakh as fine. Gupta had sought the bribe from complainant, Ranjana Shahi, for clearing her legal fees amounting to ₹25 lakh for representing the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare.Stating that the convict did not deserve leniency, the court observed that corrupt government officials forced counsels, who defend the government in court, to run from pillar to post to get their lawful dues released. As per CBI, in 2016, Gupta was posted as a senior accounts officer with the Pay and Account Office (Plant Protection and Miscellaneous) of the Union ministry of agriculture in Haryana’s Faridabad.Shahi, a resident of Sector 40, Chandigarh, was a senior panel counsel for the Union of India in the high court and had been representing the ministry of agriculture’s department of agriculture, cooperation and farmers’ welfare, Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage. For this, around ₹25 lakh on account of legal fees had to be disbursed to her.Despite a sanction order by the government, Gupta did not clear her fees and demanded a bribe of ₹60,000 (8% of the sanctioned amount of ₹6.8 lakh).On May 21, 2016, a trap was laid and Gupta was caught red-handed while accepting illegal gratification of ₹55,000 from the complainant.

25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Dispute over fee: DPS Srinagar ‘bars’ Class-2 student from attending online classes||Parents of a student studying at Delhi Public School (DPS), Srinagar, filed a complaint with the Jammu and Kashmir education department on Tuesday after the school allegedly barred the Class-2 student from attending online classes over pending utility and transportation charges pertaining to the lockdown period. The student’s father, Wajahat Waseem, said, “For around 20 months since August 2019 when restrictions were imposed in Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370 and due to the Covid lockdown my daughter has not been to school. However, I still paid the monthly fee during the curfew and lockdown period amounting to ₹56,400,” Waseem said.The pending dues amount to of ₹24,000, which includes annual charges that the UT government has barred schools from charging during the lockdown period. “The pending sum includes transportation charges, a service that they did not provide and annual charges such as heating charges. When our child did not attend school, how are these charges justified? This is unscrupulous exploitation on part of the school,” he said.Normal offline classes have started in DPS Srinagar for students from Class 5 onwards. Lower classes attend online teaching sessions. On Tuesday, Waseem and his wife Nuzhat Wajahat wrote to director school education, Kashmir, complaining that the school had violated provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which is applicable post abrogation of Article 370 and also different circulars of the UT administration.They requested the director to direct the school management to restore his daughter’s online classes and stop them from ‘exploiting’ parents. “The management should also be directed to refund our admission fee amounting to ₹1,10,000 so that we are able to admit our daughter in another educational institution,” the parents wrote in the complaint. Waseem claimed that he had not been paid for seven months. “Right to Education is a fundamental right. How can DPS Srinagar bar a child from attending online classes? The government is still undecided on transportation charges and charging annual charges has been totally banned,” he said.Calls to the vice-principal and member of the school managing committee Shafaq Afshan did not elicit any response. HT contacted the administration section of the school on its landline number where an office bearer, after hearing about the issue, urged this reporter to call after five minutes. They did not pick up the phone thereafter. Director school education Mohammad Younis Malik said they will ascertain the facts of the case. “We will be issuing a notice to the school, accordingly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dispute-over-fee-dps-srinagar-bars-class-2-student-from-attending-online-classes-101616618060437.html

25-03-2021||Delhi||IGNCA starts shifting to make way for Central Vista revamp||Officials of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art (IGNCA) have started shifting their campus to Janpath Hotel, which will be their temporary home for at least three years, as the Central Vista redevelopment project takes shape.Once the Central Vista project is ready, the national centre for art will move into a new campus near Jamnagar House.Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art is one of the many government buildings which will be demolished to make way for 10 new, state-of-the-art office complexes proposed as part of the Centre’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. The approximately ₹15,000 crore project includes construction of a new Parliament building, common central secretariat, and new residences for the vice President and the Prime Minister. While the Parliament building will be completed next year, the entire project is looking at 2024 completion.Sachidanand Joshi, member secretary of IGNCA, said, “We have started shifting out of IGNCA. Some of our divisions have already moved to our new office. We estimate that the entire shifting process will take at least two months. By the third week of April, we will physically shift everything to Janpath Hotel and by mid-May we plan to wind-up everything here.”On Wednesday, HT noted that at the arts and culture centre, work was progressing at a rapid pace to shift artefacts, paintings, collection of rare manuscripts, microfilms, the library of rare books and reference material, archives to the new five-storeyed building at Janpath hotel. The corridors of the spacious centre were spotted stacked with cardboard, wooden and aluminium boxes, that had historical material neatly packed in them.Joshi said that they have been planning for the shifting process for the past six-eight months. “We have planned the process in two steps: long and short term. There is stuff which we don’t need on a day-to-day basis. We are packing all the archival material in boxes that will be stored safely in the new building. The rest is our daily routine stuff. Some divisions have already shifted and are in the process of settling down. We have planned the shifting process keeping in mind that we will be shifting again to our new centre (Jamnagar house) in a few years.”Set up in 1985, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art is spread over 25 acre along the Central Vista. The centre has been developed on a design provided by American architect late Ralph Lerner, who was a professor at Princeton University. His design was selected in an international competition in which the government received 194 entries from architects from 37 countries, as per information available on IGNCA’s website.The centre has been actively involved in organising exhibitions, performances, conferences, lectures. It also offers short-term and other courses in art and culture, which currently are being held online. Joshi said that they will resume regular activities from the new centre in June.Joshi said that the space at Janpath hotel is more or less same as on the current campus. “There is an amphitheatre with a seating capacity of 400 and an auditorium with space for 160 people. There is space for galleries. There are more organised spaces there which we can convert into galleries. CPWD has refurbished the place as per our requirements,” said Joshi.IGNCA officials said that the entire campus will be handed over to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) by June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ignca-starts-shifting-to-make-way-for-central-vista-revamp-101616617246735.html

Six years on, however, PUDA has failed to acquire the land for the said road.An allotee, Wg Cdr Jasbir Singh (retd), said that even after a full payment of the plot, GMADA has provided us with the connecting road to our township, especially in the pocket having a number of 600 series. Even, others, who are constructing the plots are using the road of TDI city and revenue road, he said.Another allottee, Dr BS Lakha, said, “It is unfortunate that we could not construct the houses due to a lack of connectivity. Even in the state consumer forum, the authority in their reply had stated that they were supposed to get clearance from the irrigation department, which they hadn’t before allotting the plots.”PUDA had acquired the land for the said project under the provisions of the Land Owners Become Partners in Development Policy. This project, Gateway City, was the maiden project under the banner of GMADA/PUDA in the district. A private developer, EMAAR, holding land had entered into a collaboration agreement with GMADA/PUDA in the revenue sharing model in the ratio of 80:20 respectively to sell the unsellable land.‘Will acquire land soon’When contacted, chief engineer of GMADA Davinder Singh said, “We are in the process of acquiring land for the road and hopefully it will be done soon.” Regarding other issues, he said, “We will be sorting them out too.”Other major issues, which the allottees are facing include lack of sewerage connectivity, loose high-tension wires in the vicinity, slum dwellers settled around the plots, location of plots near the bed of Patiala Ki Rao river and sewage treatment plants, and the presence of a scrap dump yard nearby.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/six-years-on-puda-fails-to-provide-road-connectivity-to-gateway-city-101616617758861.html

Jammu and Kashmir’s Congress vice-president Raman Bhalla accused the government of deliberately increasing the prices of petrol and diesel. He demanded that the Central reduce its excise duties on petroleum products. “The Modi government has completely failed in keeping its promises to the people of India. The need of the hour is for different parties to set aside their differences and come together to change this government,” the former minister said. Bhalla said that on one hand, the government was increasing taxes as well as the prices of petroleum products and gas that had made the life of the low-income group miserable and on the other unemployment was increasing but the government failed to devise an effective economic plan for solution of the core issues. Bhalla slammed the government for changing the focus of the budget from welfare of the people to elections. “The pandemic has affected the income of the common man but the government is increasing excise duty and central GST,” he said, adding that the government had reduced fund allocation for rural local bodies and fertiliser subsidy. The Congress leader urged the government to speed up the COVID-19 vaccination drive, saying that at the current pace, it would take 18 years to achieve 100 % vaccination in the country.“We decry the politics of hate and divide, as Congress believes the all-time relevant slogan of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist unity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-protests-against-rising-inflation-fuel-prices-unemployment-in-jammu-101616617578959.html

The department of social welfare had organised a special camp at the Sector-22 civil hospital for the home’s seniors, who are all above 70 years of age.Bhalla, who lost his four children to a road accident, said the coronavirus had impacted his small world unpleasantly.Since the centenarian has low hearing, he said, “When everyone around me puts on a mask, it gets difficult for me to understand what they are saying, I want all of us to be mask-free and vaccination may take us back to normalcy.”Bhalla said that back in 1941 in Lahore, an epidemic of Kala Azar had gripped the city and the British were only giving vaccines to families who were ready to join the army to fight in the World War.“All of us received the vaccine and it was a proud moment for us,” said Bhalla.Vaccine hesitancy in the city remains a major challenge for the authorities. Despite the availability of resources, the response among the targeted population remains low. The city has the capacity to inoculate 7,000 persons a day, but the numbers remain less than 3,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/im-gutsier-than-most-says-105-year-old-after-getting-covid-vaccine-inchandigarh-101616617098819.html

A case was registered against sarpanch Gurnam Singh, also a Dalit, and three others under sections of Indian Penal Code, Juvenile Justice Act and the SC/ST Act at the Dhuri police station on March 14. A video of the incident had surfaced on social media. “The government gives ₹2 lakh compensation to a Dalit victim’s family in such case. The family of the boy has been given 25% ( ₹50,000) of the amount and the rest will be provided as per law,” he added. SSP Soni said, “Necessary action was taken in the case as per the law.” A group of residents, including women, of Bhasaur village gathered at the local government primary school, claiming that an unnecessary “caste colour’ was given to the case as it was their panchayat members who rescued the boys from the neighboring village. “The village was united but some people made mountain out of a molehill to get panchayat membership,” said Sukhwinder, the mother of one of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thrashing-of-juveniles-national-sc-commission-chief-asks-sangrur-police-to-submit-report-on-arrest-of-accused-in-2-days-101616616804911.html

Congress MLA from Jalandhar north, Bawa Henry, and mayor Jagdish Raja had installed the new statue on Monday at the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Chowk on the eve of 90th death anniversary of the freedom fighter. The statue cost ₹5 lakh, records show. The BJP and the SAD have slammed the Congress government in the state and accused it of disrespecting martyrs. Senior BJP leader and former cabinet minister Manorajan Kalia on Wednesday wrote a letter to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, demanding a probe into the matter. “In the name of beautification, the bust statue of Shaheed Bhagat Singh has been replaced by a 5-feet statue at a crossing named after him. The new statue of does not resemble photographs of the martyr available in public domain,” the letter says.He added that it was also surprising that in the plaque announcing the installation, the name of the martyr had been relegated to the bottom with a font size smaller than the names of other local leaders. Kalia adds in his communication, “It is therefore requested that an inquiry may kindly be ordered to be instituted to fix the responsibility of municipal corporation officers and the recovery of public money that has been given wasted by giving approval to the freshly-installed statue be made from the guilty officer.”SAD legislator from Adampur, Pawan Kumar Tinu, added that this was a major blunder and the statue even showed the martyr raising his left hand, instead of right as was the case in all other sculptures of the martyr. “The Punjab government should take strict action against the erring officials. The Congress party has disrespect a national hero.” Jalandhar mayor Jagdish Raja told HT over phone that he agreed that the statue did not resemble Bhagat Singh. “We will replace the statue,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jalandhar-mc-s-new-statue-of-bhagat-singh-kicks-up-row-101616616798799.html

We ask that in such situations fines be avoided. We ensure that customers only enter the shop wearing a mask and after sanitising their hands. So, police should let shopkeepers enforce the Covid rules inside shops.”Such challans have also been issued in other markets, including sectors 18 and 28. This has come as bad news for shopkeepers who are already beginning to report a decline in footfall across various markets ever since the Covid cases started to rise.Subhash Narang, CBM senior vice-president and head of Sector 22-B market welfare association said that a decline in the number of customers is noticeable now and has fallen down by around 50% in the past week. In Sector 46, market body president Balwinder Singh said, “While the footfall is down by around 20-30% here, the administration’s message is getting through. We seldom find anyone not wearing a mask in the market now.”In the cramped market of Sadar Bazaar, Sector 19, as well, the numbers have started dropping. Market body president Narinder Singh said, “Shopkeepers are following all rules to the book as we don’t want things to get worse. Another lockdown-like situation will force us to give up on our businesses.”Meanwhile, Panchhi, who is also the president of Chandigarh Traders’ Association in Sector 17, said that the footfall has not been affected much in Sector 17 and crowds can still be seen in the market, especially in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mask-norms-chandigarh-beopar-mandal-asks-cops-not-to-issue-fines-inside-shops-101616615898524.html

The residents have demanded that the MC should keep the garden open for visitors from 5am to 10 pm as it used to be earlier. There are many who come to spend leisure time in the afternoon and have to face dejection when they are not allowed inside. The garden, which is among the prominent parks of the city, is the favourite haunt for walkers and workout enthusiasts. One of the residents of Maya Nagar, Suraj said, “The MC does not allow any of the management committees to close the gates of the public parks, but the civic body itself is shutting down the garden for four hours. This is among the favourite places of children as swings have also been installed in the garden besides the open playing area. During winters, elderly go for a walk on sunny days there.” A resident of Ghumar Mandi area, Babanpreet Singh, said, “At times, it looks embarrassing when we enter the park with children and couples are sitting at different points, especially during the afternoon. This move might reduce their numbers, but the MC should not restrict the entry of visitors to the park. Rakh Bagh remains open for the entire day. The rose garden should also be open as everyone visits the park as per their convenience and such restrictions give a harrowing time to the visitors.” Meanwhile, MC officials said it was a precautionary measure taken in the view of Covid-19 situation and the civic body also takes up cleanliness drive in the garden during these hours. MC junior engineer Kirpal Singh said, “The decision to keep the garden shut for four hours was made last year by the higher authorities due to the pandemic. As machinery is also used for maintenance, the garden is closed to avoid any mishap. We have not received any official complaint or objection in this regard from the residents.”Mini Rose Garden all set for an upgrade To give a new look to the mini rose garden situated in Kidwai Nagar (old city), MC started a project for its renovation and refurbishment on Wednesday. The project worth ₹3.48 crore will be taken up under the smart city mission and is likely to end within a year.MC will take up different works, including softscaping, setting up of a musical fountain, cafeteria, badminton court, pergolas, canopy, and open gym among other works.However, many Congress leaders and supporters gathered for inauguration of the project were seen without masks.

The wind of change is expected to blow as the Ludhiana police are set to launch a contest to choose the best police station. “Stations will be judged on 25 parameters, including good behaviour, and there will also be a provision of negative marking of 20 points,” said police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal. The assessment will be done by a team of police officials and reputed residents of the city having no links with the police department.There are 29 police stations, 30 police posts and 12 other units in Ludhiana.Commissioner Agrawal said, “The idea to organise such contests was floated by DGP Dinkar Gupta. The top-ranked police station will get a reward amount of ₹3 lakh, followed by ₹1 lakh prize money to the second ranked station while the one on the third spot will get ₹50,000, besides certificates. Among the police posts, the reward will be 1 lakh, ₹50,000 and ₹25,000 for the top-three spots.”Similar prizes will be given to top-three police units like women cell, cyber cell, and economic offence unit. The police chief said even the office management of gazetted officers will be evaluated based on their capacity to supervise their units. They will also be ranked on the basis of their performance and disposal capabilities. Five broad parametersAgrawal said there will be five broad parameters to select the top performing and poorly performing police stations — location and access to station, community orientation and public facilities, welfare of police personnel, crime prevention and police station management, transparency and accountability. “Each of these has been further divided into five sub-parameters. Each sub-parameter will have maximum four marks. These include whether there are signboards to guide public to the police station, beat map, crime chart and crime prevention tips written on flex boards, or if the police station building has been painted well, has greenery, and general cleanliness.Infra, public dealing to be evaluatedEvaluation will also include the condition of visitors’ room, help desk, reception, toilet and water facilities, besides investigating officer’s work stations, progress of arrest of POs, recoveries under the NDPS Act, percentage of complaints disposed of within three months, maintenance of record room, condition of lock-ups, disposal of rape and Pocso cases within 30 days after the arrest of the accused.” Agrawal said.“If any court passes an order regarding poor working of a police station, four marks will be deducted. Similarly, four marks will be lost if there is a law and order problem which could not be controlled by the police station concerned and a senior officer has to intervene. If more than 10% complaints are pending for more than three months, there will be a deduction of four marks. In case any employee is suspended for misconduct or caught for corruption, marks will be deducted as well,” he added.He said police stations have been given two months’ time to prepare for the contest. Results will come out in the first week of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-cool-contest-to-ensure-that-ludhiana-cops-put-on-their-best-behaviour-101616615661881.html

The HC, however, allowed the trial court to hear any application being filed in the case.On March 23, Justice Suresh Kait vacated the stay on the trial after the police, represented by Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad told the court that complete hard copy of the charge sheet is ready and the accused may collect it from the Karkardooma court on March 25, when the case is next listed for hearing.The court said, “In view of above, no further order is required to be passed and the same is, accordingly, disposed of with pending application…. Accordingly, interim order is vacated”.Delhi police’s special cell had challenged the legality and validity of September 21 and October 21 orders by additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, directing the police to supply physical copy of the charge sheet.On October 9, the trial court judge directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet after being told that the police “have inadvertently” put a document in it which contained the details of some of the protected witnesses and its copies were supplied to the accused booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The judge directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet, redacting the details of the protected witnesses and supply it to the persons charge-sheeted in the case and their counsel.On October 21, the investigating officer told the court that he has submitted 16 new pen drives containing the redacted version of the charge sheet and accompanying documents in terms of the earlier order.However, the court directed the accused and their counsel to be provided with both the hard and soft copies of the fresh charge sheet.The judge also said that the court was not impressed with the submission of the investigating officer who had sought 15 days time for the sanction for funds from the Delhi government for taking out the hard copies for every accused. The judge directed the police to supply the documents at the earliest.Challenging these orders in the high court, the city police contended that the mandate of law under section 207 of CrPC is to provide “copy” of each of the report/ statements/ document subject to reasonable exception. It said that law does not specify supply of “hard copy” or “soft copy” nor does it draw any distinction between “hard copy” or “soft copy”.Till date, the city police has filed three charge sheets, including two supplementary charge sheets, against several accused —former JNU student Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, Gulfisha Khatoon, former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider, Shafa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan.-- for allegedly being part of a larger conspiracy in the riots that broke out in February 2020 in various localities of north-east Delhi.Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Wednesday directed the police to ensure safety and security of Umar Khalid while bringing him for the proceedings in a case related to the riots.Chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar directed the Tihar Jail superintendent, DCP (Deputy commissioner of police) and DAP (Delhi Armed Police) to ensure safety and security of Khalid while bringing him to the court and taking him back to the prison.Khalid had moved an application seeking directions for his security during his physical production in the court for the remand proceedings.He was arrested in October last year in the case of violence in Khajuri Khas area. Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain is also an accused in the case.

The commission will be headed by a retired judge, whose name is yet to be decided, said a senior MVA minister. The official announcement of the judicial commission is likely to be made on Thursday. The decision was taken in a meeting of senior ministers held at Varsha, official residence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, late on Wednesday evening. On March 24, HT had reported that the state is likely to declare a judicial commission into the allegations. Senior ministers Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil, Anil Deshmukh, Dilip Walse Patil, Balasaheb Thorat, Nawab Malik, Jitendra Awhad and Dadaji Bhuse were present for the meeting which lasted for over two hours. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni was also called for the meeting to discuss various aspects of the probe, the minister said. In an eight-page letter, Singh on March 20 accused Deshmukh of giving Sachin Vaze, a controversial police officer arrested in the Antilia bomb scare case, a target to collect ₹100-crore a month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours and also several other allegations. Singh brought up the charges through a letter three days after being transferred from his post to Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra, on March 17. He also challenged his transfer in the Supreme Court who has asked him to approach the Bombay high court on Wednesday. The commission is likely to be formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, in which the commission will have powers to summon anyone for deposition, seek documents and conduct hearings. Deshmukh is also facing allegations of corruption levelled by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis who sought a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged corruption in IPS postings. On Tuesday, he said then director general of police (DGP) Subodh Jaiswal had submitted a comprehensive report on the alleged racket to the state on August 25, 2020. Fadnavis said the commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla had intercepted some suspicious calls after they received information about a racket of brokers in the IPS transfers. The issue was discussed at length in the state cabinet meeting held in the three-hour long meeting during the day on Wednesday. The home minister reportedly clarified no corruption had taken place in the transfer of senior police officials and the allegations leveled by former Mumbai police commissioner too were wrong. Deshmukh reportedly told his cabinet colleagues that 90% of the transfers mentioned in the report submitted by Shukla did not take place. “The people referred to in the report as middlemen have no involvement in the transfers,” he reportedly told the cabinet. He said Shukla’s act led to breach of trust between officers and also defamed the top IPS officers who have been named in the report. He said that the officers should sue her for defamation. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray reportedly expressed concerns over the entire episode and resolved to take a stern stand against the officials acting against the interest of the government. “We failed to recognize some officials in the bureaucracy. This is very dangerous and needs to be tackled with iron hands,” Thackeray is said to have told his cabinet colleagues during the cabinet meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-anil-deshmukh-row-mva-to-form-panel-to-probe-allegations-101616615480180.html

The land acquisition process was to be completed by December 2020, and faces further trouble with farmers from 12 districts of the state starting a protest against the NHAI on Wednesday, demanding a halt to land acquisition till the Centre repealed the three farm bills. Farmers also want NHAI to come up with a better offer for the land. The Centre has said that the project must be completed by 2023.NHAI project director Santosh Kumar Arya said, “The project has been delayed due to hitches in the land acquisition process. The delay, however, is manageable as we are working upon a resolution. We are holding talks with the farmers through representatives of Punjab state government at district levels.”He added that the compensation reward has not been finalised as yet. “We expect to complete the land acquisition process in 3-4 months. We are coordinating with the state government,” he added.The ongoing protest over three farm laws and the dissatisfaction of farmers over compensation offered have been major roadblocks. Meanwhile, protesting farmers gathered at the Bhakra canal at Passiana village in Patiala on Wednesday and started their protest for coming five days. The expected total cost of the expressway project is ₹35,000 crore, of which, the NHAI will spend ₹10,000 crore on land acquisition for a 300km stretch in Punjab. Harmanpreet Singh Jeji, coordinator of Delhi Katra Expressway Kisan Sangharh Committee (DKEKSC), who is sitting at protest in Patiala, said over 200 villages in Patiala, Sangrur, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Gurdaspur and Pathankot have already passed a resolution not to give land for the project.“The farmers are being offered peanuts for selling their land. The NHAI has offered ₹9.67 lakh per acre compensation, which was later revised to ₹18 lakh. However, after the state government implemented the method multiplication factor for land acquisition, many farmers were offered ₹55 lakh,” he claimed.In January, aiming to break the deadlock over the issue and low prices offered being offered in the acquisition process, the state government had notified new multiplication factors (with which market value is to be multiplied) under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, but the issue remains unresolved issue so far.As per the detailed project report, the project will promote religious tourism as the road will connect two important holy cities—Katra-Vaishno Devi and Amritsar— before it teaches Delhi. Though the expressway will reduce the distance between Delhi and Katra by just 40-km, it will reduce the travel time from the present 11 hours to around six hours. The travel time from Delhi to Amritsar will be around four hours.The Expressway will also provide shortest connectivity to important Sikh shrines at Dera Baba Nanak, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib and Tarn Taran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhiamritsarkatra-expressway-will-make-up-for-delay-in-land-acquisition-in-punjab-says-nhai-101616615478670.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Kishor meets first-time Punjab Cong MLAs, takes their first-hand feedback||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s principal adviser and political strategist Prashant Kishor on Wednesday met the first-time MLAs of the Congress here for their “first-hand feedback” on the ground realities and implementation of poll promises ahead of the 2022 state polls. The poll consultant, who was the brain behind the Congress’ 2017 campaign that saw the party score a resounding victory with a near two-thirds majority, met the party legislators for the stocktaking exercise at the chief minister’s official residence here. Kishor had called 37 first-timers for interaction and most of them showed up. The legislators met him in groups of three, sharing their views about the public perception of the state government’s image, implementation of election promises, and development works undertaken in their constituencies or regions, according to several first-timers spoken to by this newspaper after the meetings. Priorities listed, concerns voiced Besides listing jobs, power tariff and relaxation to traders and shopkeepers for the lockdown period, incomplete development works and pending promises as the priority areas that the government needs to focus on in the remaining few months, some MLAs also spoke their mind about the bureaucracy calling the shots. “The government has done several things, but these were done through officials and elected representatives have not been involved. I told him that this needs to be rectified and messaging should be right for maximum political mileage,” one of the MLAs said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, a legislator from Doaba spoke about the need to give more push to development works in his region which, according to him, was not given adequate representation in the state cabinet and, therefore, did not get adequate attention. Another suggestion from an MLA from Majha region was that ministers should sit in their offices, meet the elected representatives more often and give more time to public to redress their grievances. CM’s aide lends ‘attentive ear’ Kishor, who meet the first-timers alone, gave 25 to 30 minutes to each group, lending an attentive ear. Payal MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha said it was an “introductory” meeting and no discussion took place on the strategy for state elections. “I told him about a hospital being set up and police station being constructed in my area and other achievements, but there is a need to speed up development works. He also told me that we will keep meeting,” he said, expressing satisfaction with their interaction. The CM’s adviser could not be contacted. The political strategist, who was inducted by the chief minister in his office on March 1, started working last week and has already held meetings with the chief secretary, top aides of the chief minister, and administrative secretaries and other officials of key departments, including the publicity arm of the state government. Kishor, who was adviser to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar earlier, also worked as poll strategist with Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress in the ongoing state polls in West Bengal. In the past, he has worked with the YSR Congress, the AAP and the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kishor-meets-first-time-punjab-cong-mlas-takes-their-first-hand-feedback-101616615239571.html

The BMC has collected around ₹4,100 crore, as of Wednesday against the target of ₹5,200 crore.Further, the BMC’s standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav, on Wednesday gave directions to the BMC’s assessment and collection department to not levy penalty of two per cent on outstanding property tax amounts in case of clearing their arrears by March 31, 2021.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the BMC said, in K West ward covering Andheri, four water connection lines were disconnected from a housing society in Versova as the society defaulted in tax payments amounting to Rs87.24 lakh. Meanwhile, in Malad west water connection of a real estate firm was disconnected owing to Rs2.65-crore arrears.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-crackdown-on-property-tax-defaulters-101616615177958.html

The remaining body was found along the tracks near Vithalwadi. The GRP received a call about a severed head spotted in one of the local trains at the Ambernath car shed. The GRP found blood on the door of the compartment. Another team was formed to look for the remaining body. ACP Sunil Patil said, “Around 50m away from the spot where we found the body, there is an electric pole, where we found blood and hair of the deceased. Prima facie, we assume that the deceased who was travelling in the last local train towards Ambernath was on the footboard and hit the pole when the train was speeding. We are checking CCTV footage and identification of the body is going on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-severed-head-found-in-train-rest-of-the-body-on-the-tracks-101616615057971.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM opposes DBT for farmers, writes to defer scheme for a year||Strongly opposing the Direct Bank Transfer (DBT) scheme for farmers, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister seeking early resolution of the matter in view of the upcoming rabi season.The CM, who has also sought time from PM Narendra Modi for a meeting on the issue, sought his personal indulgence to issue appropriate directions to the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Government of India, to defer the implementation of the scheme for at least one year.The arhtiyas (commission agents) and farmers have long-standing relations, he pointed out, questioning the need to change the system when it was working very well. Around 50% farmers give their land on contract, so how will those who till the land get their money under DBT, the CM said at a media event.In his letter, Amarinder drew the PM’s attention to the ministry’s directions, asking the Punjab government to ensure direct payment to farmers along with online submission of the details of land owners/ cultivators. Pointing to the age-old relationship that Punjab has between the arhtiyas, who are licensees under the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act, 1961, and farmers, he noted that for the past many decades, the state procurement agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) have been procuring foodgrains for the central pool.The farmers have never complained of non-receipt of payment of the MSP, and the state government is ensuring online payment to farmers, albeit through these arhtiyas, he added. Further, said the CM, the land ownership and tenancy issues may give rise to various avoidable legal complications, especially during the ongoing farmers’ agitation. This, he said, “may also cause avoidable unrest and anguish among the farmers.” He further noted that bringing the software in line with the proposed directions shall take considerable time.‘My experience is my biggest strength’ Ruling out any threat from the other major political parties in the next assembly elections, the CM said he believed that his experience of governing the state and also in the army will help him handle the challenges of the state beyond 2022. The CM trashed the C-voter survey that gave the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) a lead in the 2022 Assembly polls, as a “paid job” of Arvind Kejriwal. The AAP leader has a huge media budget he can use to buy such surveys, he said, adding that Kejriwal’s party poses no risk to the Congress in Punjab. “This same company had predicted 100 seats for AAP in 2016/17 and everyone knows how many they ultimately got”, he said adding that Kejriwal and his party would meet the same fate in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-opposes-dbt-for-farmers-writes-to-defer-scheme-for-a-year-101616614942198.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Complete lockdown in Nanded and Beed||The number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra continued to rise as the state recorded 31,855 cases on Wednesday, marking the highest single-day spike since the start of the outbreak last year. Ninety-five deaths were recorded in the state taking the total number of deaths to 53,684. On Wednesday, 1,40,844 citizens were tested in Maharashtra. There are currently 2,47, 299 active cases of Covid-19 in the state. With 49,036 active cases, Pune tops the list followed by Nagpur (34,016 active cases). Mumbai (29,395 active cases) and Thane (24,567 active cases) occupy third and fourth positions respectively. Tatyarao Lahane, director of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), attributed the higher caseload to increased testing in the state. “Unlike other states, which are testing only patients with symptoms, we are testing everyone. This is bound to increase our numbers,” said Lahane, who emphasised the need for the public to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. To curb the spread of the infection, complete lockdowns have been ordered in Nanded and Beed district from March 26 till April 4. On Wednesday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan described the situation in Maharashtra and Punjab to be of grave concern. The Union ministry said that of the 10 districts in India that have shown huge surges in Covid-19 cases, nine are in Maharashtra (Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nanded, Jalgaon and Akola). The tenth is Bengaluru (urban) in Karnataka. Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said it was imperative that adequate precautions be taken to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 among communities. “The history of pandemics, whether it’s measles or influenza, has shown that there are several waves before it finally stabilises down. In the meantime, the government should ban all religious and political gatherings,” said Shaikh. He applauded the state government’s decision to curtailed Shab-E-Barat and Holi celebrations this year. While the daily caseload has been increasing since early March, Maharashtra has also witnessed a rise in the number of deaths from Covid-19 of late. In the past six days, 546 people have died due to Covid-19. Dr Amin Kaba, former secretary of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, said the government should work towards speeding up vaccinations. “The government needs to undertake mass vaccinations and it cannot do this only through government and private hospitals. They need to allow private clinics to carry out vaccinations,” said Kaba. He said that even though the virus would mutate, vaccination would help check the rate of transmission. It is possible to contract Covid-19 even after getting both shots of the vaccine. However, being vaccinated helps protect against severe infection and transmission by reducing the viral load.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/complete-lockdown-in-nanded-and-beed-101616614941130.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Rashmi Shukla “breached the trust”, responds Maharashtra govt||Maharashtra housing minister Jitendra Awhad on Wednesday said that the former state Commissioner of Intelligence Rashmi Shukla did not have permission to intercept phones calls to collect intelligence that formed the basis of the report on the alleged money for transfer scam in the state police department.The minister who spoke to reporters after the state cabinet meeting during which the report came up for discussion, said that the ministers were “furious” at what they saw was an attempt to “defame” the police department and as “a conspiracy” against the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “Legal action needs to be taken against those involved in this entire episode,” he said, adding that Shukla “breached the trust of seniors”.Shukla, currently on central deputation, put together a report that names senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking, after intercepting the phone calls of six middlemen from June 2020 onwards.Shukla, an additional director general with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) who recently took additional temporary charge of southern sector, did not respond to calls or messages.“The then Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sitaram Kunte [current chief secretary, Maharashtra] has confirmed that he never gave the permission for the tapping of the phone numbers mentioned in the report. When asked about the insubordination, Shukla had told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Anil Deshmukh a few months ago that it was a mistake committed by her. She had even apologised in writing and the letter is with the government,” Awhad told reporters after emerging from the three-hour long state cabinet meeting on Wednesday.He clarified that Shukla had used pre-existing permissions provided for intercepting calls on other phone numbers but had not sought new permission for the numbers of the six middlemen mentioned in the report dated August 25, 2020.“Shukla had taken permission for some other numbers to intercept, but the numbers mentioned in the report were intercepted. The officer did not follow the norms. State cabinet ministers were furious when the facts were discussed in today’s meeting. Legal action needs to be taken against those involved in this entire episode as it has brought infamy not only the police department but also to the state. This is a betrayal by the officer. The report submitted by Shukla was used politically two months after Shukla apologised,” Awhad said.In a press conference held in Mumbai on Tuesday, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis had said Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on August 25, 2020, who in turn forwarded the report to Kunte the following day.Fadnavis said that Shukla had “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary-home and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politician”.However, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik refuted the claim and said on Tuesday that Shukla had intercepted calls illegally.Awhad reiterated on Wednesday that most of the transfers of the officers mentioned in the report did not take place. “The people referred to in the report as middlemen are insignificant and cannot have an involvement in the transfers,” he said.He said that Shukla’s act led to the breach of trust between officers and also defamed the top IPS officers who have been named in the report.“It needs to be probed about the permission given for the tapping of the phones and actual interception done,” Awhad said, alleging that the phones of several leaders were under surveillance during the formation of the MVA government.Jitendra Awhad later tweeted in Marathi, “There are ireful reactions in the police force, especially among the junior-senior officers who have been named in the report. Some of them are going to sue Shukla for defamation while a few have decided to make a complaint against her to the government.”HT has seen a copy of the report, which named the police officials and the middlemen who helped them seek postings of their choice. It also mentioned the names of politicians such as NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, as they came up in the alleged conversations.The report did not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly. It contended that one middleman is an assistant in the home minister’s office.The report did not state that any direct transfer of money to these politicians took place. It did, however, refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.The report names police officers who were in touch with six middlemen for transfers to desired posts.In the summary to the report, Shukla wrote: “The aforesaid brokers were in close contacts and embroiled in these negotiations with several influential and the police officers ranging from inspectors to several high-ranking officers are in contact with such undesirable individuals. The information obtained and evidence collected is highly incriminating and gravely implicates a number of individuals engaged in this activity.”Malik, however, said on Tuesday that the transfer of policemen was a procedural affair and did not occur as mentioned in the report.Speaking to reporters in New Delhi on Tuesday, Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut said, “They (the officials) may have prepared some reports with good intentions. The chief minister will decide what is to be done of these papers.”A delegation of BJP politicians, including Fadnavis met Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Wednesday, urging him to seek a “status report” from state chief secretary on the law and order situation.“Extortion is exposed...there is a transfer racket.. state officials are being threatened... all this is worrisome, but the chief minister remains silent. We requested the governor to seek a detailed report from the government as the CM is not taking any action,” Fadnavis said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray reportedly expressed the concerns over the entire episode during the cabinet meeting, a senior minister said on condition of anonymity. The CM has not spoken publicly about the report as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rashmi-shukla-breached-the-trust-responds-maharashtra-govt-101616614939791.html

With the touch of a button, the CM cleared the transfer of 10,099 teachers and volunteers to the station of their choice, purely on merit basis. School education minister Vijay Inder Singla was present on the occasion.The government had received 35,386 online applications from teachers and volunteers, of which 15,481 were found ineligible, as they did no meet the prescribed parameters of the policy. The remaining 19,905 were found eligible for transfer. For the first time, computer teachers and categories of education volunteers were also brought into the ambit of the Teachers Transfer Policy. The CM said the unique teachers transfer policy has been instrumental in successfully achieving the goal of quality education through filling of vacant posts. He disclosed that the state government would soon enact the Teachers Transfer Act, in place of the existing system of notifications that the school education department issues. The CM lauded the school education department for sprucing up infrastructure and improving the quality of education in government schools. Under the online system, over 50% transfer applications have been approved with complete transparency to date, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-digitally-transfers-11-000-teachers-under-new-policy-101616614938655.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports over 5K Covid-19 cases||For the first time since the outbreak of Covid-19, the city recorded more than 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in a single day. On Wednesday, Mumbai had 5,190 new cases of Covid-19, the highest single-day caseload recorded so far. Six deaths were reported taking the death toll to 11,610 deaths. Civic officials have pointed to ramped up testing — there were 40,400 tests conducted on Wednesday compared to 23,000 on Tuesday — to explain the spike. Until February 10, Mumbai was reporting between 200 and 400 new cases of Covid-19 per day. This increased to 1,000 new cases daily in early March. Wednesday’s caseload crossed the previous single-day highest of 3,779 cases, recorded on March 21. Mumbai has been reporting over 3,000 new cases every day since March 21. The city’s recovery rate is 88% with 3,32,713 recoveries and the mortality rate is 3.09%. There are 29,395 active cases in Mumbai. Dharavi also recorded a 10-month high on Wednesday, with 62 new cases of Covid-19, which is the most cases it has reported in a day since May 2020. Since April 1, 2020, when the first case of Covid-19 was detected in the area, Dharavi has recorded 4,531 cases of Covid-19. Of these, 237 cases are currently active and 3,977 people have been discharged. Assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar, who looks after Dharavi, said, “The daily caseload has been increasing across the city and due to this, Dharavi is also witnessing a spike. As we are increasing testing, more high-risk contacts are detected. We are also testing citizens randomly due to which more cases are getting detected.” As part of its efforts to break the chain of Covid transmission, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started conducting rapid antigen tests on randomly-selected citizens in public places, including malls. In the last two days, 33,553 additional tests were conducted. On Wednesday, the civic body conducted 40,400 tests, of which 21,000 were rapid antigen tests. Overall, in the past year, the city has reported 3,74,641 cases and conducted 3.7 million tests. Mumbai’s overall Covid positivity rate is 9.75%. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “We are not suggesting everything should be shut down again, but citizens need to ensure they head out only for economic reasons. Unwanted visits outside the house should be avoided for now. We also need to understand that Covid-appropriate behaviour has to be maintained even post vaccination. The cases may also go up to 6,000 or 8,000 in a day if we test aggressively. It is a good thing to test more and detect more if we want to curb the spread.” Earlier this week, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had said the city can handle 6,000 cases per day. “Logically, we can predict that the number of cases per day will double as the number of tests done per day is doubled,” Chahal had said on Monday while emphasizing that there was no need to panic as most of the cases in Mumbai are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. BMC’s data shows that between February 22 and March 22, as the number of cases spiked in the city, most were come from age group of 30 to 39 years, which has 8,400 cases. The second-most affected age group is of 40 to 49 years, which has over 7,600 cases. Those between 50 to 59 years have 7,500 cases and 6,899 cases are from the age group of 20 to 29 years. The lowest surge — 2,500 cases — is in the age group of 0 to 19 years. There are over 5,100 cases in the age group of over 90 years. Cumulatively, the highest number of cases are from the age group of 50 to 59 years, which has over 69,000 cases. Ten thousand of total 11,592 deaths from Covid-19 have been reported from the age group of those above 50 years. Assistant municipal commissioner Prashant Gaikwad said, “We are witnessing cases being reported across all age groups. However, above 80 years of age and in children, the cases are much higher. In all the remaining age groups, the spread is almost similar.” Speaking of the random tests being conducted in public places, like Chowpatty, Gaikwad said, “The aim is to detect the maximum number of citizens who are positive but roaming out in the open.” Those selected for testing must pay for the test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-over-5k-covid-19-cases-101616614878635.html
25-03-2021||Delhi||Man assaulted, forced to chant slogans in Khajuri Khas; one held||A man was allegedly kicked, punched, and forced to chant “Hindustan Zindabad” and “Pakistan Murdabad” slogans in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas by a person who is an accused in the riots that took place in 2020, police said on Wednesday.A video of the incident, which allegedly happened on Tuesday, was widely circulated on social media after which police registered a case and arrested the attacker on Wednesday. Police identified the attacker, purportedly caught on camera, as Ajay Goswami, a resident of Old Garhi village and a dairy trader, said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east).The officer said Goswami is an accused in the 2020 north-east Delhi riots, but clarified that his alleged involvement in the riots has no connection to the latest alleged assault. Police did not immediately share details on Goswami’s nature of involvement in the riots or the current status of that case.Unwilling to identify the victim, Sain said victim too has a criminal record and was allegedly involved in a murder and robbery case. Another police officer, who asked not to be identified, said the victim is a Muslim man. “On Tuesday, the man was allegedly trying to enter Goswami’s dairy, purportedly with the an intention to steal, when he was caught,” said the officer.Police, however, have not registered any case of theft or attempted theft against the victim.In any case, the DCP said Goswami beat up the victim while another accused, Deepak, recorded the video on his mobile phone. The video, which was widely shared on social media, showed Goswami allegedly punching the victim in the abdomen, kicking him in the face and other parts of the body, and throwing him around.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.As he beat the victim, he also kept asking him to chant ”Hindustan Zinadabad” and ”Pakistan Murdabad” slogans, which the victim repeatedly did while pleading for an end to the assault, the video purportedly showed.Once the video landed on the internet and was brought to the police’s notice, the police took cognizance of it and began probing its origin. The victim and assailants were eventually identified by Wednesday after which Goswami was arrested. Deepak is yet to be arrested.A case of voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint has been registered at Khajuri Khas police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-assaulted-forced-to-chant-slogans-in-khajuri-khas-one-held-101616610624458.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress seeks probe into govt officials with links to BJP, RSS||Maharashtra Congress leaders met chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday and demanded a probe into government officials who were Bharatiya Janata Party (BP) or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sympathisers and were employed during the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra. The party has also demanded a probe into the allegations levelled by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh as well as allegations of scam in police transfers, in a bid to derail opposition BJP’s attempts to defame the three-party coalition government.The Congress delegation led by state chief Nana Patole met the CM and demanded strong collective measures to control the damage attempted at by the BJP. The party said the truth should come to the fore at the earliest to avoid the bad name arising out of the ongoing controversy. The team reportedly also demanded action against Singh and former commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla for insubordination and violation of All India Services Rules.“We are of the opinion that there was no need of resignation of the home minister unless an inquiry is conducted in the allegations levelled by Singh. The state government should immediately appoint a probe committee of a retired or serving judge of high court. We believe that Singh was acting on the behest of the BJP and was part of the smear campaign by the opposition. But at the same time, the truth should be brought to light to avoid further damage to the image of MVA government. The government should immediately take action against him and other officials,” said a party leader who was part of the delegation.The Congress has also hit out at the BJP and said the opposition party should first give details about appointment of RSS workers in the government during Fadnavis’s tenure. “The BJP misused the bureaucracy using its power in Centre for their political gain. There were many BJP-RSS sympathisers in the state government during Fadnavis government. What benefits did the RSS and BJP get from them needs to be investigated, and we have made a demand for the same to the CM,” Patole said.Former CM and current leader of Opposition in legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis had attacked the Congress on Wednesday by raising questions over the silence maintained by the ruling party. “I am surprised to see that the Congress has maintained complete mum even amid the political crisis in the state. Is it because they have been getting their share in the corruption?” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-seeks-probe-into-govt-officials-with-links-to-bjp-rss-101616614818533.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Amid pandemic, more employees prefer a hybrid model, says survey||A recent survey has found a majority of employees prefer a hybrid working model, which allows people to divide their hours between working remotely and from the office. Conducted by Paperspace India, a collective of designers and architects, the survey reported that 56% of its respondents preferred the hybrid model. Launched today, Paperspace India is an affiliate of Paperspace Asia. For their survey, Paperspace India spoke to 610 employees and employers across the country. The findings include the observation that 63% felt returning to the office is critical for their career advancement. With reference to the hybrid working model, respondents said they felt comfortable spending an average of 2.6 days a week in the office. Male employees said they preferred to go into office 3.3 days on average while female employees opted for two days. With the lockdown being relaxed, many companies have asked employees to resume going to office on alternate days or two to three times a week. Kulin Kapadia, managing director, Paperspace India, said, “The natural experiment forced on the world by the coronavirus has led to organisations reimagining the future of work. Indian corporates are looking for hybrid solutions that not only help bring their employees back to offices, but also optimize real estate costs.” The survey also found that 60% of employees would like to return to the office only if all safety protocols are in place. While 78% voiced concerns about their health after returning to the office, 41% were worried about how safe would it be to travel to office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-pandemic-more-employees-prefer-a-hybrid-model-says-survey-101616614757920.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Mutations make coronavirus infectious: Experts||The Central government confirmed on Wednesday that a “double mutation” of the virus that causes Covid-19 has been found in Maharashtra. Experts believe it is responsible for the 17% spike in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. They have observed that the variant in Maharashtra appears to be more transmissible, but less virulent.In mid-February, the positivity rate in Amravati and Yavatmal reached 50% and 32% and genome sequencing showed the presence of two mutations (E484Q and N440K). The state sent 900 samples — 223 from Mumbai — from Covid hot spots and of travellers and families for analysis. While studying them, a new variant was found.In a statement on Wednesday, the Centre said, “The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations...these mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and don’t match any previously categorised variants of concerns.”E484Q and L452R have been categorised as escape mutations. Epidemiologist Dr Lancelot Pinto said escape mutations make the virus more infectious. “Variants are expected to evolve when a highly transmissible virus moves rapidly through a host population. Such new variants of the coronavirus could have escape mutations which help the virus evade the body’s immune system, thereby conferring the virus with a survival advantage. Escape mutations in the spike protein could result in infections among individuals who had existing antibodies to earlier strains of the virus,” said Dr Pinto. Epidemiologists believe the mutation has contributed to the spike in Maharashtra’s caseload. “An analysis of the trend of the infection spread in the state had indicated a mutation months ago. Like mutation trends in other countries like the UK and South Africa, it was spreading faster and patients from same families were contracting the infection,” said Dr Subhash Salunke, state advisor for Covid-19.Dr Rahul Pandit, part of the state’s Covid task force, said the mutated viruses are more contagious but most patients are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. “Unlike the first strain, this one is less virulent. But we have to wait and watch. We are also concerned that there is a possibility that it can turn more deadly and the severity may increase,” he said. Dr Pandit also said it may be possible for recovered patients to be reinfected by the new strains. Experts say it is too soon to know how effective Covishield and Covaxin are against the mutations. “The Astra Zeneca vaccine had a lower efficacy among individuals infected with the South African variant. Whether the vaccine will be effective against infections with the newer variants needs to be studied, first with in-vitro experiments in the lab, and then in clinical trials to assess efficacy among subjects who receive the vaccine,” Dr Pinto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mutations-make-coronavirus-infectious-experts-101616614698561.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Money-laundering case: ₹3.85 crore unaccounted income in Khaira’s accounts, ED tells HC||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that in 12-odd years, ₹4.86 crore were deposited in Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s bank accounts but the declared income to the income tax department stood at ₹99 lakh. It also said that during this period, ₹84 lakh was deposited in cash in Khaira’s accounts. These claims have been made by the ED in response to a petition filed by Khaira against the central agency’s raids of March 9 on his properties and some persons associated with him in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. Khaira was elected to the state assembly in 2017 on a ticket of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Two years ago, he quit AAP and formed Punjab Ekta Party (PEP). The ED says Khaira declared to the income tax department for the period 2008-09 to 2019-20 an aggregate income of ₹99.07 lakh. However, total deposits in his five accounts, have tallied to ₹4.86 crore of which ₹84 lakh has been deposited in cash. Deposits made by Khaira in his bank account are not commensurate with the income declared, ED says in its 81-page report to high court. The case has now been adjourned to April 1 after taking on record the ED’s affidavit.The ED further claims that examination of accounts of Khaira and his family -- his wife Jatinder Kaur and son Mehtab Singh Khaira – have received ₹64 lakh from his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal, Simmer Khaira and a firm in which his son-in-law is a director.Documents containing cash transactions in foreign currency and suspicious property documents and electronic devices were seized from the record from the premises of Khaira and his associates on March 9. Cash transaction worth ₹4.5 crore and suspicious transactions in foreign currency are of US dollar 1.19 lakh were found, it claims. These unexplained cash transaction as well as property details recovered during the probe need to be explained by him, the ED says justifying why he was summoned by it on March 17.It has asserted that plea is not maintenable as at this stage he has not been made as accused and there is also no violation of his fundamental and legal rights.It further said that unlocking of phone does not violate his right in any manner and state has every right to collect such evidence as part of the criminal proceedings. “Money laundering is a standalone offence. A person who has not committed a scheduled offence could be prosecuted for an offence of money laundering and Enforcement Directorate won’t wait for prosecution to establish a scheduled offense,” it said adding that even if a person is acquitted in a scheduled offence he could still be prosecuted under money laundering law.Quoting Punjab Police probe, it says one Gurdev Singh convicted by the trial court used to provide funds and vehicles to Khaira for his election campaign and would make logistics arrangements from the proceeds of crime generated from smuggling and dealing in heroin. Thereby implying that proceeds of crime were used to finance election of Khaira in return Khaira would provide protection to him, it claims. Nine persons were convicted in October 2017 in the case by a trial court and sentenced them to imprisonment, ranging from three to 20 years, for trans-border heroin smuggling. The court had summoned Khaira as “additional accused” through same order. Two months later, Supreme Court had stayed the summons to him. Khaira has moved the high court seeking quashing of the investigation launched by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. He had also sought quashing of the ED’s summons for March 17. Khaira, who is Punjab Ekta Party president and Bholath MLA had alleged that he was targeted since he was supporting farmers protest.It also claims that after 2015 FIR when Gurdev Singh was on the run between February 2015 and March 2015, he was in contact of Khaira through Gurdev’s UK based sister Charanjit Kaur and Joga Singh, personal security officer of Khaira. The case is merely not only about proceedings of crime generated but also financing the narcotics smuggling, acquisition of arms and to provide safe passage to other criminals, it says. Khaira, however, said: “It’s cock and bull story by the ED. The agency went through my bank accounts of 12 years and added my agricultural limit worth ₹3 crores in my income. I have answer to each and every allegations of the agency. The central agency is after me for my legitimate income of 12 years, but it doesn’t have the guts to ask anything to Badals and Captain who looted the state for several years,” said Khaira.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moneylaundering-case-3-85-crore-unaccounted-income-in-khaira-s-accounts-ed-tells-hc-101616614578441.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Temperature crosses 38°C third time this month||The maximum daytime temperature in the city touched 38.1 degrees Celsius (C) on Wednesday, as per the India Meteorological Department’s automatic weather station in Santacruz. This marks the third day this month that Mumbai’s maximum temperature cross the 38-degree mark, after touching 38.1°C on March 4 and 38.2°C on March 5. The maximum daytime temperature in March last year was 37.5°C (on March 17).Wednesday’s maximum temperature was above the normal mark by just over 5 degrees, and up from the previous day’s daytime high of 35.3°C. IMD officials attributed the sudden uptick in mercury to hot, dry land breezes originating from the east and north-east of Mumbai.“The temperature of the city is heavily influenced by the balance of sea and land breezes. Hot, dry winds in the middle level, and lower level winds blowing from the east, caused delayed setting of sea breeze which tends to have a cooling effect in the latter part of the day. As a result, daytime temperatures across Mumbai rose during the day,” said an IMD official.Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 35.4°C on Wednesday, up from 33°C the day prior. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city (based on projected data for the AWS in Santacruz), the maximum temperature is expected to drop to between 35°C and 36°C over the next week, while the minimum temperature is expected to remain at a steady 24°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-temperature-crosses-38-c-third-time-this-month-101616614518497.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||Amid rising Covid cases, MU decides to continue with online exam||Bringing relief to students and colleges, the University of Mumbai on Tuesday announced that the impending semester exams will be held online in view of the rising Covid-19 cases.In a circular issued on Tuesday, Vinod Patil, director, board of examination and evaluations of MU, said that summer semester exams will be conducted online through the same guidelines issued earlier for the autumn semester exams last year.The exams for semester I to IV for both regular and repeater students will be held between April 15 and May 5. The exams for semester VI for regular and repeater students will be conducted from May 6 to 21 and semester V repeater exams from May 24 to June 2. A separate circular will be issued to announce the dates of the remaining exams.All theory exams are to be conducted online. An online test of 50 marks should be taken for degree and post-graduate examinations of traditional students (arts, commerce and science) in which 50 multiple choice questions (MCQ) should be given. Students will be given an hour to complete the examination. For vocational education courses, an online theory test will be conducted for a total of 80 marks – of which 40 marks will be for MCQs and the other 40 for descriptive answers. For inter-disciplinary courses, that exam will be of a total of 60 marks of which 30 will be for MCQs and 30 for online descriptive exam.This has brought clarity to students as well as colleges for preparing for the exams. “Given that cases are rising, it was expected that exams will be held online. As we have already conducted two exams, we are well prepared for it,” said Kishore Peshori, principal, MMK College Bandra.“With the number of cases rising rapidly, we were wary of taking our final exams in person. That seemed risky,” said Akshata Pawar, final year B Sc Botany student at Sathaye College in Vile Parle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-rising-covid-cases-mu-decides-to-continue-with-online-exam-101616614459563.html

He is being brought to Panipat for further interrogation,” said Panipat superintendent of police (SP) Sahshank Kumar Sawan.He said it is learnt that the skeletons are of a woman and her teenage boy and daughter, but more details cannot be revealed at the moment.Police said that they trio are not relatives of the accused and the matter requires further investigation.Police had registered an FIR under Sections 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unknown accused for triple murder and are collecting further details of the previous owners of the single-room house.According to police, Adesh Kumar, who had taken the house on rent two years ago, said that for the past couple of months he spotted insects coming out of the floor and he took up the issue with current owner Pawan Kumar.On Tuesday, Pawan had sent labourers for digging of the floor for renovation and they found three human skeletons buried under the cemented floor.Police also recovered a salwar-kameez, a trouser and a jacket near the skeletons.Pawan, who works at a cooperative sugar mill had purchased the house from Saifi about two-and-a-half-years-ago. Saifi had lived in the house for one year before this.Forensic experts said they have sent the skeletons for postmortem to ascertain the gender, age, identities and cause of death of the deceased trio with the help of DNA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/recovery-of-human-skeletons-in-panipat-house-ex-owner-held-from-up-s-bhadohi-101616614458446.html
25-03-2021||Mumbai||‘Leopard collared in SGNP travelled to Tungareshwar and back’||Researchers have successfully traced the journey of a leopard from Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai to Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWLS) in Thane district, using radio-collars or radio-telemetry this month. The leopard, officially known as L93 and nicknamed Maharaja, was fitted with a radio-collar on February 23 as part of a two-year-long study by SGNP administration and Wildlife Conservation Society, which commenced in June last year. One of the aims of this study, researchers explained at a press conference on Wednesday, is to understand the movement of the leopards across urban and forest landscapes, and to identify movement corridors between the protected areas of SGNP and TWLS.In case of L93, the animal was found to use a “chicken-neck” corridor connecting the two forests, just ahead of Nangla forest block of SGNP. The animal, researchers explained, has been seen frequently in the northern, Yeoor range of the national park and was likely to have been crossing roads while roaming about the area.The animal, as evidenced by GPS data and camera trap photos, navigated his way across two linear intrusions that cut across this corridor —Chinchoti-Bhiwandi Road and an existing railway line that runs parallel to it. “We found that the animal crossed this path four times during his journey from SGNP to TWLS and back. While he only crossed the road at a single location, the railway tracks were traversed at multiple spots,” said Nikit Surve, wildlife biologist and one of the researchers of the study.This is the third time in nearly a decade that the movement of a leopard across SGNP and TWLS has been documented, and the second time using radio-collars. Radio-collar allows scientists to triangulate the GPS location of the animal in real time. The first such instance was that of a leopard named Ajoba, whose 125km journey from Malshej Ghat to SGNP in 2010 has been widely cited in press reports. At the time, Ajoba had entered SGNP through Vasai Creek. A male leopard, L59, was later photographed in 2017 crossing high-traffic barriers such Ghodbunder Road, Vasai Creek and Diva-Kaman railway line to get to TWLS. It was found dead at Kaman-Bhiwandi Road in January 2018.As per preliminary results from Phase-1 of the radio-telemetry study, researchers said L93’s journey to TWLS traversed a total of 62 km in six days. About 8 km was covered during the day time, while the remaining 54 km was covered during the night. Researchers also found the remains of a chicken killed by L93, and were able to identify areas where he sleeps and rests.Pugmarks of a female leopard were also found close to that of L93. Researchers said more data needs to be acquired before inferences can be made about their companionship. L93 spent a total of seven days in TWLS during his first visit, venturing up to the highest point of the sanctuary. The second time, stayed for only about 30 minutes before returning to SGNP. The particular location he used to cross over into TWLS,Forest department officials and researchers pointed out that the particular area chosen by L93 to cross over into Tungareshwar is about to undergo a rapid urban transformation, with three major infra projects set to come up in the area. These include the MMRDA’s Virar-Alibaug multimodal corridor, the High Speed Rail Corporation’s Diva-Panvel bullet train line, and Delhi-Mumbai dedicated freight corridor.“Of these, the latter two have already been given forest and wildlife clearance, while the multi-modal corridor’s clearances are being processed. The project proponents have agreed to jointly build a 1-km long, 30-metre wide overpass for animals across this corridor between SGNP and TWLS,” said G Mallikarjuna, CCF, SGNP. This mitigating measure had been proposed by a State Wildlife Board sub-committee in January last year, and is awaiting a green light from the board, officials said. Sunil Limaye, addition principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), SGNP, said, “These preliminary findings reinforce the importance of this chicken-neck between TWLS and SGNP. They also justify the need to create safe passage for these animals between these protected areas, which may be affected due to upcoming development projects. Wildlife clearances for these projects include strict conditions that mitigating measures be put in place first.”Researchers also shared information about another female leopard, three-year-old L115 (nicknamed Savitri), who is seen to be using the southern, Tulsi range of SGNP, often crossing into Thane subdivision. Notably, on March 17, L115 began waking up around 7:30pm and completed a circular route around Tulsi Lake, travelling about 4.5 kms in 11 hours. Phase-2 of the study, which will involve tracking another three leopards with radio-collars, is set to begin toward the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/leopard-collared-in-sgnp-travelled-to-tungareshwar-and-back-101616614398762.html

It has decided to go by the existing formula under which women and scheduled castes get 5% reservation, with another 2% quota for backward classes. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had mooted the proposal on women reservation. Committee members comprising cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Aruna Chaudhary and Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Youth Congress president Barinder Singh Dhillon and Jakhar were unanimous in taking the decision. “It would not have been practically possible, as it requires changes in the Punjab Municipal Act 1911 that governs the functioning of the civic bodies in Punjab, including the elections of office-bearers,” said a member of the committee.Ahead of the 2017 state polls, the Congress manifesto had promised 50% reservation for women in civic bodies and village panchayats. In the polls held for civic bodies on February 14 this year, 2,302 wards went for polls out, of which 1,151 women were elected, with wards reserved for them.The committee members also reached a conclusion that bringing women into the forefront, at the grassroots level, especially in an election year would not be politically beneficially.Elections for office-bearers of urban local civic bodies are expected to take place in the first week of April. The local bodies department is expected to receive the gazette notification of results from state election department soon, after which it will give a 14-day notice to elect office-bearers and for civic bodies to make arrangements.ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO DECIDE ALL HEADSAnother committee of the Pradesh Congress Committee is expected to take a call on the names to head all civic bodies. Of eight municipal corporations it has been decided to have a mayor belonging to the SCs for Hoshiarpur. Mohali municipal corporation has been kept for a general candidate as in the past, it has had mayors from the SCs. A cabinet minister is eyeing the top post in Mohali for his brother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-50-quota-for-women-among-civic-body-office-bearers-in-punjab-101616614344478.html
25-03-2021||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing: Trial against Saini, Umranangal to start from April 2||Two months after the special investigation team (SIT), probing 2015 police firing incidents, filed a chargesheet against former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal, in the FIR registered in 2015 in connection with the Behbal Kalan firing incident, the court of judicial magistrate (first class), Faridkot, Suresh Kumar on Wednesday committed the chargesheet to the sessions court. The trial against Saini and Umranangal will start in the Faridkot district and sessions court from April 2. However, the main chargesheet against the other co-accused, which was already committed, is pending in the sessions court for consideration of framing charges. Now, the sessions court will listen the arguments against all the accused, including Saini and Umranangal.During hearing, heavy police force was deployed at the Faridkot judicial complex on Wednesday. Saini skipped the hearing, while Umranangal appeared before the court. An application for exemption from the personal appearance of Saini was filed, which was allowed by the court. The court also directed Saini’s counsel to ensure his presence in the sessions court on the fixed date.“The offense under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC are exclusively triable by the court of sessions. The main challan against other co-accused is pending in the court of sessions. Therefore, the present case is committed to the court of sessions judge, Faridkot, Sumeet Malhotra for April 2 and accused persons are directed to appear before the court on said date at sharp 10am so that arguments on charge against all the accused can be heard together,” said JMIC Suresh Kumar. The SIT is yet to file a supplementary chargesheet against inspector Gurdeep Singh Pandher, who is also an accused in the case. Following an application of Pandher, the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed SIT not to file chargesheet against him till further order. On September 10, 2020, the SIT told a Faridkot court that Saini and Umranangal were the main conspirators in the Behbal Kalan firing incident. On September 28, SIT nominated Saini and Umranangal as accused in the FIR registered at Bajakhana police station in connection with Behbal Kalan firing case.On January 15, SIT filed a supplementary chargesheet under sections 302, 307, 218, 201, 166-A, 120-B, 34, 194, 195, 109 of IPC in Behbal Kalan firing case naming Saini and Umranangal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/behbal-kalan-firing-trial-against-saini-umranangal-to-start-from-april-2-101616614343044.html

Even a monthly progress report has to be put up on the website of the Panipat district magistrate,” further read the order.The orders are based on findings of a committee set up to assess damage to the environment and public health by air and water pollution caused by the Panipat refinery after residents of villages in its vicinity, led by Singhpura Sithna village sarpanch Satpal Singh, had taken up the issue with the NGT in 2018.They had alleged that the refinery is polluting the air and water in its vicinity.Following the compliant, the NGT had formed a joint team for ground-level inspection to assess damage to environment and human health.In its report, the committee had found many environmental violations including samples from the effluent treatment plant (ETP) of the unit being non-compliant, ambient air quality exceeding the norms, VOCs resulting in eye irritation, untreated effluents being discharged into the green belt areas, untreated effluents being stored in open storage lagoon without VOC recovery system, and the groundwater samples not complying with the norms.In May 2019, on recommendations of the first assessment report of the joint committee, the NGT had directed the oil company to deposit ₹17.31 crore to the CPCB as interim compensation for restoration of environment.Then again in July 2020, the NGT had directed the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) officials to deposit a sum of ₹25 crore as interim compensation for restoration of environment.Reacting over the orders, HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan said, “Since the HSPCB has been made the nodal agency, we will follow all steps for compliance of the orders as per schedule with the help of other members of the joint committee.”In its reply to the NGT on March 18, the IOCL had claimed that they have complied with most issues raised by the joint committee and steps were taken to stop illegal discharge into the Thirana drain and work to cover all open sources of VOC emission will be completed by May 21 this year.Vivek Narain, general manager (A&W) Panipat refinery, said, “We have duly received the final orders of the NGT and are studying it. The NGT has considered the report submitted by the joint committee in the order and not levied any further compensation upon the IOCL.“The IOCL is committed to protection of environment. All directives suggested by the NGT will be complied by,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ensure-environmental-restoration-clean-drinking-water-air-near-panipat-refinery-101616614341833.html
25-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt drops name of ration delivery scheme, Centre points out flaw||The Delhi Cabinet headed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday approved the removal of the name ‘Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana’ from its ambitious doorstep delivery of a ration scheme after objections by the Union food and consumers affairs ministry.However, the Centre hinted that it may not be enough to launch the scheme on March 25. The ministry on Wednesday said that prima facie the scheme appears to “dilute” the National Food Security Act (NFSA).In a letter to the Delhi administration on Friday, the Union ministry principally raised two objections to the scheme -- the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA); and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA can only be done through a Parliament amendment.In a statement issued by the government on Wednesday, the chief minister’s office said: “The original name of the scheme, Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana, which was expected to be rolled out on March 25, will not have any name due to the obstruction by the Centre. Under the new scheme, wheat flour atta, rice, and sugar will be delivered to homes in packed bags.”However, DJ Narain, spokesperson for the Union ministry of food and public distribution, said dropping the name has nothing to do with the essential parameters of NFSA.“No reply (on the letter dated March 19) from the Delhi government has been received by the Ministry so far. We are still awaiting clarity from the Delhi government on several grey areas. From their order, prima facie it seems that many aspects of the NFSA act are either being diluted or slipping into uncertain zones,” he said.The spokesperson further asked if the additional price of milling and packaging will be recovered from consumers.“To ensure fair and foolproof transparent delivery, biometrics are needed of the fair price shop owner and the beneficiaries. Delhi remains only one of the four states in India which is still not doing it. The other three states --- Chhattisgarh, Assam and West Bengal had valid infrastructure and Aadhaar seeding issues. But Delhi has no infrastructure problem and was one of the first states/UTs to have 100% Aadhaar seeding, yet biometric system has not been implemented in the national Capital,” said Narain.On Saturday, Kejriwal said the scheme, after its name being removed, will be sent to the Central government for its approval.“This scheme will have no name. The central government sends the ration which gets distributed through the ration shops and now we will send the ration to the homes of the individuals. We do not want any kind of credit for this scheme and that is why the name of the scheme will be removed,” he said at a press conference.The home delivery system of ration will be optional for beneficiaries, government officials sad. “The file is being sent to the Central government now,” the official added. In its letter to the Delhi food commissioner on Friday, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the Delhi government is free to launch the scheme “without mixing the elements of the NFSA foodgrains”.The scheme was to be launched on March 25 from 100 households in Shahdara district’s Seemapuri area. On Saturday, Kejriwal said the scheme was planned with the intention to remove loopholes in the system and address the difficulties faced by people in getting their monthly quota of ration.Delhi has around 7.2 million ration beneficiaries, according to government data.The distribution of ration is currently managed by a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops. “At present, people can get ration only by going to a fair price shop. They have to stand in long queues or wait for shops to open as many open only for 2-3 days a month which is illegal. Then there is the problem of pilferage, adulteration and corruption. So, the doorstep delivery programme was aimed at addressing these systemic problems,” the chief minister said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-drops-name-of-ration-delivery-scheme-centre-says-it-still-dilutes-food-act-101616610613383.html

Secondly, it should recover the losses from him,” Tikait said.The BKU leader urged people to observe ‘Bharat Bandh’ on March 26.“This protest is a battle of ideology. The government has failed to hold talks with our delegation in the last two months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that farmers can sell their produce anywhere. We will prove him right by selling the crop outside state assemblies, the Parliament and offices of deputy commissioners,” Tikait said.“If the farmers can enter Delhi to take part in the parade, they can definitely reach outside the Parliament to sell their crop. People of BJP know that the PM has destroyed their party and that they have lost relevance on the ground level,” he added.Slamming the Union government over central agencies’ raids at Opposition leaders’ premises, Tikait said, “The BJP government is targeting people who are standing in support of farmers in the ongoing stir and conducting raids at their premises.”“Government is making attempts to muzzle the voice of Opposition and farmers. They had conducted I-T raids on premises of the Meham MLA’s home but he had voted against BJP in the Haryana assembly during trust vote. The BJP government can ask central agencies to target those standing in favour of farmers but they cannot suppress the voices of farmers,” Tikait added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-govt-should-lodge-fir-against-khattar-for-digging-nhs-to-prevent-movement-of-farmers-tikait-101616614218547.html

The court though had set aside Bharti’s conviction under section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence of a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) with a JCB machine.In his plea, Bharti has said that there is no evidence and the judgment of March 23 of the Special Judge has been passed relying upon conjectures and surmises based upon the totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution foisting erroneously the guilt upon the petitioner.“That the prosecution has miserably failed to prove guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt to substantiate the charges…That there is no iota of evidence which can be attributed to the petitioner in the instant case attracting ingredients of offence u/s 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and u/s 147 IPC r/w sec149 IPC,” the plea read.“Further, the case of the prosecution is full of improvements, embellishments, contradictions and is unworthy of reliance and will fall like a pack of cards just by the stroke of the sheer hand of providence by this court,” the plea added.The matter will now be heard on May 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-stays-aap-mla-somnath-bharti-s-conviction-jail-term-grants-him-bail-101616610607334.html
25-03-2021||Delhi||Lockdown brought to fore the humane face of policing||On the first anniversary of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Delhi Police on Wednesday said it has, so far, lost 34 personnel to the viral infection, while 7,733 personnel were infected. Even so, the force did its best to bring relief to people amid the pandemic -- it distributed over 12 million food packets to the needy, while 997 pregnant women were shifted to various hospitals in police vehicles during the lockdown.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the city police mentioned how they helped people by issuing movement passes, delivering food, ration and other essentials, apart from taking care of senior citizens, migrants and stray animals.Terming 2020 a “challenging year”, the Delhi Police said the lockdown brought about a paradigm shift in policing while putting a humane face on the law enforcing mechanism. After the nationwide lockdown was announced beginning March 24, police were among the first responders to the Covid-19 pandemic and were called the “Corona Warriors,” along with health care personnel and sanitation workers, the statement read.“So far, Delhi Police has lost 34 of its own -- they died while discharging their duties during the pandemic. A total of 7,733 personnel were infected, while 7,688 personnel have recovered, so far,” said city police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.While enforcing the lockdown in Delhi, Biswal said the focus of the force was to ensure that there was no panic among the people. The force also ensured that migrants had a regular supply of food, medicines, and other essentials during the months of restriction. All 15 police districts organised food networks through community kitchens.Apart from the food distribution, the police also started a helpline to address grievances of the public and to tackle emergency situations such as providing relief measures to the hungry, shelter to the stranded and aid to the helpless. The patrolling vans doubled up as ambulances for ailing and serious patients, thousands of whom were safely transported to and from hospitals.“A total of 997 women in labour were transferred to hospitals in PCR vans while nine babies were delivered in vans with the help of our personnel. In one such case, constable Dayaveer of Ashok Vihar police helped a pregnant woman shift to a hospital where he helped her deliver the child. The family named the child Dayaveer, after the policeman,” said Biswal, adding that several recovered personnel became plasma donors for those who were seriously infected.The city police said they issued movement passes to many whose family members were stranded at different locations outside the city and also to those who wanted to attend funerals of their loved ones in other states. “We were also monitoring emergencies flagged on social media and addressing them as quickly as possible. Medicines were made available to patients at their doorstep while issues of senior citizens were also taken care of,” said Biswal.According to Biswal, as a mass movement of migrant labourers towards their home towns in other states was one of the biggest challenges before the force -- these workers were persuaded by the police to stay at their homes or in shelters homes.“As migrants were already in distress, the police were briefed to be extra polite with them. Supplies of food, water and other essentials were distributed to them with the help of the civil administration, NGOs and civil society. When the lockdown was gradually eased, proper arrangements were made for them to reach their home towns,” added Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-brought-to-fore-the-humane-face-of-policing-101616610604382.html
25-03-2021||Other||Yediyurappa allocates additional funds to backward classes to deflect criticism||Bengaluru The BS Yediyurappa-led government on Wednesday allocated an additional ₹300 crore for the Ambedkar Development Corporation and the Adi Jambhava Corporation to help ease the pressure on himself over allegations of prioritising some caste groups over the others. The chief minister had come under sharp criticism for announcing ₹500 crore each for the dominant and politically influential communities like Vokkaligas and Lingayats in the state budget. The decision to allocate huge funds for Vokkaligas and Lingayats was seen as a move to get the backing of caste groups ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. The allocations for Vokkaligas, analysts said, is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strategy to reach out to the dominant community in southern Karnataka or Old Mysuru region where it has little electoral representation. The Vokkaligas are also known to support former prime minister HD Deve Gowda and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular). It would be crucial for the BJP to make inroads into this region if it wishes to return to power in 2023 on it’s own. He has also entertained reservation-related requests from dominant communities like Valmikis, Kurubas, Panchamasali (a subsect of Lingayats) and Vokkaligas among others to not be seen as only helping groups that back him and expand his support base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yediyurappa-allocates-additional-funds-to-backward-classes-to-deflect-criticism-101616613017766.html
25-03-2021||Other||Assembly adjourned after ruckus over Jarkiholi case||Bengaluru: The Karnataka Assembly was adjourned sine die on Wednesday as the sex scandal allegedly involving BJP leader and former water resources minister Ramesh Jarkiholi rocked the proceedings for the third consecutive day. Faced by continued disruption, the budget session of the Assembly that began on March 4, was adjourned sine die five days ahead of the schedule of March 31.The uproar started after Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar on Wednesday sought an inquiry into the private lives of 225 legislators to know if they were involved in any “immoral relationships” in the past. “I am openly challenging them, all the 225 legislators… let us all face an inquiry. In your personal lives, those who do not have extra marital affairs, let it be proved, including me... let it come out. Who did what when they were chief ministers... let it come out... what they did in their personal lives. Let there be an inquiry since it’s a question of morality,” Sudhakar told reporters in Bengaluru. The minister also named former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamy and Congress state chief D K Shivakumar to face the challenge “if their conscience is right”. He added that the probe would bring out the truth on all the elected representatives before the people of the state.Sudhakar said that such a probe would also reveal which of the legislators were “Eka Patni Vrata” (loyal to his wife) and “Sri Ramachandra”. The challenge, which was withdrawn by the minister later in the day, came as a response to the Congress’ demands for a court-monitored probe into the alleged sexual exploitation of a woman by former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on the pretext of providing a job. Sudhakar is among the six ministers in the B S Yediyurappa-led government who have secured an injunction from a city and sessions court against publication, broadcast and circulation of any material against them.His remarks evoked a sharp response from leaders belonging to the ruling as well as opposition party, with legislators assuring that they have “one wife and one family”. “When giving a statement, you should name the person concerned. It is wrong to say that all of them should be inquired. When one person becomes a minister or a legislator, there is some status and respect that they have… they are not like common people since they have been elected,” Narasimha Nayak (Raju Gouda), BJP legislator from Shorapur, said, adding that Sudhakar’s statement was not correct and must be withdrawn.“I have just one wife and just one family. Am happy he has taken all our names. I think there is something wrong with him,” Shivakumar said. He added that his party would discuss the remark and raise it before the House. Hitting out at Sudhakar, Kumarsawamy said such a situation would not have arisen if he and his ministerial colleagues had followed propriety.Recalling that he had once slipped in his private life, he said, I admitted that in the Assembly. Why has he (Sudhakar) brought in my name. I have said it openly.” “These things wouldn’t have come up had you behaved properly and hadn’t gone to court for an injunction. You created these problems, Kumaraswamy said.“I don’t know the context in which he made those statements but using that word is wrong,” Roopakala M (Roopa Shashidhar) of the Congress said. H D Revanna of Janata Dal (Secular) said he was willing to undergo any probe and even make a statement in a temple before the gods. In a letter to the government later, Siddaramaiah, the Congress’ leader of opposition, said the party accepted the challenge and that the chief minister and Speaker should also be among those probed. Earlier in the day, Siddaramaiah demanded that the Jarkiholi case be supervised by the Chief Justice of Karnataka high court. “We have no faith in the Special Investigation Team (SIT),” he said. He had earlier sought the registration of a rape case against Jarkiholi as the victim, he claimed, said in a video that she was “utilized” and thus, it would amount to rape.However, in a statement released in the evening, Sudhakar said that his words should not be taken literally and that people should “understand the pain and anguish” behind them. “No one bothered when Congress deliberately tried to defame and indulge in character assassination of the six ministers. But my statement to introspect themselves has hurt people. I request them not to take the literal meaning of my statement but understand the pain and anguish behind my words,” he said. “My statement has been misinterpreted and I regret it if it has hurt anyone,” he added. Meanwhile, finance bills were passed by the Karnataka Legislative Assembly amid staunch protests over the case. The Congress, which continued to agitate for the third consecutive day, trooped into the well of the House and raised slogans against the government. The Grand Old Party also demanded the resignation of the six ministers who sought injunction from the court. Yediyurappa, whose reply on the budget discussion was continuously disrupted by the protesting legislators, condemned Congress’ conduct and said people were watching the developments and will teach them a lesson in the days to come.“As they don’t have any issue they are doing it, I condemn it. People of the state are watching you and will teach a lesson in the days to come, you can’t achieve anything from it,” he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. After the chief minister’s reply, the Speaker put the appropriation bills, supplementary estimates, and related financial bills including Fiscal Responsibility (Amendment) Bill 2021 that were tabled, to vote, and they were passed amid din.The Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was also passed by the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assembly-adjourned-after-ruckus-over-jarkiholi-case-101616612957789.html
25-03-2021||Other||Govt imposes curbs on political, religious events||Bengaluru As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continue to surge in Karnataka, the state government on Wednesday said it has directed all district authorities to restrict all political and religious events for a month. “We have to take strict action now as it would be difficult to contain the surge if there are slips now,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health minister, said on Wednesday. Karnataka reported 2,298 new Covid- 19 cases in 24 hours on Tuesday, taking the total number of active cases to 16,886. The state also reported 12 fatalities taking the to to 12461, according to the state health department’s daily bulletin. Bengaluru continued to account for the majority of new cases as it reported 1,398 cases on Tuesday, taking the total active caseload to 11,520. Bengaluru reported seven fatalities on Tuesday, taking its toll to 4,563. Kalaburagi recorded 118 new cases, while Tumakuru, Udupi, Bidar and Mysuru reported 94, 79, 82 and 74 new cases, respectively, on Tuesday. Sudhakar said the state will observe decisions taken by other states on mandatory RT-PCR tests for all persons coming from other states. “We will see how things turn up in other states and then decide,” he said. However, the government remains steadfast in not announcing a lockdown—partial or otherwise. According to experts, the knowledge of Covid-19, ongoing vaccination drive and economic considerations have weighed on the decisions of chief minister B.S Yediyurappa-led state government. “The economic impact is one of the major considerations of the government,” Dr V Ravi, senior professor and head of the department of Neurovirology at NIMHANS, said. Dr Ravi is also part of the technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 in Karnataka. Stating that last year was the state and country’s first experience on the virus, Dr Ravi added that there is better knowledge on the subject and that Karnataka was better prepared to deal with the surge. He said hospitals were better equipped and that there were enough beds with oxygen and other requirements to treat Covid-19 patients. Though Karnataka had proactively begun its treatment, testing, tracing and isolation efforts last year, it has fallen back on tracing and testing in the last few months, experts said. The government is now willing to deploy any or all measures like isolation, testing persons coming from other states and improving contact tracing, while shrugging off any suggestion to go in for a lockdown, experts said. With revenue channels from the Centre drying up, Karnataka is relying on taxes like excise and home registrations among other avenues to bring in some funds into the cash-starved and calamity-prone state. Despite losing out on two months of sales, the excise department of the state has managed to fulfill its 2020-21 target of Rs22,700 crore on Wednesday, with almost a week left to go in the financial year. An official of the excise department said the increase of taxes twice last year by 17-25% helped bring in some revenue to the state exchequer. “(I) don’t think there is anything alarming at this stage,” the official said. With a sharp surge in cases, Yediyurappa-led government has fallen back on intensifying the vaccination drive to contain the spike. Till 7.30 pm on Tuesday, Karnataka has vaccinated (first and second dose) over 28.11 lakh people. However, the government has turned a blind eye on political events and other public functions where large numbers of people gather with no safety protocols like wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, experts said. The government has intensified scrutinising weddings, late night parties and other events. Chief minister B.S Yediyurappa has specified that restrictions will be imposed on people gatherings indoors and not outdoors. This distinction will help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other political parties to campaign for the upcoming bypolls (on April 17) and conduct meetings, analysts said.Industrialists and people in the hospitality business, meanwhile, feared that any possibility of another lockdown would cripple the economy further. “We have written a letter to Dr Harsh Vardhan (Union health minister) and the BBMP commissioner to increase vaccination and not take any harsh decisions,” PC Rao, president of the Bengaluru Hotels Association, said. He added that there was no financial help from the government during the last lockdown and another set of restrictions would cripple a sector that was just getting back on its feet. “Our business got no support from the government. We had to bear the burden of government decisions and we may just not be able to bear another lockdown,” said a member of the state wine merchants association, requesting not to be named..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-imposes-curbs-on-political-religious-events-101616612897751.html
25-03-2021||Delhi||HC orders Delhi govt to pay nearly ₹900 crore to MCDs by end of March||The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the state government to release the remaining amounts due to the three civic bodies towards their Basic Tax Assignment (BTA) on the basis of revised estimates presented in the budget for the year 2021-22, within the current financial year.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said that the amount, which is nearly ₹900 crore, is one of the major and important sources of revenue for the corporations. It said that this contribution by the Delhi government to the corporations is used to meet the expenditures towards the salaries and other expenses on a day-to-day basis.“….we direct the Delhi government to release in the financial year the remaining amount due towards BTA to the three corporation on basis of revised estimates presented in budget for year 2021-22,” the court said.The corporations had sought that the amount deducted by the Delhi government in their revised estimates be released to them for release of salaries.The Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel advocate Satyakam, told the court that they have incurred a huge deficit in the revenue generation due to the pandemic and they would release the amount in April.However, the court said that the money should be released by this financial year. A detailed order is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi high court.Reacting to the development, Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, at a press conference, said that the decision of high court ordering immediate release of funds to the three municipal corporations has vindicated his party’s agitation, demanding fund release for MCDs.He said that BJP has all along said that due to its biased political attitude, the Arvind Kejriwal government has not allowed rise in MCDs funds as per 4th Delhi Finance Commission & Municipal Reforms Committees recommendations.“Apart from this, the Arvind Kejriwal government every year cuts the budget allocated funds of the three MCDs. Due to this biased politics of Arvind Kejriwal government, today over ₹13,000 crore of MCDs funds stand accumulated with it.“….the court today delivered a historic decision rejecting all pleas put up by Delhi government and ordered that they should in one week release Rs. 991 crores of pending funds of the three MCDs for this current financial year 2020-21,” he said, adding that the order has established that the Delhi government has with political bias stalled municipal funds and it is responsible for the problems of deficient public services faced by the people apart from the salary problem faced by the employees.The AAP did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcorders-delhi-govt-to-pay-nearly-rs-900-crore-to-mcds-by-end-of-march-101616610597413.html

The victim’s family members have alleged that the assailants fired more than 30 rounds and the man was shot nearly 24 times.The police too confirmed that multiple rounds were fired, but refused to give the exact count of bullet injuries that the man might have sustained, while stating that they were waiting for the autopsy report.Police identified the victim as Dalip alias Kunal, who they said had a criminal past and he was involved in seven cases of murder, kidnapping, robbery and hurt. The police suspect that Kunal may have been killed over personal enmity. His family, however, has accused a local criminal for the murder and said that the local goon had threatened his brother around two months ago. Kunal ran a meat shop at H-block in Dakshinpuri.“We have registered a case of murder and are probing it from all possible angles. Prime facie, personal enmity appears to be the reason behind Kunal’s murder,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.DCP Thakur said that the crime took place around 11.30pm outside Kunal’s meat shop and it came to their notice at about 12.45am, after a call was received from a hospital.During initial enquiry, the DCP said, it was learnt that Kunal was standing near his shop when the four men arrived on two two-wheelers and opened fire. Kunal was declared brought dead at the hospital, he said.Kunal’s brother Sunny said that his brother was with two other persons when the four men — all wearing helmets —arrived on a bike and a scooter and opened fire. “They fired 30-40 bullets. Doctors told us that my brother was shot at least 23-24 times. We were having enmity with a local gangster, who had threatened me over the phone around two months ago,” said Sunny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-shot-multiple-times-in-dakshinpuri-police-suspect-personal-enmity-behind-murder-101616610589331.html

Aggarwal’s son, Aayush, as well as his brother-in-law, Mohit Goyal, said the police told them that they did not find the chain on Aggarwal’s body or at the crime scene.“We are investigating the case from all possible angles and it’s too early to reach any conclusion,” said deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani, when asked if Aggarwal’s murder has any connection with his missing gold chain.Aggarwal lived with his wife and two children on the first floor of a four-storey building in Majlis Park. The occupants of all four floors, including Aggarwal, own a property on Mahatma Gandhi Road that is less than a kilometre away from their home. A four-storey building is being constructed there and Aggarwal was murdered at the under-construction site when he had gone there with his wife to meet the labourers on March 16, the police said.A woman labourer working at the site said she was cooking food while Aggarwal and his wife were talking to another labourer, when she heard a gunshot. “By the time I rushed out there, Aggarwal lay bleeding on the floor. An unidentified man had shot him and fled on a scooter,” said the woman, who did not share her name.A case of murder and use of firearm was registered and several teams were formed to identify and nab the suspect. The investigating team scanned CCTV cameras around the crime scene and the routes that the suspect had taken. It helped them identify the scooter and its owner, who told the police that it was stolen some days ago from central Delhi. The owner also said teams from police stations in west Delhi had also contacted him regarding the use of his scooter in snatching incidents, said the officer cited above.After picking up some clues, the police teams of west and north-west districts are conducting searches at various places, including Uttar Pradesh, to nab a snatcher who could be involved in Aggarwal’s murder and the snatching incidents of west Delhi, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-probing-snatching-angle-in-ca-s-murder-after-gold-chain-found-missing-101616610585429.html

25-03-2021||Pune||Pune civic body to start 24x7 Covid vaccination at five civic hospitals||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued an order on Wednesday to start round-the-clock Covid-19 vaccination at five civic hospitals from March 24. The civic body aims to increase vaccination as the city has been witnessing a drastic rise in the number of fresh Covid cases. The order states that when the night curfew is imposed only health care workers and frontline workers would be vaccinated at these centres and it would not be opened for phase two beneficiaries. The order mentions that the five 24x7 vaccination centres would be Kamala Nehru hospital in Mangalwar peth, Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Yerawada, Jayabhai Nanasaheb Sutar hospital in Kothrud, Murlidhar Pandurang Laigude at Wadgaon Dhayari and Annasaheb Magar Maternity home in Hadapsar. The order also states that these centres must put out a board which clearly mentions that vaccination would not be in place during the night curfew hours. The medical officer concerned must appoint a medical superintendent and medical officer at these centres. The state’s vaccination capacity also went up as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) donated an air-conditioned vaccine van to the state government’s health department. The van with a capacity of 32 cubic meters can carry 30 lakh doses of vaccines at a time. This is the first such initiative in the state. The van will supply vaccines especially in Marathwada and Vidarbha. Dr Dilip Patil, state vaccination officer and deputy director of public health department said, “Any vaccine be it the currently approved Covid-19 vaccines or other vaccines under universal immunisation programmes like polio, rubella and others need to be maintained at +2-+8 degrees Celsius so that the efficacy remains intact. It is important to maintain the cold chain between vaccine suppliers and beneficiaries. Since the vaccine will be available to all people from April 1, a large number of vaccines will have to be transported. In this case, the vaccine van will be useful. Our furthest vaccination centre is at Nagpur which is about 1,000 kilometers. This truck can store the vaccine safely for days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-start-24x7-covid-vaccination-at-five-civic-hospitals-101616602037034.html

It was not clear, thus, if the two sides intend to pick up from where the Trump administration had left off or they will start afresh, as Goyal suggested some weeks ago.The two officials agreed to “revitalise” engagement through the US-India Trade Policy Forum, the USTR said referring to the key platform for trade talks between the two countries.They also decided to “to work constructively to resolve key outstanding bilateral trade issues and to take a comprehensive look at ways to expand the trade relationship”.The Indian side had said the Trump administration resorted to “nitpicking” in the trade talks and constantly changed their goalposts, which eventually denied them a deal, even a “mini deal” or an “interim deal”. Goyal has called for a “fresh package” for talks.Tai raised the importance of cooperation on a broad set of issues, including digital trade, intellectual property, agriculture, labour, and climate and the environment, the USTR said, listing out major US issues, some of whom have defied resolution across administrations in India and the US and some new and emerging areas of dissonance.There was no mention in the USTR readout to the Indian demand for restoring its special trading privileges under a US trade programme called the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which were terminated by the Trump administration to force India to concede key US demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-agree-to-resolve-outstanding-trade-issues-101616696904959.html
25-03-2021||World||Joe Biden doubles goal of Covid-19 vaccines to 200 million doses||President Joe Biden opened his first formal news conference Thursday with a nod toward the improving picture on battling the coronavirus, but he was immediately pressed on thorny issues, like immigration and voting rights, now testing his administration.Biden doubled his original goal on Covid-19 vaccines by pledging that the nation will administer 200 million doses by the end of his first 100 days in office. The administration had met Biden's initial goal of 100 million doses earlier this month — before even his 60th day in office — as the president pushes to defeat a pandemic that has killed more than 545,000 Americans and devastated the nation's economy.But while Biden had held off on holding his first news conference so he could use it to celebrate progress against the pandemic and passage of a giant Covid-19 relief package, he was quickly pressed at the question-and-answer session about all sorts of other challenges that have cropped up along the way.A pair of mass shootings, rising international tensions, early signs of intraparty divisions and increasing numbers of migrants crossing the southern border are all confronting a West Wing known for its message discipline.“I am going to deal with all of those problems,” Biden pledged.He then endorsed a modification — but not elimination — of the filibuster, without which it would be difficult to get his ambitious agenda through Republican opposition in the Senate. But he left the door open, at least on certain issues, to go further.“If there’s complete lockdown and chaos, as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’re going to have to go beyond what I’m talking about,” he said.“I want to get things done. I want to get them done consistent with what we promised the American people,” said Biden, who spent decades in the Senate. “I am going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating getting things done in the United States Senate."While seemingly ambitious, Biden’s vaccine goal amounts to a continuation of the existing pace of vaccinations through the end of next month. The US is now averaging about 2.5 million doses per day and an even greater rate is possible. Over the next month, two of the bottlenecks to getting Americans vaccinated are set to ease as the US supply of vaccines is on track to increase and states lift eligibility requirements to get shots.The scene looked very different from what Americans are used to seeing for formal presidential news conferences. The president still stood behind a podium against a backdrop of flags. But due to the pandemic, the White House limited attendance and only 30 socially distanced chairs for journalists were spread out in the expansive room.“It’s an opportunity for him to speak to the American people, obviously directly through the coverage, directly through all of you,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. “And so I think he’s thinking about what he wants to say, what he wants to convey, where he can provide updates, and, you know, looking forward to the opportunity to engage with a free press.”Biden is the first chief executive in four decades to reach this point in his term without holding a formal news conference. While he has been on pace with his predecessors in taking questions from the press in other formats, he tends to field just one or two informal inquiries at a time, usually in a hurried setting at the end of an event or in front of a whirring helicopter.Pressure had mounted on Biden to hold a formal session, which allows reporters to have an extended back-and-forth with the president on the issues of the day. Biden's conservative critics have pointed to the delay to suggest that Biden was being shielded by his staff.West Wing aides have dismissed the questions about a news conference as a Washington obsession, pointing to Biden’s high approval ratings while suggesting that the general public is not concerned about the event. The president himself, when asked Wednesday if he were ready for the press conference, joked, “What press conference?”Behind the scenes, though, aides have taken the event seriously enough to hold a mock session with the president earlier this week. And there is some concern that Biden, a self-proclaimed “gaffe machine,” could go off message and generate a series of unflattering news cycles.“The press conference serves an important purpose: It presents the press an extended opportunity to hold a leader accountable for decisions,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, presidential scholar and professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania. “A question I ask: What is the public going to learn in this venue that it couldn’t learn elsewhere? And why does it matter? The answer: The president speaks for the nation.”Biden was expected to point to a surge in vaccine distribution, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the sweeping stimulus package.But plenty of challenges abound.His appearance comes just a day after he appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the government’s response to the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border, where the administration faces a growing humanitarian and political challenge that threatens to overshadow Biden's legislative agenda.In less than a week, two mass shootings have rattled the nation and pressure has mounted on the White House to back tougher gun measures. The White House has struggled to blunt a nationwide effort by Republican legislatures to tighten election laws. A pair of Democratic senators briefly threatened to hold up the confirmation of Biden appointees due to a lack of Asian American representation in the Cabinet. And both North Korea and Russia have unleashed provocative actions to test a new commander in chief.In a sharp contrast with the previous administration, the Biden White House has exerted extreme message discipline, empowering staff to speak but doing so with caution. The new White House team has carefully managed the president’s appearances, which serves Biden’s purposes but denies the media opportunities to directly press him on major policy issues and to engage in the kind of back-and-forth that can draw out information and thoughts that go beyond curated talking points.Having overcome a childhood stutter and famously long-winded, Biden has long enjoyed interplay with reporters and has defied aides’ requests to ignore questions from the press. He has been prone to gaffes throughout his long political career and, as president, has occasionally struggled with off-the-cuff remarks.Those are the types of distractions his aides have tried to avoid, and, in a pandemic silver lining, were largely able to dodge during the campaign because the virus kept Biden home for months and limited the potential for public mistakes.Firmly pledging his belief in freedom of the press, Biden has rebuked his predecessor’s incendiary rhetoric toward the media, including Donald Trump’s references to reporters as “the enemy of the people.” Biden restored the daily press briefing, which had gone extinct under Trump, opening a window into the workings of the White House. And he sat for a national interview with ABC News last week.Biden has also delivered a series of well-received speeches, including his inaugural address, and has shown that he can effectively communicate beyond news conferences, according to Frank Sesno, former head of George Washington University’s school of media.“His strongest communication is not extemporaneous. He can ramble or stumble into a famous Biden gaffe,” said Sesno in a recent interview. “But to this point, he and his team have been very disciplined with the message of the day and in hitting the words of the day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-doubles-goal-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-200-million-doses-101616696150759.html
25-03-2021||World||Russia opposition leader Alexei Navalny's health worsens in prison||Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has accused prison authorities of failing to provide proper treatment for his back pain and leg problems, saying in a letter posted Thursday that his physical condition has worsened in prison and he now has trouble walking.Navalny blamed his health problems on prison officials failing to provide the right medicines and refusing to allow his doctor to visit him behind bars. He also complained in a second letter that the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night amounted to sleep deprivation torture.Copies of his letters to penitentiary officials and Russia’s top prosecutor were posted on Navalny's website.The 44-year-old Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken opponent, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.Last month, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.“My condition has worsened. I feel acute pain in my right leg, and I feel numbness in its lower part,” Navalny wrote in the letter. “I have trouble walking.”He said that the authorities have given him standard pills and ointment for his pain, but refused to accept medicines earlier prescribed by his doctor.He accused prison officials of undermining his health with a “deliberate denial of due medical assistance."Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service said earlier Thursday that Navalny had undergone medical check-ups the previous day, describing his condition as “stable and satisfactory.”But Navalny's lawyer, Olga Mikhailova, said Thursday after visiting him in prison that “his right leg is in terrible shape.”Mikhailova said on Dozhd TV that Navalny was taken to a hospital outside his prison on Wednesday for magnetic resonance tomography but wasn't given the results.She said Navalny had experienced back pain for four weeks, but prison officials also would not permit a visit by his doctor. The lawyer argued that authorities should transfer Navalny to Moscow so he could get better treatment.Navalny’s wife, Yulia, said on Instagram that she doesn’t trust the prison medics, and she called on authorities to let doctors who have her and her husband's trust in to see him. She said prison authorities refused to accept a note from Navalny's doctor prescribing some exercises to ease his back pain.She denounced the treatment of her husband in prison as part of Putin’s “personal revenge.”Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the Kremlin wasn't following Navalny's condition, referring questions to the penitentiary service.Earlier this month, Navalny was moved to a prison colony in Pokrov in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of Moscow. The facility stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its particularly strict regime that includes routines like standing at attention for hours.In a note earlier this month, Navalny described the prison, IK-2, as a “friendly concentration camp.” He said he hadn’t seen “even a hint at violence” there but lived under controls that he compared to George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four.”Navalny, whom prison authorities had earlier marked as a flight risk, said he was subject to particularly close oversight, including a guard waking him up every hour at night and filming him to demonstrate he is in the required place.He complained about the practice in a separate letter to the chief of the penitentiary service and the top prosecutor that also was released Thursday, saying that the hourly checks amount to “sleep deprivation torture.”Navalny’s arrest in January triggered a wave of protests that drew tens of thousands of participants across Russia. Authorities detained about 11,000 people, many of whom were fined or given jail terms ranging from seven to 15 days.Navalny's associates called earlier this week for another mass protest across the country to demand his release from prison. They urged Russians to sign up for a protest on an interactive map and said they would set a date for it when the number of people willing to take part reaches at least 500,000 nationwide.More than 250,000 have registered on a dedicated website since it opened Tuesday.Russian officials have rejected demands from the United States and the European Union to free Navalny and stop the crackdown on his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-s-health-worsens-in-prison-101616696142982.html
25-03-2021||World||'Happens every year': Joe Biden says immigrant surge seasonal||President Joe Biden pushed back Thursday at claims the flow of undocumented immigrants at the US southern border has reached crisis levels, saying the surge is a mostly seasonal problem that happens each year."There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year," he said in his first press conference since taking office.Pushing back on criticisms that he has opened the door to undocumented immigrants, Biden said his government is committed to allowing unaccompanied migrant children to enter the United States for humanitarian reasons.More than 9,000 came in February, a number on track to top 14,000 this month, swamping facilities of the US Customs and Border Patrol for processing them.He also said that the United States is allowing a number of families to enter because Mexico is refusing to accept their return."We are sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming," Biden said."They should all be going back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happens-every-year-joe-biden-says-immigrant-surge-seasonal-101616696129129.html
25-03-2021||World||Nike, Adidas and H&M face boycott heat over Xinjiang||Nike and Adidas came under attack on Chinese social media on Thursday over past comments the fashion brands have made about labour conditions in Xinjiang, part of a diplomatic row between China and the West.The sportswear companies were the latest caught up in a backlash prompted by a Chinese government call to stop foreign brands from tainting China's name as internet users found statements they had made in the past on Xinjiang.Chinese state media had singled out H&M on Wednesday over a statement reported last year where the Swedish fashion retailer said it was deeply concerned by reports of accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang, and that it did not source products from the Chinese region.Both Nike and Adidas, which have been growing rapidly in China, have said previously that they do not source products or yarn from the Xinjiang region. Adidas declined to comment on Thursday and Nike did not respond to requests for further comment.Earlier this week, China denied allegations of human rights abuses by its officials in the western region of Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs, after the European Union, United States, Britain and Canada imposed sanctions on the officials.Beijing hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European lawmakers, scholars and institutions.Some internet users said they would stop buying Nike and will support local brands such as Li Ning and Anta, while others told Adidas to leave China.The dispute creates a dilemma for Western companies who must balance the desire to expand their business in China against the views of consumers in their home markets."Brands must not rescind on their human rights responsibilities in the face of this pressure," said Chloe Cranston of Anti-Slavery International, a member of the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uighur Region.BOYCOTT CALLSShares of Anta Sports Products Ltd and Li Ning Co surged, while shares in Adidas, Inditex and H&M fell on Thursday.State tabloid Global Times said Spain's Inditex, owner of Zara, had "quietly removed" a statement on Xinjiang from its English and Spanish-language websites.An Inditex webpage stating that the company was highly concerned about reports alleging social and labour malpractice in various supply chains among ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang was live on March 24, a Google cache showed, but now appears to be unavailable.Inditex did not respond to a request for comment. Inditex has previously said it does not have any commercial relations in Xinjiang.Chinese internet users also targeted the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a group that promotes sustainable cotton production which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns.BCI members include Nike, Adidas, H&M and Japan's Fast Retailing. The Better Cotton Initiative website also stopped working on Thursday. The organisation did not respond to a request for comment."If you boycott Xinjiang cotton, we'll boycott you. Either Adidas quits BCI, or get out of China," one internet user wrote.H&M said on Wednesday it respected Chinese consumers and that it was committed to long-term investment and development in China.But by Thursday morning, H&M did not exist on some Chinese store locator maps. Searches for H&M stores on Baidu Maps yielded no results. The retailer's official store on Alibaba's Tmall, an e-commerce platform, was inaccessible.At a daily media briefing at China's foreign ministry, spokeswoman Hua Chunying, when asked about H&M, held up a photograph of Black Americans picking cotton."This was in the US when Black slaves were forced to pick cotton in the fields," she said.Hua then held up a second photograph of cotton fields in Xinjiang."More than 40% of the cotton in Xinjiang is harvested by machinery, so the alleged forced labour is non-existent."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nike-adidas-and-h-m-face-boycott-heat-over-xinjiang-101616695635976.html
25-03-2021||World||US conducted more than two dozen pre-election cyber operations||The US carried out more than two dozen operations to thwart adversaries from election meddling ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a top intelligence official.General Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command, testified at a Senate hearing on Thursday that Cyber Command conducted the operations “to get ahead of foreign threats before they interfered or influenced our elections.”Nakasone appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee a week after the US intelligence community issued a report describing foreign efforts to influence voter opinions. It found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered operations to hurt President Joe Biden’s candidacy and favor former President Donald Trump. Iran sought to hurt Trump’s candidacy, but China didn’t deploy influence efforts, according to the report. While there were foreign efforts aimed at affecting voter opinion, there were no attempts on “any technical aspect of the voting process,” the agencies found.Nakasone also said that two recently discovered cyber-attacks were “a clarion call” to take a fresh look at challenges facing the US.The first was December’s revelation that suspected Russian hackers compromised popular software from SolarWinds Corp. and breached about nine government agencies as well as 100 companies. And in March, Microsoft Corp. revealed that suspected Chinese hackers used vulnerabilities in its Exchange software for email and carried out an attack that experts say has tens of thousands of victims.“What we’ve seen from both the SolarWinds and the Microsoft intrusions is an increasing level of sophistication,” Nakasone said. “This is a scope, a scale, a level of sophistication that we hadn’t seen previously.”The SolarWinds attack was conducted through US networks, taking advantage of an area where Nakasone said he has limited visibility, referring to constraints on domestic surveillance by intelligence agencies.“Our adversaries understand that they can come into the United States and rapidly utilize an internet service provider -- come up and do their activities and take that down, before a warrant can be issued, before we can actually have surveillance by a civilian authority here in the United States,” he said. “That’s the challenge that we have right now.”Asked whether China has continued to steal intellectual property from the US after a 2015 agreement that neither power would conduct economic espionage, Nakasone described wide-ranging Chinese cyber activities in recent years. “I have seen the Chinese continue to utilize cyber activities below the level of armed conflict to steal intellectual property, to steal our personal identification, and at times attempt to influence our populace,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-conducted-more-than-two-dozen-pre-election-cyber-operations-101616693184255.html
25-03-2021||World||Giant cargo ship with all Indian crew blocks the Suez Canal. All you need to know||The giant cargo ship Ever Given remained stuck in the Suez Canal for the third consecutive day creating a huge backlog of ships in the canal. The Japanese owner of the ship, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, has said that the entire crew of 25 Indian nationals were safe and no oil leaks have been detected, reported the BBC.The Suez Canal authority has temporarily suspended traffic along the waterways while some experts predict that it will take several days to clear the canal costing global trade billions of dollars.Also Read | Jailed Putin opponent Navalny says his health is worsening“I can’t exclude that it can last weeks if the ship is really stuck,” Bloomberg quoted Peter Berdowski, chief executive officer of Boskalis Westminster, the parent company of the salvage team as saying.“It is like an enormous beached whale. It's an enormous weight on the sand. We might have to work with a combination of reducing the weight by removing containers, oil and water from the ship, tug boats and dredging of sand,” Berdowski added, reported Reuters.What has happened so farThe front of the ship is wedged around 5 meters into the canal wall, restricting the re-floating efforts, reported Bloomberg.The trouble began on Tuesday as the strong winds kicked up sands along the banks of the 120-mile narrow Suez canal. The over 200,000-tonne vessel was on its way from China to Rotterdam when the gusts as high as 46 miles an hour swept the dust around it making the crew lose control of the ship. Then the ship dashed into a sandy embankment that blocked nearly the entire canal. The vessel is still in the same position as it was when it careened, Bloomberg quoted Inchcape Shipping Services, a maritime services providerDigging efforts are ongoing as a way to remove sand from the front hull of the vessel to tug the vessel from the side.ImpactThe 400 meters long ship has choked both ways of one of the busiest canals linking Asia with Europe. A line of 156 large container ships, tankers carrying oil and gas, and bulk vessels with grains have created a massive traffic jam, also referred to as one of the worst shipping jams seen in years.Around 30 per cent of the world’s shipping container volume and 12 per cent of the total global trade of all goods pass through the narrow canal.As per rough estimates, the blockage in the backdrop of the global economy affected by Covid-19 will cost about $9.6 billion worth of traffic a day, as per Lloyd’s List. Westbound traffic is worth around $5.1 billion a day and eastbound traffic is around $4.5 billion a day, reported Bloomberg.Kaisha has apologised for the disruption but said dislodging Ever Given seems extremely difficult, reported BBC. “In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat [the Ever Given], but we are facing extreme difficulty,” BBC quoted Kaisha as saying.The shipping container vessels have nearly doubled in size in the past decade, even with the Suez Canal widening and deepening to make the transit easier. The block highlights the risk for the shipping industry as the ships get bigger and waterways get congested making such incidents common.Container ships have to wait for the canal to get clear or opt for sailing around the southern tip of Africa, Cape of Good Hope, which will take two more weeks of travel.Also Read | US lawmakers, tech CEOs face off over disinformationNick Sloane, the salvage master that led the re-flotation of the capsized cruise ship at the coast of Italy in 2012 believes that the best chance for normal shipping will return by Sunday or Monday when the tide will reach its peak. The salvors may have to lighten the vessel by unloading heavy elements from the ship, even fuel for that matter, things that aid the ship to keep steady at sea.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-cargo-ship-with-all-indian-crew-blocks-the-suez-canal-all-you-need-to-know-101616689872605.html
25-03-2021||World||Jailed Putin opponent Navalny says his health is worsening||Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny said he is suffering severe back pain despite prison officials’ assurances that he’s in a satisfactory condition.“I consider the deterioration in my health is a direct result of the actions and inactions of prison officials, deliberately aimed at refusing me necessary medical care and ruining my health,” he wrote in letters to prison and judicial authorities posted on his website by allies Thursday. “I regard what’s happening as an abuse.”Navalny demanded access to a Moscow specialist and an end to prison guards waking him every hour during the night. He has “practically lost the use” of his right leg and is in “terrible pain,” Olga Mikhailova, one of his lawyers, told TV Rain after visiting him in prison earlier Thursday.President Vladimir Putin’s most outspoken critic has been held at the notorious IK-2 prison about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow since March 11. He was imprisoned for breaching parole while recovering in Germany from a near-fatal nerve-agent poisoning in Siberia last year that he and Western governments have blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny involvement.Navalny said he was taken for a scan Wednesday but not informed of the results and given only two pain-relief tablets a day.The regional Penitentiary Service said Navalny had been examined with other inmates with health complaints on Wednesday and found to be in “stable, satisfactory” condition, the state-run Tass news service reported.Navalny’s wife, Yulia, appealed to Putin to release him in an Instagram post Thursday in which she also said that prison officials had refused to allow lawyers to pass on exercise instructions from a back specialist to help her husband reduce the pain.The penal colony holding 44-year-old Navalny is known for its particularly harsh regime. He’s serving a 2 1/2 year sentence for violating probation terms of an earlier suspended fraud sentence in a case that the European Court of Human Rights has called politically motivated.His supporters have called for a day of rallies across Russia this spring. Nationwide protests that erupted in January following Navalny’s detention petered out after a major crackdown that led to thousands of arrests.Navalny’s allies say 250,000 anonymous entries have been made on a petition from people who’ve pledged to take part in the new demonstrations calling for his release, out of a targeted 500,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-putin-opponent-navalny-says-his-health-is-worsening-101616691859223.html

Gavi said it has notified recipient countries.The institute has been contracted to supply vaccines to 64 countries, and Gavi said the U.N.-backed program has “notified all affected economies of potential delays.”Gavi, which runs COVAX jointly with the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, has already distributed 31 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- 28 million from the Serum Institute and another 3 million from a South Korean contractor also producing the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unbacked-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-program-warns-of-supply-delays-101616690907397.html
25-03-2021||World||US lawmakers, tech CEOs face off over disinformation||More than two months after the violent uprising at the US Capitol, angry lawmakers in the same building Thursday are asking social media top executives for answers about how they are clamping down on misinformation and harmful content leading to violence and other damaging impacts.The leaders of Facebook, Google and Twitter sought to head off critics leading into the House of Representatives hearing, the latest in a series highlighting concerns over moderating content about elections, Covid-19 and the January 6 uprising.The remote video hearing is the fourth for Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey since last July and the third for Google's Sundar Pichai, who have been in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike."Whether it be falsehoods about the Covid-19 vaccine or debunked claims of election fraud, these online platforms have allowed misinformation to spread, intensifying national crises with real-life, grim consequences for public health and safety," said the heads of the two congressional subcommittees holding the hearing, in a statement.The tech CEOs said they were doing their best to keep out harmful content."Every day Twitter grapples with complex considerations on how to address extremism and misinformation," Dorsey said in his written testimony released in advance by the House Energy and Commerce Committee."Our efforts to combat misinformation, however, must be linked to earning trust. Without trust, we know the public will continue to question our enforcement actions."Pichai said Google is dedicated to giving people "trustworthy content and opportunities for free expression across our platforms, while limiting the reach of harmful misinformation."Zuckerberg meanwhile said Facebook has ramped up its efforts "to keep hate and violence off our platform" and offered a proposal to address concerns about liability of online platforms, suggesting that each platform have systems in place to weed out illegal content.Zuckerberg said that "people of all political persuasions want to know that companies are taking responsibility for combatting unlawful content and activity on their platforms."He maintained that Congress "should consider making platforms' intermediary liability protection for certain types of unlawful content conditional on companies' ability to meet best practices to combat the spread of this content."- Amplifying algorithms -The hearing comes amid a growing backlash against Big Tech firms which dominate key economic sectors, and which have largely benefitted from the move to online services during the pandemic.As the tech firms become a bigger part of people's lives, they have been facing a firestorm over disinformation, privacy, liability and antitrust as the Biden administration assembles its team and regulatory officials. But prospects for any immediate moves in Washington were unclear.A statement from the Energy and Commerce Committee said the big platforms "maximize their reach -- and advertising dollars -- by using algorithms or other technologies to promote content... (and) often elevate or amplify disinformation and extremist content."Some activist groups blame the platforms for the January 6 Capitol attack, claiming they failed to weed out content which led to the violence.Top law enforcement officials from 12 states meanwhile Wednesday called on Facebook and Twitter to take stronger measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 vaccine disinformation by vaccine opponents."The science is clear -- this vaccine saves lives," said New York state Attorney General Letitia James."Facebook and Twitter must take immediate action to protect New Yorkers and limit any further loss of life as a result of the spread of inaccurate information."The platforms were also expected to face criticism from Republicans for banning president Donald Trump for his comments seen as inciting the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 by his supporters, who have accused social media of political bias.Even as the tech firms face fury over disinformation, the Washington Post reported Thursday that at least seven Republican lawmakers on the committee tweeted or retweeted posted using the "Stop the Steal" phrase which was believed to be the catalyst for the January 6 violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-tech-ceos-face-off-over-disinformation-101616689553960.html

25-03-2021||World||Biden to set new Covid vaccine targets in first White House press conference||President Joe Biden is expected on Thursday to lay out a new goal for US vaccinations against Covid-19 at his first formal White House news conference, where topics will likely include immigration, infrastructure, gun control and foreign relations.Biden, who has taken questions from reporters in other settings since taking office on Jan. 20, may face sharp queries on a recent rise in asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border, plans to share coronavirus vaccines with other countries, and efforts to keep Americans safe from mass shootings.Aides have been drafting potential questions and answers for the Democratic president in recent days to prepare for the event, slated to begin at 1:15 p.m. (1715 GMT).Biden said last week that his goal of having 100 million vaccine shots administered was being met early and promised to announce a new goal this week.The administration may be able to double it, he said then.The White House says 130 million shots have been administered as of Wednesday. Some 85 million people have received one shot, while some 45 million people have been fully vaccinated.Just a few dozen journalists from news outlets selected by the White House Correspondents' Association will be on hand in the East Room, because of restrictions related to the pandemic.Biden's news conference is likely to offer a sharp contrast to the marathon sparring sessions his predecessor, Donald Trump, held with reporters, where the Republican president's insults and off-the-cuff remarks regularly made news. Ratings for the major cable television networks have dipped since Trump left the White House.At 78, Biden is the oldest person to take office as U.S. president, and his political opponents will be looking for signs he has become less sharp with age.Biden's popularity has remained high in his first two months in office, after a $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed Congress and millions were inoculated against the coronavirus with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.A March 17-18 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 59% of adults in the United States approving of Biden's overall job performance and 35% disapproving.The president will face questions about his plans to advance gun control after two deadly mass shootings in less than a week. On Tuesday, Biden called for a ban on assault weapons and urged lawmakers to pass tighter gun control measures, but Republican support for such action is low.Biden's next big legislative package could also come up. He is expected to unveil a roughly $3 trillion bill to boost U.S. infrastructure during a trip to Pittsburgh next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-set-new-covid-vaccine-targets-in-first-white-house-press-conference-101616689225779.html
25-03-2021||World||India will honour deal to supply Covishield vaccines: Canadian PM||Supply of Covishield vaccines from India to Canada will be completed but the entire shipment may be delayed as India deals with developments outside its control.Reuters had earlier reported that the Indian government had placed a “temporary hold on all major exports” of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by the Institute of India (SII) under the brand name Covishield “to meet domestic demand as infections rise”.Another reason for a delay may be beyond India’s control, as a background media note circulated by India’s high commission to Ottawa noted: “The production of vaccines is dependent on several factors including the supply of raw materials. Some major suppliers in the West have banned the export of vaccines and also of raw materials.”A deal between the SII and Canadian firm Verity Pharmaceuticals, announced following a call from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in February, calls for 2 million doses to be shipped to Canada. Of these, 500,000 arrived in Toronto on March 3. However, there is some doubt over when the remainder will be shipped.Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Trudeau made it clear he was paying attention to reports that the Covishield supply could be affected. However, he appeared to be confident the deal will be honoured. “At this point, we have no indications that the 2 million doses we will be receiving from the Serum Institute over the coming two months will in any way be affected and we will continue to ensure that that be the case.”The media note circulated by India’s high commission did not identify the Western countries or elaborate on the raw materials impacted but there are production “challenges” expected in April.However, India plans on honouring its external obligations including those to Canada, to which it is expected to complete the final shipment by mid-May. However, the shipments were originally expected to be “front-loaded” but that may not be the case any longer.The media note stated that the “schedule of delivery remains under discussion between the companies”. It also said the Indian government was “working hard” with manufacturers to “expand the production capacity as soon as possible to meet both domestic and external demands”.It added that India has, thus far, supplied over 60 million doses to more than 75 nations, including under the COVAX facility, the global arrangement to ensure equitable access to coronavirus pandemic vaccines throughout the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-honour-deal-to-supply-covishield-vaccines-canadian-pm-101616686344073.html
25-03-2021||World||UK set to extend emergency coronavirus powers by 6 months||British lawmakers were voting Thursday on whether to prolong coronavirus emergency measures that have given the government unprecedented powers to restrict U.K. citizens’ everyday lives.The government is asking Parliament to extend the powers until September, and to approve a road map for gradually easing Britain's strict coronavirus lockdown over the next three months.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s large Conservative majority in Parliament all but guarantees success, but Johnson faces rebellion from some of his own lawmakers, who say the economic, democratic and human costs of the restrictions outweighs the benefits.The Coronavirus Act, passed a year ago as Britain went into lockdown, brought in a wide range of temporary health, economic and social powers to deal with the pandemic. It gives authorities powers to bar protests, shut down businesses, restrict travel and detain people suspected of having the virus.Heath Secretary Matt Hancock said Parliament had had to take “extraordinary measures in response to this extraordinary threat.”But Conservative lawmaker Mark Harper, a leading lockdown skeptic, said he had not “heard a single good answer” as to why the British government needed to extend the “draconian” powers for another six months.Britain has recorded more than 126,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But the U.K.'s fast-moving vaccination program has so far given at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to more than half of its adult population.Virus infections and deaths have fallen sharply in the last month even as they are rising in much of Europe.The British government is gradually lifting a national lockdown and children returned to school on March 8. Shops, hairdressers and outdoor dining are due to reopen on April 12, followed by indoor venues on May 17. Remaining restrictions are set to end June 21, if the country is not facing a large new virus surge.Hancock said infections were likely to rise as society opened up, but thanks to vaccines that would not automatically mean more virus-related deaths. But he said it was still right to proceed with caution.“We must restore the freedoms that we all cherish, but in a way that doesn’t put the (National Health Service) at risk,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-set-to-extend-emergency-coronavirus-powers-by-6-months-101616685510729.html
25-03-2021||World||Pak PM flouts Covid guidelines, holds in-person meet days after testing positive||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan -- who tested positive for C-19 last week -- on Thursday flouted coronavirus protocols and held in-person meeting.Shibli Faraz, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, has posted the image of the Pakistani Prime Minister on Twitter with the caption 'Prime minister with the media team today at Bani gala'.The image showed seven people sitting in a room with Imran Khan. Though Khan and the people in the meeting were wearing masks and maintained physical distancing, the image from the federal minister did not go down well with people on social media.Some were quick to point out that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson had held virtual meetings after he had tested positive for coronavirus. One user wrote: "Bro that's how intelligent and sensible governments work when their premiere is sick. Protecting themselves and others."Another user wrote that it was a "boomer problem" that Khan was "sticking to 'in person' meetings when a more efficient and safe way is available."Netizens even urged the people to not "try this at home" as the cases are rising at a high rate in Pakistan."Poor optics and bad example from our PM @ImranKhanPTI. This meeting, if so important, could've been done over a video link. This pic is a violation of #SOPs and #coronavirus isolation guidelines. Once again poor advice and an incompetent team of advisors," Raza Haroon, a political worker wrote on Twitter.According to data issued by National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 38,858 tests were conducted in the country during the last 24 hours out of which 3,946 returned positive, taking the positivity ratio to 10.15 per cent, Geo News reported.Khan's special assistant on national health services Faisal Sultan had said on Saturday that the Prime Minister has tested positive for coronavirus."PM Imran Khan has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating at home," Sultan said in a tweet.Khan, 67, was vaccinated on Thursday with the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm as part of the nationwide anti-coronavirus vaccination campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-flouts-covid-guidelines-holds-in-person-meet-days-after-testing-positive-101616684136721.html
25-03-2021||World||Situation easing in eastern Ladakh, says Chinese military||The situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh has eased “distinctly” after the withdrawal of border troops from Pangong Lake, the Chinese military said on Thursday. It, however, gave no indication about the complete disengagement of frontline soldiers from all friction points in the area.India has repeatedly said that the complete withdrawal of Chinese troops from all points of conflict is necessary to maintain peace and tranquility along the disputed border.New Delhi and Beijing are cautiously attempting to emerge from the worst border conflict in decades, which saw soldiers dying on both sides.Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have been held since last year but disagreements exist; disengagement is yet to take place in the remaining areas including at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra areas.“Thanks to the joint efforts made by China and India, the situation in the border area has been eased distinctly”, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said on Thursday.Ren added that at present China and India have disengaged front-line troops in the Pangong Lake area.Both sides have agreed to maintain communication through military and diplomatic channels to promote the settlement of other issues in the west section of the China-India boundary, Ren was quoted as saying by the Chinese military-run China Military Online.China hopes the two sides could value the hard-won results, maintain dialogue and communication and stabilise the situation against relapse and gradually reach a resolution, which can be accepted by the two countries to jointly maintain peace in the border area, he said.Asked to comment on the Quad, Ren said China is firmly opposed to the Quad alliance consisting of the US, India, Australia and Japan.Ren said China firmly opposed the four-side mechanism promoted by the US as it adheres to the “Cold War mentality”.He was responding to a question on the recent Quad summit and reported remarks by US national security advisor Jake Sullivan stating that the four leaders discussed the “challenges” posed by China.The virtual summit was attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide SugaThe Quad mechanism believes in group confrontation, is keen on geopolitical games, and uses the so-called “China challenge” as an excuse to “form cliques” and openly provoke relations between regional countries.“We are firmly opposed to this,” Ren said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-easing-in-eastern-ladakh-says-chinese-military-101616683223902.html
25-03-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 684,000, fewest since pandemic||The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell sharply last week to 684,000, the fewest since the pandemic erupted a year ago and a sign that the economy is improving.Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell from 781,000 the week before. It is the first time that weekly applications for jobless aid have fallen below 700,000 since mid-March of last year. Before the pandemic tore through the economy, applications had never topped that level.Still, a total of 18.9 million people are continuing to collect jobless benefits, up from 18.2 million in the previous week. Roughly one-third of those recipients are in extended federal aid programs, which means they've been unemployed for at least six months.Their prolonged joblessness could prove to be a long-term hindrance: Typically, many people who have been unemployed for extended periods struggle to find work even as the economy regains its health.The economy has been showing signs of emerging from the pandemic crisis with renewed vigor, with spending picking up, manufacturing strengthening and employers adding workers. Hiring increased in February, with 379,000 added jobs — more than double January's total. The economy expanded at a 4.3% annual rate in the final three months of last year, the government estimated Thursday, slightly faster than its previous estimate. That pace is widely expected to accelerate in the coming months, fueled by substantial government rescue aid.Credit card data from JPMorgan Chase showed that consumer spending jumped last week as the $1,400 checks that are going to most adults under President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion emergency aid package began to be paid out. The Treasury says it has so far distributed 127 million payments worth $325 billion.Last week, Federal Reserve policymakers substantially boosted their forecast for the economy this year, anticipating growth of 6.5% for 2021, up from an estimate of just 4.2% three months ago. That would be the fastest rate of expansion in any year since 1984. The Fed also projects that the unemployment rate will reach 4.5% by the end of this year, down from the current 6.2%.Last week, some individual states reported sharp drops in applications for aid. In Illinois, they tumbled 80% to just under 15,000. In Ohio, they fell by nearly a third to 69,000.Nationally, though, the number of recipients in an extended federal jobless benefits program jumped by 730,000 to 5.5 million, with nearly all the increase occurring in California.Historically, the weekly unemployment claims figure has been considered an accurate reflection of the pace of layoffs. But that connection has weakened during the pandemic. Widespread fraud and the processing of backlogged claims have distorted many states’ jobless aid data. That has been particularly true for the federal program that covers self-employed and gig workers; this data has fluctuated wildly in many states.And a report from the California Policy Lab last week illustrated another complicating factor: Many people have applied multiple times during the pandemic, having been initially laid off or furloughed, then been called back to work, then been laid off again. Each layoff has triggered a new application for unemployment benefits.The Policy Lab’s report found that 75% of jobless claims in California in the final week of February were from people who had previously been laid off and applied for benefits.Across the country, economic activity slowed in February as severe winter weather caused sharp drops in home sales, retail spending and orders for heavy factory goods. Most economists, though, say they think the economy is now rebounding as the weather improves and additional support from the new $1.9 trillion federal rescue package kicks in.Some analysts are increasingly optimistic that hiring will accelerate quickly this year. Two senior fellows at the Brookings Institution have forecast that employers will add a substantial 700,000 to 1 million jobs per month, on average, over the next 10 months. At the higher end of that estimate, the economy by year’s end would have regained all the 9.5 million jobs that remain lost to the pandemic.There are still risks that could frustrate such hopes. The number of new daily coronavirus infections has leveled off, though hospitalizations and deaths continue to fall. And as many states have dropped or relaxed pandemic-related restrictions on gatherings and business activity, another wave of infections could weigh on the economy.Though growth may accelerate this year, hiring often lags behind economic growth as businesses wait to see if rising demand is sustainable. What’s more, roughly 4 million Americans stopped looking for work during the pandemic and aren’t counted in the unemployment rate. Most of them will need to be re-hired for the economic recovery to be fully complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-684-000-fewest-since-pandemic-101616679372400.html
25-03-2021||World||Family of autistic teen who died after choking on chicken nugget gets $2 million||The family of a 19-year-old student with autism will receive a $2 million settlement from a Florida school district a year and a half after he choked on a chicken nugget and died.The settlement approved by the Palm Beach County School Board on Wednesday, also sets up a mandatory training program — named in honor of Kedar Williams — for principals, teachers and other employees who work with special needs students, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.“His parents are pleased not only with the settlement, but they are most proud of the fact they fought for their son and fought for a training program designed to address the deficiencies that led to Kedar’s death,” said Sia Baker-Barnes, a lawyer who represents his mother, Megan Williams, and estate.Kedar Williams was rushed to a hospital Aug. 13, 2019, after choking on the chicken nugget at William T. Dwyer High in Palm Beach Gardens.Williams had a form of autism that made him mostly non-verbal, and he also had a condition that made him prone to aspiration, or choking, the family said.An aide was supposed to be assigned only to Williams, Baker-Barnes said. But video showed the aide was attending to another student when Williams choked.“Having your son wave goodbye to you in the morning, before school, and then never seeing him alive again is a mother’s worst nightmare. Our family has a gaping hole without Kedar in our lives,” his mother, Megan Williams, said in a statement.The boy's father, Jeffrey Williams, will share in the settlement. He is a teacher in Polk County.“He’s around children every day, so this is a reminder of the loss he feels,” Salesia Smith-Gorden, a lawyer Jeffrey Williams, told the newspaper.Normally, there’s a cap of $300,000 for negligence or liability cases, unless a claims bill is filed in the Legislature, allowing a larger payout. But the family filed a lawsuit in federal court, in addition to state court, citing a violation of federal protections for students with disabilities. That enabled them to collect a larger settlement without the Legislature.“While no amount of money will ever take away the pain caused by this tragedy, the School District of Palm Beach County hopes that the settlement reached with the Williams family will help to ease the burden of this tremendous loss,” district spokeswoman Claudia Shea said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-of-autistic-teen-who-died-after-choking-on-chicken-nugget-gets-2-million-101616677241305.html
25-03-2021||World||US Secretary of State Blinken says West needs to cooperate more than ever||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that cooperation between allies was more important than at any time in recent history and that relations with NATO and the European Union would be crucial to overcoming challenges.Speaking on the last day of his three-day visit to Brussels, Blinken continued what many European officials said was a charm offensive to win back the support of allies sidelined during four abrasive years under US President Joe Biden's predecessor Donald Trump."I came here very much with one particular focus in mind, and that was to make clear the United States' determination to revitalise our alliances and partnerships," Blinken said alongside Belgium's Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes.He later told U.S. diplomats in Brussels he wanted to mend and "modernise" relationships to focus on new challenges, which he has listed as China's rise, Covid-19, climate change, a newly assertive Russia and keeping a technological edge on rivals."There's a greater premium than any time since I've been involved in these issues, on finding ways to work together, again," said Blinken, a long-time Biden confidant involved in U.S. foreign policy for decades.Blinken won European Union support on Wednesday for a U.S. plan to confront Chinese power together through a formal dialogue that Beijing had hoped to avoid, praising EU officials who Trump actively sought to undermine."A basic tenet of the Biden-Harris administration is consulting with our friends, early and often," Blinken said.Biden will address EU leaders via video conference later on Thursday, the first such gesture since President Barack Obama did so in 2009.Issues remain, however, including Turkey's purchase of Russian missiles and discussions with Moscow to buy more, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under construction between Russia and Germany, which Blinken reiterated that Washington opposes."Some of our allies are moving in the wrong direction," he said on Wednesday, referring to backsliding on democracy in Hungary, Poland and Turkey, although he did not name countries.He stressed that alliances need to serve U.S. interests and that NATO allies must help pay for their own security, saying: "We can't sustain effective alliances without showing how they deliver for the American people."But China's decision on Monday to retaliate strongly against Western sanctions over human rights abuses has appeared to bring Europe and the United States closer together. European governments have summoned Chinese envoys to explain measures against EU nationals that were seen as going far beyond what Brussels imposed."We're convinced that it is (through) enduring relationships, like the one between our countries, and like the ones that exist through the European Union and through NATO ... that we can overcome any of these challenges," Blinken said.Citing the "devastating" Covid-19 pandemic, Blinken promised to work with the EU and NATO on global distribution of vaccines, and to ensure they are prepared for future pandemics.While insisting Europe does not have to choose between the United States and China, Blinken insisted throughout his trip that the West must show authoritarian states that democracy is a superior system and stand up for liberal values.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-blinken-says-west-needs-to-cooperate-more-than-ever-101616675386031.html
25-03-2021||World||UK’s 2020 emission drop sees it almost halfway to net zero||The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 9% in 2020 as coronavirus lockdowns saw a drop in road use and pollution from the business sector.The large annual drop puts the country at almost halfway to its legal goal of effectively eliminating the UK’s territorial emissions by 2050, according to provisional data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.The long term decline in UK emissions has been driven by the shift away from burning coal for power generation. As electricity demand fell and renewable energy made up a larger share of the power mix, carbon dioxide emissions from the sector fell by nearly 12% in 2020.UK CO2 pollution - which makes up the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emissions - fell by almost 11% in 2020, caused mainly by a significant drop in road use, as lockdowns ground the country to a halt.Half of the drop in CO2 output came from the 20% fall in transport emissions. Meanwhile residential sector emissions increased by 1.8% as people stayed at home as 85% of UK households burn gas for heating.The UK’s net-zero emissions target doesn’t include emissions from imported goods or emissions attached to shipping and aviation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-2020-emission-drop-sees-it-almost-halfway-to-net-zero-101616675116126.html
25-03-2021||World||Greek Independence Day events culminate in military parade||Fighter jets flew by the ancient Acropolis and tanks rumbled past parliament in central Athens on Thursday as Greece’s celebrations for the bicentenary of its war of independence culminated in a military parade attended by dignitaries from Britain, France and Russia but no members of the public.With Greece struggling to contain a renewed surge of coronavirus infections that are straining the health system, the crowds that normally line the route were banned from this year’s Independence Day parade, with the public able to watch only through live television coverage or online streaming.Greece invited dignitaries from Russia, France and Britain, the great powers that had provided vital assistance to the nation’s bid for independence from the Ottoman Empire, to attend the celebrations marking 200 years since the start of the Greek rebellion.Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and French Defense Minister Florence Parly were in Athens for the events, along with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades. French President Emanuel Macron had been due to attend, but pulled out a few days earlier as coronavirus infections spiked in France and he tightened restrictions domestically.Charles, Mishustin, Parly and Anastasiades laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier outside parliament before the start of the military parade, which included a mounted cavalry section and marching troops from the army, navy and air force, as well as the police, fire department and coast guard.Fighter planes and helicopters flew in formation above central Athens — they included a US Air Force plane, French Rafale jets and Britain's Royal Air Force Voyager aircraft in which Prince Charles flew to Greece, the Union Jack emblazoned on its tail.Unable to watch the parade in person, many Athenians came out onto balconies in the center of the city to watch the flyby, snapping pictures with cameras and mobile phones.The Greek independence revolt started in the Mani region of the southern Peloponnese peninsula in 1821 and continued for years without official foreign support, with the Greeks gradually becoming riven by dissent and infighting. In 1827, with the revolution almost squashed, the war fleets of Britain, Russia and France intervened to destroy a Turkish-Egyptian fleet in the Bay of Navarino, in the western Peloponnese.This crucial blow enabled the Greeks to fight on and eventually gain independence in 1830.Speaking during an official dinner Wednesday night, Prince Charles noted his ties to Greece, the land of his grandfather and of his father’s birth.“In feeling a profound connection to Greece — her landscapes, her history and her culture — I am hardly alone: there is something of her essence in us all,” he said. “As the wellspring of Western civilization, Greece’s spirit runs through our societies and our democracies. Without her, our laws, our art, our way of life, would never have flourished as they have.”Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis kicked off Thursday’s celebrations by attending the raising of the Greek flag on the Acropolis.“Two centuries ago, a handful of determined fighters within and outside Greece, raised the banner of independence. They set in motion a process the end of which not even they themselves could have dreamed of. With the help of their allies, they fought heroically and won their freedom,” Mitsotakis said in a speech.Throughout Greece’s history as an independent nation “we have lived through moments of triumph and of pain. Wise decisions, but also great mistakes,” he said. “But in all of humanity’s great tribulations our land was always on the right side of history.”Mitsotakis noted that this year’s Independence Day was “unique, but also different, as it finds us in the final battle with the pandemic. With great difficulties, but with victory now visible. Besides, our national vaccination campaign is named Freedom.”Despite being under lockdown-type measures since early November, Greece has seen spiraling coronavirus infections, with record numbers of patients intubated in intensive care units and dozens of daily deaths. Hospitals are strained to their limits, with many ICUs at capacity. As of Wednesday evening, the overall pandemic death toll had reached 7,649 and there were about 245,000 total confirmed infections in the country of around 11 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greek-independence-day-events-culminate-in-military-parade-101616674121811.html
25-03-2021||World||World War II codebreaker Alan Turing is the new face of Britain's £50 note||The rainbow flag is flying proudly Thursday above the Bank of England in the heart of London's financial district to commemorate World War II codebreaker Alan Turing, the new face of Britain's 50-pound note.The design of the banknote was unveiled before it is set to be formally issued to the public on June 23, Turing's birthday. The 50-pound note is the most valuable denomination in circulation but is little used during everyday transactions, especially during the coronavirus pandemic as digital exchanges increasingly replaced the use of cash.The new note, which is laden with high-level security features, completes the bank's rejig of its stable of paper currencies over the past few years. Turing's image joins that of Winston Churchill on the five-pound note, novelist Jane Austen on the 10-pound note and artist J. M. W. Turner on the 20-pound note. All the notes are made from polymer rather than paper, which means they should last longer and remain in better condition through their use.The new note incorporates two windows and a two-colour foil that designers say will make it very difficult to counterfeit. There is also a hologram image that changes between the words “Fifty” and “Pounds” when the note is tilted from side to side, as well as an embedded microchip to pay tribute to Turing's role in the birth of computers.Turing was selected as the new face of the 50-pound note in 2019 following a public nomination process, recognition of his pivotal role in breaking Nazi Germany's Enigma code during World War II. The code had been believed to be unbreakable as the cypher changed continuously. Historians say the cracking of the code may have helped shorten the war by at least two years, potentially saving millions of lives.The 250,000 or so votes supporting Turing's nomination also represented a recognition of the discrimination that he faced as a gay man after the war.“There’s something of the character of a nation in its money, and we are right to consider and celebrate the people on our banknotes," Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey said.“Turing is best known for his codebreaking work at Bletchley Park, which helped end the Second World War. However, in addition, he was a leading mathematician, developmental biologist, and pioneer in the field of computer science. He was also gay, and was treated appallingly as a result."During World War II Turing worked at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking centre, where he helped crack Enigma by creating the “Turing bombe,” a forerunner of modern computers. He also developed the “Turing Test” to measure artificial intelligence.After the war, he was prosecuted for homosexuality, which was then illegal, and forcibly treated with female hormones — a form of chemical castration. His conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). He died at age 41 in 1954 after eating an apple laced with cyanide.Turing received a posthumous apology from the British government in 2009, and a royal pardon in 2013. Four years later, the Turing law, which pardoned gay men with past convictions, was passed.Actor and author Stephen Fry said the choice of Turing to appear on the 50-pound note marks another step in the nation’s long overdue recognition of “this very great man,” whose “talents ranged far and wide.”In a YouTube video posted by the Bank of England, Fry laid out the levels of discrimination and “barbaric punishments” that gay men faced in the years after World War II.“Alan Turing was among the thousands of men who were harried and harangued by the authorities," he said.“Not just down to the hostile attitude to their sexuality alone, but also under the bigoted belief that there was a link between homosexuality and communism," Fry added.Over the past decade, Turing's life has become known to a much wider audience, especially in the wake of the 2014 film “The Imitation Game” that saw Benedict Cumberbatch play the role of Turing.Great-nephew James Turing, who runs the Turing Trust which refurbishes U.K. computers for use in African schools, said the Bank of England’s move was an "unbelievable honour” for his family.“It certainly highlights the enormity of Alan’s legacy, which hopefully we are doing something through the Turing Trust that he would be proud of in continuing to further enable access to a digital world," he told BBC radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-war-ii-codebreaker-alan-turing-is-the-new-face-of-britain-s-50-pound-note-101616673863597.html
25-03-2021||World||EU's top court rejects effort to force tougher climate rules||The European Union’s top court on Thursday rejected an effort by a Scandinavian youth group and eight families around the world to force the EU to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they were not “individually” affected by Europe’s climate policy.Families from Kenya, Fiji, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and Romania and the Swedish Sami Youth organization launched the legal action in 2018. They hoped to draw attention to the impact of climate policy on individuals and activists fighting for starving Arctic reindeer and other environmental issues.The European General Court acknowledged that the plaintiffs are generally affected by climate change but rejected the case in 2019 on procedural grounds. The families and youth group appealed to the European Court of Justice, or ECJ, the bloc’s top court.The ECJ upheld the lower court’s decision Thursday, saying the plaintiffs “are not individually concerned” by the EU’s climate legislation so the case won't be heard.After the legal effort was initially launched, the European Commission proposed a “European Green Deal” with more ambitious goals toward fighting climate change. European Union leaders reached a deal last year to cut the bloc’s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, more than the previous goal of 40%.Experts say ending the use of fossil fuels is one of the most important measures needed to limit global warming, believed to be causing heavier storms, fiercer droughts and other weather problems damaging lives and livelihoods around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eus-top-court-rejects-effort-to-force-tougher-climate-rules-101616673749913.html
25-03-2021||World||What North Korean missile tests mean for US relations||New U.S. president, same old North Korean playbook. Almost.Two months after President Joe Biden took office, North Korea is again turning to weapons tests to wrest outside concessions. But the tests so far have been relatively small compared to past launches. That indicates Washington has a window of engagement before North Korea pursues bigger provocations.This week, North Korea’s neighbors reported the country fired four short-range missiles into the sea in its first missile launches in about a year. The launches — two on Sunday, two on Thursday — came after the North said it had rebuffed dialogue offers by the Biden administration, citing what it called U.S. hostility.Here’s look at North Korea’s recent missile launches and their motives.WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S STRATEGY THIS TIME?North Korea has a long history of performing major weapons tests around the time new governments take power in the United States and South Korea.In February 2017, less than a month after Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency, North Korea tested a mid-range missile that observers said showed an advance in weapon mobility. Later in 2017, four days after current South Korean President Moon Jae-in was inaugurated, North Korea fired what it called a newly developed, nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.In 2009, North Korea conducted a long-range rocket launch and a nuclear test within the first four months of the first term of the Obama administration.This week’s weapons tests largely appear to follow that playbook, but experts believe the country held back from a more serious a provocation because the Biden administration is still evaluating its North Korea policy.The four missiles fired this week were all short-range and don’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. According to South Korea’s assessment, the first two weapons launched Sunday were believed to be cruise missiles. But Japan said the two fired Thursday were ballistic missiles, more provocative weapons that North Korea is banned from testing by U.N. Security Council resolutions.“The basic pattern isn’t much different. But while North Korea in the past focused on showing off its maximum capability when a new government came in the United States, I feel the North is trying to control the level of (its provocation),” said Du Hyeogn Cha, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies.WHAT DOES NORTH KOREA WANT?What it has always wanted: for “the United States to lift sanctions while letting it maintain its nuclear capability,” said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.Because the Biden administration is unlikely do that anytime soon, some experts say North Korea may stage bigger provocations, like a long-range missile test or a nuclear detonation.For now, it is ramping up its rhetoric along with the short-range missile launches.In January, about 10 days before Biden took office, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced he would enlarge his nuclear arsenal and beef up the country's fighting capability to cope with a hostile U.S. policy and military threats. He also pressed South Korea to suspend regular military drills with the United States if it wants better ties.When U.S. and South Korean militaries pressed ahead with their springtime drills this month, Kim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned the U.S. to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said Washington reached out to Pyongyang starting in mid-February, but Pyongyang hasn’t responded. Coupled with the overture, however, Blinken continued to slam North Korea’s human rights record and nuclear ambitions when he visited Seoul last week. North Korea’s First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said her country will keep ignoring such U.S. offers because of what she called American hostility.The recent launches seem to be an example of North Korea “putting Kim Yo Jong’s threats into action as she said the United States can’t sleep in peace if it doesn’t accept its demands,” said Moon Seong Mook.WHAT’S NEXT?Experts say it’s highly unlikely for the Biden administration to back down and make concessions in the face of North Korea’s short-range missile launches. Biden, who has called Kim “a thug,” also isn't likely to sit down for one-on-one talks with Kim unless he gets a pledge that North Korea will denuclearize — and officials confirm the country is sincere.Amid the standoff, North Korea could end up launching bigger weapons tests, especially if it isn’t satisfied with the Biden administration's North Korea policy review that is expected to be publicized soon, experts say.“Biden won’t likely do a Trump-style ‘reality show summit’ with Kim. Kim’s agony in the next four years will be subsequently deepened and his nuclear gambling cannot help continuing,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor at South Korea’s Korea University.North Korea could turn to long-range missile and even nuclear tests, which Kim Jong Un suspended when he began engaging diplomatically with Washington. While Kim Jong Un has claimed to have achieved the ability to attack the U.S. homeland with nuclear missiles, outside experts said the North hasn’t mastered everything it would need to do that.Such a major provocation would certainly prompt the United States and its allies to seek additional U.N. sanctions against North Korea.But tougher sanctions may be difficult because of China, the North's major diplomatic ally and economic lifeline, wields veto power on the U.N. Security Council. Given its current tensions with Washington, China may not easily agree to more sanctions even if North Korea engages in long-range or nuclear tests, analyst Cha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-north-korean-missile-tests-mean-for-us-relations-101616673512537.html
25-03-2021||World||Xi urges chinese province to deepen ties with democratic Taiwan||Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged Fujian to do more to develop ties with Taiwan, a sign of Beijing’s continuing efforts to bring the democratically ruled island under its sway.Xi told provincial officials to “be bold in exploring new paths for integrated cross-strait development,” the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday. He urged them to focus on offering policies that would benefit Taiwanese people and deepen mutual understanding, Xinhua said, without elaborating.Xi worked in Fujian from 1985 to 2002, rising from vice mayor of Xiamen to provincial governor, and recalled that period as he wrapped up a four-day “inspection tour.”“I worked in Fuzhou for six to seven years,” he said. “I came here at the age of 37 and spent the best years of my life here. I gained a lot of experience and understanding.”The Chinese leader also visited RICOM Group, an optical lens company in Fuzhou, according to Xinhua. The company says on the Chinese-language version of its website that it supplies the Shenzhou manned spacecraft program.China works to entice companies and individuals to work on the mainland, while at the same time isolating the current government of the island, which sits just 130 kilometers (80 miles) across a strait from Fujian. Beijing said earlier this month it would let agricultural firms sell bonds on the mainland and also enjoy preferential insurance and credit policies.Beijing at the same time exerts pressure on the government of President Tsai Ing-wen, whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence. China cut off ties with the island Tsai was elected 2016, and kept up that pressure after she won a second term.Chinese military jets make frequent incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, and the mainland sometimes flexes its economic might to the island of nearly 24 million people. Last month China blocked pineapple imports, saying it found pests in shipments.Xi said in 2019 that the mainland is “not committed to renouncing the use of force” to take control of the island, which has strong economic and security ties to the U.S.The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been ruled separately since Chiang Kai-shek moved his government to the island as he lost a civil war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-urges-chinese-province-to-deepen-ties-with-democratic-taiwan-101616671574526.html
25-03-2021||World||NASA's Mars helicopter mission next month may pave the way for interplanetary flight||NASA engineers plan to send a miniature helicopter whirring just above the surface of Mars next month in an interplanetary aviation experiment that, if successful, would mark the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft on another celestial body.The U.S. space agency is comparing the Martian debut of its 4-lb (1.8-kg) solar-powered whirlybird, dubbed Ingenuity, with the Wright Brothers' first sustained flight of a motor-driven aeroplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.Paying homage to that feat, a tiny swath of wing fabric from the original Wright Brothers plane has been fastened underneath the helicopter's solar panel and will go aloft with Ingenuity when it takes flight roughly 150 million miles from Earth.Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles, where Ingenuity was designed and built, are aiming to launch the twin-rotor, four-legged helicopter on its maiden test flight sometime around April 8.The helicopter was carried to the red planet last month strapped to the belly of NASA's Mars rover Perseverance, which landed Feb. 18 on the floor of a vast basin called Jezero Crater after a nearly seven-month journey through space.Perseverance, a robot lab on wheels, is designed primarily to seek out traces of fossilized microbial life from Mars' ancient past and to collect rock specimens for return to Earth through future missions to Mars.One of its first tasks is to transport Ingenuity to its test-flight zone, a flat area near Perseverance's landing site. There the helicopter will be unloaded by remote control and set on the surface before the rover drives carefully away.NASA has set aside 30 Martian days to unpack and prepare the helicopter for its historic, but modest, first spin. It will take off on a slow, vertical ascent to about 10 feet (3 meters), hovering for 30 seconds, rotating in the air and then descending to a gentle touchdown.JPL plans to film the entire exercise with cameras mounted on Perseverance, parked a short distance away, and will beam images back to Earth hours later. Ingenuity is also equipped with two cameras of its own used for navigation.The helicopter will undertake additional flights up to 16 feet (5 meters) high, assuming the initial foray unfolds as expected.'Wright Brothers' momentIf successful, NASA hopes Ingenuity - a technology demonstration separate from Perseverance's astrobiology mission - paves the way for aerial surveillance of Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus or Saturn's moon Titan.The immediate goal, however, is achieving "that Wright Brothers moment, getting powered, controlled flight, then adding mobility and adding other capabilities like any flight-test program," said Bobby Braun, JPL's planetary science director.While Mars possesses just a third of the gravity to overcome as Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, presenting a special challenge for aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (4-feet-long) and spin more rapidly than would ordinarily be needed for an aircraft of its size.The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers simulating Martian conditions at JPL, but it remains to be seen whether Ingenuity will fly on the red planet.The small, lightweight aircraft must also withstand punishing cold, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge its batteries and keep internal components sufficiently heated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-mars-copter-mission-next-month-may-pave-the-way-for-interplanetary-flight-101616669507527.html

Because their grief is not a sickness, it is a loss. And loss takes time."The leave provisions apply to mothers, their partners as well as parents planning to have a child through adoption or surrogacy, she said.One in four New Zealand women have had a miscarriage, Andersen said in her statement.India is the only other country with similar legislation, media said.New Zealand was the first country in the world to give voting rights to women and has been an pioneer on issues around woman's rights.The ruling centre-left Labour government is led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who is seen as a global champion for women. Her government last year passed a historic law to decriminalise abortion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-unanimously-passes-miscarriages-bereavement-leave-law-101616667678403.html
25-03-2021||World||White House to spend $10 billion to bolster vaccine effort||The White House announced Thursday that it is dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural enclaves throughout the country.The effort, which is funded through the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package passed earlier this month, will include $6 billion in funding for community health centers to expand Covid-19 vaccinations, testing and other preventive health care for populations at higher risk for the virus.President Joe Biden's administration, which will start distributing the money in April to nearly 1,400 centers across the country, said health centers can also use the funding to modify and improve infrastructure and add mobile units.In addition, the Biden administration said it is allotting $3 billion to bolster “vaccine confidence.” The money, which will be parceled out to 64 jurisdictions, can be used by rural, faith-based organizations and by food assistance and housing nonprofits in high-poverty communities to conduct door-to-door outreach and education efforts to urge eligible people to schedule vaccination appointments.Some of the funding will also be spent to help dialysis clinics provide Covid-19 vaccinations to people receiving dialysis and health care personnel in the clinics.About $300 million is earmarked for community health worker services to support Covid-19 prevention and control, and an additional $32 million is for training, technical assistance and evaluation, the White House said.The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 545,000 people in the United States, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-spend-10-billion-to-bolster-vaccine-effort-101616666469489.html
25-03-2021||World||Traffic suspended in Suez Canal as bid to refloat stranded ship hits new trouble||The owners of a giant container vessel blocking the Suez Canal said Thursday they were facing "extreme difficulty" refloating it, prompting Egypt to suspend navigation through one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was trying to refloat the Panama-flagged MV Ever Given, a 400-metre (1,300-foot) long vessel which veered off course and ran aground in a sandstorm on Tuesday.Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the 59-metre wide container ship wedged diagonally across the entire canal.Japanese ship-leasing firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha said it owned the giant vessel and was facing "extreme difficulty" trying to refloat it."In co-operation with local authorities and Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, a vessel management company, we are trying to refloat (the ship), but we are facing extreme difficulty," Shoei Kisen Kaisha said in a statement on its website."We sincerely apologise for causing a great deal of worry to ships in the Suez Canal and those planning to go through the canal."As shipping specialists warned it could take days or even weeks to budge the vessel, the Suez Canal Authority announced it was "temporarily suspending navigation".Maritime sources told AFP Thursday that a new dredger had been deployed to speed up the operation while northern convoy ships remain docked in the waiting areas of the canal.Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs Inc show the 59-metre wide container ship wedged diagonally across the entire canal."We've never seen anything like it before," said Ranjith Raja, Middle East oil and shipping researcher at international financial data firm Refinitiv."It is likely that the congestion... will take several days or weeks to sort out as it will have a knock-on effect on other convoys."- 'Days, maybe weeks' -The blockage has already hit world oil markets. Crude futures surged six percent on Wednesday as traders assessed the likely impact on deliveries.Broker Braemar warned that if tug boats are unable to move the giant vessel, some of its cargo might have to be removed by crane barge to refloat it."This can take days, maybe weeks," it said.The vessel's managers, Singapore-based Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), said its 25 crew were unhurt and the hull and cargo undamaged.A MarineTraffic map showed large clusters of vessels circling as they waited in both the Mediterranean to the north and the Red Sea to the south.Historic sections of the canal were reopened in a bid to ease the bottleneck, with dozens of ships waiting at both ends of the waterway.The waterway drastically shortens travel between Asia and Europe because it prevents vessels from having to navigate around southern Africa's Cape of Good Hope.The Singapore-to-Rotterdam route, for example, is 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles) and up to two weeks shorter than going around Africa.It is an "absolutely critical" route because "all traffic arriving from Asia goes through the Suez Canal," said Camille Egloff, a maritime transport specialist at Boston Consulting Group.Nearly 19,000 ships passed through the canal last year carrying more than one billion tonnes of cargo, according to the SCA.Egypt earned $5.61 billion in revenues from the canal in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/traffic-suspended-in-suez-canal-as-bid-to-refloat-stranded-ship-hits-new-trouble-101616665995748.html

25-03-2021||World||H&M, Nike in hot soup in China over forced Uighur labour comments||Retail giants such as H&M and Nike are facing a massive social media backlash in China for statements on the use of forced Uighur labour to pick cotton in the northwestern Xinjiang province.Xinjiang is currently in the middle of tit-for-tat sanctions between Beijing and the West for alleged human rights abuses. The European Union, the US, Britain and Canada on Monday imposed sanctions on Chinese officials accusing them of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.China retaliated with its own sanctions against few European lawmakers, institutions and academics.The massive online backlash was triggered by a social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Communist Party of China (CPC) group, on Wednesday after it published old statements made by the companies.In separate statements, the companies had said that they were “concerned” about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region.While H&M had made the statement last year, it was unclear when Nike had put out its statement. “We are concerned about reports of forced labour in, and connected to, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR),” Nike said.The Communist Youth League quoted the statements, seemingly as a part of Beijing’s retaliation against the sanctions levelled by western countries.“Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!” the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China’s ruling party, said in a post on the Weibo social media platform.Online response against the old posts was overwhelming with millions calling for the boycott of the companies. While many called for boycotts, celebrities cut ties, and e-commerce platforms have dropped the retailer, H&M.China, according to Reuters, is H&M’s fourth-biggest market with sales of 2.9 billion Swedish krona ($337 million) in the 12 months through November 2020. It has hundreds of outlets across China.More angry responses were targeted at the company after H&M China said in an announcement on Wednesday evening that the group had always upheld the principles of openness and transparency in the management of the global supply chain, ensuring that suppliers around the world comply with sustainability commitments such as the “OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct”, and that it does not represent any political position.“Chinese netizens don’t buy the H&M reply regarding Xinjiang cotton, and some said the reply implies that the firm is not doing wrong,” the China-based Global Times said in a report on Thursday.“As of 8am on Thursday, more than 115,000 comments were made after the company’s statement was made late on Wednesday, and one of the top comments is that ‘let me translate, the reply is that, I am not doing wrong’,” the GT report added.According to Reuters, topics around the Nike statement were among the highest trending on China’s Twitter-like social media Weibo on Thursday, and the social media storm had wider fallout. Popular Chinese actor Wang Yibo terminated his contract as a representative for Nike in response to social media criticism over its Xinjiang statement, his agency said on Weibo on Thursday.Xinjiang is the largest cotton growing region in China, ranking first nationally in total output, per unit production and planting area for 25 consecutive years, Chinese state media reported last year. In 2020, the total cotton planting area in Xinjiang reached 2.51 million hectares, nearly the same as in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hm-nike-in-hot-soup-in-china-over-forced-uighur-labour-comments-101616662403689.html

25-03-2021||World||North Korea missile launch tests Biden, alarms Japan ahead of Olympics||North Korea launched two suspected ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan on Thursday, underscoring steady progess in its weapons programme and ramping up pressure on the new U.S. administration as it reviews North Korea policy.The apparent tests were reported by authorities in the United States, South Korea, and Japan, and coincided with the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan.They would be the first ballistic missile tests by North Korea in nearly a year and the first reported since US President Joe Biden took office in January.Analysts said the latest missile tests did not mean denuclearisation diplomacy was dead, but they highlight an inconvenient truth for the US administration: Pyongyang's arsenal is advancing, posing new threats and increasing its potential bargaining power should talks resume."Every day that passes without a deal that tries to reduce the risks posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile arsenal is a day that it gets bigger and badder," said Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States.Thursday's launches came just days after North Korea fired several cruise missiles in an exercise that Biden said was not provocative but "business as usual".The Biden administration is in the final stages of its North Korea policy review, officials have said, and has been simultaneously signalling a hard line on human rights, denuclearisation and sanctions, while making diplomatic overtures that have been rebuffed by Pyongyang.It would be a mistake for Washington to ignore the advances in North Korea's short-range missiles, especially after leader Kim Jong Un declared in January that his military had the technology to miniaturise nuclear warheads and place them on tactical missiles, said Markus Garlauskas, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and former U.S. National Intelligence Officer for North Korea."Downplaying North Korean ballistic missile tests will not help U.S. diplomacy with North Korea in any way, and would only encourage North Korea to further test the bounds of what the new administration can accept," he said.The missile launches highlight the threat North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community, the United States military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.The command said it was monitoring the situation and consulting allies. There was no official comment from the White House or State Department on the test.North Korea typically confirms such missile tests - which it says are part of its sovereign right to self-defence - in state media the day after they happen.Japan's coastguard said the first missile was detected soon after 7 a.m. and flew about 420 km (260 miles), followed by a second 20 minutes later that flew about 430 km.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that two "short-range missiles" were fired into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan from North Korea's east coast.South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies were analysing the data of the launch for additional information, the JCS said in a statement.Narang said even short-range ballistic missile tests would be a "step up" from the weekend cruise-missile test and allow North Korea to improve its technology while sending a proportionate response to recent U.S.-South Korea military drills.REGIONAL REACTIONThe launches overshadowed the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan, beginning a four-month countdown to the summer Games in Tokyo."The first launch in just less than a year represents a threat to peace and stability in Japan and the region and violates U.N. resolutions," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in comments aired by public broadcaster NHK.Suga said he would ensure a safe and secure Olympics and discuss the launches with Biden during his visit to Washington next month.Japan lodged a formal protest through its embassy in China, while South Korea's National Security Council expressed deep concern.After a meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong in Seoul, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the need to establish peace and stability in Northeast Asia."This means all related countries need to abandon arms race and escalation of military activities of any form," he told a news conference.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula was the goal of all mankind."We call on the relevant sides to meet each other halfway and continue to maintain the deescalation situation to advance political settlement and work for lasting peace and security on the peninsula," she said.U.S. POLICY CHALLENGELeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Biden's North Korea policy review would come within the context of the administration's strategy on China, North Korea's only major ally."North Korea’s military activities after reaffirming ties with Beijing raise questions about how China is complicit in sanctions evasion and may be enabling the Kim regime's threats to the region. This will increase calls in the U.S. and elsewhere to sanction Chinese firms involved in illicit trade," he said.North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, ahead of an historic meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.In early 2018, North Korea announced a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and ICBMs, though it says it no longer feels bound by that after negotiations with the Trump administration faltered.Biden's diplomatic overtures to North Korea have similarly gone unanswered, and the North said it would not engage until the United States ceased hostile policies and military exercises with South Korea.Analysts have noted a change in wording from previous U.S. administrations, emphasising the "denuclearisation of North Korea" rather than the whole peninsula - a position likely to be anathema to Pyongyang.North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes throughout 2020 in violation of U.N. sanctions dating back to 2006, helping fund them with about $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to U.N. sanctions monitors.It has tested a number of new short-range missiles that can threaten South Korea and the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed there, most recently in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-tests-biden-alarms-japan-ahead-of-olympics-101616661689608.html
25-03-2021||World||1 report, 4 theories: Scientists mull clues on virus' origin||A team of international and Chinese scientists is poised to report on its joint search for the origins of the coronavirus that sparked a pandemic after it was first detected in China over a year ago — with four theories being considered, and one the clear frontrunner, according to experts.The lengthy report is being published after months of wrangling, notably between U.S. and Chinese governments, over how the outbreak emerged, while scientists try to keep their focus on a so-far fruitless search for the origin of a microbe that has killed over 2.7 million people and stifled economies worldwide.It wasn't immediately clear when the report will be released after its publication was delayed earlier this month. By many accounts, the report could offer few concrete answers, and may raise further questions.It will offer a first glance in writing from 10 international epidemiologists, data scientists, veterinary, lab and food safety experts who visited China and the city of Wuhan — where a market was seen as the initial epicenter — earlier this year to work with Chinese counterparts who pulled up the bulk of early data.Critics have raised questions about the objectivity of the team, insisting that China's government had a pivotal say over its composition.Defenders of the World Health Organization, which assembled the team, say it can't simply parachute in experts to tell a country what to do — let alone one as powerful as China.“I expect that this report will only be a first step into investigating the origins of the virus and that the WHO secretariat will probably say this," said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University's Global Health Policy and Governance Initiative at the O'Neill Institute. “And I expect some to criticize this as insufficient."The Wuhan trip is billed as Phase 1 in a vast undertaking to flesh out the origins of the virus.The WHO has bristled at depictions of the mission as an "investigation" — saying that smacks of an invasive forensic probe that wasn't called for under the resolution adopted unanimously by the agency's member states in May that paved the way for the collaboration. The WHO and China later ironed out the ground rules.Team member Vladimir Dedkov, an epidemiologist and deputy director of research at the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute in Russia, summarised the four main leads first laid out at a marathon news conference in China last month about the suspected origins of the first infection in humans. They were, in order of likelihood: from a bat through an intermediary animal; straight from a bat; via contaminated frozen food products; from a leak from a laboratory like the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Officials in China, as well as Chinese team leader Liang Wannian, have promoted the third theory — the cold-chain one — while the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump played up the fourth one, of the lab leak. But Dedkov said those two hypothesis were far down the list of likely sources.He suggested frozen products on which the virus was found were most likely contaminated by infected people. An infected person also likely brought and spread the virus at the Wuhan market associated with the outbreak, where some of the contaminated products were later found.“In general, all the conditions for the spread of infection were present at this market,” Dedkov said in an interview. “Therefore, most likely, there was a mass infection of people who were connected by location.”“At this point, there are no facts suggesting that there was a leak" from a lab, Dedkov said.“If suddenly scientific facts appear from somewhere, then accordingly, the priority of the version will change. But, at this particular moment, no.”Suspicions about political meddling have dogged the mission, and the international team leader — the WHO's Peter Ben Embarek — acknowledged in interviews last week that unspecified “pressures” might weigh on its members.Liang, in a Chinese newspaper interview, also bemoaned political pressure on the team.Delays in deploying the international team to China, repeated slippage in the timing of publication of the report, and rejiggering of the plans for it — an initial summary of findings was jettisoned as an idea — have only fanned speculation that the scientists have been steered by political authorities or others.“The last understanding we had was that it is expected to come out this week — we'll have to see if that actually happens,” the U.S. charge d'affaires in Geneva, Mark Cassayre, said on Wednesday. “We have a clear understanding that other studies will be required.”He said the U.S. was hopeful the report would be a “real step forward for the world understanding the origins of the virus, so that we can better prepare for future pandemics. That's really what this is about.”The WHO leadership, including Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, repeatedly praised the Chinese government's early response to the outbreak, though recordings of private meetings obtained by The Associated Press exposed how top WHO officials were frustrated at China's lack of cooperation.The international team was wholly reliant on data collected by Chinese scientists after the outbreak surfaced, and Dedkov called the visit to Wuhan an “analytical trip, mainly for the purpose of retrospective analysis in the sense that we studied only those facts that were obtained earlier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-report-4-theories-scientists-mull-clues-on-virus-origin-101616660807459.html
25-03-2021||World||Pakistan Interior ministry refuses to renew Nawaz Sharif's passport||Pakistan Interior Ministry on Wednesday decided not to renew the passport of former Prime Minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif who is currently residing in London.The interior ministry stated this in response to a query by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made on February 19 regarding the "request for issuance of new diplomatic passport by the former Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif", reported Dawn.Sharif's passport had expired in February of this year. Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had already announced in January that the PML-N supremo's passport would not be renewed as per instructions from Prime Minister Imran Khan.The letter by the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs turned down the request and stated that the renewal of Nawaz Sharif's passport would not be processed by the relevant authorities.The interior ministry stated that in order to return to Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif may apply for an Emergency Travel Document (ETD) from the Pakistan High Commission in the UK, and "the same may be issued once he produces prior bookings of travel to Pakistan through PIA (Pakistan International Airlines) only."The Ministry also said that Nawaz was declared a proclaimed offender by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a criminal appeal titled "Mian Nawaz Vs NAB", as well as Toshakhana Reference by an accountability court in Islamabad and declared absconder in reference in case of Mir Shakeelur Rehman by an accountability court in Lahore, reported Dawn."He being a fugitive of the law and absconder cannot seek any further relief unless he surrenders before the courts in Pakistan," the letter said.IHC had granted eight-week bail to Nawaz Sharif on October 29, 2019, and had allowed him to travel abroad for four weeks for medical treatment on November 16, 2019 order.As per the court directives, the duration could be extended based on medical reports. Meanwhile, Interior Ministry had asked for more information related to Nawaz's health, reported Dawn.Nawaz Sharif has been vocal about the misgovernance of PM Imran Khan and has held many virtual summits of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) criticising the incumbent government and had garnered the support of a large audience in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-interior-ministry-refuses-to-renew-nawaz-sharif-s-passport-101616654657131.html
25-03-2021||World||Biden eager to fix ‘broken’ immigration system: White House||President Joe Biden is keen that the US Congress should quickly fix America's "broken” immigration system, for which he has already sent in a legislation, the White House has said.In February, the Biden administration introduced an ambitious immigration bill in Congress which among other things proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards.The US Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers.“The president...believes that there should be faster processing, that our immigration system is broken at many levels and of the system and that he is eager for Congress to move forward with action there,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday at her daily news conference.She was responding to a question on the recent protest by Indian-American doctors who are seeking the elimination of the existing per country quota for Green Card, as a result of which the backlog for Indians now runs into several decades.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently.The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress House of Representatives and the Senate and signed into law by President Joe Biden, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally.The legislation would also benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian IT professionals and their families.Responding to another question on the inordinate delay in the issuance of employment authorisation card to H4 and L2 visa holders, a significant number of whom are Indian women, Psaki said that part of the reason the administration went to push for action on immigration on the Hill is to move forward with expediting the processing and doing that on several levels, including a number of the visas.“So, that's part of the reason why we think that’s such an important piece to move forward,” Psaki said.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.The Biden administration has taken several steps to address the problems related to legal immigrants.The citizenship bill sent by the White House to Congress includes providing new funding to the state and local governments, private organisations, educational institutions, community-based organisations, and not-for-profit organisations to expand programmes to promote integration and inclusion, increase English-language instruction, and provide assistance to individuals seeking to become citizens.This bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps.The bill makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced STEM degrees to stay in the US; improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards.The bill provides dependents of H-1B visa holders work authorisation, and children are prevented from “aging out” of the system.The bill sent by the White House also creates a pilot programme to stimulate regional economic development, gives the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the authority to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions, and incentivises higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.It also requires that the DHS and the Department of Labour establish a commission involving labour, employer, and civil rights organisations to make recommendations for improving the employment verification process.Workers who suffer serious labour violations and cooperate with worker protection agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief.The bill protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from deportation in order to allow labour agencies to interview these workers.It also protects migrant and seasonal workers, and increases penalties for employers who violate labour laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-eager-to-fix-broken-immigration-system-white-house-101616651012354.html
25-03-2021||World||Narendra Modi’s supporters in the US stem hostility in Chicago city council||The Chicago city council on Wednesday rejected a resolution to condemn the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the revocation of Kashmir’s special constitutional status, handing Indian-descent supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a first victory in a battle that had seemed largely skewed against him thus far.The Chicago council members turned down the resolution 26-18 with six abstentions.A similar resolution had been passed earlier by at least six city councils starting with Seattle in February 2020. Despite pushback from Indian-descent supporters of PM Modi, that legislation, or variations of it, passed in six other cities such as Cambridge in Massachusetts, St Paul in Minnesota, San Fransisco in California, Albany in New York, and Hamtramck in Michigan.“Dedication, talent, time, sweat and tears of sons and daughters of India won,” said Bharat Barai, an Indian-American physician who spearheaded the effort to defeat the resolution in the Chicago city council. Barai had also played a key role organising the 2-14 Madison Square Garden event for Modi on the latter’s first visit to the US after taking office.Unlike the pushback against other city council resolutions, the effort to defeat the Chicago legislative measure had the full backing of the Indian government. The Indian consulate general in Chicago reached out to several members of the city council, arguing, according to people familiar with these discussions, that India had a right to defend itself. Some council members, aldermen, had resisted the pitch from the Indian government, saying it amounted to interference in Chicago city’s affairs.On Wednesday evening, Modi supporters in the US hailed the vote as a major victory. “The efforts of the larger Indian-American community to defend their country of origin and expose the efforts of the opponents of India won the day,” said Darshan Soni, an activist.The resolution - titled “Recognition of India’s 72nd anniversary of Republic Day and call for condemnation of violence against certain castes and faith group” - was introduced in July 2020 in efforts launched by Modi detractors in several US cities.The proposed resolution that upset Indian-descent supporters of Modi included, “(Former) president (Donald) Trump’s bigoted policies within the US including discriminating on religious grounds, targeting vulnerable communities, stripping citizenship, fabricating crises and stoking hatred have been mirrored by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his… Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, and their alarming ideology that Hindus are racially and culturally superior to others.“Across the country, there has been a surge in the number of mobs lynching’s and violence towards minorities.”Also, the proposed resolution had sought to condemn the “the inherently discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which actively creates an unconstitutional, religion-based criteria to grant citizenship to select immigrants - the first instance of religion being used as a criterion for Indian citizenship; the CAA has already been used to threaten deportation for India’s 40,000 Rohingya refugees”.Chicago Tribune, a local news outlet, noted the contentious proceeding. “During an unusually long and intense council debate for a symbolic measure, some aldermen said they had received thousands of messages from both sides in recent months, most urging them to vote against it,” it said.Indian community leaders acknowledged swamping the offices of the aldermen with emails decrying the resolution as a part of their campaign, which they propose to scale up to the national level to replicate the success in Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/narendra-modi-s-supporters-in-the-us-stem-hostility-in-chicago-city-council-101616651541864.html
25-03-2021||World||US surpasses 30 million Covid-19 cases amid vaccinations||The United States on Wednesday surpassed 30 million cases of Covid-19 even as the country is making progress on the number of vaccinations.While daily new infections have decreased significantly from their peak in January, new cases remain high at around 55,000 cases per day, while 1,000 people are dying every day despite a decline in casualties due to vaccinations, reported The Hill.Meanwhile, hundreds of spring breakers have been flocking to the streets, beaches and restaurants in Miami Beach in Florida, prompting health officials to urge people not to let down their guard.Health officials have also warned against states lifting coronavirus restrictions until a wider share of the population is vaccinated."When I'm often asked, 'Are we turning the corner?' my response is really more like, 'We are at the corner. Whether or not we're going to be turning that corner still remains to be seen,'" said Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, on Wednesday during a White House briefing."You've got to continue to do what we're doing: more vaccinations and continue to do public health measures until we actually do turn the corner," he added.The country is now vaccinating people at the pace of around 2.5 million shots every day, reported The Hill. 70 per cent of people aged 65 and above have received at least one shot, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Data.Experts say people should still wear masks when in public and avoid crowds and travel."I continue to be worried about the latest data and the apparent stall we are seeing in the trajectory of the pandemic... CDC is watching these numbers very closely. As I said on Monday, the decisions we make now will determine what the pandemic looks like in the days and weeks ahead," said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday.The US continues to remain the worst affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, with 30,009,771 total infections and 545,237 deaths so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-30-million-covid-19-cases-amid-vaccinations-101616650510567.html

25-03-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup activists to hit streets in fresh protests after paralysing strike||Myanmar pro-democracy activists plan to resume street demonstrations on Thursday, a day after a nationwide silent strike saw businesses shut and people stay at home in protest against military rule in the Southeast Asian country.In a sign of further international pressure over a Feb. 1 coup, the United States is planning to impose sanctions on two conglomerates controlled by Myanmar's military, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Marking a switch in tactics by protesters, Wednesday's silent strike left normally bustling areas of commercial hubs like Yangon in the south and Monywa in central Myanmar deserted.While the scale of the street protests had been dropping in recent days, activists called for a big demonstration on Thursday."The strongest storm comes after the silence," protest leader Ei Thinzar Maung said in a social media post.Candle-lit vigils took place across Myanmar again overnight, photographs on social media showed, with some small early protests already starting on Thursday morning.In Thanlyin on the outskirts of Yangon protesters held up placards reading: "We don't accept military coup", while medical staff wearing white coats held a dawn march in the second city of Mandalay.At least 286 people have been killed as the security forces employ lethal force to quell unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Five more people were wounded overnight in Mandalay, Myanmar's second city, Myanmar Now media outlet reported.A 16-year-old man later died after being shot in the back, the outlet said.The funeral of a seven-year-old girl killed on Tuesday, the youngest known victim of the crackdown, took place on Wednesday in Mandalay.A spokesman for the military, which said on Tuesday 164 protesters had been killed, did not answer calls seeking comment.SINGAPORE FOREIGN MINISTER IN JAKARTAThe junta on Wednesday freed hundreds of people arrested in its crackdown on protests against the overthrow of the elected government of Aung Sang Suu Kyi.There was no word from authorities on how many prisoners were let out, but AAPP said 628 people were released after more than 2,900 had been arrested since the coup.The junta has faced international condemnation for staging the coup that halted Myanmar's slow transition to democracy and for its deadly suppression of dissent.It has tried to justify the takeover by saying a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was fraudulent - an accusation the electoral commission has rejected. Military leaders have promised a new election but have not set a date and have declared a state of emergency.The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Monday against individuals involved in the coup and the repression of the demonstrators.Meanwhile, a move by the U.S. Treasury to blacklist two conglomerates controlled by the military - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) - and freeze any assets they hold in the United States could come as early as Thursday, sources said.The military controls vast swathes of Myanmar’s economy through the holding firms and their subsidiaries.Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign to bring democratic civilian rule to Myanmar, has been in detention since the coup and faces charges that her lawyer says have been cooked up to discredit her.Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan is due to meet his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta on a trip starting on Thursday that is expected to include discussions on Myanmar.Malaysia and Indonesia are seeking an urgent meeting of Southeast Asia's ASEAN regional grouping, of which Myanmar is a member to discuss the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-activists-to-hit-streets-in-fresh-protests-after-paralysing-strike-101616649375542.html

Both Moscow and Seoul remain committed to an early resumption of the negotiation process between the parties involved in the interests of a lasting resolution of the entire range of issues in the region," Lavrov said after talks with his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong, Sputnik reported.Lavrov also mentioned that Northeast Asia, including the Korean parties, must abandon the arms race in the region."We emphasized the importance of efforts to maintain a peaceful and stable situation in Northeast Asia, including, of course, the Korean Peninsula, which implies the refusal of the parties to continue the arms race and to build up military activity in any form," said Lavrov, who is on a two-day visit to Seoul, reported Sputnik."I highly appreciate that we are steadily developing the multifaceted bilateral relations after the establishment of diplomatic contacts in 1990," Chung added.South Korean Foreign Minister also pointed out, despite the C-19 pandemic, South Korea remained an important economic partner of Russia, the second-biggest one in the Far East."In 2019, the [bilateral] trade reached $22.3 billion and the inter-human contacts became the most intensive in the history of the Korea-Russian relations. Although the pandemic urges us to change the usual format of cooperation, I believe that at such moments we must not reduce our contacts and continue the close cooperation to boost the inter-human contacts," Chung said.On Thursday, North Korea test-fired two ballistic missiles toward the Sea of Japan, sparking concern in South Korea and Japan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moscow-seoul-committed-to-resume-talks-on-korean-peninsula-issues-says-lavrov-101616649120096.html
25-03-2021||World||North Korea test-fires ballistic missiles in message to US||North Korea on Thursday test-fired its first ballistic missiles since President Joe Biden took office, as it expands its military capabilities and increases pressure on Washington while nuclear negotiations remain stalled.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the launches threaten “peace and safety in Japan and the region,” and that Tokyo will closely coordinate with Washington and Seoul on the North’s testing activities.South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong, after meeting his Russian counterpart in Seoul, expressed “deep concern” over the launches and urged the North to uphold its commitments for peace. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called for a swift resumption of dialogue to resolve the standoff with North Korea.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the two short-range missiles were fired at 7:06 a.m. and 7:25 a.m. from an area on the North’s eastern coast and flew 450 kilometers (279 miles) on an apogee of 60 kilometers (37 miles) before landing in the sea. It said South Korea’s military has stepped up monitoring in case of “further provocations” from the North.A senior US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military observations, matched the information from South Korea’s military, saying that initial assessments suggest the North fired two short-range ballistic missiles.“This activity highlights the threat that North Korea’s illicit weapons program poses to its neighbours and the international community,” said US Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson Capt. Mike Kafka.The launches came a day after US and South Korean officials said the North fired short-range weapons presumed to be cruise missiles into its western sea over the weekend.North Korea has a history of testing new US administrations with missile launches and other provocations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.Still, Thursday’s launches were a measured provocation compared to the nuclear and intercontinental missile tests in 2017 that inspired war fears before the North shifted toward diplomacy with the Trump administration in 2018.Analysts say that the North would gradually dial up its weapons displays to increase its bargaining power as it angles to get back into stalled talks aimed at leveraging nuclear weapons for badly needed economic benefits.It’s unclear how the Biden administration would respond before it completes its policy review on North Korea in the coming weeks.The negotiations over the North’s nuclear program faltered after the collapse of Kim Jong Un’s second summit with President Donald Trump in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of their nuclear capabilities.Since Trump’s first meeting with Kim in 2018, the North has not conducted nuclear or long-range missile tests, although analysts believe they have pressed ahead with their programs on both.The North has continued short- and medium range missile testing during its suspension of nuclear and long-range tests, expanding its ability to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including US bases there.Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from South Korea’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the flight data released by South Korea's military suggests the North possibly tested a new solid-fuel system modeled after Russia’s 9K720 Iskander mobile ballistic missiles.These missiles, which analysts see as potentially nuclear capable, are designed to be highly maneuverable and travel on lower trajectories compared to most other ballistic weapons.Kim said it was also possible that the North tested its new multiple rocket launchers or another solid-fuel ballistic system that outwardly resembles the US MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System.The North had conducted at least 16 launches of the new short-range weapons since they were first revealed in 2019.North Korea has so far ignored the Biden administration’s efforts to reach out, saying it won’t engage in meaningful talks unless Washington abandons its “hostile” policies.Kim Jong Un’s powerful sister last week berated the United States over its latest round of combined military exercises with South Korea that ended earlier this month, describing the drills as an invasion rehearsal and warned Washington to “refrain from causing a stink” if it wants to “sleep in peace” for the next four years.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the North’s short-range tests on Sunday were its first missile firings since April 2020. President Joe Biden played down those launches, telling reporters, “There’s no new wrinkle in what they did.”While Kim has vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program in recent speeches, he also tried to give the new US administration an opening by saying that the fate of their relations depends on Washington.During his visit to Seoul last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sternly criticised North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and human rights record and pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince the North to denuclearize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-test-fires-ballistic-missiles-in-message-to-us-101616648855832.html
25-03-2021||World||In a first for US, Senate confirms transgender doctor for key post||Voting mostly along party lines, the US Senate has confirmed former Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine to be the nation’s assistant secretary of health. She is the first openly transgender federal official to win Senate confirmation.The final vote Wednesday was 52-48. Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in supporting Levine.Levine had been serving as Pennsylvania’s top health official since 2017, and emerged as the public face of the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She is expected to oversee Health and Human Services offices and programs across the US.President Joe Biden cited Levine’s experience when he nominated her in January.Levine “will bring the steady leadership and essential expertise we need to get people through this pandemic — no matter their zip code, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability,” Biden said.Transgender-rights activists have hailed Levine’s appointment as a historic breakthrough. Few trans people have ever held high-level offices at the federal or state level.However, the confirmation vote came at a challenging moment for the transgender-rights movement as legislatures across the US. — primarily those under Republican control — are considering an unprecedented wave of bills targeting trans young people.One type of bill, introduced in at least 25 states, seeks to ban trans girls and young women from participating in female scholastic sports.One such measure already has been signed into law by Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, and similar measures have been sent to the governors in Tennessee, Arkansas and South Dakota.Another variety of bill, introduced in at least 17 states, seeks to outlaw or restrict certain types of medical care for transgender youths. None of these measures has yet won final approval.Issues related to transgender rights also are a major factor in Republican opposition to the proposed Equality Act, which would extend federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ people across the US. The measure has passed the Democratic-led House but likely needs some GOP votes to prevail in the Senate.Former Houston Mayor Annise Parker, president of the LGBTQ Victory Institute, alluded to those developments as she welcomed the Senate's vote on Levine.“At a time when hateful politicians are weaponizing trans lives for their own perceived political gain, Dr. Levine’s confirmation lends focus to the contributions trans people make to our nation,” said Parker, whose organization recruits and supports LGBTQ political candidates.Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who voted no, had confronted Levine about medical treatments for transgender young people — include hormone treatment and puberty blockers — during her confirmation hearing Feb. 25.“Do you believe that minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one’s sex?” Paul asked.Levine replied that transgender medicine “is a very complex and nuanced field with robust research and standards of care” and said she would welcome discussing the issues with him.In the past, Levine has asserted that hormone therapy and puberty-blocking drugs can be valuable medical tools in sparing some transgender youth from mental distress and possible suicide risk.The confirmation vote was assailed by the conservative Family Research Council, which contended that Levine, in addition to her stance on transgender medical care, had supported “a variety of pro-abortion and anti-religious freedom proposals” while serving as Pennsylvania's health secretary.“Levine may be the most extreme radical ever confirmed by the Senate," said Travis Weber, the council's vice president for policy and government affairs.A pediatrician and former Pennsylvania physician general, Levine was appointed as Pennsylvania’s health secretary by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf in 2017. She won confirmation by the Republican-majority Pennsylvania Senate.However, Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, voted against Levine’s confirmation Wednesday.“In Pennsylvania, the pandemic struck seniors in nursing homes disproportionately hard compared to other states,” Toomey said. “This was due in part to poor decisions and oversight by Dr. Levine and the Wolf administration.”He also said an extended lockdown advocated by Levine “was excessive, arbitrary in nature, and has led to a slower recovery.”A graduate of Harvard and of Tulane Medical School, Levine is president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. She’s written in the past on the opioid crisis, medical marijuana, adolescent medicine, eating disorders and LGBTQ medicine.Praise for her accomplishments and her handling of the pandemic have coincided with a steady stream of vitriol directed at at her on social media.As reported Tuesday by the Associated Press, Levine was among the targets of a private Facebook group called the Pittsburgh Area Police Breakroom whose participants included many current and retired police officers.Dozens of group members fueled days of transphobic posts about Levine for her role in statewide social-distancing mandates to stop the spread of Covid-19.“Someone needs to shoot this thing!!” one retired officer wrote.In January, a Pennsylvania legislator shared on Facebook an image mocking Levine’s appearance, then offered a general apology.State Rep. Jeff Pyle, a Republican, said on Facebook that he “had no idea” the post mocking Levine “would be … received as poorly as it was” but that “tens of thousands of heated emails assured me it was.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-for-us-senate-confirms-transgender-doctor-for-key-post-101616648920861.html
25-03-2021||World||Kamala Harris to tackle migrant crisis at Mexico border||US President Joe Biden has handed vice-president Kamala Harris her biggest challenge of their administration: the developing immigration crisis at the southern border.“I’ve asked her, the VP, today - because she’s the most qualified person to do it - to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help - are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,” Biden said at the White House.In response, Harris said, “Thank you, Mr President and for having the confidence in me. And there’s no question that this is a challenging situation.”There have been reports of a surge of undocumented migrants, even unaccompanied children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - the so-called Northern Triangle countries - arriving up at the Mexican border with the United States seeking entry.Unlike the Trump administration that had turned away these children, sparking international outrage, the Biden administration is allowing them entry.Biden pushed back against the growing narrative of an immigration crisis, saying “this new surge we’re dealing with now started with the last administration”. But, he added, his administration will deal with it.Harris will lead that effort - working with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to persuade them to keep their people from heading for the US border, traversing across Mexico - through diplomacy, backed with US aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-tackle-migrant-crisis-at-mexico-border-101616648721685.html
25-03-2021||World||North Korea missile launch tests Biden administration, Tokyo Olympics||North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the sea near Japan on Thursday, Japan's prime minister said, fuelling tension ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and ramping up pressure on the Biden administration as it finalises its North Korea policy.The missile launches highlight the threat North Korea's illicit weapons programme poses to its neighbours and the international community, the United States military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.The command said it was monitoring the situation and consulting allies.Japan lodged a formal protest through its embassy in China and said the test threatened peace and safety in the region, while South Korea's National Security Council expressed deep concern.Japan's coastguard said the first missile was detected soon after 7am and flew about 420 km (260 miles), followed by a second 20 minutes later that flew about 430 km (270 miles), indicating the missiles were short-range weapons.North Korea has previously test-fired missiles over Japan that were able to carry nuclear warheads and reach anywhere in the United States."The first launch in just less than a year represents a threat to peace and stability in Japan and the region and violates UN resolutions," Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in comments aired by public broadcaster NHK.The launches coincided with the start of the Olympic torch relay in Japan on Thursday, beginning a four-month countdown to the summer Games in Tokyo which were delayed from 2020 because of the coronavirus.Suga said he would ensure a safe and secure Olympics and "thoroughly discuss" North Korea issues, including the launches, with US President Joe Biden during his visit to Washington next month.South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier reported at least two "unidentified projectiles" were fired into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan from North Korea's east coast.South Korean and US intelligence agencies were analysing the data of the launch for additional information, the JCS said in a statement.South Korea's presidential Blue House will convene an emergency meeting of the national security council to discuss the launches.There was no official comment from the White House or State Department on the test.US POLICY CHALLENGENorth Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, ahead of an historic meeting between leader Kim Jong Un and former US President Donald Trump in 2018.The Biden administration is in the "final stages" of reviewing its North Korea policy, senior US officials told Reuters this week.Analysts have noted a change in wording from the previous administration, emphasising the "denuclearisation of North Korea", rather than the whole peninsula - a more unilateral position likely to be anathema to Pyongyang.Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the North Korea policy review would come within the context of the administration's strategy on China, North Korea's only major ally."North Korea’s military activities after reaffirming ties with Beijing raise questions about how China is complicit in sanctions evasion and may be enabling the Kim regime's threats to the region. This will increase calls in the US and elsewhere to sanction Chinese firms involved in illicit trade," he said.'STEP UP'Over the weekend North Korea fired two short-range cruise missiles, US and South Korean officials said, but Biden brushed off those tests as "business as usual" and officials in Washington said they were still open to dialogue with Pyongyang.Vipin Narang, a nuclear affairs expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, said short-range ballistic missile tests would be a "step up" from the weekend test, and allow North Korea to improve its technology and send a proportionate response to recent US-South Korea military drills.The test launches should not torpedo diplomatic efforts but were a reminder of the cost of the failure to secure a deal with Pyongyang, he said."Every day that passes without a deal that tries to reduce the risks posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile arsenal is a day that it gets bigger and badder," Narang said.Biden's diplomatic overtures to North Korea have gone unanswered, and the North said it would not engage until the United States dropped hostile policies, including carrying out military exercises with South Korea.North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programmes throughout 2020 in violation of UN sanctions dating back to 2006, helping fund them with about $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to independent UN sanctions monitors.In early 2018, North Korea announced a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and ICBMs, though it says it no longer feels bound by that after negotiations with the Trump administration faltered.It has tested a number of new short-range missiles that can threaten South Korea and the 28,500 US troops stationed there, most recently in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-missile-launch-tests-biden-administration-tokyo-olympics-101616647707642.html

The United States hit the same milestone on December 14, but it has a larger population.Wednesday's coronavirus figures from the Brazilian health ministry added another 2,009 deaths to the country's tally, which local media say is an undercount.On Tuesday, Brazil hit a single-day record of 3,251 Covid-19 deaths and authorities fear that April could be as grim as March in the country's overwhelmed hospitals.Brazil added 1,00,000 deaths to its tally in only 75 days, a spike health experts have blamed on a lack of political coordination, new variants that spread more easily and a disregard for health protocols in many parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-second-nation-to-top-3-00-000-covid-19-deaths-101616636817849.html

25-03-2021||World||Harris to lead efforts with Mexico, Central America, to stem migrant flow||President Joe Biden on Wednesday named Vice President Kamala Harris to lead US efforts with Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle countries to try to stem the flow of migration to the United States.Biden's decision gives a high-profile assignment to his vice president, a daughter of immigrants who has forged a reputation as an ally of immigration advocates. As California attorney general, Harris had to deal with a major influx of unaccompanied minors at the state's border with Mexico in 2014.It is a task that carries political risks for Harris, a potential future presidential candidate. Border woes have been an intractable problem for multiple presidents.Biden served in a similar role for then-President Barack Obama when he was vice president. By assigning her to handling diplomatic efforts with Central America, Biden is elevating the migration issue as a top priority.Just two months into office, Biden is struggling to get a handle on a burgeoning migration challenge along the U.S. border with Mexico - a problem the Democrat blamed on "the somewhat draconian" policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, who left office with his border wall incomplete.Biden said the United States was going to need help from Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and that Harris "agreed to lead our diplomatic efforts and work with those countries.""The best way to keep people from coming is to keep them from wanting to leave," Biden said, listing gang violence, drug-trafficking cartels, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes as factors spurring migration.Harris said the job "will not be easy, but it is important work, it is work that we demand as a people of our country."U.S. officials are battling to house and process an increasing number of unaccompanied children, many of whom have been stuck in jail-like border stations for days while they await placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.Senior administration officials said Harris' focus would be on regional solutions and working with leaders in the region to make it safer for people to remain in their home countries and make asylum requests there."We're going to look at the possibility for people in their home countries in the Northern Triangle to have a predictable, regular process of seeking asylum there so they don’t have to take this phenomenally dangerous journey or, worse yet, send their children unaccompanied," said one senior official who briefed reporters on the Harris move.Harris is expected to travel to the region at some point, but no trips are planned yet, another official said. Phone calls with leaders in the region are expected as well.Recycled planEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele criticized the U.S. focus on Northern Triangle countries in a tweet on Wednesday, apparently seeking to decouple his country from Honduras and Guatemala in U.S. policy.Bukele retweeted a chart with data indicating a significant decrease in the amount of unaccompanied children from El Salvador taken into custody by U.S. Customs and Border Protection since 2020, compared with previous years."If the United States wants to seriously address immigration at the southern border, they should really drop the 'Northern Triangle' concept," Bukele tweeted. "A recycled plan that did not work in 2014 will not work now."Since taking office in January, Harris has been carving out a role for herself as a promoter of Biden’s U.S. coronavirus relief bill, the first major legislation the president signed into law. She has also taken an active role in encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.While she has not had a specific policy portfolio until now, she has had calls with foreign leaders, including those of allies such as France and Israel. Sergio Gonzales, executive director of the Immigration Hub, a migration advocacy group, welcomed Harris' appointment, saying it "underscores the seriousness of the Biden-Harris White House to tackle every aspect of our broken immigration system."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-to-lead-efforts-with-mexico-central-america-to-stem-migrant-flow-101616631647263.html

25-03-2021||World||Five things to watch as Facebook, Google, Twitter CEOs testify in Congress||The CEOs of Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, and Twitter testify before Congress on Thursday for the first time since pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, an attack in which critics say social media played a crucial role.Here are five things to watch for in the testimony of Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc's Jack Dorsey before two subcommittees of the Energy and Commerce Committee:ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE CAPITOL VIOLENCEAfter the November presidential election, false narratives about voting fraud on social media and elsewhere helped to spur supporters of former President Donald Trump to storm the Capitol, the seat of US government, on Jan. 6. Lawmakers will likely ask about social media's role in inciting the violence.The non-profit Avaaz said in a new report this week that it had identified 267 Facebook pages and groups - including "Stop the Steal" groups - with some 32 million followers that spread content glorifying violence late last year. Facebook took issue with the report, it said.SHOULD SECTION 230 BE CHANGED?The tech platforms have long lobbied to protect Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability over user content, while some Republicans have advocated that it be scrapped and several bipartisan proposals have suggested revising it.Facebook's Zuckerberg suggested in written testimony released on Wednesday that it be changed to give platforms immunity from liability if they follow best practices for removing damaging material from their platforms.Google's Pichai and Twitter's Dorsey proposed approaches such as developing content policies that are transparent and giving users ways to appeal decisions.HAS TRUMP TWEETED FOR THE LAST TIME?Republican lawmakers were angered by the decisions to suspend Trump from Facebook and Twitter in the waning days of his administration, and what they see as a general stifling of conservative voices.Republicans may pressure the CEOs to reverse course. Or they may decide that the suspensions are no big deal since Trump has apparently decided to launch his own platform in coming months.A PANDEMIC OF MISINFORMATIONLawmakers have been aggravated by widespread misinformation online about Covid-19, including how serious and real the pandemic is, bogus treatments for the coronavirus and whether vaccines to inoculate people against it are safe.Facebook said recently that it removed more than 12 million pieces of content about Covid-19 and vaccines that global health experts flagged as misinformation.Still, the Center for Countering Digital Hate said in a report this week that all three platforms had failed to satisfactorily enforce their vaccine misinformation policies and attorneys general for 12 states said Facebook and Twitter needed to do more to combat the problem.WHAT ARE PLATFORMS DOING TO STOP MISINFORMATION?The platforms have invested in content moderation aimed at curbing misinformation and introduced a flurry of new rules in recent months.Zuckerberg in his testimony will talk about its third-party fact-checking network and how Facebook promotes authoritative information. He will also continue to emphasize that Facebook is not about political content for most users. Dorsey will talk about Twitter's misinformation policies and plans, such as its fact-checking experiment Birdwatch.Pichai in written testimony on Wednesday also listed actions taken by Google after Jan. 6, such as giving authoritative news sources a higher profile.Lawmakers may ask the platforms whether actions after the assault on Congress were too little, too late.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-things-to-watch-as-facebook-google-twitter-ceos-testify-in-congress-101616632445374.html
25-03-2021||World||A $60 billion US stimulus windfall is heading China’s way||David Ni is expecting a great year for his Chinese car-wheels business, thanks to the $1.9 trillion boost President Joe Biden just gave to the US economy.Americans flush with $1,400 stimulus checks mean “demand in the US is rampant,” said Ni, whose Jiangsu Siborui Import and Export Co., headquartered in Nanjing, buys high-end aluminum alloy car wheels from Chinese producers and sells them to retailers in the US.“Citizens get cash and they jump into shopping,” he said, predicting his sales will surge by more than 30% this year.The US fiscal boost will bring huge spillovers for the global economy, especially China, the world’s biggest exporter. About $360bn of the stimulus package will be spent on imports, according to Allianz SE, with Chinese exports likely to increase by $60 billion over 2021-2022 as Americans snap up computers, household equipment and clothing.But it also means rising prices for Chinese-made goods that have already started to tick up and a possible worsening in tensions with the U.S. over trade imbalances.While US neighbors Canada and Mexico will see the biggest impact relative to the size of their economies, the stimulus package could increase China’s gross domestic product by 0.5% over the next year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Bloomberg Economics estimates that a 1% boost to US demand adds about 0.08% to China’s GDP.That means the economy could expand 9% this year, according to UBS AG, which upgraded its forecast for China’s export growth in 2021 to 16%, compared with 3.6% last year. The export boost would give businesses room to spend on expanding capacity, allowing China to maintain its high levels of investment even as state spending on infrastructure slows, according to chief China economist Wang Tao. The government’s official GDP growth target for this year is “above 6%.”There’s already concerns in the US that the stimulus and expected economic rebound this year could lead to faster inflation there, with Treasury yields surging in recent weeks. An increase in imports from China combined with the recent rebound in Chinese factory prices mean American consumers could soon be paying more for their goods too.Ni said Chinese wheel producers are raising prices because of shipping costs near record highs and the recent rise in metal costs.“Southeast Asia manufacturing has not yet recovered -- the orders will fall on Chinese exporters,” he said. “Consumer prices in the U.S. are unavoidably rising.”Protectionist MovesThe trade boom could also mean more effort from the US to curb imports in the longer term in order to ease the trade imbalance with China, a source of tension in Washington for years.“Given America’s history, it is easy to envisage that protectionist sentiment, including on currencies, could be exacerbated,” Mark Sobel, a former career Treasury official, wrote in a commentary last week. “Even if the widening current account deficit is largely made in the U.S., history shows that won’t stop American finger pointing.”Stronger export growth will also slow Beijing’s efforts to rebalance the economy to make it more reliant on domestic consumption and less on industrial production. The government has been saying it wants to do this for several years, but little progress has been made and the process was actually set back last year when consumer spending collapsed.“I don’t feel that the relatively weak domestic consumption is bothering the policy makers that much. It’s similar to last year,” said Chen Long, an economist at Beijing-based consultancy Plenum. “I don’t think there’s discussion about re-balancing at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-60-billion-us-stimulus-windfall-is-heading-china-s-way-101616631611068.html
25-03-2021||World||In US, top court mulls police power to enter homes without warrant||The Supreme Court on Wednesday weighed when police can enter homes without a warrant, with the justices making up scenarios involving elderly neighbors, a cat in a tree, a mask-less social gathering and even a Van Gogh painting to help them resolve the case.While some of the examples were lighthearted, the case concerned a man whose wife was worried that he might kill himself. Police entered his Rhode Island home without a warrant and seized two handguns. The man said a ruling against him would give police a blank check to enter homes without a warrant if they were performing a “community caretaking” function.During the arguments, it seemed clear both liberal and conservative justices believe police should be able to enter a home in limited circumstances, though they worried about how to ensure police aren't given too much leeway. Using hypothetical scenarios is one way the justices test the boundaries of various legal theories, and they came up with many Wednesday.Chief Justice John Roberts asked whether police officers could enter the home of an elderly woman if they were told she was never late but missed a dinner date with neighbors and wasn't answering her phone.“The police are violating the Constitution because they walk in the back door to make sure she's not lying on the floor?” he said skeptically during 90 minutes of arguments the court heard by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic. Later, Roberts wanted to know whether officers could enter a fenced backyard to get a cat out of a tree if the cat's owners were away or whether they could go into a home to save a Van Gogh painting if water was dripping on the artwork.Other justices also tested the potential limits on police's authority. Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked whether, in a town with a high rate of coronavirus infections, police could enter a home if they saw through the window “a lot of people gathered together that are not wearing masks.”Justice Samuel Alito said what troubles people about a “caretaking exception” is that “doesn't seem to have any clear boundaries.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether officers in the case at hand could have taken “not just the gun but any bat, knife, anything else that in their judgment this man could have used" to kill himself.Prior court decisions allow police to enter a home without a warrant in emergencies. Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested allowing police warrantless entry into homes for community caretaking is most likely to be relevant in two scenarios: when an elderly person hasn't been heard from and where there are potential suicide concerns. He suggested he was worried about police officers “backing away from going into houses” in those scenarios.The case heard by the justices involved a Rhode Island couple, Edward and Kim Caniglia. In 2015, during an argument in their home in Cranston, Edward Caniglia put a gun on their home's dining room table and told his wife: "Why don’t you just shoot me and get me out of my misery?"The weapon turned out to be unloaded, and Kim Caniglia ultimately spent the night at a motel. But she called police the next day when her husband didn't answer her phone call. She told police she thought he might be suicidal.Police spoke with Edward Caniglia at his home and he told officers he was fine. But he agreed to go to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, his lawyers say, after being promised that his two handguns wouldn't be seized if he did. After an evaluation, he was discharged, but while he was away, police entered his home without a warrant and took his guns anyway. The weapons were only returned after he sued.The Biden administration is urging the court to side with the officers.The case is Caniglia v. Strom, 20-157.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-top-court-mulls-police-power-to-enter-homes-without-warrant-101616630793380.html

But since Johnson was elected in December 2019, the Union Jack has become increasingly visible — an ever-present backdrop to interviews by government ministers from their offices or homes.Its increased prominence is part of a government campaign to stress the unity of the United Kingdom at a time when support for Scottish independence is growing. The red, white and blue Union flag combines the emblems of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, which make up the United Kingdom along with Wales.Some Britons, especially those on the left, are uncomfortable with visible displays of patriotism, or with the flag's associations with the British Empire and Brexit.Under the new rules, any government building wishing to fly the European Union flag will need special permission. The government says that regulations “to allow the EU flag to be flown on public buildings without acquiring planning permission will also be removed following the U.K.’s departure from the European Union,” which became final at the end of 2020.The new fly-the-flag guidance won’t apply in Northern Ireland, where displaying British and Irish flags is highly sensitive and governed by complex rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flying-the-flag-uk-govt-tells-ministries-to-wave-union-jack-101616617009789.html
25-03-2021||World||Cooperation in culture, health, railways, on Modi’s agenda on Bangladesh visit||India and Bangladesh will sign several agreements and unveil new measures to boost people-to-people contacts during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit this week, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Wednesday.Modi is set to participate with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina in the neighbouring country’s National Day celebrations on Friday. This is Modi’s first foreign visit since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, and he will also deliver a speech at the event at the national parade ground in Dhaka.Though Bangladesh has invited four heads of state and government from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and the Maldives to join the celebrations marking 50 years of its independence, Modi will be the only leader to join the main celebrations on March 26.“As a reflection of the growing cooperation, both sides will sign a range of agreements during the prime minister’s visit. These agreements will cover a number of areas of our cooperation,” Shringla told a media briefing ahead of the visit.Some of the agreements will cover areas such as disaster management, trade and oceanography. The two sides will also be looking at a comprehensive trade-related agreement, and continuing discussions on a comprehensive economic partnership.“We will also have new announcements covering cooperation in areas of culture, preservation of the spirit of 1971, health, railways, education, border development, power cooperation and start-ups,” Shringla said.The visit will especially reflect the India-Bangladesh relationship based on strong political and people-to-people ties, which has “facilitated a partnership marked by conversations and discussions in candour, friendship and comfort”, he added.Modi will visit the mausoleum of “Bangabandhu” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, at Tungipara in Gopalganj district, thus becoming the first Indian dignitary to visit the site, Shringla said.The Indian premier is also set to visit two Hindu temples outside Dhaka – the Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Satkhira and the Matua temple in Orakandi – on March 27. These temples are revered by the Matua community, a large number of whom live in West Bengal.“This visit will be of very special significance and will serve to highlight our unique and special ties, which reinforce our comprehensive strategic partnership with Bangladesh,” Shringla said. Bangladesh is also at the “intersection” of India’s “Neighbourhood First” and “Act East” polices and the scene of India’s largest visa operation, he added.Besides the National Day celebrations, Modi is visiting at a time when Bangladesh is celebrating Mujib Borsho, the birth centenary of Rahman, and the golden jubilee of diplomatic ties.Modi will meet Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid and will hold restricted and delegation-level talks with Hasina. He will also interact with representatives of the country’s 14-party ruling alliance, opposition leaders, freedom fighters and youth leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cooperation-in-culture-health-railways-education-on-pm-modi-s-agenda-on-visit-to-bangladesh-101616615240668.html
25-03-2021||World||Two Indian entries in North America’s biggest documentary film festival||Two Indian entries focusing on women will be among those screened at the 2021 edition of North America’s biggest documentary film festival, Hot Docs. The 12-day festival will commence on April 29. Among the highlights will be a 93-minute feature Writing with Fire. The documentary profiles a newspaper in rural Uttar Pradesh, Khabar Lahariya, which is run entirely by a team of Dalit women. The documentary also highlights the transition of the newspaper from print to digital. Hot Docs programmer Myrocia Watamaniuk, said that the documentary Khabar Lahariya portrays how “these reporters know they are changing perceptions of what women dare to do while protecting democracy through journalism”. It’s directed and produced by Rintu Thomas and Sushmit Ghosh. The other Indian entry in the festival, Testimony of Ana, is a 24-minute short feature directed by Sachin Dheeraj Mudigonda. According to programmer Angie Driscoll, the story is about an “adivasi woman, accused of witchcraft by her neighbours in rural India, uses faith and perseverance to survive attacks”. The festival will begin with the screening of A.rtificial I.mmortality from Canadian director Ann Shin. Covering the philosophical and ethical questions relating to the evolution of technology, it “reveals how our memories can be digitised and uploaded into digital clones, preserving our personality and spirit without the limitations of a physical body”, according to a statement from Hot Docs. The 2020 edition of the festival was disrupted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada and was postponed to May and then held virtually. A year later, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to affect the world, the 2021 Hot Docs will be held completely online. Hot Docs received nearly 2,300 submissions of which 219 documentaries from 66 countries were selected for the festival. The films fall into 12 categories including Special Presentations, International Spectrum and World Showcase and half the directors are women. “Documentaries are vitally important in helping us understand the world we live in, and to build bridges of understanding across cultural, social and political divides, particularly at this unprecedented moment in time,” Hot Docs’ director of programming, Shane Smith said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-indian-entries-in-north-america-s-biggest-documentary-film-festival-101616607858066.html
25-03-2021||World||India, US to resume homeland security dialogue||India and the US on Tuesday announced they will re-establish the Homeland Security Dialogue focused on issues such as cybersecurity, emerging technology, and violent extremism.The announcement was made after a discussion between US secretary for homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas and Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.The two officials “agreed to re-establish the US-India Homeland Security Dialogue and to discuss important issues such as cybersecurity, emerging technology and addressing violent extremism”, the department of homeland security said in a readout of their discussion.The first round of the re-started dialogue is expected to take place later in the year, according to people familiar with the discussions.The two countries had welcomed efforts to “reinvigorate” the dialogue -- between the US Department of Homeland Security and the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs -- at the 2+2 dialogue of the foreign and defence ministers of the two countries held in New Delhi last October.An initiative of the Obama administration, the first India-US Homeland Security Dialogue was held in May 2011. The then secretary of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, travelled to India to take part in the dialogue with her then Indian counterpart home minister P Chidambaram. The second India-US Homeland Security Dialogue was held in Washington DC in 2013 between Napolitano and the then home minister Sushilkumar Shinde.Though working groups set up as part of the dialogue continued to engage on several areas of mutual concern and issues, the dialogue at the ministerial level were not scheduled after 2013. Meetings at the ministerial level were also not held during the administration of President Donald Trump, from 2017 to January 2021. The people cited above said it wasn’t for lack of interest.Mayorkas and Sandhu also discussed “the positive engagement “ that has already taken place between the two countries since President Joe Biden took office, including the first summit-level meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, that comprises the US, India, Japan and Australia.Increased cooperation among the four countries on emerging technology was one of the key outcomes of the Quad Summit, held virtually on March 12. The initiative is to be spearheaded by the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group, one of the three working groups announced by the four leaders (the two others are focused on Covid-19 vaccine distribution and climate crisis).Mayorkas and Sandhu also took stock of other areas of interest such as “the important contributions of students and entrepreneurs that have made both countries stronger”.Richard Rossow, the India chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said, “The Homeland Security Dialogue is quite important. The United States and India both have shared concerns about terrorism. And some of the terror groups are the same. Having open lines of communications and rapport between our leading officials can ensure better coordination, keeping citizens from both nations safer.“Some emerging areas of concern require regular consultations. For example, both nations are being regularly targeted with cyber-attacks. Sharing information on sources of these attacks, the tactics, and potential countermeasures will be very helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-us-to-resume-homeland-security-dialogue-101616561822119.html
25-03-2021||India||BJP announces Suresh Angadi’s widow as its candidate for Belagavi bypolls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday announced the names of the three candidates for the April 17 by-polls in three seats of Karnataka.The party, in a late evening release, said that Mangala Suresh Angadi, the widow of late Union minister Suresh Angadi was its choice for the Belagavi (Belgaum) Lok Sabha by-polls.Suresh Angadi was the Union minister of state for railways. He died due to Covid-19 related complications on September 23 last year.The party has named Sharanu Salagar as its choice from Basavakalyan in Bidar district.The BJP continued to show its gratitude to the 17 defectors as it named Pratapgouda Patil as its choice from Maski in Raichur district. Patil was one of the 17 legislators who engineered the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress government in 2019, defected to the BJP and helped Yediyurappa come to power as the chief minister of Karnataka for the fourth time.The Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) has announced that it will contest both Basavakalyan and Maski by-polls. The Congress on the other hand has announced candidates for all three constituencies that provide Yediyurappa with an opportunity to silence the growing calls for his removal from within his own party, analysts said.BJP won Belagavi in 2019 while the Congress had won both Basavakalyan and Maski seats in 2018.Yediyurappa has shown his gratitude to almost all those who helped him to power as they occupy nearly half of the cabinet berths in the state. However, one of those turncoats, Ramesh Jarkiholi has found himself in the thick of a raging sex-scandal in Karnataka that has further pushed Yediyurappa to a corner.Jarkiholi, one of the catalysts in the defection drama, had to resign from the cabinet after a social activist filed a complaint of sexual harassment on behalf of the alleged victim.The alleged sex-for-job scandal continues to haunt the BJP government in Karnataka as the opposition has sought a court-monitored probe into the case and also demanded that a case of rape be filed.Since the Jarkiholi incident, six other ministers who had defected to the BJP with Jarkiholi have also gone to court and secured an injunction that restricts at least 68 media houses, social media platforms and others from publishing, circulating or broadcasting any material considered defamatory to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-announces-suresh-angadi-s-widow-as-its-candidate-for-belagavi-bypolls-101616696906084.html

The moves will be implemented in Bengaluru as Bengaluru Urban is one of the top 10 districts of the country with the highest number of active Covid cases at present.The government developed 'Quarantine Watch' app last year to monitor people who are coming from outside. People who are advised home quarantine will have to register themselves on this app giving through mobile number and will have to upload their quarantining photos on the application so that the authorities can verify that such an individual is not flouting home isolation rules. The location of the individual will also be mapped through the application.Negative RT-PCR report must for all passengers arriving in BengaluruThe government is also bringing back the stamping of the hands of people advised to quarantine with indelible ink. This process will begin in a few days, Karnataka health and medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar said.Last year, Karnataka earned praise for its high-tech approach to Covid-19 as the state government readied a Covid war room and developed two apps — Corona Watch and Quarantine Watch to tighten its surveillance on people.As the number of cases went down, the watch became relaxed over time, but now with the resurgence of cases, the tech measures are on their way back, the government said.The government has also made RT-PCR test report mandatory for anyone visiting the state as 60 per cent of Bengaluru's cases have an interstate travel history.Karnataka's 5-point plan to stop the spread of the infection> Strict monitoring of quarantined people through Quarantine watch.> RT-PCR test report mandatory irrespective of the state from where an individual is travelling.> A penalty of ₹5,000 to 10,000 to be imposed on establishments found flouting social distancing norms.> Not more than 50 to 100 people can attend birthday parties, funerals. Open-area wedding can host 500 people while the number should be 200 for closed-space wedding parties.> The state is targeting to test one lakh samples for Covid-19 infection per day.On Thursday, the state recorded 2,523 fresh cases and 10 deaths. This was the third consecutive day that the state's daily dally breached the 2,000-mark. Out of these cases, 1623 infections have been reported from Bengaluru urban district alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-brings-back-quarantine-watch-app-hand-stamping-as-covid-cases-rise-101616691572892.html

25-03-2021||India||To meet domestic demand, vaccine exports to be done in phased manner||India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to other countries, though the rollout will be in a phased manner and delivery schedules are expected to be calibrated in sync with domestic requirements, people familiar with developments said on Thursday. Explaining the government’s decision to focus on the domestic vaccination programme and not to expand vaccine exports, the people said on condition of anonymity that the phased supplies to other countries will be made over the coming weeks and months. Noting that no other country had so far matched India in supplying more than 60.5 million doses of vaccines as grants, commercial supplies and supplies to the COVAX facility, the people also made it clear that the government has not imposed a ban on vaccine exports. As reported by Hindustan Times, the government has decided to focus on meeting the needs of the domestic immunisation programme following a sudden spike in the total number of Covid-19 cases in recent days, and the move to open up the vaccination drive to everyone above the age of 45 from April 1. “We had said that keeping in view domestic requirements, India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner. This position remains unchanged,” said one of the people cited above. “We have not imposed any ban on exports of vaccines unlike many other countries,” the person added. India remains committed to help other countries with vaccines, including through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. In view of the country’s current manufacturing capacity and the needs of the national vaccination programme, “there may be a need to calibrate the supply schedules from time to time”, the person said. All stakeholders will have to work together to adjust the schedules as needed. “Only by such cooperation, we can collectively deal with the pandemic,” the person said. India has so far provided vaccines to 77 countries around the world, including more than 8.5 million doses as grants, 34.1 million doses as commercial supplies and 17.8 million doses through the COVAX facility. However, vaccine exports have slowed down as domestic demands increased over the past week. The last country to receive made-in-India vaccines was South Sudan, which was provided 132,000 doses through the COVAX facility on March 22. India began vaccine exports just five days after rolling out its domestic vaccination programme on January 16. Supplies under the COVAX facility were made as soon as purchase orders were placed. Future vaccine exports are also linked to the ramping up of domestic production capacities and the grant of emergency use authorisations for more vaccines. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, plans to increase production of the AstraZeneca vaccine or Covishield to 100 million doses a month by April, up from the current level of 70 million doses. With more than 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of Coronavirus infections after the US and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-meet-domestic-demand-vaccine-exports-to-be-done-in-phased-manner-101616689944354.html
25-03-2021||India||‘Criticizing govt’s inaction doesn’t amount to hate speech’: Supreme Court||Frowning at the attempt of branding strong disapproval of government’s inaction by citizens as hate speech, the Supreme Court on Thursday said, “Disapprobation of governmental inaction cannot be branded as an attempt to promote hatred between different communities.”Examining a petition by Shillong Times Editor Patricia Mukhim, who sought to quash criminal cases lodged against her over a Facebook post, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said, “Free speech of the citizens of this country cannot be stifled by implicating them in criminal cases unless such speech has the tendency to affect public order.”The Court quashed the criminal case lodged against Mukhim in July last year by terming the complaint against her a “figment of imagination”. She faced proceedings under Sections 153A (promoting enmity or doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 500 (defamation) and inciting violence punishable under Section 505(c) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on a complaint by a village tribal body, locally known as Dorbar Shnong, which was offended by the journalist’s Facebook post of July 4.In her post, Mukhim had condemned an attack on some non-tribal boys and sought the intervention of the Meghalaya chief minister, also demanding the Dorbar Shnong to take remedial steps against such attacks against non-tribals which have been continuing since 1979.The bench said, “Where allegations made in the FIR or the complaint, even if they are taken on their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, the FIR is liable to be quashed.”Advocate Vrinda Grover, who appeared for Mukhim, had challenged the order of the Meghalaya High Court of November 10, 2020, refusing to stay the proceedings. She claimed that the petitioner had a fundamental right of free speech and liberty under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution.The bench said that the fervent plea made by the appellant in her post for the protection of non-tribals living in Meghalaya and for their equality cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be categorized as hate speech. “…if the victims voice their discontent, and speak out, especially if the state authorities turn a blind eye, or drag their feet, such voicing of discontent is really a cry for anguish, for justice denied – or delayed. This is exactly what appears to have happened in this case,” added the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criticizing-govt-s-inaction-doesn-t-amount-to-hate-speech-supreme-court-101616688444428.html

On Thursday, his custody has been extended to April 3.Appearing in the special NIA court, Vaze said he was made a scapegoat in the case. He said he investigated the case only for one and a half-day as it should have been investigated."I was investigating officer of the case for one and a half days and did whatever I could in that capacity. But there was a sudden change in some plan somewhere. I went to the NIA office on my own and was arrested," he said.The NIA has invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against Vaze in this case.The explosive-laden car which was found near Antilia belongs to Mansukh Hiran. But the car got stolen a week before the bomb threat incident. A week after the security breach incident, Mansukh Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane. Hiran's wife accused Vaze of being involved in her husband's mysterious death.NIA has found that a suite was booked for 100 days at a plush hotel in south Mumbai by paying ₹12 lakh and using a fake Aadhar card with a false name but Vaze's photo as ID proof.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probing-vaze-s-claim-that-he-planted-explosives-to-become-super-cop-reports-101616687482221.html

The commercial operation of passenger flights will begin from March 28,” the chief minister said, addressing a gathering after the inauguration of the airport. The first commercial flight of IndiGo from Bengaluru will land at Kurnool airport at 10 am on March 28. “Initially, flights would be operated to four destinations – Visakhapatnam, Chennai and Bengaluru,” he said. The airport, which is owned by the Andhra Pradesh Airports Development Corporation Ltd (APADC) got the aerodrome licence from the Director General of Civil Aviation on January 15 this year. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) gave the security clearance to the airport on January 27 for the commencement of scheduled aircraft operations after final security vetting.

A university spokesman said in a statement that the mess facility in the university would be closed with effect from Thursday afternoon and all the students have been asked to vacate their hostel rooms with immediate effect. The university authorities also issued a circular stating that all examinations for all courses scheduled from Thursday had been postponed indefinitely. “The university will soon release a revised timetable,” the circular said. The sudden closure of the university hostels and mess facilities left the students in the lurch. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students took out a protest demonstration at the NCC gate and women’s hostel, forcing the authorities to call for deployment of police personnel. As the students blocked the main thoroughfare on the OU campus till the midnight, the police arrested the student union leaders including All India Students Federation state organising secretary RN Shankar, executive member Uday Kumar and OU students’ federation leader Sumer, Progressive Democratic Students Union leaders G Shyam and others. The police shifted the arrested leaders to Nallakunta police station, before releasing them on Thursday morning. “The students lost most part of the academic year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. It has been not even three or four months since the hostels were open for students. Most of them are from rural areas, and have no access to online education. They are staying in hostels and are preparing for the University examinations as well as various competitive examinations. Where would they go suddenly, if they are asked to vacate the hostels?” AISF leader Shankar said. The students’ union leader pleaded with the authorities to allow them to remain in the hostels, even if the mess facilities are closed, but the authorities said they have to follow the government rules. The Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE), too, announced postponement of all semester exams of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses under different universities across the state. “We have postponed all degree and PG semester exams under all universities. A revised schedule will be announced soon by the universities concerned,” TSCHE Chairman Prof T Papi Reddy said. The University of Hyderabad announced that the decision to allow the return of terminal semester PG students and research scholars (except the 2020 batch) to the campus was being put on hold until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/osmania-students-protest-against-telangana-s-move-to-close-varsities-hostels-101616683524104.html
25-03-2021||India||‘Dissent is being criminalised’: Mehbooba Mufti after ED questioning||Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, soon after being questioned by the officials of Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case, today said that the country is not ruled according to the constitution and dissent has been criminalised.Without naming the BJP, Mufti said that the country is being run as per the agenda of a political party.The ED had first summoned Mufti to Delhi for investigation in the money laundering case. However, she refused to travel to the national capital due to Covid-19. On Thursday, she was questioned at the ED office Rajbagh for five hours, soon after she went there at 11 am.After coming out, the PDP chief said that she was questioned about the land and property of his father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed at Bijbhera in south Kashmir and other related details including how that was sold and how much money was received. “I was questioned about the funds as the chief minister and any money spent on youth engagement programs and how that was done,” she said.“This country is ruled either by the ED, the CBI or the NIA, either you are charged in sedition or money laundering and whosoever talks on issues EDI/CBI or NIA is used against him. This country is not running according to the constitution of India, it’s running according to the agenda of a particular party. Dissent has been criminalised in the country,” she said.The former chief minister said that she has nothing to hide. “My hands are clean and have nothing to hide. It took them two years to search things and now they are asking details about my father’s land or how much money was spent on the mausoleum of my father. They’re asking about the secret fund, how it was used and the widows who got the fund. Our party PDP will remain steadfast on its agenda for which the party was formed,” she stated.Mufti was summoned for questioning by the ED on March 15 in a money laundering case when a team of the federal agency reached the PDP chief’s Fairview residence with the summons.Soon after the ED officials’ visit to her house, Mufti had said in a tweet that such short-sighted scheming would not work.“GOI’s tactics to intimidate and browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable. They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions and policies. Such short-sighted scheming won’t work.”Earlier, she had said that she was ready to appear before the ED in Srinagar for any sort of investigations. However, due to Covid-19, she declined to travel to New Delhi.Since her release, Mufti has been vocal against the Centre, especially the BJP government, for the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A. She even said that her party’s fight is not for Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood but for the special status which was taken away by the Centre on August 5, 2019.She is the second former chief minister of J&K to appear before the ED after Srinagar MP and former CM Farooq Abdullah who appeared before the ED officials at Rajbagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-is-being-criminalised-mehbooba-mufti-after-ed-questioning-101616683043899.html

This effectively means that passengers may have to wait in the queue to enter metro stations.This comes a couple of days after the Delhi government identified the Metro to be one of the super-spreader zones including other places such as cinema halls, weekly markets and malls. The national capital has been witnessing a steady increase of Covid-19 with a positivity rate touching 1.54 per cent and 1,254 fresh cases on Wednesday.“Due to the strict reinforcement of the social distancing norms, the passengers are advised to plan their journey in advance and allow for additional time of 20-30 minutes for their commute. If possible, off-peak hour travel may also be opted by those who have the flexibility to avoid overcrowding/long wait during peak hours,” Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said on Thursday.The DMRC is also set to increase the number of flying squads checking for mask and physical distancing violations. Entry would be strictly regulated as per Covid-19 physical distancing protocols at the major metro stations including Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba Road, Central Secretariat, Patel Chowk, ITO, especially during morning and evening peak hours.“While waiting in the queue, the passengers will be strictly required to wait on the marked social distancing circles/stripes. If it is found that the distancing is not followed at stations, entry gates will be closed for passengers at those stations until the distancing is ensured,” DMRC said in a statement Thursday.Officials also said that they will be writing to district officials to maintain physical distancing outside the metro station as “there might be a spike in passengers waiting outside the stations while waiting for their turn to enter stations in line with social distancing norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-metro-to-tighten-measures-to-check-covid-19-spread-101616682623943.html
25-03-2021||India||Union minister Rajnath Singh says Mamata Banerjee took West Bengal back to 19th century||Accusing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of "taking back Bengal to the 19th century, with no development work undertaken in the past 10 years", Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday said the TMC dispensation, just like its predecessor, the Left Front, has wronged the people of the state.Singh, during his public meeting here in Purulia district, took a dig at the TMC's 'khela hobe' (game will be played) slogan, and said Bengal, now on, will witness only work and development.Alleging that the TMC supremo delivers speeches encouraging acts of violence and aggression, the union minister wondered if the chief minister "seeks to divide the country" by repeatedly terming people who have come from other states as outsiders.He also sought to know if people from Bengal are treated as outsiders elsewhere.Stressing that the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which later became the BJP, was established by Syama Prasad Mookerjee -- a son of Bengal -- Singh said, "Will any brother from this state be considered an outsider in Uttar Pradesh? All people born on the soil of India are brothers to each other."Claiming that the TMC dispensation has done nothing for the people of Bengal, Singh said, "How is it possible that those belonging to one party (BJP) are outsiders, while you, having ruined Bengal, are an insider? The CM, instead of undertaking development work, makes thoughtless remarks."Neither 'Maa nor mati or manush' (mother, motherland, and people) feel safe in the state."'Maa, Mati, manush' is another slogan that was coined by the TMC during 2009 general election.Singh further accused Banerjee of not fulfilling her promise of putting an end to water crisis in the state."Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on his part, has promised piped water availablility in every household of the country by the end of 2024," the defence minister stated.Maintaining that the BJP government at the Centre has never discriminated against the people of the state, as often alleged by the TMC, the senior saffron party leader said, "The Congress-led UPA government at the Centre had given ₹1.32 lakh crore to Bengal under the 13th Finance Commission, while the Modi government allotted ₹4.48 lakh crore to the state under the 14th Finance Commission."Insisting that more than 150 saffron camp workers have been killed in West Bengal, the senir BJP leader said that it is the responsibility of the state's chief minister to ensure the safety and security of its people, no matter which party they bore allegiance to."Bomb-making factories are openly being run in Bengal. If the same had happened in Uttar Pradesh (of which he was once the chief minister), the matter would have been dealt with sternly."The BJP, if allowed to form government in Bengal, will make security arrangements not just for saffron camp workers, but also those belonging to the Congress, Left and the TMC," he said, exuding confidence that his party will bag more than 200 seats in the state.Emphasising that the BJP is not a party that creates enmity between people, he said, the TMC supremo has been trying to divide the people of Bengal on religious lines."The BJP will not practice discrimination on the basis of religion. It would rather punish anyone creating trouble or indulging in such crimes. Now no one will be able to stop Durga Puja celebrations or Saraswati Puja in Bengal," he said.Controversy had erupted in 2017 at a school in Tehatta, Nadia district, over celebration of Saraswati puja, with one section of students apparently trying to stop another group from observing the festival.In that very year, the West Bengal government had tried imposing curbs on Durga idol immersion, as the occasion coincided with Muharram, but the high court later eased the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-rajnath-singh-says-mamata-banerjee-took-west-bengal-back-to-19th-century-101616680181804.html

25-03-2021||India||Despite agitation against privatisation move, Vizag steel plant achieves record production||While continuing their one-and-a-half months-long agitation to prevent the privatisation of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), also known as the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, the workers have also been striving to improve the productivity of the company and bring it back into profits.Between Tuesday and Wednesday, there was a record production of 20,400 tonnes of hot metal in the steel plant.“This is the highest production since the inception of the plant in the 80s. On March 6, the plant achieved a record production of 20,350 tonnes,” RP Sharma, spokesperson of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, said.All three blast furnaces, each having a production capacity of 7,150 tonnes, are running round the clock. “We have achieved nearly 98 per cent productivity in the company, thanks to the dedication of the workers despite their anxiety over the government’s decision,” Sharma said.Trade union leaders said the workers wanted to prove to the Centre that if given an opportunity, they could completely turn around the company’s financial position and bring it back into profits. According to the trade union leaders, the RINL has been making consistent profits for the last four months. In December 2020, the company made a net profit of ₹212 crore. In January this year, the net profit of the company was ₹134 crore. “After the announcement of privatisation by the Centre in February, too, the workers strived hard to achieve a net profit of ₹165 crore and as the financial year closes by March-end, the company is likely to get the profit of around ₹300 crore,” J Ayodhya Ramu, trade union leader and convenor of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Samithi (Visakha Steel Protection Committee) said.Though the trade unions have given the strike notice to the management on March 11, stating they would go on an indefinite strike any day after March 25, they have not taken any decision yet. “We have been working like disciplined soldiers. A strike is our last option,” All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) leader of the steel plant, A Adinarayana, said.The company spokesman said the RINL had, in fact, undergone a tough phase last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We had to shut down two of the three furnaces and only one furnace was in operation for six months. Subsequently, the workers were allowed in full shifts and the plant operations were back in full swing only in the last four or five months,” Sharma said.The steel plant, which had a turnover of ₹16,000 crore in 2019-20, is expected to achieve a turnover of nearly ₹17,000 crore in 2020-21, despite the crisis prevailing in the plant due to the pandemic. “This month alone, the company is targeting a record production of 7 lakh tonnes of hot metal and the turnover is likely to touch ₹3,200 crore,” the spokesman added.The main reason cited by the Centre for privatising the RINL was that it had been consistently making losses for four years out of the last five years. It reported a loss of ₹1,604 crore in 2015-16, ₹1,263 crore in 2016-17 and ₹1,369 crore in 2017-18. The company made a profit of ₹96.7 crore in 2018-19 but plunged into a huge loss of ₹3,319 crore in 2019-20.Besides, the RINL is also facing a huge debt burden of ₹22,000 crore, which is being serviced at 14 per cent.The trade union leaders, however, say the losses or the debt burden of the company were insignificant compared to the huge assets of the steel plant. “The problem is not with the steel plant or the workers. It is with the management. We have all the strength and resources to make it a profitable venture if the government gives us a helping hand,” Ramu said.He reiterated that the RINL can bounce back into profits if it is allotted captive mines, which reduces the burden of procuring iron ore by nearly ₹3,500 crore a year, and the interest on the loan outstanding is reduced from 14 per cent to eight per cent as being extended to private industrialists.“In the name of getting rid of the loss-making company, the Centre is virtually killing a golden goose,” Adinarayana said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-agitation-against-privatisation-move-vizag-steel-plant-achieves-record-production-101616679803729.html

25-03-2021||India||Covid-19: In a first, duration of Haridwar's Kumbh Mela curtailed to one month||The duration of the 'Kumbh Mela' in Uttarakhand's Haridwar has been curtailed to just one month for the first time in its history in view of a recent surge in Covid-19 cases, news agency PTI reported on Thursday. Yesterday, the Uttarakhand government had made it mandatory for devotees to bring a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours for attending the upcoming mega congregation.The occasion usually lasts around three-and-a-half months. Its last edition was held in Haridwar from January 14 to April 28 in 2010. According to a new notification, the congregation on the banks of the Ganges in Haridwar in Uttarakhand will now take place from April 1 to 30, with three 'shahi snan' (major bathing) dates on April 12, 14 and 27.Also Read: Negative Covid test report mandatory to attend Kumbh Mela: Uttarakhand govtThe temple city of Haridwar is in the final stages of preparations to host the 'Kumbh Mela', which is slated to start from April 1. On the other hand, the Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand, which lay low for a few months, are once again showing a rising trend of late. 200 new coronavirus infections were reported on Wednesday, of which the maximum were detected in Haridwar (71 cases). Dehradun, the state's winter capital, reported 63 cases, while as many as 22 cases were reported from Nainital, according to a Covid-19 control room bulletin.The rising number of cases forms a cause of concern for the administration since thousands of devotees take a dip in the holy river during the mela, with their number increasing manifold on the days of 'shahi snan'. Authorities also expect heavy turnouts on the occasions of Chaitra Pratipada on April 13 and Ram Navami on April 21.The Kumbh Kshetra (area) covers Neergarh, Tapovan, Bitthal Ashram Marg to Muni-Ki-Reti Road and Rishi-Haridwar bypass in the north; and Narendra Nagar-Rishikesh bypass, the forest check-post on Rishikesh-Dehradun Road, Rishikesh-Haridwar bypass, Mansa Devi, Billkeshwar Mandir, Tibri Mohand, BHEL residential buildings, Roorkee-Bahadarabad road and up to 13 km on Haridwar-Delhi road in the west. In the south, the congregation area will extend from Bahadarabad-Haridwar bypass to Siddha Sot Setu and from Siddha Sot Setu to Neelkanth Mahadev temple in the east.Soon after taking over as the chief minister of Uttarakhand, Tirath Singh Rawat had said that it was not compulsory to bring a negative RT-PCR test report for devotees gathering for the Kumbh. It is a religious event that comes once in 12 years and devotees can attend it freely, he had said. However, he later ordered strict compliance with the guidelines issued by the central government in view of the surging positive cases.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-a-first-duration-of-haridwar-s-kumbh-mela-curtailed-to-one-month-101616671842219.html

He said that there was no provocation in Tikait’s speech and also called the action “an attempt to silence the voice of farmers.”“The police have booked a case against Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait in Shivamogga (Shimoga) and Haveri on the charges of delivering provocative speech.

You need to gherao Bengaluru (like Delhi) from all sides and people will come and join your protest,” news agency ANI quoted Tikait as saying.Kumaraswamy defended these remarks saying that there was nothing provocative in the speech. “There is no provocative element in Tikait’s statement- Farmers need not come to Delhi for the struggle against new farm laws. You can launch a struggle here itself like the one in Delhi”.

25-03-2021||India||How Delhi’s abstention on Sri Lanka vote in Geneva is playing out in Chennai||In Mannar, the northern province of Sri Lanka, during the civil war, three children woke up on most mornings to dead bodies near their homes and schools. When they were outdoors, and between their school and home, a four-kilometre walk, their father taught them to run to the nearest shelter if they heard distant sounds of aerial bombs or shelling. The bombings took place so often that even the sound of a coconut breaking would send the children running in fear.“...they [the children] were traumatised, so I decided to come to India,” said the father, who wished to remain anonymous because of the fear of reprisal for his family back home. His siblings and extended family stayed back in Sri Lanka.For families like his, the 47-member United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)’s resolution on Sri Lanka is an important step towards justice. On March 23, UNHRC adopted the resolution for promoting reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in Sri Lanka with 22 of its members voting in favour. India abstained, generating concerns among the Sri Lankan Tamils in India. “Our tears and scars are still fresh... We are at peace now in India but how do we find closure for what happened to us if India takes a neutral position?” the 68-year-old father asked.Also Watch | India abstains from vote on Sri Lanka at UNHRC over civil war crimesAfter living in a transitory camp for four years in Mandapam, his family was shifted to a refugee camp. His four sisters and three brothers stayed back. During the end of the war in 2009, his oldest brother and his children died when they were hiding in a trench. Colloquially called bunkers, these were the safest options to minimise injuries when there was shelling. But death was certain if a bomb landed inside the trench.In Tamil Nadu, successive governments have provided education quota and other benefits for Sri Lankan Tamils. The three children, scarred by war during their childhood, now have a possibly secure future. One is studying for an MBA degree in a London university while two are employed in the state.But to ensure justice for Sri Lankan Tamils, both domestic and international pressure is crucial, say activists. “There is value in the UNHRC process because there is an international spotlight on the issues, so we know there is fairness among the global community on this issue and it is not forgotten,” said Sri Lankan-born social worker Poongkothai Chandrahasan, who has been working with refugees for 17 years in Tamil Nadu.It is voices like these from the ground and the sympathy and solidarity that they evoke among the wider population of the state that has generated pressure on political parties in Tamil Nadu. India’s abstention has embarrassed the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). It is being held accountable as it in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Tamil Nadu, which goes to polls on April 6.Both AIADMK and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) have promised benefits for Sri Lankan refugees in their election manifesto such as dual citizenship and voting rights. “We know the local parties support our rights and we are aware there may be no immediate solution,” said the father. His generation of refugees wants to return home. “It is our motherland after all,” he said. “But we will advocate for our right to vote and make it a reality before we return.”Also Read | India’s Sri Lanka dilemma | HT EditorialWhile it is not a major electoral poll plank, the issue is sensitive in Tamil Nadu. Some regional parties such as S Seeman’s Tamil nationalist party Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) and Vaiko’s Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) have grown solely maintaining the Sri Lankan Tamils issue as their core ideology. Several Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leaders, including its chief Vellupuli Prabhakaran, were associated with Dravidian leaders. When they came to the state, they often lived with Tamil families who supported their struggle.Both AIADMK and BJP have said that India’s vote in Geneva would not affect their alliance, but the regional ally has come down heavily on its national partner. AIADMK leaders say that they are ideologically different from the BJP and the alliance is only aimed to defeat the DMK. “This is not the first time that the BJP is making us answerable to criticism just before elections,” said an AIADMK leader, who wished to remain anonymous. “Before the Vellore by-poll, they passed the legislation against triple talaq and our candidate AC Shanmugam lost all the Muslim votes and the seat. On the Sri Lankan issue, however, our electoral prospects would not be impacted as the people who vote based on this issue will anyway choose NTK.”MDMK is with the DMK and Vaiko, who was close to Prabhakaran. It has condemned the Central government for its stand on the vote. DMK president MK Stalin said if there were no elections, the BJP would have voted in favour of Sri Lanka and called abstaining a “great betrayal.” Before the voting, Stalin and AIADMK’s ally, PMK, had urged the Centre to vote against Sri Lanka.The BJP justified its stand, listing Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government’s schemes and funds for Lankan Tamils. “Though we have abstained, we have issued a strong statement in favour of Sri Lankan Tamils,” said BJP leader CT Ravi. “This is not a political issue but a humanitarian issue between two countries.” Modi had earlier said that the Centre would support the equality and dignity of Sri Lankan Tamils at a public meeting in Chennai in February. “It is like lip-service,” reacted AIADMK’s senior leader C Ponnaiyan.After the three-decade-long war ended in 2009, there have been seven resolutions on Sri Lanka in UNHRC. India’s position has varied. Ahead of the vote in March 2013, the DMK pulled out of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, which was in power at the Centre. DMK said the Congress did not do enough to address the alleged human rights violations of Tamils.“The BJP is not bothered about the AIADMK’s position on the issue,” said political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “It is not an election issue though it would be spoken about during campaigning and only NTK may get voters on this issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-delhi-s-abstention-on-sri-lanka-vote-in-geneva-is-playing-out-in-chennai-101616672303412.html

Owing to some financial reasons, he was forced to drop out of school."Faced with financial distress, I dropped out of school in the eighth standard. Then, I went on to work in a couple of IT companies. I have been fond of computers since childhood. I honed my skills and gained knowledge about graphics while working in these companies," Asif said."After working for some time, I started a small set up around graphic designing at home itself. Later, I got a call from one of my mentors who advised me to upgrade my skills to web designing as I was quite good at graphics," Asif added.He said that his 'Thames Infotech' journey started in 2016. Having observed my work in graphic designing, some people contacted him. One of them told him to upgrade to website designing as he was already quite good at graphics. Then, he worked in a UK-based company as an employee and kept learning about websites."I met a man who was a Google-employee, called Hamja Salim. He said we should start a small set-up dealing in website designing. We started our start-up in June 2016. We shifted its headquarters to Manchester in 2018. The start-up was not called 'Thames Infotech' at the start. I took this name from the famous river in London," Asif further added.He returned to Kashmir in 2018 following his wish to create IT awareness in my region."Here we just have one IT professional for every 100 doctors. People think there is no scope in IT. But there is a lot of scope in it. I am giving lessons and teaching the youth here about website and graphics designing now. I don't want my region to fall behind in this particular field," he said.Zubair Ahmad, one of his friends, told ANI that Asif has always been a laborious and talented boy."He struggled a lot in life but I know him as a determined guy from the beginning," Ahamd said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/board-exams/school-dropout-creating-it-awareness-among-kashmiri-youth-101616671961788.html

Addressing reporters, the minister said that this guideline will apply only to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits.For the rest of the state, an RT-PCR negative test report is mandatory only for those arriving from Punjab, Chandigarh, Maharashtra and Kerala. Sudhakar said that a decision was taken to expand these regulations to all travellers since Bengaluru has been reporting the highest number of cases in the state.Stating that 60 per cent of Bengaluru’s cases have an interstate travel history, Sudhakar said that the government is planning to revive the stamping of hands of those who have to undergo home isolation. “Many youngsters who are supposed to undergo home isolation are freely walking around because they are asymptomatic. We need to curb this,” he said.The government has also decided to bring back the Quarantine Watch application, which was suspended after the state witnessed a drop in cases, to monitor those undergoing home isolation.On Wednesday, The Karnataka government had proposed imposing strict fines on establishments, like hotels, departmental stores and organisers of public events as well as other places that host large gatherings, which fail to enforce safety protocols.According to the late-night order issued by the state government on Wednesday, a fine of ₹5,000-10,000 has been proposed on all establishments that do not enforce Covid-19-appropriate safety protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing.“The owners of the establishment will be responsible for: a) ensuring compulsory wearing of masks and social distancing; b) enforcing restrictions on the number of persons to be allowed,” the order stated.The government has put a cap on the number of wedding attendees to 500 in open spaces and 200 in closed areas, the number has to be between 50 and 100 for birthday parties and funerals, depending on whether they are held in enclosed or open spaces. The government has restricted the number of attendees at religious and political events to 500.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negative-rt-pcr-report-must-for-all-passengers-arriving-in-bengaluru-karnataka-health-minister-101616671763042.html

The explosive-laden SUV which was found in front of Ambani house Antilia on February 25 belonged to Hiran, but was stolen a week before the incident. After he was found dead on March 5, Hiran's wife claimed that the car was with Vaze in November last year. She also claimed that Vaze was pressurising Hiran to get arrested in the case.Also Read | Modi insecure about Kejriwal, BJP wants NCT Bill to stem his popularity: SisodiaOn Thursday, as Vaze was produced before the court, he said he had been made a scapegoat in the entire episode. "I have been made a scapegoat in this entire incident and have nothing to do with the crime," he said."I was Investigating officer for one and half day and I did what required to investigate in the case and not only me, all crime branch officers and Mumbai police did," said Vaze before the court.As he is fully co-operating with the probe, Vaze said his custody should not be extended.Vaze told he wanted to share the details of what happened after he went to NIA as he was called for interrogation on March 13. The magistrate asked Vaze to speak with his lawyer and after his discussion with his lawyer Abad Ponda, Vaze said he would give to the court in writing.Vaze was arrested by the NIA for his alleged role in the Antilia bomb scare under section 286, 465, 473, 506(2), 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, and 4(a)(b)(I) of the Explosive Substances Act 1908.The Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis earlier said that Sachin Vaze case will not be over until the killer of Mansukh Hiran is revealed. Fadnavis also accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led government of trying to save Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-vaze-to-be-in-nia-custody-till-april-3-101616671396094.html

She has been granted bail upon furnishing a surety of ₹15,000 and a cash surety of ₹20,000, Bar and Bench reported.On March 1, the court ordered a bailable warrant against the actor as she failed to respond to the summons issued by the court."For willful absence of accused (Ranaut) without any justified reasons, despite service of summons, issue bailable warrant of ₹1,000 against accused Kangana Ranaut," Magistrate R R Khan said in the order."As accused (Ranaut) has voluntarily remained absent without any justified reason despite service of summons and even not filed any exemption application, therefore, as per law issuance of bailable warrant of ₹1,000 against accused will be justified," it added.The case pertains to a television interview that Kangana gave on July 19, 2020, and linked Javed Akhtar with Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death. Akhtar filed a criminal complaint against Kangana on November 3, under Sections 499 (defamation) and 500 (punishment for defamation) of the Indian Penal Code.On Thursday, she appeared before the court following which the court granted bail. In a parallel development, the Karnataka high court on Thursday set aside an FIR registered against Kangana Ranaut over her tweets where she compared protesting farmers with terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-gets-partial-relief-in-defamation-case-filed-by-javed-akhtar-101616669929794.html
25-03-2021||India||In Assam and Bengal, the BJP’s contrasting approach to CAA-NRC||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s dilemma regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in election-bound West Bengal and Assam became obvious on Tuesday when the party released its manifesto for the Assam elections.The party’s national president JP Nadda, while releasing the poll manifesto in Assam, said CAA cannot be changed through a state legislation and did not commit to its implementation, two days after home minister Amit Shah, while releasing the manifesto for West Bengal, said the state Cabinet would take a decision on implementing CAA if the BJP comes to power in the state.The BJP’s manifesto in Assam is silent on implementing CAA, which allows citizenship to Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains who came to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Interestingly, before the 2016 elections in the state, which it won, the party promised implementation of CAA, which in the state would have meant automatic citizenship to minorities from Bangladesh, who came after the 1971 war of liberation, without going through the tedious NRC process.Also Read | BJP promises corrected NRC to protect ‘genuine’ Indian citizensIn 2019, the Parliament approved a bill to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955, providing automatic citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from some neighbouring countries who came to India before December 31, 2014. The Assam Accord provides citizenship to migrants after March 25, 1971 as the cut-off date. The difference in the time frame has caused consternation in a state where fear of outsiders resulted in a seven-year-long agitation. The Centre is yet to notify the rules to implement the amended law. In March, a Parliamentary committee gave the home ministry another six months to notify the rules.On Monday, at a road show in West Bengal’s Medinipur, Shah said that CAA will be implemented in Bengal. “Once we are in power, the first meeting of our Cabinet will announce the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act,” Shah said.Interestingly, the party is silent on implementing NRC in West Bengal, fearing that doing so could impact Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, including Dalit Hindu communities, the Rajbanshis of north Bengal and Matuas of south Bengal. The two constitute about 28% of the state’s population. Both the communities have demanded CAA and opposed NRC.However, in Assam there were widespread and violent agitations in 2019 against CAA . Most people in the state are in support of NRC, though. Assam’s main opposition party, the Congress, has promised that it will not implement CAA in the state if it comes to power. Also Read | Nobody an outsider in Tagore’s Bengal, says PM Modi; invokes national anthemThere is a fear in Assam that CAA would dilute the 1985 Assam Accord and lead to a fresh influx of Bangladeshi Hindus. The accord provided for the deportation of all refugees and migrants, who entered Assam after March 25, 1971. CAA extends the deadline until December 31, 2014.In Assam, the BJP has announced that it will focus on a corrected NRC after a large number of Hindu migrants were left out of the updated NRC announced on August 31, 2019. NRC for the detection of undocumented foreigners excluded 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million people, who applied for inclusion in NRC. The BJP has rejected NRC as “faulty” saying genuine citizens were left out while foreigners were included. The NRC is yet to be notified.Nadda said the party, if elected in Assam, would make efforts to correct the NRC to protect genuine citizens. The NRC was conducted in Assam under the Supreme Court directions in 2017-18. In the budget session of Parliament, the home ministry said that no decision has been taken on implementing the NRC nationally. Tapas Roy, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister, said, “The announcement Shah made regarding CAA is nothing but a jumla (false promise). The BJP knows it can never enforce it in Bengal. The same goes with NRC. Shah needs to explain what happened to the 1.2 million Bengalis whose names got delisted in Assam,” he said. Kolkata-based professor of economics and political analyst Sarthak Roychaudhury said, “If Shah is a seasoned and judicious politician then he should first analyse why such large sections of Bengalis, including Hindus, are opposed to CAA and NRC. Both are double-edged weapons and the BJP needs to be careful about them.”Akhil Ranjan Dutta, a columnist and professor of political science at Gauhati University, said, “The BJP is talking only about a corrected NRC, but the 10 commitments (in its manifesto) don’t mention CAA, which the party has committed to implement in West Bengal. In the 2019 general election, CAA was a core issue. But this time they have avoided it and are more focussed on highlighting the so-called clash of civilisations and promise to protect Assam’s ‘sanskriti’ from cultural threat. It seems they want to polarise votes as part of a key strategy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-and-bengal-the-bjp-s-contrasting-approach-to-caanrc-101616669484933.html
25-03-2021||India||Need to increase maximum age limit for recruitment due to Covid pandemic doesn't arise: Centre||The need for increasing the maximum age limit for recruitment to various categories of posts under the central government, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in the country, does not arise, the Rajya Sabha was informed on Thursday.“Insofar as the increase in maximum age limit by two years for all the eligible unemployed youths, who are seeking state government jobs is concerned, it is for the concerned state governments to decide,” Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said in a written reply.The minister was responding to a question whether the government is considering to increase maximum age limit by two years for all the eligible unemployed youths, who are seeking central and state government jobs as they lost their chances due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown in the country.For recruitment to central government posts, the recruiting agencies, such as the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), have been making necessary arrangements for conduct of examinations in a safe manner considering the Covid-19 pandemic safety protocols, Singh said.While conducting civil services (preliminary) examination-2020 on October 4 last year, the UPSC also gave an option to the candidates to change the centre for civil services (preliminary) examination-2020 so that candidates who had moved to a different location before/during the Covid-19 pandemic could also appear in the examination, he said.“As such, the need for increasing the maximum age limit for recruitment to various categories of posts under the central government due to the pandemic and lockdown in the country does not arise,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-increase-maximum-age-limit-for-recruitment-due-to-covid-pandemic-doesn-t-arise-centre-101616669142931.html
25-03-2021||India||Corporate party’s entry makes enough ripples in Kerala’s polity||After its emphatic win in four local bodies in Ernakulam district in December, the corporate party, Twenty20, took a deep plunge in assembly elections, nine years after its formation, increasing heartbeats of mainstream political parties. It has fielded eight candidates for the April 6 elections and claims at least a couple of them will be in the state assembly.There was a long queue before Kitex group of companies, a successful apparel unit and aluminium utensil producer, headquarters in Kizhakkambalam (16 kilometres away from Ernakulam) before elections but the Twenty20 stood its ground.“Our independent character is our success. If we align with any formations we will lose our identity,” said chief co-ordinator of the party Sabu Jacob who is also chairman of the ₹1,000 crore Kitex group.Due to Twenty20’s presence, many constituencies are witnessing a four-cornered contest in Ernakulam, a first for the state. The fledgeling party got a big push last week when V Guard group chairman Kochouspeh Chittilapilly, known for his philanthropic activities, actor Sreenivasan and cine director Siddique (‘Body Guard’ fame) joined it as mentors.“Everyone needs a change and people are looking to us for this. There were many attempts to run us down and during the last local body elections, all parties teamed up and there were attempts on some of our activists. But these attacks failed to intimidate us,” said Jacob, a second-generation businessman who shuttles between India and the United States.In the 2016 local body election, it swept the power in Kizhakkambalam, a tiny panchayat with 38,000 people, but in 2020, it added four more local bodies to its kit.For the politically conscious state, “corporatization of power” was hard to digest but results are plain to see. Houses for the poor (known as God’s villas), free wi-fi, special package for students, subsidised food, better infrastructure, plug and play stations for startups and organic farms form the results that are visible in the semi-agrarian and urban village of Kizhakkambalam. If a visitor mistakes Kizhakkambalam for a slice of a developed country, he can’t be blamed either. The Twenty20 stamp is everywhere.“We consider our village an extended family. People’s need is the need of the village. Once debt-ridden panchayat, now it has a surplus budget worth ₹13.4 crore. There were many attempts to intimidate us and we spent a good amount for litigation also,” Sabu Jacob explained.Recently, many such apolitical outfits like ‘V for Kochi’ and ‘Thiruvananthapuram Development Front’ came forward to align with the new experiment but Twenty20 remained aloof.“It is not a one-day wonder. We need sustainable and committed people to further it. So we are not for any experiment at this juncture,” he said adding that he was forced to float the party in 2012 after being fed up with the mounting corruption around. He said after gauging the success of the assembly poll experiment, he will think of furthering Twenty20’s wings to other parts of the state.“All I want is to correct the system but nobody is willing to involve with it. Many people are there to make running commentaries without involvement. People will have to come forward to correct it,” he explained his guiding principle. He said the country lacks vision and corruption has seeped into every aspect, hindering development and happiness around.“If we can sweep out corruption and work with some vision, I think 80 per cent of our problems will be over,” he said.The people of Kizhakkambalam and many neighbouring villages are happy but politicians are not amused. “If big corporate houses run parties like this what will be the future of our country? People will be happy with some goodies and services but in the long run, it will destroy democracy,” said former MP and CPI(M) leader P Rajeev who is seeking election from Kalamassery. All parties admit the new party is posing a big threat to established players and are keeping their fingers crossed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corporate-party-s-entry-makes-enough-ripples-in-kerala-polity-101616669303020.html
25-03-2021||India||Amid protest, Odisha Cabinet okays mineral foundation fund for hockey stadium||On Monday, the Odisha Cabinet approved the development of Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Stadium and construction of an international hockey stadium in Rourkela ahead of Men’s Hockey World Cup in 2023. Of the ₹356.38 crore the project requires, ₹266 crore will come through District Mineral Foundation (DMF) Trust of Sundargarh, and Odisha Sports Development Fund.The decision has renewed the questions that have been raised over the alleged misuse of DMF funds for a various other projects but those for mining-affected public, which was why the DMF was created. For instance, in January last year, Rourkela city police got 25 Innova Crysta vehicles at a cost of ₹4.65 crore with Sundargarh DMF fund.“How would building stadium or buying police vehicles help mining-affected areas? People in Sundargarh don’t have access to safe drinking water and proper roads. Should the funds not be used for better purposes,” asked Laxman Munda, CPM MLA from Bonai in Sundargarh. Munda’s protests have come at a time when the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh is using the DMF funds for the construction of an airstrip in Singrauli district, one of the biggest and most polluted coal mining and thermal power hubs in the country.  DMF was instituted through an amendment to Mines and Minerals(Development and Regulation) Act 2015 to “work for the interest and benefit of people and areas affected by mining”. The funds of DMF trust come from mining companies operating in the respective districts and they pay an equivalent of 30% of the royalty amount for leases granted before 2015, and 10% for leases granted after that. DMF fund is to be spent on improving human development indicators through investments in high-priority areas such as healthcare, education, women and child development, improving sustainable livelihood, and income opportunities in areas adversely affected by mining.Also Read | Amid protest, Odisha Cabinet okays mineral foundation fund for hockey stadiumTill January this year, Odisha collected ₹11,984.87 crore in its DMF fund, the highest in the country, and spent ₹5,364 crore out of it, around 44.76% , a little less than the national average. Yet, there are murmurs of protest over the alleged misuse of funds.Kusum Tete, BJP MLA of Sundargarh, one of the districts where DMF money is being spent, said, “Rourkela city is not a mining area while most of my electorate bear the brunt of pollution due to coal and iron ore mining. The government is using DMF funds for sports infra in Rourkela, and policing. Should it not have used the money for providing piped water in Sundargarh?” Tete said Hemagir, one of the blocks in her assembly constituency, suffers from pollution from trucks carrying coal to neighbouring Chhatisgarh. “The first priority should have been using the DMF funds to prevent pollution in the area. The tribals have been agitating for the past two months, but the government is the least bothered,” she said.Chinmayi Shalya, who works with the International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology (iForest) on DMF issues, said DMF fund is not meant for stadium construction and beautification projects. “It is a targeted fund for mining-affected communities. Using it singularly for hockey World Cup would potentially be a misuse,” she said.Chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra and Sundargarh district collector Nikhil Pawan Kalyan did not comment on the allegations.Activists are also severely critical of the state government’s decision to use DMF funds for integrated traffic management system to check road fatalities in the state.“The commerce and transport department has asked all districts to install CCTV surveillance system for enforcement of traffic violations at vulnerable stretches and black spots on highways from the DMF or Corporate Social Responsibility fund where DMF is not available. How will CCTV surveillance help the lot of tribals?” asked activist Pradip Pradhan.The state government also plans to construct integrated infrastructure complex, including old age homes in all the 30 districts, with the funding support from DMF. In Keonjhar, locals pointed out the district authorities are building a handball stadium in Keonjhar. “At least 56% of the people in Keonjhar district are Dalits and tribals and sizeable section of them is below the poverty line. Yet the district administration does not take the suggestion of the common people while finalising the plans for DMF use,” alleged Kiran Sahu, president of Keonjhar Citizen’s Forum.Even as there have been protests over the expenditure on stadiums and police vehicles, the Odisha Commerce and Transport department has sought the permission to build a new railway line project for iron ore transportation in Keonjhar district from DMF fund, triggered another controversy.In a letter to the Keonjhar district collector, the department has asked if the DMF trust can sanction ₹363.38 crore for building the 18 km Banspani-Barbil line that will provide direct rail connectivity to iron ore loading stations on the Noamundi-Bolani Khadan section from Banspani for movement to steel plants in Odisha or to ports. The railway line is proposed to be built by Odisha Rail Infrastructure Development Limited, a state government-led joint venture with Indian Railways.Environmentalists and right activists are decidedly against the project. “When DMF fund is supposed to be spent for the benefit of those affected by mining-related operations, seeking permission for spending it on railway project connecting iron ore loading stations to steel plants is a mad idea. The DMF fund is meant to uplift the living standards of mining-affected people, not make their lives more miserable,” said Prafulla Samantara, rights activist who was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2017.Prominent environmental activist Biswajit Mohanty said it is laughable to propose spending DMF fund for iron ore transportation when miners are asked to contribute to the fund for the damage they are causing to local environment. CPM MLA from Bonai constituency of Sundargarh district, Laxman Munda said, “Lack of transparency can result in wasteful expenditure, misuse of funds and sub-standard quality of work and corruption.” Shalya pointed out that decision-making needs to involve those directly affected by mining. “There are some good investment examples from Odisha, such as, the use of DMF to increase MGNREGA wages at par with state minimum wage in Keonjhar. States should guide and equip districts for a long-term planning of DMFs so that funds are used wisely and effectively to improve the well-being of local communities,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-protest-odisha-cabinet-okays-mineral-foundation-fund-for-hockey-stadium-101616668823177.html

I have challenged in the Delhi High Court the constitutional vires of Section 50 of the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act), under which these summons are issued," she said in a letter to the ED.Section 50 of the PMLA empowers the authority, that is, officers of the ED, to summon any person to give evidence or produce records. People who are summoned are bound to answer the questions put to them and to produce documents as required by the ED officers, failing which they can be penalised under the PMLA.The PDP leader had said that without prejudice to any of the contentions in the proceedings before the high court, "I state that I am not in a position to attend the summon on March 22 as I have prior commitments that cannot be cancelled at such short notice"."If however you insist we must do it sooner, I am ready and willing to be questioned in Srinagar, preferably at my residence or through video conference from Srinagar," Mehbooba said in her letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-appears-before-ed-in-srinagar-101616668132512.html
25-03-2021||India||Domestic violence complaints against women spiked in year of lockdown: NCW data||The number of complaints of domestic violence received by the National Commission for Women rose sharply from 2,960 in 2019 to 5,297 in 2020, the year of the lockdown when most people were confined to their homes due to Covid-19. The trend continues this year as well.The NCW received a total of 19,730 complaints of crimes against women in 2019 as compared to 23,722 in 2020, according to official data.A year after the lockdown, the NCW continues to receive over 2,000 complaints every month of crimes against women with nearly one-fourth of them related to domestic violence, it stated. According to the NCW data, 1,463 complaints of domestic violence against women were received from January, 2021 to March 25, 2021.The nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 last year to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it also trapped many domestic violence victims with their abusers.Soon after the lockdown was imposed, the NCW reported a surge of complaints related to domestic violence so much so that it started a dedicated WhatsApp number for reporting of just domestic violence complaints.The number of complaints of domestic violence went on increasing through the months and in July, a record number of 660 such complaints were received.Since June, the NCW has been receiving over 2,000 complaints of crimes against women every month out of which nearly a quarter are of domestic violence, the data stated.According to the NCW data, 25,886 complaints of crime against women have been received from April, 2020 till now which includes 5,865 complaints of domestic violence. Also, the NCW received the highest number of complaints against women in six years in 2020 at 23,722 with nearly one-fourth of them of domestic violence.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma had said economic insecurity, increased stress levels, anxiety, financial worry, and lack of other such emotional support of parents/family's side may have resulted in domestic violence in many instances in the year 2020."More so, home has become the workplace of both the spouses and as well as schools and colleges for their children. In such situations, women are multitasking being professional at the same time supporting their families from the same space. But the biggest challenge for women this year is not only to adapt but to thrive in this unprecedented situation," she had told PTI.Women rights activist Yogita Bhayana, who heads the People Against Rape in India (PARI), said the high rate might also be because of high awareness among women to talk about it and report it."There has been an increase because there is also a rise in awareness because women are getting more proactive reporting it and talking about it. Earlier they used to suppress their grievances and the government is also spreading awareness and women get motivated by other women reporting it," she said."Because of social media, the reporting of domestic violence has increased. Women have become more vocal and they have less tolerance, which is very good," she noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-violence-complaints-against-women-spiked-in-year-of-lockdown-ncw-data-101616665002984.html

25-03-2021||India||Chhattisgarh bars Holi Milan events in Raipur, quarantine must for outsiders||Chhattisgarh, one of the five states powering the surge of Covid-19 cases, has announced restrictions on entry of people to tourist spots and banned social, political and religious programmes in state capital Raipur, an official statement by the government said on Thursday.The new set of guidelines issued by the Raipur district administration also mandates that people entering the capital from other states would have to spend seven days in home quarantine before they can step out.An official said according to the guidelines, Holi Milan celebrations or other public gatherings have been banned, although ‘Holika Dahan’, a religious ritual associated with the festival, has been allowed to take place on the condition that a maximum of only five people are present.Thursday’s restrictions in Raipur comes after a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. According to data compiled by the Union health ministry, Chhattisgarh reported 1,443 cases in the last 24 hours, next only to Maharashtra’s 16,600 fresh cases. On Sunday, Chhattisgarh ordered all educational institutions and anganwadis to remain closed till further notice.India recorded 53,476 new Covid-19 cases, 26,490 recoveries, and 251 deaths in the last 24 hours. Apart from Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, the other states that have reported a significant increase in Covid cases are Karnataka, Punjab and Gujarat. These five states account for 77% of the total cases in the country.The Union home ministry earlier this week gave states a free hand to introduce restrictions on people to deal with the pandemic, allowing state governments to impose their local restrictions such as night curfew or weekend restrictions in the district, sub-district or city level based on the situation. States are, however, not allowed to stop inter-state and intra-state movement.“All kinds of religious festivals, cultural and political programmes, sports, exhibitions and fairs, functions and public programmes have been banned. Religious places will remain open for only paying obeisance at personal level and people can enter places of worship individually, but organising any kind of group or public programmes will be prohibited there,” the Chhattisgarh government’s statement said.Programmes such as marriage, funeral, etc will be allowed with the maximum presence of 50 persons, and adherence to Covid-19 guidelines, such as wearing masks and social distancing will be mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-bars-holi-milan-events-in-raipur-quarantine-must-for-outsiders-101616660662283.html

He was reacting to the passage of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, (GNCTD bill) in the Rajya Sabha."They (BJP) want to run the government through the LG. Then, what's the need for an elected government?" Kharge was quoted by news agency ANI as saying. "We had forced them to send the bill to the select committee but they didn't agree, then, opposition walked out of the House," he further said.On Wednesday, the upper house of Parliament gave a nod to the contentious Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, amid massive uproar and opposition walkout. The bill has already been passed by the lower house of the Parliament, Lok Sabha.The bill seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functions to the L-G who is appointed by the central government. If enacted, a reference to the word 'government' in any law passed by the legislative assembly would directly mean the L-G and not the state government. It also makes it mandatory for the city government to seek L-G’s opinion before any executive action.Since it was tabled in Parliament, there has been major protests by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP government. The bill has also revived an old-running power tussle between the Centre and the Delhi government over the control of the national capital.On Wednesday, Delhi chief minister and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal called it a "Sad Day" for the Indian democracy and asserted that the party will continue its struggle to "restore power back to people". " Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down," he added in the post on Twitter.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the BJP "fears Arvind Kejriwal".Meanwhile, the Centre and rejected accusations related to the bill being "unconstitutional". In an attempt to dispel concerns raised by opposition members, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy said the amendments in the act will create a sound government mechanism in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whats-the-need-for-an-elected-government-says-mallikarjun-kharge-after-parliament-passes-nct-bill-101616656793914.html

Athawale said that he demanded President’s rule to be imposed in the state amid corruption allegations against the home minister Anil Deshmukh, reported news agency ANI.“...gave him (President Kovind) a memorandum on behalf of RPI (A) party demanding the President's rule in Maharashtra. It is a serious matter. No inquiry can take place until the Maharashtra government is removed. He said that he will consider it,” he told ANI.Watch | Ramdas Athawale meets Kovind, seeks President's rule in MaharashtraAthawale's meeting comes in the backdrop of extortion allegations against Deshmukh levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed from his post. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Singh stated that the home minister tasked now suspended police officer Sachin Vaze with collecting ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai. Vaze has been arrested in cases related to bomb scare at billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month.The minister, however, has denied the allegations saying he was admitted to a hospital in Nagpur after testing positive for Covid-19 and then home quarantining at his Mumbai bungalow in February, when according to the cop’s letter he met Vaze.As opposition leaders continued to mount pressure on the government, Deshmukh on Wednesday wrote to chief minister Thackeray seeking an investigation into the corruption charges levelled against him by Singh. "If the chief minister inquires the matter, I would welcome it. Satyamev Jayate," he wrote on Twitter and posted the copy of the letter he sent.The top cop on the other hand has approached the Supreme Court demanding a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against Deshmukh. The apex court directed him to the high court saying the latter was a more appropriate forum for deciding on the issue. Following this, the former Mumbai Police chief withdrew his petition.NCP leaders including the party’s national chief Sharad Pawar have backed Deshmukh. The former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, however, has continued to raise his voice alleging that this is not the first time corruption charges have been made against the state home minister. He has repeatedly demanded Deshmukh’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-demands-president-s-rule-in-maharashtra-amid-corruption-claim-against-anil-deshmukh-101616655079915.html

The court also asked Deepak Kochhar to surrender passport with authorities and co-operate with the probe in the loan case.A special court had rejected his bail plea in November, 2020. He was arrested in September last year. Both Chanda and Deepak Kochhar are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) for alleged corruption and money laundering. Both of them have been questioned by the ED multiple times.The probe revolves around alleged irregularities in the granting of loans to the Videocon Group.It started after a whistle-blower complaint alleged that Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon invested in a company along with Deepak Kochhar and then transferred his holdings to the latter. The complaint linked this to loans issued by the bank to Videocon.ICICI bank’s board initially backed Chanda Kochhar. However, she stepped down on October 4, 2018. The bank’s board sacked her in January 2019, treating her exit as termination.Kochhar defended herself before ED in March 2019 saying the loans were given on merit and have no link with her husband’s business.The ED is probing 24 loans aggregating ₹7,862 crore during Chanda Kochhar’s tenure as the CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank. Out of this, ₹1,875 crore loan disbursed by ICICI Bank to Venugopal Dhoot-led Videocon Group in 2009 and 2011.A special PMLA (Prevention Of Money Laundering Act) court granted her bail in February in the loan case. She was asked to furnish a bond of ₹5 lakh and not leave the country without the permission of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deepak-kochhar-husband-of-chanda-kochhar-gets-bail-in-loan-case-101616656032851.html

They can then schedule the an appointment to get a dose of the vaccine. People need to carry a photo ID to the centre they have applied for the appointment.The government has now allowed all citizens above 45 years of age to get a vaccine against the Covid-19. They can avail the shots from April 1 onwards, without having to show the comorbidities certificate.So far 5.21 crore vaccines have been administered in India.India has decided to not expand vaccine exports for now and first meet domestic needs following a massive spike in coronavirus cases, people familiar with the development told HT.

The court passed the order while hearing a plea from women Army officers who were rejected for permanent commission."We allow these petitions with a number of directions. Officers will be considered for permanent commission subject to disciplinary and vigilance clearance," the bench headed by Justice Dr D Y Chandrachud said."This shall continue and they shall avail all benefits," it further said, disposing off the writ petition.The court also made strong observations about the Army's evaluation criteria to grant permanent commission to officers, calling it "arbitrary and irrational"."The evaluation criteria adopted by Army constitutes systemic discrimination of women... The criteria requiring them to match the lowest merit of the male officer and requirement to be in SHAPE-1 criteria disproportionately affects women," the bench said."A career in the army comes with many trials. It becomes more difficult when the society puts responsibility of childcare and domestic work on women," the bench said. It, however, added that there can be no judicial review of standards adopted by the Army.In their petition, the women officers claimed that 615 women officers of the Short Service Commission (SSC) were eligible for PC, but only 277 made it to the final list.The court asked the Army to consider the candidature of these women officers within a month in accordance with the directions issued by the court.The top court earlier ordered that the permanent commission will apply to all women officers in the Indian Army in service, irrespective of their years of service. It also ordered that after the judgement of Delhi high court, Centre should grant permanent commission to women officers.Last year, the court ordered the central government to grant permanent commission to women officers in the Army's non-combat support units on par with their male counterparts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-101616651773531.html
25-03-2021||India||India will finally have a say in crucial meetings to decide Afghan future||After months of watching from the sidelines as the Trump administration recklessly pushed ahead with a deal with the Taliban, the Indian government will finally have a say in two crucial meetings being held to decide the future of Afghanistan.On March 30, external affairs minister S Jaishankar is set to join a meeting of the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process in the Tajikistan capital of Dushanbe. Sometime after that, India is expected to join Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, and the US for a meeting to be convened by the UN to discuss a unified approach on Afghanistan.Both meetings will be crucial opportunities for the Indian foreign policy set-up to present its expectations of the end state that the US appears intent on pushing through in Kabul in order to end its involvement in a war that has dragged on for two decades and bring all its troops home.Also Read | India, Afghanistan to share experience, expertise in public service recruitmentThe meetings are also relevant because India has had virtually no say regarding the negotiations between the US and the Taliban since the signing of a so-called peace deal last year and no role in the “extended troika” meeting on Afghanistan that was convened by Russia on March 18.As the Trump administration pushed ahead with its talks with the Taliban, India had to be content with watching from the margins while carrying on with its vast development portfolio – with pledges of $3 billion, India is the largest regional investor in Afghanistan’s future – and making repeated calls that the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, and that any solution must also address New Delhi’s security concerns.However, even the strongest opponents of the Taliban are now veering around to the conclusion that any future dispensation that emerges in Kabul, thanks to the latest push by the Biden administration, will have to include the militant group that is viewed with deep suspicion in New Delhi because of its deep-rooted links with the military establishment in Rawalpindi.Insiders in Kabul say US secretary of state Antony Blinken resorted to the step of writing a letter to President Ashraf Ghani last month, outlining American plans for the new push for a political settlement, after conveying messages on five separate occasions regarding the need for the government in Kabul to act with more alacrity. This included two phone calls from Blinken to Ghani in January and February, but the insiders say these contacts didn’t elicit the response desired by the Afghans.There is also a feeling in some quarters in Kabul that New Delhi is uniquely placed, because of its influence with Ghani, to persuade the Afghan president to consider the American proposal – which includes a draft peace agreement that envisages a “transitional peace government”.So far, Ghani has shown little inclination to accept this American proposal. Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar said during his visit to India this week that any interim set-up would be a departure from the Constitution. He also said Ghani is ready to hold early presidential elections if the Taliban agree that elections are the only legitimate way to transfer power.Also Read | India, Afghanistan ink deal for new dam, PM Modi calls for immediate ceasefireBut insiders in Kabul note that Ghani’s shrinking popularity among the public could ultimately limit his role in the process that is currently being pushed by the US, and the Indian side could nudge him to play a more proactive role in shaping the end state.The most-tricky issues for India, however, remain forging closer links with all political players in Afghanistan and the question of opening a channel with the Taliban. The US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, argued last year that India should initiate a dialogue with the Taliban as it would help New Delhi to directly take up its terrorism-related concerns with the militant group.Though there was a nascent debate within Indian decision-making circles some time ago on whether to open a channel with the Taliban, this was set aside at the time of the 2019 general election because of concerns about New Delhi potentially engaging the Taliban leading to questions about the lack of a similar approach with the Kashmiris.Though the Biden administration might ultimately relent on its May 1 deadline for withdrawing all American troops from Afghanistan, thereby addressing some of the immediate security concerns of New Delhi about such a drastic drawdown energising India’s adversaries in Afghanistan, it is becoming increasingly clear that India will have to make some hard choices if it wants to have a seat among the players who will shape Afghanistan’s future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-will-finally-have-a-say-in-crucial-meetings-to-decide-afghan-future-101616650221948.html

25-03-2021||India||India logs 53,476 Covid-19 fresh cases, highest daily spike in 5 months||India’s cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) witnessed a jump of 53,476 in a day while the daily toll from the disease went up to 251, according to the data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday. This is the highest daily spike since October 23 last year when 54,366 fresh cases were recorded.The nation’s infection tally has soared past 11.78 million. The fatality count, which has been rising over the last few weeks, has gone up to 160,692.Following the grim figures since the last few weeks, the central government on Tuesday decided to open vaccination for everyone above 45 years of age from April 1.Adding to the worries, a novel variant of the Sars-Cov-2 has been detected in seven states, and especially in high numbers in Maharashtra, the health ministry said on Wednesday. The emergence of the new variant partially explains the surge in cases, experts said. Officials, however, have said that it may be too soon to arrive at a conclusion.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The variant carries mutations that include those denoted by the letters E484Q and L452R, which have separately been linked to making the virus spread more readily and defeat, to some extent, immunity from a vaccine or past infection.“The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs (variants of concerns),” the health ministry said in statment on Wednesday.The director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujeet Kumar said though 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “ data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”“Though VOCs and a new double mutant variant have been found in India, these have not been detected in numbers sufficient to either establish or direct relationship or explain the rapid increase in cases in some states. Genomic sequencing and epidemiological studies are continuing to further analyze the situation,” the government said.Other experts, however, have said that the possibility of a correlation is very high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-53-476-fresh-covid-19-cases-highest-daily-spike-in-5-months-101616645356869.html
25-03-2021||India||3 Rafale fighters landing next week, 9 more in April to add to IAF’s firepower||The Indian Air Force (IAF) is set to acquire more teeth with three more Rafale omni-role fighters on their way to Ambala early next week with another nine slated to land by mid-April from France. The Hasimara forward base in north Bengal will start operations with five fighters next month, people aware of the matter said.According to French and Indian diplomats, an IAF team has already reached Merignac airbase in Bordeaux to finalise the date for ferrying three Rafales to Ambala. The expected date is either March 30 or 31 with the fighters to be refuelled mid-air by French refuellers as per availability with a stop-over at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE.India ordered 36 planes from France (the equivalent of two squadrons with 18 jets each) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The IAF’s Ambala-based Golden Arrows Squadron has already inducted 11 Rafale jets between July 2020 and January 2021. These fighter jets have been operated in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China since early May 2020.Dassault Aviation has already handed over seven more fighters to the IAF for training in France and will deliver the remaining six Rafale jets after April to complete the delivery of 36 aircraft by end of this year.The aircraft carries a range of potent weapon systems including long-range Meteor missiles, HAMMER smart munition and SCALP cruise missile. The beyond visual range air-to-air Meteor missile is considered a game-changer by defence experts with undisclosed range well beyond 100 kilometres.Diplomats cited above said there was a remote possibility that IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, who will be on a bilateral visit to France around April 20-22, could flag off the nine fighters from Merignac airbase.The arrival of nine Rafales in April will complete the Ambala squadron with 18 aircraft. The second squadron at Hasimara forward base will be raised with five fighters. Although Hasimara is a front-line airbase for the fourth-generation-plus fighters in the eastern sector to keep a close eye on Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh borders with China, the fighters will be deployed all over the country, particularly north Assam.Air force officials said after the induction of Rafales in Hasimara, India’s eastern flank will enhance the strategic capability of the IAF with a C-130J Hercules squadron based at West Bengal’s Panagarh.National security planners are also pushing for the upgrade of Indian airbases in the eastern sector with more blast pens and surface-to-air missile cover given the rapid upgrade of Chinese infrastructure and military airbases all along the Line of Actual Control. An influential section within the military believes that IAF’s eastern air command, currently headquartered in salubrious climes of Shillong in Meghalaya, should be shifted closer to north Assam for rapid response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-rafale-fighters-landing-next-week-9-more-in-april-to-add-to-iaf-s-firepower-101616645122653.html
25-03-2021||India||India to temporary hold all big exports of AstraZeneca shot, including to COVAX: Report||India has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca coronavirus shot made by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine-maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise, two sources told Reuters.The move will also affect supplies to the GAVI/WHO-backed global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, through which 64 lower-income countries are supposed to get doses from SII, the programme's procurement and distributing partner UNICEF told Reuters."We understand that deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines to lower-income economies participating in the COVAX facility will likely face delays following a setback in securing export licences for further doses of Covid-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII), expected to be shipped in March and April," UNICEF said in an email."COVAX is in talks with the Government with a view to ensuring deliveries as quickly as possible."The foreign ministry and the SII did not reply to requests for comment.COVAX has so far received 17.7 million AstraZeneca doses from the SII, of the 60.5 million doses India has shipped in total, and many countries are relying on the programme to immunise their citizens.There have been no vaccine exports from India since Thursday, the foreign ministry's website shows, as the country expands its own immunisation effort."Everything else has taken a backseat, for the time being at least," said one of the sources. Both sources had direct knowledge of the matter, but declined to be named as the discussions are not public."No exports, nothing till the time the India situation stabilises. The government won't take such a big chance at the moment when so many need to be vaccinated in India."SOME DELAYS ALREADYThe SII has already delayed shipments of the AstraZeneca drug to Brazil, Britain, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. British authorities are in touch with New Delhi to get its second batch of 5 million doses ordered from SII.COVAX has a deal to buy 1.1 billion doses of the AstraZeneca and Novavax shots that the SII is making in bulk, mainly for low- and middle-income countries.UNICEF in Vietnam said in a statement on Wednesday that vaccine production issues had led to delays in deliveries to all countries that were due to receive vaccines through COVAX.UNICEF told Reuters that COVAX had informed participating countries they would receive lower than expected volumes in March of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot produced in South Korea."In line with the challenges of the current global supply environment, this is due to challenges the company faces in rapidly scaling up supply and optimising production processes for these early deliveries," it said.AstraZeneca has told COVAX it would make up for the delayed volumes in April and May, UNICEF said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet decided this week to widen its inoculation drive by including everyone above 45 from April 1, and many states battling a surge in infections have demanded that all adults be covered.With 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States and Brazil.Currently, only the elderly and those over 45 with other health conditions are eligible for vaccinations in India. Health and frontline workers were first in line when India began its drive in mid-January.India has so far administered more than 52 million doses, of which 47 million are the SII's locally-made version of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The rest is the COVAXIN vaccine developed in India by Bharat Biotech.The government has so far asked the SII to supply around 141 million doses. The company has also accounted for nearly all of India's vaccine exports.The SII plans to boost monthly production to 100 million doses from April/May, from up to 70 million now, Reuters reported earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-temporary-hold-all-big-exports-of-astrazeneca-shot-including-to-covax-report-101616644570298.html

Here is all you need to know about the detection and why it in part explains a surge in cases even as officials said it may be too soon to draw conclusions:• The variant carries mutations that include those denoted by E484Q and L452R, which have separately been linked to characteristics that make the virus spread more readily and defeat, to some extent, immunity from a vaccine or past infection.• Two of these, E484Q and L452R, have been seen as a combination in a variant the government described as “double mutant”.• It was found in a large number of samples, 206, in Maharashtra, which is in the grip of its worst wave of infections yet.• “These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs [variants of concern],” the Union health ministry said in a statement.• Sujeet Kumar, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said that while 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”• But other experts said the likelihood of a correlation is very high.• “If 20% of samples in states like Maharashtra have shown mutant variants, it is very likely that the surge in Covid-19 cases is being driven by these mutations,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologists.Also Read | Maharashtra, Mumbai see a record 31,855 and 5,190 new Covid-19 cases• The government also confirmed the discovery of a large number of people with the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Punjab (336 cases) and in the case of this variant too.• Delhi recorded the second-highest number of samples with this variant at 75.• The UK variant is one of three VOCs.• The other two were first seen in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1).• In all, 771 samples from 18 states have turned up positive for these VOCs.• Experts said the situation must now be closely watched, particularly in states where a large number of samples have the novel variant or the variants of concern.• On Wednesday, Maharashtra accounted for 60% of the 53,410 daily new cases in the country and Punjab 5% although cases here have risen sharply from a low base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-sars-cov-2-detected-in-india-what-it-could-mean-101616644581280.html
25-03-2021||India||Anil Deshmukh writes to Uddhav Thackeray to probe corruption charges against him||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, facing the opposition heat over corruption allegations, wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. Deshmukh shared the letter shortly after midnight on his Twitter handle in which he asked Thackeray to investigate the corrupt malpractices allegations levelled against him by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh."I have asked the chief minister to inquire into the allegations made against me by (former Police Commissioner of Mumbai) Param Bir Singh to bring out the truth," according to the translation of his tweet from Marathi.मी माननीय मुख्यमंत्री महोदय यांना परमबीर सिंग यांनी माझ्यावर जे आरोप केलेत त्याबद्दल चौकशी लावून, "दूध का दूध, पानी का पानी" करावे अशी मागणी केली होती. माननीय मुख्यमंत्री महोदयांनी याची चौकशी लावली तर, मी त्याचे स्वागत करीन.सत्यमेव जयते... pic.twitter.com/f2oJjFhO8A"If the chief minister inquires the matter, I would welcome it. Satyamev Jayate," he added. He said in the accompanying tweet that this will separate wheat from chaff.Also Watch: 'Action against Anil Deshmukh necessary,' says analystSingh wrote a letter to Thackeray last Saturday in which he accused Deshmukh of running a “money collection scheme” through the police. Singh said that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze - a cop arrested in connection with the Mukesh Ambani security threat case - to collect ₹100 crore a month from various establishments in Mumbai through extortion.Also Read: Supreme Court asks Param Bir Singh to move Bombay HCThough Deshmukh denied all the allegations, Singh's letter triggered a political storm in Maharashtra. The constituents of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi Alliance (MVA) - Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress - met for several rounds of meetings to find out a solution to the crisis.NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who has been the chief crisis manager for MVA, stood behind his party colleague Deshmukh; other NCP leaders ruled out Deshmukh's resignation. But the entire issue gave ammo to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which attacked the Thackeray government, demanding Deshmukh's resignation.The BJP attack is being led by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who met the Union home secretary and Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. While Fadnavis said he gave evidence on Deshmukh to the Union home secretary, the governor was asked to send a report to the Centre.Meanwhile, a senior MVA leader told Hindustan Times that the state government has decided to form a judicial commission to look into the allegations levelled against Deshmukh. The decision was taken in a meeting of senior ministers held at Varsha, official residence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, late on Wednesday evening, the minister added.An official announcement is likely to be made on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-desmukh-writes-to-uddhav-thackeray-to-probe-corruption-charges-against-him-101616643477692.html

Here is all you need to know about the submission:• It came during the court’s hearing of a plea moved by the NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) seeking stay on sale of electoral bonds from April 1 to 10 ahead of the assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, and Union Territory of Puducherry.• Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said the Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it.• The EC said it is also asking for transparency, which the court can consider later.Also Read | TMC calls on EC to create ‘level-playing field’ in West Bengal• Electoral bonds promise anonymity, with only the issuing bank, the state-owned State Bank of India being aware of the identity of the purchaser.• They were notified by the government in January 2018 and were first issued in March 2018.• A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde recorded the submission of EC and reserved orders on the application filed by ADR.• While doing so, the Court raised an apprehension of possible misuse of these bonds and the mechanism available with the Centre to remedy the situation.• This was not the main objection of the petitioner, who was objecting to the very use of the bonds, not their misuse.• Attorney General KK Venugopal appearing for Centre referred to certain checks and balances.• He said that parties are required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they have expended the money.• A political party can face deregistration if it is found to indulge in anti-national or illegal activities.• Venugopal said the use of bonds is essential for the country as it has curbed black money used in elections.• For the petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there was complete anonymity about who purchases these bonds and to whom they are subsequently transferred.• He read out an earlier affidavit filed by EC in March 2019 where it raised concerns over a lack of transparency in tracking political party donations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-supports-electoral-bonds-seeks-transparency-what-its-submission-to-sc-says-101616642421301.html
25-03-2021||India||Rain, thunderstorm likely over central India today, says IMD||Widespread rain and thunderstorm activity is likely over central and west India today followed by rain and thunderstorms over the western Himalayan region, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).A cyclonic circulation is lying over Madhya Maharashtra and its neighbourhood and there is another cyclonic circulation over southeast Madhya Pradesh. Under their influence, isolated rainfall with thunderstorm and lightning is likely over east Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Maharashtra , Marathwada, Konkan and Goa today. Also Read | MP, UP sign Ken-Betwa pact: Here’s why it alarmed environmentalistsA fresh Western Disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region from March 27. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or snowfall with thunderstorm and lightning is likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and thunderstorm, lightning, hail and gusty winds are likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan and Muzaffarabad. The maximum temperatures are likely to rise by 4-6 degrees Celsius (°C) over northwest India and by 3-4°C over west India after 48 hours.Meanwhile, the cooling effect of La Niña, a global weather pattern, has started waning, according to the IMD, which said that it may completely turn neutral during April, resulting in a harsh summer.La Niña is associated with the cooling of Pacific waters. A La Niña year generally receives good rainfall and temperatures are lower than normal.“La Niña is often associated with lower temperatures in India. But that is now unlikely during the rest of the summer and monsoon months. But the actual weather conditions will depend on local synoptic features. For example, the interaction of westerlies and easterlies over central India is currently causing thunderstorm activity and temperatures have dropped. But overall, we can say La Niña will phase out gradually,” said DS Pai, senior climate scientist at IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-thunder-likely-over-central-india-todayimd-101616641041173.html
25-03-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear petition seeking to stop deportation of Rohingya refugees||The Supreme Court will on Thursday hear a petition seeking release and protection of over 150 Rohingya refugees in Jammu and Kashmir. The union territory's administration has said it will work on their deportation to Myanmar.The petition will be heard by a bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. Last week, the bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to come with a response to the plea.The intervention application has been filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, through advocate Prashant Bhushan. It also seeks direction to Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) to the Rohingyas in the informal camps.The plea said that it is filed to protect rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21, read with Article 51(c) of the Constitution, against the deportation of Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India after escaping widespread violence and discrimination against their community in their home country Myanmar.It sought direction to the Union government to refrain from implementing any orders on deporting the Rohingya refugees, who have been detained in Jammu. “There is a military government in Myanmar now. Their life is under threat,” said Bhushan, requesting an urgent hearing of the plea. He was referring to the latest military coup in Myanmar in February.According to official documents from the office of deputy commissioner of Jammu, there are 6,523 Rohingya in Jammu, the petitioner said.The Jammu & Kashmir administration began the process of identifying undocumented immigrants on March 6. Over 150 of them were sent to a holding centre under the Foreigners Act. Officials insisted due process of law was followed and added the immigrants sent to the centre did not carry any valid travel documents.Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar since 2017 to escape persecution and many of them have been staying in the union territory. The UN has called a Myanmar army’s campaign against the Rohingya “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.On January 10, last year, the top court had said that it would hear in detail, a batch of pleas challenging the Centre's decision to deport illegal Rohingya Muslim immigrants to Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-petition-seeking-to-stop-deportation-of-rohingyas-101616640748213.html

This variant, the ministry said on Wednesday, has been detected in seven states, including Maharashtra which has been witnessing a second wave of the infection.The "double mutant" variant was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three "variants of concern" - first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, the ministry said at its briefing about the Covid-19 situation in the country.The ministry, however, said it could not be sufficiently established yet if these variants were behind the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in some states.Here is everything you need to know about this variant:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-sars-cov-2-found-all-you-need-to-know-about-it-101616638608245.html
25-03-2021||India||India likely to delay Covax vaccine supplies for March, April, says Unicef||India will likely delay deliveries of AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine doses to the GAVI/WHO-backed COVAX facility for March and April, the programme's procurement and distributing partner Unicef told Reuters early on Thursday."We understand that deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines to lower-income economies participating in the COVAX Facility will likely face delays following a setback in securing export licenses for further doses of COVID-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII), expected to be shipped in March and April," Unicef said in an email."COVAX is in talks with the Government of India with a view to ensuring deliveries as quickly as possible."Reuters reported on Wednesday that India had put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca shot made by SII, the world’s biggest vaccine-maker, to meet domestic demand as infections rise.Unicef also said that Covax participant countries have also been told about lower-than-expected supplies of AstraZeneca doses made in South Korea for March."In line with the challenges of the current global supply environment, this is due to challenges the company faces in rapidly scaling up supply and optimizing production processes for these early deliveries," Unicef said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-delay-covax-vaccine-supplies-for-march-april-says-unicef-101616633210574.html
25-03-2021||India||Delhiwale: Greenhouse getaway||Some birds, some cats, a few trees, a few graves, and absolute quietude. Spending five minutes here is enough to secede from the life of everyday. Duties, concerns, plans, worries, prospects, and all other trains of daily thoughts dissolve into silent air.Such is the magic of the place. It is a spacious courtyard tucked deep inside the congested Walled City. There must be many private courtyards and rooftops in the area with such calmly ambience, but this is one of the few that is accessible to all. The way to it passes through narrow crowded noisy lanes, but once you enter the door, you are abruptly transported into an oasis.The courtyard is home to a little-known Sufi shrine. It has about a dozen graves and looks like a miniature qabristan, or cemetery. Its very existence must be the reason behind the neighbourhood’s name in which it is situated—Mohalla Qabristan.This afternoon, every element of the courtyard is conspiring to add to the extraordinary serenity. With one distracting exception. The entire place is painted in light green. All the wall, all the graves. This specific beauty is keeping the senses in suspended excitement. In some places, the green is splashed about in differing hues, possibly because the painter applied varying number of brush strokes. That makes the view more enchanting, as if one was gazing upon some sort of modern art.The Sufi shrine lies on a lower level. The staircase leading to it is also painted green. The few graves over there are in green too. Some of them are at level with the ground. Leaves have fallen around them.One wonders about the people buried here. A man emerges, informing that these are centuries-old resting spots, and that burials no longer take place here. He explained that the green paint was applied recently to celebrate a festivity concerning the Sufi mystic, whom he addresses as Peer Baba.Soon afterwards he goes away, and the place is again still, returning to a quietness that feels extraordinarily fragile and thus doubly intense.Try coming alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-greenhouse-getaway-101616632562185.html
25-03-2021||India||Experts call for curbs as Capital adds 1,254 Covid cases, 6 deaths||The Capital set yet another record of single-day new infections for the year, as 1,254 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Wednesday, even as health experts urged the Delhi government to reintroduce some curbs on social gatherings and public places to prevent the outbreak from again spiralling out of control with the festive season days away.The seven-day average of new cases, or case trajectory, has now more than doubled in just one week, clearly marking the start of Delhi’s fourth wave of Covid – on average, 886 new cases were reported every day in the past week, against 428 cases a day a week ago.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday banned public celebrations during Holi, Navaratri and Shab-e-Baraat. Experts on Wednesday also called for barring or restricting non-essential activities.“There are some essential activities like going to hospitals or going to banks. All other activities should be stopped,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the chairman of the PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care.Wednesday’s case-spike was Delhi’s highest in 96 days, with the city last adding more infections (1,418) on December 18.The Covid-19 test positivity rate also maintained its steady rise, climbing to 1.52% on Wednesday. While the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a number below 5% for an infection to be considered under control, the positivity rate in the Capital has risen consistently over the past two weeks, which experts have warned could be an indicator that cases may skyrocket soon.“Large weddings and get-togethers are not essential. Going to restaurants and pubs is not essential. These should be restricted before cases spread further. Yes, there will be economic consequences, but it will save lives,” said Dr Khilnani.He also urged people not to take the infection lightly, adding that hospital beds reserved to treat Covid-19 patients had begun to fill up again.“There is a belief among people that cases now are mostly mild. This is absolutely not true. We are seeing many severe patients who have to be admitted to the intensive care unit and be given high oxygen support. At our hospital, wards that had been declared non-Covid had to be opened up again because of the surge in cases,” he said.The number of hospitalisations in Delhi crossed the 1,000-mark on Wednesday for the first time since January 21, with city hospitals treating 1,063 persons with Covid-19 as on Tuesday night. The number of active cases has inched closer to 5,000, with 4,890 in the city currently infected.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the virology department at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, said, “A total lockdown may not be possible and isn’t necessary. However, sensible restrictions will help. If everybody wears a mask in public, 50% of the problem is gone. If they can avoid crowds where they are touching other people, 20% of the problem is solved. So, instead of closing shops and supermarkets, the people there must be trained to ensure hand hygiene before people go in and after they come out. They need to check the customers for masks and social distancing.”Travel from neighbouring states could also be adding to Delhi’s caseload, he warned.“Delhi has a huge floating population. Many come to Delhi to find work. It is also a hub for international travel. Being the Capital, all official work is also done here. This movement adds to the number of cases. I have seen instances where one person in the family travelled to a neighbouring state and everyone else in the family got the infection later on,” said Dr Khilnani.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Tuesday directed the administration to conduct random tests at airport, railway stations and interstate bus terminals on people coming from affected states such as Maharashtra.Experts also called for expediting vaccinations to stem the rise in cases. “We need to increase the pace of vaccinations. This will help curb deaths among the old and those with comorbidities,” said Dr John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-call-for-curbs-as-capital-adds-1-254-covid-cases-6-deaths-101616629135656.html
25-03-2021||India||Supreme Court sets 45-day deadline for resolution plan||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed fresh consideration of resolution plans for the debt-ridden Jaypee Group within 45 days, saying no new expression of interest will be entertained for taking over the firm and only state-owned NBCC and Suraksha Realty may file revised proposals, giving new hope for the completion of about 22,000 pending flats in Noida and Greater Noida.The apex court remitted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) the issue of approval of the resolution plan.For about 22,000 homebuyers who have invested in the Jaypee Group’s housing projects and are still awaiting possession of their flats, the judgment has heightened hopes of an early resolution, even as there is no end in sight to the corporate insolvency resolution procedure (CIRP) of Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), pending before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) since 2017.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, in its 375-page judgment, said: “We are conscious of the requirements of the discipline of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and would hasten to observe that the course which is being adopted is in the complex and peculiar features of this case but, this repeat exercise concerning the CIRP of JIL cannot be an unending process and needs to be taken to its logical conclusion.”In exercise of its extraordinary powers under Article 142, the apex court directed NBCC and Suraksha Realty to submit fresh resolution plans in two weeks and directed the Committee of Creditors (which also has homebuyers) to consider it and submit a report to the adjudicating authority within an extended period of 45 days beginning Wednesday.Since August 2017, when JIL went into the insolvency process after NCLT admitted the application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium, this is the fourth round of litigation which has been decided by the apex court. On March 3 last year, NCLT approved NBCC’s bid to acquire JIL through the insolvency process and complete over 20,000 pending flats over the next three and half years. The order was, however, challenged in the appellate tribunal NCLAT and later in the Supreme Court.NCLAT had asked NBCC to implement its proposal to acquire debt-ridden JIL and complete over 20,000 pending flats, but said that its direction was subject to its final order.Last year, the Supreme Court withdrew to itself all matters pending before the NCLT and NCLAT after NBCC objected to modification in its resolution plan by the NCLT, which was later challenged by it before NCLAT. The court heard NBCC, homebuyers and other stakeholders, including the Jaypee Group, before reserving order on the way forward in October 2020.Homebuyers said that after a long wait, the order passed by the court was not on expected lines. “After so many months, we expected the court to give us a solution. The court held that ₹750 crore deposited by Jaypee Associates Limited could not be part of the resolution plan of NBCC as it was property of JAL. They should have ordered the same to be given towards construction of JAL housing projects,” said Arvind Verma, president of Knight Court Social Welfare Association, a housing project of JAL.

25-03-2021||India||Sad day, says Kejriwal as NCT bill is approved||The ruling Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi on Wednesday called it a “black day” for the Indian democracy as Parliament passed a bill seeking to give overarching powers to the Delhi lieutenant governor over the elected government and the assembly.The Rajya Sabha passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 on Wednesday. The Lok Sabha passed the legislation on Monday. The bill will now be sent for the President’s approval before it becomes a law.Chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal called it a sad day for the Indian democracy, but added that work in Delhi will neither stop nor slow down. “RS passes GNCTD amendment Bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “fears Kejriwal”.“It is a black day for Indian democracy. The rights of the government elected by the people of Delhi have been snatched away and put in the hands of the lieutenant governor. Look at the irony - Parliament, which is the temple of democracy, was chosen for the murder of democracy. The people of Delhi will fight against this dictatorship,” Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.As constitutional experts and senior government officials said the bill will impact day-to-day governance in the city and functioning of the Delhi assembly, the AAP said it may move the Supreme Court against the bill.The passage of the bill comes at a time when the Delhi government is planning to bring in fundamental reforms to excise rules in the Capital and roll out an ambitious scheme to provide ration under the public distribution scheme at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries.AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said the bill was an unconditional attempt to make the Delhi government “administratively impotent”. “The GNCT of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 is an unconstitutional attempt to make Delhi government ‘administratively impotent’ by a political party that has been made ‘electorally impotent’ by the people of Delhi,” he said.According to the bill, “government” in the national capital would mean the “Lieutenant Governor” in context of any law to be made by the legislative assembly.Replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy sought to dispel the concerns of the opposition members saying the amendments in the Act will create a sound government mechanism in the NCT of Delhi.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha, however, said the bill suffers from serious constitutional infirmities.“It seeks to nullify the July 2018 decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. It is against the law laid down by the Supreme Court. The definition of the government can only be the elected government,” he said. Senior government officials said once the bill becomes an Act, L-G Anil Baijal will have the power to call for any file of the Delhi government.A senior official said after the bill becomes law, it will cause increased friction between the legislature and executive.“This is because the amendment states that not just decisions of the council of ministers, but the opinion of the L-G will have to be sought on the decision taken by every minister. Delhi has seven ministers, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and each of them issues dozens of orders/directives daily. The back-and-forth of files will only delay projects,” the official said. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta welcomed the passing of the bill, saying it will help improve administration in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-day-says-kejriwal-as-nct-bill-is-approved-101616628061951.html
25-03-2021||India||India rejects Pakistan's objections over hydro projects||India has rejected Pakistan’s objections to the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir and said both of them comply with the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.This was conveyed to the Pakistani side during a two-day meeting of the permanent Indus commission that concluded in the Indian capital on Wednesday. This was the first meeting of the commission in more than two-and-half years.Pakistan has for long objected to the construction of the Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai projects on tributaries of the Chenab river, saying their designs are not in line with the treaty.“Discussions continued on designs of...Pakal Dul (1,000 MW) and Lower Kalnai (48 MW). Indian side held that these projects are fully compliant with the provisions of the [Indus Waters] Treaty and provided technical data in support of its position,” said a statement issued by the external affairs ministry.The Pakal Dul project is being built on Marusadar river, a tributary of the Chenab in Kishtwar district. Lower Kalnai is being built on another tributary of the same river.The Pakistani side also requested that India should share information on the design of other hydropower projects being planned. The Indian side “assured that the information will be supplied as and when required to be supplied under the provisions of the Treaty”, the statement said.The statement described the meeting as “cordial manner” and said India’s Indus water commissioner Pradeep Kumar Saxena and his Pakistani counterpart Mehr Ali Shah “reaffirmed their commitment to interact more frequently in an attempt to resolve the issues by bilateral discussions under the Treaty”.The two sides also agreed to hold the next meeting of the permanent Indus commission in Pakistan on mutually convenient dates.The treaty specifies that the waters of the three eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Sutlej) have been allocated exclusively to India. The western rivers (Indus, Chenab and Jhelum) are allocated to Pakistan, with India given rights such as agriculture, navigation, domestic use and unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations.Under the provisions of the Indus Waters Treaty, which was brokered by the World Bank and signed by the two countries in 1960, the two commissioners are required to meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan.The last meeting of the permanent Indus commission was held in Lahore in August 2018. The current talks were held against the backdrop of a thaw in bilateral ties, which had taken a hit after the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing.The meeting wasn’t held last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last month, the Indian and Pakistani militaries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, raising hopes for further improvements in bilateral relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pakistan-s-objections-over-hydro-projects-101616627503496.html
25-03-2021||India||UAPA slapped on Sachin Vaze in Antilia case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has invoked sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), an anti-terror law, against Sachin Vaze, the Mumbai Police assistant inspector who is the main accused in the Antilia explosives case. NIA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after interrogating Vaze for the past 12 days, speaking to several Mumbai Police officers and witnesses, and analysing technical evidence, they have managed to piece together the sequence of events behind the case that has caught the nation’s attention.NIA has used sections 16 and 18 of the anti-terror law against Vaze, claiming that an individual/or group of persons planning such a conspiracy can be booked under terror charges. The two sections deal with conspiring to commit a terror act. It will now seek Vaze’s further custody under UAPA on March 26, when he is produced in court.On February 25, a green Scorpio was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in south Mumbai. It contained a bag with 20 loose sticks of gelatin (with no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani. NIA took over the probe into the explosives case on March 9 and arrested him on March 13.Officials said the agency has established that the conspiracy was planned by Vaze as his “comeback” case. HT reported on March 17, citing unnamed NIA officials, that Vaze orchestrated the incident to prove his worth to the police top brass. NIA officials claimed he wanted to regain his lost reputation due to a suspension in 2004, related to a custodial death. Vaze was only reinstated in 2020, after an alliance of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party, and the Congress (the MVA or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) came to power. And he tripped up, the officials contended, because of his overconfidence.Sharing details, one NIA officer said, “As part of his plan to produce a sensational case in Mumbai and then solve it in record time, the arrested assistant police inspector, who was in charge of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), asked businessman Mansukh Hiran to leave his Scorpio on the highway on February 17.”Hiran, an auto parts dealer, was previously known to Vaze, who had borrowed the same vehicle between November and the first week of February. Investigations have revealed that Vaze used to borrow cars, especially luxury vehicles, from dealers.“Hiran, after leaving the car on Mulund-Airoli Road, met Vaze near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus the same day, and handed over the keys as asked by the officer. Vaze then asked Hiran to lodge a complaint (of a missing car) with the police, which Hiran filed on February 18,” the first officer said.From February 17 till February 25, the Scorpio was with Vaze and his associates in CIU, investigations revealed.On February 25, a second NIA investigator said, Vaze and a constable of CIU went in a convoy of two cars — the Scorpio and an Innova — to Carmichael Road around 2:20am to drop the Scorpio, laden with gelatin sticks, near Ambani’s residence, Antilia. A threat letter, addressed to Ambani and his wife, had already been placed beforehand in the vehicle. “Vaze and the constable took turns to drive Scorpio and then they returned in the Innova,” the officer said.“But, around 4.30am, Vaze returned to the spot to check the Scorpio as he thought he had left his identity card in it by mistake,” the second officer added. This visit, NIA officials said, has been established by CCTV footage from Mulund toll naka, where the Innova can be seen re-entering Mumbai from Thane around 4am after leaving the city about half-an-hour earlier.NIA officials said the agency will likely make the constable, whom they did not name, a witness rather than charge him in conspiracy. They added that the constable has confirmed the role of Vaze in the conspiracy.Once he was made the investigating officer of the case, Vaze asked Hiran to take the rap, but the latter demurred, said a third NIA officer.NIA officials believe that Vaze’s plan was to create some link between Hiran (once he confessed) and some Pakistani terror group or suspect, to make it look like a conspiracy planned by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. The officials admitted that this remains a theory that is yet to be proved.The NIA officials said they cannot comment on Hiran’s murder — his body was found in a creek on March 5— because the Maharashtra Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) is yet to hand over the case. ATS, which on Wednesday was asked to do so by a Thane court, claims to have solved the case. At a press conference on Tuesday, ATS said that Vaze was the “mastermind” behind the murder, which was carried out by Naresh Gor (a bookie) and Vinayak Shinde (former constable).NIA officials said they have Vaze’s call records, showing multiple calls to and from with Hiran in February and much before that. They also claim to have his location data, his presence at various locations as seen in CCTV footage, and testimony from witnesses.NIA officials said the agency is still probing the role of officers from CIU and Mumbai Police in general, including assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, a close associate of Vaze in CIU who has already been questioned, and others.The officials added that their investigation has revealed the influence Vaze, a former encounter specialist (a colloquialism used to describe policemen who shoot down gangsters in encounters, real and staged) enjoyed in Mumbai Police — far in excess of what an assistant inspector usually would. Vaze, a member of the Shiv Sena, made no effort to hide either his pelf (he used to occasionally drive to work in a Mercedes SUV that has been seized by NIA), or his power (he was close to several politicians, and former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh).Tracking Vaze, NIA has also found CCTV footage from several five-star hotels where the policeman used to stay for days on end. NIA officials say he made a lump sum payment of ₹13 lakh to one of the hotels for a total of 100-days stay. “We have information this hotel and others were used for illegal financial dealings of Vaze and extortion activities,” the second NIA officer said.Vaze has given misleading answers to NIA for the past 12 days and has claimed that he is being framed by his rivals in Mumbai Police. He is also yet to disclose where he got the gelatin sticks from.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uapa-slapped-on-sachin-vaze-in-antilia-case-101616627178879.html
25-03-2021||India||‘Double mutant’ variant of virus found as cases hit 53,000||India has detected a novel variant of the Sars-Cov-2 in seven states, and especially in high numbers in Maharashtra, the health ministry said on Wednesday, a discovery that experts said could, in part, explain a surge in cases although officials said it may be too soon to draw conclusions.India recorded 53,410 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest since October 23.The variant carries mutations that include those denoted by the letters E484Q and L452R, which have separately been linked to characteristics that make the virus spread more readily and defeat, to some extent, immunity from a vaccine or past infection.Two of these, E484Q and L452R, have been seen as a combination in a variant the government described as “double mutant”. It was found in a large number of samples, 206, in Maharashtra, which is in the grip of its worst wave of infections yet. “These mutations have been found in about 15-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued VOCs,” the ministry said in a statement. VOCs refers to variants of concern.The director of the National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujeet Kumar said at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19 later in the day, that while 206 samples from Maharashtra had the new variant, “ data does not allow for us to make a direct correlation yet for the rise in cases.”Also read: How bad is the current wave of Covid in India?But other experts said the likelihood of a correlation is very high. “If 20% of samples in states like Maharashtra have shown mutant variants, it is very likely that the surge in Covid-19 cases is being driven by these mutations,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologists.The officials at the briefing also said that samples from six more states recorded this variant, with Delhi having the next highest numbers at 9.The government also confirmed the discovery of large number of people with the UK variant (B.1.1.7) in Punjab (336 cases) and in the case of this variant too, Delhi recorded the second-highest number of samples with this variant at 75. The UK variant is one of three VOCs. The other two were first seen in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). In all, 771 samples from 18 states have turned up positive for these VOCs. “Since INSACOG initiated its work, 771 variants of concerns (VOCs) have been detected in a total of 10787 positive samples shared by States/UTs. These include 736 samples positive for viruses of the UK (B.1.1.7) lineage. 34 samples were found positive for viruses of the South African (B.1.351) lineage. 1 sample was found positive for viruses of the Brazilian (P.1) lineage. The samples with these VOCs have been identified in 18 States of the country,” the health ministry said. INSACOG stands for Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia.Officials who asked not to be named said most of these were of people who came back from other countries and their contacts. In Punjab, CM Amarinder Singh said on Tuesday that most of the B.1.1.7 variants (326 out of 336) were found in samples taken from the community.“Mutations in viruses occur naturally. It is a law of nature and we should per se not panic. We should remember if the virus does not replicate, it will not mutate — hence, the way to combat mutations is to suppress the chain of transmission,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, during the briefing.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine drive faces uphill battle against fresh waveExperts said the situation must now be closely watched, particularly in states where a large number of samples have the novel variant or the variants of concern. On Wednesday, Maharashtra accounted for 60% of the 53,410 daily new cases in the country and Punjab, 5%, although cases here have risen sharply from a low base.Kang warned variants can have an impact on vaccine efficacy. “Vaccines may not be quite as effective against variants that are capable of immune escape, but it is very unlikely that vaccines will not protect at all against severe disease. We will have some protection from either prior infection and vaccination.”An expert associated with the Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 response said the state is monitoring the variant’s impact closely. “It will become a cause for grave concern if mortality begins to increase. Presently mortality figures are considerably stable,” said this person, asking not to be named.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said, “Presence of a variant of concern or suspected variant of concern does not automatically mean that they are causing the outbreak, but rather suggest caution and implementation of public health measures for containment. It is of course concerning, so these measures are being taken in parallel with investigations into the transmissibility, inhibition by antibodies of recovered people and inhibition by antibodies of vaccinated people, of such variants.”Experts have long called for increasing genomic sequencing. The Indian consortium of labs under INSACOG carrying out genomic sequencing targeted 5% of all positive cases to be analysed beginning January, but, at a little under 11,000 , this number is short of the at least 48,000 it should have been, based on the number of 966,376 cases recorded between January 1 and March 23.“The volume (of genomic sequencing) has been increased, I would say exponentially, in the past three months. Before INSACOG was established, we had sequenced 3,000 positive samples, which has gone up to about 11,000 now. It will obviously increase as we go on from here,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan at the briefing.The Sars-Cov-2 virus was seen to be picking up about two mutations a month. But in mid-December, authorities in UK announced they had found a new variant with an unusually high number (17) of mutations and appeared to be spreading at a faster rate because it was more infective.Later analyses showed this variant, which is regarded to get its most serious characteristic from the mutation N501Y, had a transmission advantage that was 0.4-0.7 times more than the predominant variant. This increase may seem minuscule but could lead to a significantly wider outbreak – as it eventually did in the UK, which struggled to bring down cases despite a lockdown over most of the winter.On Wednesday, the government did not disclose how many other mutations are in the variant that has the E484Q and L452R. The two mutations occur on the spike protein, the portion of the virus that latches onto human cells and enters it.The South African and the Brazilian variants both contain the E484K mutation. L452R is a mutation linked to a fast-spreading variant in California, US.(with inputs from Eeshanpriya MS in Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-variant-of-virus-found-as-cases-hit-53000-101616626775259.html
25-03-2021||India||Stalkers convicted of murdering Nikita Tomar||A fast-track court in Faridabad on Wednesday held two men, Touseef and Rehaan, guilty of murder in the Nikita Tomar case within five months of the incident that shocked the National Capital Region and brought women’s safety into sharp focus.Tomar was shot dead at point blank range in broad daylight right outside her college in Faridabad by the men who were stalking her, with the shooting captured in CCTV footage.The court of additional sessions judge Sartaj Baswana convicted the two of murder, kidnapping, homicide and conspiracy. The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Friday, said advocate Adal Singh Rawat, counsel for the victim’s family. Prime accused Touseef was also held guilty under the Arms Act. However, Azruddin, the third accused in the case, who allegedly supplied the murder weapon, was acquitted.The 21-year-old victim was shot dead on October 26, leading to her family alleging that the murder was linked to “love jihad” as Touseef had been stalking her, pressuring her to marry him and change her religion. “Love jihad” is a term popularised by right-wing groups alleging a conspiracy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into marriage for the purpose of changing their religion.The court on Wednesday found Touseef and Rehaan guilty under Sections 302, 366, 511, 120B/34 of the IPC. Touseef was also convicted under Section 27/1 of the Arms Act.Faridabad police tweeted the timeline of the case and the verdict issued by the court with the hashtag “#justicefornikita”.“Nikita Tomar murder (26/10/2020, accused Touseef arrested the same evening, 27/10/2020 Rehaan arrested, 28/10/2020 Azruddin arrested, 6/11/2020 challan produced in court, 24/3/2021 verdict announced, 26/3/2021 sentence to be pronounced,” the tweet said. Asked to comment on the case, a spokesperson for Faridabad Police said an official statement would be released on Friday after the sentencing.During the course of hearing by the fast-track court, production of evidence started on December 1. The counsel for the victim’s family said 55 witnesses were produced by the prosecution while two were produced by the defence. The court heard the case twice a week and after holding arguments on March 22 and March 23, announced the verdict on March 24.The family of the victim expressed satisfaction at the verdict and demanded that the accused be given maximum punishment for the crime. “The investigation conducted by the police and the speed with which the case was heard by the fast-track court has ensured justice for Nikita,” said Rawat, counsel for the family and also a maternal uncle of the victim.The failed abduction bid and subsequent murder of the young woman was caught on CCTV cameras. The footage showed Touseef and Rehaan trying to push Tomar into their car as she stepped out of Aggarwal College after writing an exam. The footage also showed that as the accused could not push Tomar into the car due to her resistance, Touseef shot at her and escaped with his accomplice.Fingerprints of the accused were matched during the investigation from three samples that included the getaway car, the pistol used for the murder, and the woman’s arm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalkers-convicted-of-murdering-nikita-tomar-101616626262972.html
25-03-2021||India||Parliament passes law on greater power to Delhi LG||Parliament on Wednesday cleared controversial legal amendments that effectively hand executive powers over to Delhi’s lieutenant governor from the city-state’s legislative assembly, following angry protests and a walkout by several opposition parties.The National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, cleared with an 83-45 vote in Rajya Sabha, says that “government” in Delhi will now refer to the L-G in the context of all laws passed in Delhi, and the opinion of the L-G will be mandatory before any executive action is taken. The bill was approved by Lok Sabha on Monday.The bill was cleared by the Upper House following several hours of heated debate, followed by a division of votes demanded by the Opposition. The Biju Janata Dal, YSR Congress and Samajwadi Party opposed the bill, but walked out in protest. The Congress walked out after the division of votes.“I would like to tell the people of Delhi and the whole country that we have full belief in the Constitution. We did not bring this bill to create problems for the Delhi govt... I request every member to support the Bill unequivocally,” MoS G Krishna Reddy said in the Rajya Sabha.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was a “sad day for Indian democracy”.“RS passes GNCTD amendment bill. Sad day for Indian democracy. We will continue our struggle to restore power back to people. Whatever be the obstacles, we will continue doing good work. Work will neither stop nor slow down,” he tweeted.Opposition parties, including the Congress, said the proposed legislation was unconstitutional and demanded it be referred to a select committee for scrutiny.Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it is “most unconstitutional bill” which the House has ever received and went on to say that “even the Delhi BJP should join us in opposing this”. “Make no mistake, friends, this is not about AAP, or Congress or BJP. It’s about the fundamentals of federalism...,” he said, and alleged that the current regime at Centre was engaged into “coercive federalism”.Reddy rejected the criticism. “We’re making amendments to the Act brought in by Congress in 1991. These are not new. We are bringing these amendments to ensure that Delhi Govt functions properly,” he said.The provisions of the bill say “before taking any executive action... the opinion of Lieutenant Governor... shall be obtained on all such matters as may be specified, by a general or special order”, and that the “legislative assembly shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration or conduct inquiries”.It also adds that “...and any of the rule made in contravention of this proviso before the commencement of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021, shall be void” -- effectively nullifying the assembly committees.The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, and triggered anger at the time as well. On Wednesday, amid protests by the Opposition, the House was briefly adjourned twice in the second half.Opposing the bill, Aam Aadmi Party member Sanjay Singh said the BJP government at the Centre has brought the bill as the party lost the Delhi assembly elections twice. He said he was seeking “justice” for the 20 million people of Delhi.BJP’s Bhupinder Yadav said the bill is important to strengthen federalism and that the L-G, “who is the rightful head of the state government will be able to take timely decision, thanks to this bill”. He criticised the AAP government for not being able to curb pollution, while claiming that Delhi’s fight against Covid-19 “was fought by the central government when the state gave up” -- sparking protests by the opposition.After Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh asked if the motion on the bill could be adopted, the opposition sought a division of votes.Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge announced that the Congress will stage a walkout to oppose the bill. “If you make LG the government (of Delhi state) what is the need for elections. And also there is no need then for representatives to chose chief minister. This (bill) is against the Constitution,” he said.Members from Trinamool Congress and Shiv Sena, too, protested the legislation.BJD’s Prasanna Acharya said the Centre should have held wider consultations. “My party does not want to be a party to this bill. We are staging a peaceful walkout,” he said. P Wilson of DMK termed the bill as “blot on the Constitution”. He cautioned that it would be stayed by courts even if it is passed by Parliament. SP’s VP Nishad and CPI-M’s Jharna Das Baidya too said the bill was unconstitutional and RJD’s Manoj Jha said his party was opposing the proposed law “on constitutional parameter and moral principles”.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha, said the bill suffers from serious constitutional infirmities.“It seeks to nullify the July 2018 decision of the constitution Bench of the Supreme Court without changing the basis of that decision. It is against the law laid down by the Supreme Court. The definition of the government can only be the elected government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-law-on-greater-power-to-delhi-lg-101616625866549.html
25-03-2021||India||Court summons P Chidambaram and Karti in INX Media case||A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram and eight others on April 7 taking cognizance of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) charge sheet in connection with their alleged role in the INX Media money laundering case.Special judge MK Nagpal said that there were sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused including Karti’s chartered accountant S S Bhaskararaman, Peter Mukerjea and six firms including INX Media and INX News.The charge sheet by the ED was filed under section 3 (money laundering) read with section 70 (offences by companies), which is punishable under section 4 (punishment) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).According to the ED’s charge sheet, the first instalment of illegal gratification of ₹3,08,62,044­, in furtherance of criminal conspiracy, was allegedly paid by INX Media to M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL) and two other shell companies beneficially owned or controlled by Karti, namely M/s Kriya FMCG Distributors Pvt Ltd (Kriya) and M/s CBN Placement and Management Centre (CBNPMC) and this amount was paid during the year 2007-08 through the companies named SpanFibre and M/s Satyam Fibre (India) Pvt Ltd (Satyam Fibre).“Thus, in view of the background and after going through the contents of this complaint and the documents referred to therein and being relied upon in support of the allegations contained in complaint, I find sufficient material and grounds for proceeding further in the matter against all the 10 accused persons named in the complaint, out of which six accused are companies, for commission of offence under section 3 read with section 70 of the PMLA, which is punishable under section 4 of the Act,” the judge said in his order.The ED’s case arises out of a complaint registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) where it had contended that P Chidambaram had “misused his official position”, in conspiracy with his son Karti and others, in granting approval to a FDI proposal of INX Media and INX News Pvt Ltd in lieu of “illegal gratification” in India and through offshore payments. The CBI registered an FIR on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as the Union finance minister. Subsequently, the ED had lodged the money-laundering case.Both Chidambaram and his son Karti are currently on bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-summons-p-chidambaram-and-karti-in-inx-media-case-101616624804764.html
25-03-2021||India||MJ Akbar moves Delhi High Court against acquittal of Priya Ramani||The Delhi high court will hear on Thursday an appeal by former Union minister MJ Akbar against the dismissal of his criminal defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani.A single judge bench of justice Mukta Gupta will hear Akbar’s petition that has challenged the February 17 decision of a city court, clearing Ramani of defamation charges for her allegations of sexual harassment against him.The appeal, filed by Karanjawala & Co, has referred to portions of the trial court’s judgment which admitted in one part that the content referred to by Akbar was “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .Akbar has sought to highlight that once the trial court held that the content was defamatory in nature, there was a duty cast upon the trial judge to explain what exactly Ramani opted as her defence to this charge, and how her defence was accepted.It has further pointed out that the trial court dismissed Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar and rest were about other male bosses since the article did not mark any distinction but failed to explain why she was not held culpable.Further, Akbar questioned the trial court’s verdict for accepting Ramani’s defence when she called an incorrect tweet by her about resignation by Akbar as an “honest mistake”. The appeal said the trial court did not analyse the evidence in this regard nor did it assess the impact of the wrong post on his reputation.On February 17, the trial court judgment had held that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”.It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the article, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.In the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case.Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister after the allegations surfaced, and sued Ramani for defamation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mj-akbar-moves-delhi-high-court-against-acquittal-of-priya-ramani-101616624808839.html
25-03-2021||India||Amit Shah promises action as row over nuns’ harassment in UP intensifies||Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday assured action in the alleged attack on nuns by a group of Bajrang Dal activists on a train in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi soon after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation.Shah was speaking at a poll rally in Kochi ahead of the April 6 state elections.“Those involved in the Jhansi nuns’ harassment incident will be brought before the law. I want to assure the people of Kerala that the culprits behind this incident will be brought to justice at the earliest,” he said.In a detailed statement on Tuesday, the church media commission said that the nuns, from a congregation of Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Church, and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church said that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the alleged attackers, Vijayan in a letter to Shah sought strict action against those “who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights” guaranteed by the Constitution.The CM said the nuns and the postulants were forcefully removed from the train by the police following a complaint from the Bajrang Dal activists alleging that the two girls were being taken for forceful religious conversion.“You would agree with me that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance and practice. Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union Government,” Vijayan said.What happened in Uttar Pradesh should not have happened in the country and it is a “very serious matter,” the CM said, attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in UP.“Violence in the name of religion is on the rise in many parts of our country. Violence against women and marginalized groups are on the rise…Uttar Pradesh is notorious for such matters. All such illegal activities are taking place under the ruling BJP government there. It should also be taken seriously that all this is happening on an uncontrolled scale,” Vijayan said.The incident occurred at a time when the BJP is wooing Christian minorities who form 16% of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area.At the rally in Kochi, Shah accused Vijayan of having close links with the prime accused in the gold smuggling case.“Who appointed the principal secretary who was arrested in money laundering and smuggling cases? Why was he sacked later? The CM can’t wash away his hands like this. Did the secretary and CM travel abroad with the main accused or not,” Shah said.Without naming the prime accused in the case, Swapna Suresh and M Sivasankar, who were arrested by central agencies in connection with case, the Union minister asked, “Why did the accused woman come to the CM’s residence regularly? Who appointed her in a key post with ₹3 lakh salary? Did the accused make foreign trips with state fund with the permission of the state government.”Justifying the investigation by central agencies in the case, he said if any scandal took place in the country, it will be probed by the Indian agencies and not those from the UN.Last week, the state government booked officials of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly trying to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case.Shah said the people of the state see BJP as an alternative for the opposition UDF and ruling LDF.Addressing a road show in Tripunithara on the outskirts of Kochi, Shah said also targeted the LDF government for its handling of the Sabarimala temple issue in 2018.“It is not easy for believers to forget the way the government trampled their customs and jailed thousands of them. The government is answerable to faithful for its various criminal acts at the holy shrine,” he said.During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the Kerala witnessed large-scale violence when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women of child-bearing age to the Sabarimala temple. Nearly a dozen women in the age group of 10-50 were stopped from entering the temple.“It is time to bring a change in Kerala. Senior bureaucrats such as E Sreedharan are also joining the BJP because they know only the BJP can help develop Kerala further under the leadership of PM Modi. LDF-UDF cannot,” he said.The senior BJP leader also hit out Congress’s Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, calling his frequent visits to the state “picnic trips”. “In Kerala he talks against left but in West Bengal both are thick friends and fighting elections together. Congress has no qualms in aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-promises-action-as-row-over-nuns-harassment-in-up-intensifies-101616619274579.html
25-03-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine drive faces uphill battle against fresh wave||While the rate of vaccination has picked up through the month of March, when India’s drive was expanded to include those most vulnerable to Covid-19, the country’s inoculation campaign still faces an uphill battle as it races against the surge of new infections in the second wave, shows data. The main reason for the pace would appear to be a reluctance among people to be vaccinated (or vaccine hesitancy), something the government is trying to address by expanding the eligibility criteria.The total number of doses administered across the country crossed 50 million on Tuesday night, with 42.7 million people having received at least one dose of the vaccine in the country till Tuesday night. A total of 8.1 million people, meanwhile, have received both doses, according to data from the Union health ministry. In over two months since the start of the vaccination drive on January 16, India has administered only around 8.5% of its target of 600 million doses (to cover 300 million people) by the end of July.This means India has just over four months to achieve the remaining 91.5%. To cover this, the vaccination drive needs to be further expanded to deliver 4.2 million shots every day for the remaining 130 days. To be sure, the government has repeatedly spoken of administering 5 million doses a day. The highest it has achieved on a single day so far is 3.4 million on March 22.Over the past month, an alarmingly strong second wave of infections has raged across India despite the roll-out of vaccines. The seven-day average of daily cases has risen to 39,526 infections a day in the past week from a low of 10,988 on February 11 – an increase of 260% in just over a month.To be sure, the pace of vaccination has also picked up considerably since as the inoculation drive moved into its second phase from March 1. More than half (52%) of all doses administered throughout India’s vaccination drive have come in just the previous two weeks.On Tuesday, the government also announced a further expansion of the eligibility criteria -- all people above 45 years of age will be made eligible to get Covid-19 vaccine from April 1. The move is likely to further boost daily vaccination numbers. With the expansion announced on Tuesday, more than a quarter (25.3%) of the country’s projected population (as on March 1, 2021) is now eligible for the vaccine, according estimates by the Technical Group on Population Projections under the National Commission on Population.Removing even more barriers on eligibility criteria would only go on to improve the coverage of the vaccination drive and further control cases, experts said.Till Tuesday, the world’s worst-hit nation, the United States has vaccinated a quarter of its population – 82.8 million people out of a population of 330 million. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has vaccinated 41% of its population. Both countries were completely overwhelmed with cases at the start of 2021, are now defying a global trend of new waves. In the US, average daily cases have dropped from over 250,000 in January to around 55,000 in the last week; in the UK, this has dropped from nearly 60,000 new infections a day in January to 5000 in the last week. At the opposite end of this spectrum is Brazil where a slow inoculation drive has failed to arrest rising cases. The South American nation, which has inoculated only 5% of its population till Tuesday, is now the world’s largest Covid hot spot and is reporting a record 75,000 new cases every day.Experts said it’s very clear that the mass vaccination has helped the US and UK.“The short answer (to whether vaccines have helped prevent new waves in the UK and US) is a resounding ‘yes’. Israel is another country that has shifted its curve using vaccines. Of course, the devil is always in the details. India is a big and complex country, but has the advantage of being home to a robust vaccine industry. We can also do this provided three factors: first, there is sufficient vaccine supply coming through; second, there are sufficient delivery points (this can be expanded because the government has the capacity); and third, there is no vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, virologist and director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.Under the drive’s first phase in India, only health care workers and frontline workers were vaccinated till the end of February. Phase two of the drive included people over 60 years of age and those aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.Till Tuesday night, 21.8 million people who are above the age of 60 years received a shot each, 8.4 million frontline workers received at least one shot, as did 7.9 million health care workers, and 4.7 million people between 45 and 60 years with comorbidities. Meanwhile, 3.1 million frontline workers and 5 million health care workers received second doses.The Union government is now stressing on the need to speed up the vaccination drive, especially in the light of the second wave.“While the vaccination drive is proceeding smoothly, the pace is uneven across different states and UTs; and, the slow pace of vaccination in some states/UTs is a matter of concern. Vaccination… in the present scenario is critical to break the chain of transmission. Therefore, all state/UT governments should rapidly step up the pace of vaccination, to cover all priority groups in an expeditious manner,” the Union ministry of health affairs said in a statement on Tuesday.Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder, Genestrings Diagnostics, said, “With the announcement of opening Covid-19 vaccines for all people above the age of 45, India has widened the safety net for many more people. Many Indians above 45 have various degrees of lifestyle diseases that makes them susceptible to contracting the infection. This move will play a key role in increasing the number of inoculated people significantly and rapidly, which is the need of the hour in view of the rising cases in many parts of the country.”(With inputs from Rhythma Kaul)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-drive-faces-uphill-battle-against-fresh-wave-101616619283699.html
25-03-2021||India||Justice NV Ramana: From a student leader to next CJI||From a student leader who fought for civil liberties during the nationwide Emergency in 1975 while sacrificing an academic year to taking over as the 48th chief justice of India next month, justice NV Ramana has had a remarkable journey.Born into a humble family of agriculturalists in Ponnavaram village of Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, justice Ramana was asked by his father in June 1975 to pack an extra change of clothes after he presided over a public meeting against the Emergency.“My father was convinced that I will be arrested,” justice Ramana recounted his experience at an event in the national capital in January when he added that he had no regrets losing a year of college when he saw so many young people sacrifice their lives for the sake of human rights.Before he joined a law college in 1980, justice Ramana worked as a journalist for a regional newspaper for two years. He was enrolled at the Bar in 1983. As a lawyer, he practised in the Andhra Pradesh high court, central administrative tribunal, the AP state administrative tribunal, and the Supreme Court in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters, with specialisation in constitutional, criminal, service and inter-state river laws.He was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judge.Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held.Justice Ramana delivered another important verdict in the Karnataka assembly case, clarifying the legal position that disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for defection could not operate as a bar for contesting re-election.Emphasising the role of the Speaker, justice Ramana wrote in the judgment: “There is a growing trend of the Speaker acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Further, horse-trading and corrupt practices associated with defection and change of loyalty for lure of office or wrong reasons have not abated. Thereby the citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, there is need to consider strengthening certain aspects, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged and checked.”By a judgment in January this year, justice Ramana held that fixing a notional income for a non-earning homemaker was a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity of life to all individuals.The verdict highlighted that fixing a notional income for homemakers was a step towards “recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms. It signals to society at large that the law and the courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers.”In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nv-ramana-from-a-student-leader-to-next-cji-101616619289591.html
25-03-2021||India||Isro’s Chandrayaan-3 launch next year: Govt||The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) plans to launch its third mission to the Moon next year, the government said on Wednesday. In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for the department of space, Jitendra Singh, said that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will carry only a lander and a rover.The space agency earlier planned to launch the Chandrayaan 3 mission either in late 2020 or early 2021. However, most missions were rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The integrated spacecraft is being realised for planned launch during 2022,” Singh said, adding that the spacecraft is in “advanced stages” of realisation, with the propulsion system already built and undergoing tests. The lander structure has also been built and is currently being fitted with its propulsion system, he said.India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2, lost contact with Earth just 2.1km away from the surface of the Moon in 2019. While the lander, Vikram, made a hard landing on the lunar surface, the orbiter is expected to remain in position for seven years.“There was a problem at the very last leg of the journey of the lander. For the third mission, we have to ensure -- one, there is no problems with the thrusters; two, the system is fault tolerant so that even if there is some issue, for example thrusters not working, the system can automatically course correct; three, we have to ensure that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter communicates with the lander throughout the powered decent because it is capable of giving last-minute commands if necessary,” said Dr M Annadurai, former director of the Isro satellite centre in Bangaluru.The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover aboard the Chandrayaan-2 were to land near the lunar south pole, where the mission was expected to observe water molecules frozen in the darker regions of the Moon.This year, Isro has planned two missions in December – the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission, and India’s first solar mission.The unmanned flight will bring India’s human spaceflight programme one step closer to sending humans to low earth orbit; the final mission will be undertaken after a successful second unmanned flight scheduled for next year.The solar mission, Aditya L1, will see the space agency send a satellite 1.5 million kilometres away to the Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, which is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit. These points are like parking spots in space from where a satellite can make observations without expending much fuel. This point between the Earth and the Sun allows an uninterrupted view of the Sun.The mission will carry six scientific payloads that will study the visible surface of the sun (photosphere), the irregular layer over it called the chromosphere, and the layer of plasma called corona that extends for thousands of kilometers and has a temperature of around 6,000 Kelvin (5726.85 degrees Celsius), according to Isro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-chandrayaan-3-launch-next-year-govt-101616619292766.html
25-03-2021||India||HC again makes -ve Covid report mandatory for Kumbh after CM Rawat scrapped it||Days after Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh rolled back Covid-19 precautions for pilgrims arriving in the state for the Mahakumbh, the state high court on Wednesday directed the government to ensure that the visitors possess negative RT-PCR test reports not older than 72 hours or a vaccination certificate.The order came after a court-appointed team of epidemiologists raised concerns over the mass congregation potentially acting as a superspreader event and the union health ministry warned of the dangers of a mega event if Covid-safety protocols were not followed.Tirath himself, who lost no time in scrapping the requirement for a negative Covid test report put in place by his predecessor, tested positive on Monday, two days after he invited devotees across the world to come to Haridwar for the Mahakumbh saying “nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19 as the faith in God will overcome the fear of the Corona virus.” His statement came after a health ministry expert panel recommended several measures to control spread of Covid during Mahakhumb such as an increase in RT-PCR testing capacity and restrictions on people coming from eight states reporting most Covid cases in the country.The high court issued the directions to enforce strict Covid restrictions after state chief secretary Om Prakash on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the court that the condition of the mandatory negative Covid report will be implemented at the festival. The chief secretary’s submission came in response to a report submitted by a court-appointed committee to check arrangements at the Mahakumbh.“Pilgrims will have to comply with the court directions on mandatory testing and vaccination certificates,” Om Prakash told reporters in Dehradun.Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April, for which an official notification is yet to be issued. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh.The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 saw over 3.3 million people visit Haridwar. Covid cases have been surging across several states, including some that account for a significant number of pilgrims.The high court gave its directions while hearing a bunch of PILs (public interest litigations) on Covid-related issues in the state.On March 5, the court constituted a committee with the mandate to inspect the preparations for the Mahakumbh and submit a report by March 23 with photographic evidence. The team comprised the district judge, Haridwar, the mela adhikari, the petitioner’s counsel Shiv Bhatt and the chief standing counsel. Bhatt said in the report that much of the arrangements were yet to be completed. “We suggested to the court that as some people have completed the vaccination, such pilgrims should also be allowed at the Mahakumbh if they submit a certificate,” Bhatt said.He added the court directed chief secretary Prakash, health secretary Amit Negi, inspector general of police Sanjay Gunjiyal, mela adhikari Deepak Rawat and the petitioner’s counsel (Bhatt himself) to inspect the Mahakumbh area for the following three days and try to address any shortcomings at the earliest. “The court has directed that an interim report based on the action taken after the inspection be submitted by March 30. The next date for hearing the matter has been fixed for March 31,” he said. The Mahakhumb officially starts from April 1.On February 22, the court directed the state government to submit a detailed affidavit by March 3 on its preparations in the light of the standard operating procedures released by the Centre. The court sought details of how many frontline workers had been vaccinated in Haridwar and how much medical staff was available for the Kumbh.The Centre had issued the standard operating procedures on the Mahakumbh in January after the state government approached it for the same on the order of the Uttarakhand high court.The latest court directions came in the wake of new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat repeatedly saying that there would be no unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims. On March 13, Rawat announced that negative Covid-19 reports were not necessary to participate in the upcoming shahi snans during the mega event.Soon after, Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, wrote to the Uttarakhand chief secretary to take stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during the Kumbh Mela.Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,646 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,629 cases are from Haridwar district. Currently, Haridwar has the highest active cases among all 13 districts in the state, 351 of a total of 930.The high court noted in its order that “already alarm bells are being rung in some parts of the country, especially from the south, that the Covid-19 pandemic is again raising its head. Therefore, the pandemic continues to be a cause of concern for all of us. Some of the southern and northern states, like Rajasthan, have started imposing a partial lockdown. This is a clear indication that we are again entering the phase where the country will face the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the state government is expected to be vigilant and to ensure that the Mahakumbh mela does not turn into a breeding ground for the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-again-makes-ve-covid-report-mandatory-for-kumbh-after-cm-rawat-scrapped-it-101616619306943.html
25-03-2021||India||CJI Bobde designates Justice NV Ramana as his successor||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Wednesday designated the second most senior judge NV Ramana as his successor, putting an end to all speculation around the nomination of the next CJI.According to people familiar with the development, CJI Bobde sent his letter to the union law ministry on Wednesday, exactly a month before his retirement. Justice Bobde retires on April 23 and justice Ramana will take the helm as the 48th CJI the next day.The law ministry , on Friday requested CJI Bobde to designate his successor in accordance with the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges in the Supreme Court.As per the memorandum of procedure, appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, considered fit to hold the office. It mentions that the law minister, at the appropriate time, would seek the recommendation of the outgoing CJI for the appointment of the next CJI.It is only when “there is any doubt about the fitness of the senior-most judge to hold the office of the Chief Justice of India”, that the MoP provides, a consultation with other judges as envisaged would be made for appointment of the next CJI.It further states: “After receipt of the recommendation of the CJI, the law minister will put up the recommendation to the prime minister who will advise the President in the matter of appointment.”This, though is usually a formality, which means Ramana, 63, will be the next CJI. He will serve till August 26, 2022.The speculations around appointment of justice Ramana as the next CJI ensued in the wake of a formal complaint against him by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the senior judge of influencing the state high court and stalling investigations into the Amaravati land scam case in which the judge’s daughters were also being probed. Jagan contended in a letter to the CJI that the Andhra Pradesh high court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.While Jagan submitted a sworn statement in the form of an affidavit after it was asked of him by the CJI for initiating the inquiry, justice Ramana also submitted his statement before the in-house panel in response to the allegations.On Wednesday, the top court closed this inquiry, giving a clean chit to justice Ramana in the episode and clearing the deck for his appointment as the next CJI.A statement posted on the SC website said: “A complaint dated October 6, 2020 sent by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh to the Supreme Court was dealt with under the in-house procedure and the same, on due consideration, stands dismissed. It be noted that all the matters dealt with under the In-House Procedure being strictly confidential in nature, are not liable to be made public”.People in the know of developments told HT that the inquiry was closed on Tuesday following which CJI Bobde sent his recommendation to the law ministry for designating justice Ramana as his successor a day after.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-bobde-designates-justice-nv-ramana-as-his-successor-101616619324781.html
25-03-2021||India||How bad is the current wave of Covid in India?||The story of India’s Covid-19 battle has changed (for the worse) in the past month. For almost eight months after September, when India’s first wave peaked, the country saw a steady decline in daily cases and deaths -- but a second wave that started mid-February is now undoing months of progress made against the outbreak. How bad is the second wave? Are things as bad as fast as they were during the rise of the first wave? As India races to vaccinate enough people amid fears of mutant strains of the virus, here’s a quick look at how the second wave of infections is playing out.1) This is the sharpest growth in daily cases since May 2020...For the week ending March 23, India reported 42,162 new infections every day on average, the highest the 7-day average has touched since November 28, 2020. Last week, this number was 25,137, indicating the pace of the rise -- 7.7% over the past week. In other words, over the past week, every single day (on average) has seen 7.7% more cases than the day preceding it. How high is it? India hasn’t seen a rate of increase as high in at least 10 months, or since early May 2020 (it was also 7.7% for the week ending May 10).However, a key difference from then is that the base at the time was very low compared to what it is now – the 7-day average of new cases on May 10, 2020 was 3,508, against 42,162 on March 23 Indeed, India’s case trajectory has gone from 20,000 to 42,000 in just 11 days , 10 days fewer than the 21 days it took to go from 20,000-to-42,000 during the first wave (between July 3 and July 24).2) ... and also daily deathsOn average, 199 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 every day in the past week , the highest the death rate has been since the week ending January 13, 2021. A week ago, on average 140 people were dying every day. This pegs the average growth rate of deaths at 5.1%. This is the highest growth rate of deaths since the week ending June 22, 2020. However, deaths were artificially inflated that week because Delhi and Maharashtra both reconciled their Covid deaths on July 16, adding more than 1500 deaths to their tallies in a single day.If we exclude numbers from that week, then the last time India saw a growth rate higher than 5.1% in deaths was (again) for week ending May 10, when the death rate was rising 5.8%.3) At the current rate, India’s wave will overtake the US’s by March 27 and Brazil’s by April 2Currently, Brazil is the biggest Covid hot spot in the world – reporting an average of 75,570 new cases every day on average. Next is the US, which is, on average reported 54,141 new infections of Covid-19 every day in the past week. With a seven-day average of new cases at 42,162, India is at the third spot. However, India’s cases are rising at a far faster pace than the first two. In fact, the case rate of the US is currently declining. In the past week, the US’s daily case rate has dropped by 0.2%. While Brazil’s case rate is rising, it is doing so at a much slower pace than India’s – 1.4% against India’s 7.7% average growth in the past week.If these countries maintain this growth rate (or in the US’s case, decline rate) in the near future, then India’s trajectory of daily cases is set overtake the US in just four days (by March 27) and Brazil in 10 days, or by April 2.4) Are fewer people dying in the second wave?Some number crunchers have claimed as much. Overall, of the 11,554,894 people infected across the country, 159,615 people lost their lives to Covid-19 till Tuesday night (March 23). This places the country’s case fatality rate (CFR) at 1.4%. However, in the initial months of the outbreak, a larger proportion of people were dying as doctors took time narrow down on effective treatments, and the health infrastructure was in the process of being strengthened. As a result, India’s CFR has steadily been improving – it was 3% till the end of June; it improved to 1.6% by the end of September. In the last six months, only 1.1% of cases have resulted in deaths. In order to see if the second wave has had a lower death rate, we plotted the seven-day average of deaths (with a 14-day lag) against the seven-day average of cases since October 1, 2020 at a ratio of 0.011:1 (as the CFR since October is 1.1%). The 14-day lag was taken because a February 2020 study showed that it took an average of 14 days from infection to death. This plot shows that the death trajectory is nearly identical to the case trajectory in the second wave, which means that so far there has been no major deviation from the 1.1% death rate.Put otherwise, it means there is no change in the case fatality rate between October and now, although, to be sure, this proportion is lower than how many people have died from the disease overall (CFR of 1.4%) and also lower than the proportion of people who died till September 2020 (1.6%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-bad-is-the-current-wave-of-covid-in-india-101616618515506.html

25-03-2021||India||50 can pray in Nizamuddin Markaz during Shab-e-Barat, Centre tells HC||The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that 50 people chosen by the state wakf board can be permitted to offer prayers at the mosque in the Nizamuddin Markaz on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat once the names of those individuals are provided to the station house officer of the local police station.The submission was made during the hearing on a plea by the Delhi Wakf Board through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It was locked down by the authorities on March 31 last year, after removing members of the Jamaat who were staying there in violation of the curbs imposed to stop the spread of the infectious disease.An FIR was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the Covid-19 lockdown.Representing the Centre, advocate Rajat Nair told Justice Mukta Gupta that if the Delhi Wakf Board seeks permission from the SHO for 50 people, they may be allowed to enter the Masjid Bangle Wali to offer prayers on the occasion of Shab-e- Barat, which will be observed on March 28-29.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, who was representing the petitioner, urged the court to permit some individuals to pray at the mosque and assured that the adjacent madrasa will not be accessed.Gupta also urged the court to decide on the opening of the mosque before the month of Ramzan commences from April 13 “as more people would want to offer prayers at the mosque during that time”. The court listed the matter for further hearing on April 12.The wakf board, in its plea, has contended that even after Unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and a hostel -- continues to be locked up.It has further argued that even if the premises were a part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-can-pray-in-nizamuddin-markaz-during-shab-e-barat-centre-tells-hc-101616610649363.html

A fifty-member group of pilgrims had boarded a bus and reached Rishikesh via Haridwar on Monday night. Prior to their visit, rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests of these pilgrims were conducted by a health department team out of whom 22 tested positive Medical officer in charge of Tehri Garhwal district Dr Jagdeesh Joshi said that the sample test report taken at Tapovan check post, has returned positive for the twenty-two pilgrims hailing from Gujarat who have already left Rishikesh. The local administration has apprised the concerned district and health department officials about the Gujarat-based pilgrims report and to ensure they get traced and isolated. Social activist Anoop Nautiyal has requested the state health department to expedite the testing process as results of the Gujarat-based pilgrims came four days later which resulted in their visiting temples and staying in the state without getting isolated and shifted to a Covid Care Centre in time. As a precautionary measure in Tapovan area which houses several yoga centres, ashrams ,hotels ,resorts where other state pilgrims and tourists stay in large numbers, mandatory thermal screening and random RT-PCR samples is done. Four yoga trainers have also tested positive in the Tapovan area along with seven hotel employees in the past two days.

25-03-2021||India||SC asks Param Bir Singh to move Bombay HC||New Delhi The Supreme Court on Wednesday commented that it was all “hunky-dory” between former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh for a long time before they fell out, and asked Singh to approach the Bombay high court for a Central Bureau of Investigation probe against Deshmukh for allegedly running a “money collection scheme” through the police, the subject of a plea by the former top cop in the apex court. The move provides a temporary respite to both Deshmukh and the state government, which has rallied behind the home minister despite vocal calls for his resignation from several quarters, most notably the opposition Bharatija Janata Party. Singh was transferred to a low-key post in Mumbai Police’s home guards on March 17 over his mishandling of a case where explosives were found in an abandoned vehicle outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia and the subsequent arrest of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in the case. On Wednesday, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhas Reddy declined to entertain Singh’s petition in the first instance, recording in its order that the high court had wider powers under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) and that it could also examine the need for a probe by a central agency. “We have no doubt that the matter is quite serious and affects the administration at large. It also appears that a lot of material which has come in (the) public domain is a consequence of the personae falling out,” noted the court in its order, as it further took note that the high court could also examine an August 2020 report by former commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla regarding corruption and the involvement of middlemen in police postings in Maharashtra. “Concerned parties have been hunky-dory for a long period and now they have fallen apart...Here is an issue relating to two personae till the time it erupted in the public glare. One person moved out and then they started saying something against each other. The question for you is why not go to the high court under Article 226?” the bench asked senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who represented Singh. Rohatgi sought to persuade the bench by listing out several cases, including the Hathras rape and murder case from Uttar Pradesh, in which the Supreme Court directly entertained writ petitions and passed orders. He added that Singh’s petition raised matters of great public interest affecting the citizens of the country. “Agreed, we also note and record that it is a serious issue. But why should the high court not do it under Article 226? You want investigation by an independent agency and that also can be done by the high court. You (Singh) are a directly affected person. You should go to the high court first,” justice Kaul told Rohatgi. The bench also pointed out that Singh has not made Deshmukh a party to his petition despite making a spate of accusations against the home minister. When Rohatgi said that this was a case of political interference in the police department in violation of the Supreme Court ruling in the Prakash Singh case of 2006 that sought to insulate the police machinery, justice Kaul retorted: “Has any state enforced Prakash Singh? No state wants to let go of its power. No reform has taken place despite Prakash Singh and as soon as an episode happens, everyone remembers our judgments.” The court added: “In our view, this is only a mantra recited periodically, wherever the occasion so suits, and there has been no seriousness by all concerned to ever implement the directions enshrined in the judgment.” Rohatgi then opted to withdraw the petition with the liberty to urgently move the Bombay high court and seek a hearing. “I will approach the high court today afternoon itself. I will also request the high court for a hearing on Thursday,” Rohatgi told the bench. He also urged the Supreme Court to record that the high court should take up the case on Thursday since CCTV footage from Deshmukh’s residence was not being handed over to the NIA (National Investigation Agency) by the ATS (anti-terrorism squad) and that Singh apprehended that the evidence of meetings between Deshmukh and Vaze could be destroyed. Justice Kaul, however, told Rohatgi that as a matter of principle, his bench did not fix dates of hearing before the high courts since they were also constitutional courts and must be allowed to decide such housekeeping issues on their own. The bench then disposed of the matter and added Deshmukh and the NIA as parties to Singh’s petition on Rohatgi’s request. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta remained present during the proceedings on behalf of the central government and CBI but did not make any submission as the matter was sent to the high court. In his petition before the top court, Singh said he was transferred to home guards “immediately” after he brought the corrupt practices of Deshmukh to the knowledge of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and some other senior leaders in the state government. The petition contended that NCP leader Deshmukh held various meetings in February 2021 at his residence with police officers, including Sachin Vaze of the Crime Intelligence Unit, Mumbai, and Sanjay Patil, ACP (Social Service Branch), Mumbai, bypassing their seniors, and asked them to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments such as bars, hookah parlours and restaurants. Singh submitted he was being made a “scapegoat to divert attention” in the Antilia case, highlighting that while there were vertically five officers between him and Vaze, Deshmukh was the one meeting Vaze at his residence. In that case, now being investigated by NIA, Vaze has already been arrested. The state ATS has also named Vaze the main accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran who was in possession of the vehicle found with the explosives, but reported it stolen a few days before the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-param-bir-singh-to-move-bombay-hc-101616612838841.html
25-03-2021||India||EC supports electoral bonds in apex court, calls for transparency||The Election Commission on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that it supports the existing system of political party funding through electoral bonds, although it added that it would like the process to be more transparent, a concern that it said could be considered later.The submission of the poll body came at a crucial juncture during the court’s hearing of a plea moved by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms seeking stay on sale of electoral bonds from April 1 to 10 ahead of the Assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and union territory of Puducherry.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi appearing for EC said, “The Commission is supporting electoral bonds and not opposing it. If we don’t support it we will go into a pre-existing system of receiving donations through cash. Electoral bonds goes one step forward as all bonds have to be obtained from the bank only. This way there is accountability. But we are also asking for transparency. That can be considered later by the Court.”The EC’s reference to transparency is significant because currently, electoral bonds promise anonymity, with only the issuing bank, the state-owned State Bank of India being aware of the identity of the purchaser. Electoral bonds were notified by the government in January 2018 and were first issued in March 2018. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde recorded the submission of EC and reserved orders on the application filed by ADR. While doing so, the Court raised an apprehension of a possible misuse of these bonds and the mechanism available with the Centre to remedy the situation. To be sure, this was not the main objection of the petitioner -- who was objecting to the very use of the bonds, not their misuse. The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “What if a political party has got ₹100 crore worth bonds and it intends to finance protests? What is the control that the Government has on the use of this money by parties for terrorist purposes, illegal activities or for purposes outside their political agenda? ”Attorney General KK Venugopal appearing for Centre referred to certain checks and balances. He said that parties are required to file their income tax returns each year showing how they have expended the money. The political party can face deregistration if it is found to indulge in anti-national or illegal activities. Venugopal said that the use of bonds is essential for the country as it has curbed black money being used in elections.For the petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan submitted that there was complete anonymity about who purchases these bonds and to whom it is subsequently transferred. He read out an earlier affidavit filed by Election Commission in March 2019 where it raised concerns over lack of transparency in tracking political party donations.Although the petition by ADR was filed in Supreme Court in September 2017, arguments have not concluded and from time to time, the NGO has approached the Supreme Court to stall issuance of these bonds till the matter is finally decided. Bhushan said that during the proceedings of this case, the Supreme Court in April 2019 directed political parties to submit receipts of electoral bonds in a sealed cover to the Election Commission. On Wednesday, EC told the court that all major political parties had filed their receipts.Bhushan said that even this would not help as EC would not know the identity of the donor. “Why should there be anonymous funding to political parties when past judgments of the Supreme Court have held that transparency in elections is a right of voters not under the Right to Information Act but as a matter of right in a democracy?” Bhushan asked, Venugopal said that bonds cannot be subsequently traded. The process follows KYC norms and anonymity of the donors is maintained in order to prevent their victimization, he explained.The electoral bonds system was introduced by way of a money bill introducing amendments in the Finance Act and the Representation of Peoples Act. ADR claimed that such anonymous route of funding amounted to legitimizing bribery as corporate could fund the party in power in a state or Centre as a matter of quid pro quo. These donations enjoy 100% tax exemption and even foreign companies can donate through Indian subsidiaries, the petition added. “The Electoral Bonds Scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy,” the application filed by ADR stated, adding that the Finance Act of 2017 exempts contributions by way of electoral bonds to be disclosed to the EC under Section 29C of the Representation of Peoples Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-supports-electoral-bonds-in-apex-court-calls-for-transparency-101616612838300.html
25-03-2021||India||TMC hits out at BJP’s Bengal unit chief for ‘Bermuda shorts’ remark||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday came under attack from the ruling Trinamool Congress for suggesting that chief minister Mamata Banerjee should wear Bermuda shorts to display injuries sustained on her leg during campaigning for the upcoming polls.The TMC shared a 14-second video of Ghosh addressing a rally in the state’s Purulia district on WHEN on its official Twitter handle. “Such distasteful remark is expected of Dilip Babu and nobody else. A remark against a woman chief minister proves that the BJP does not respect women. The mothers and sisters of Bengal will give a befitting reply on May 2,” the TMC tweeted while tagging Ghosh’s and Bengal BJP’s Twitter handles. In the video, the BJP leader could be heard saying, “Her plaster was replaced with crepe bandage. But she is still showing her leg to everyone. She is wearing her saree in such a way that one leg is visible while the other is not. I have never seen anyone wearing a saree like this. If she has to show her leg then she can wear Bermudas so that people can see clearly.” The CM sustained injuries on her leg during a roadshow in East Midnapore’s Nandigram on March 10. While the TMC has alleged that it was a deliberate attack on Banerjee, the EC ruled out any conspiracy. Banerjee is contesting against her former protégé Suvendu Adhikari, who recently joined the BJP.Hitting out at the BJP leader, TMC MP Mahua Moitra tweeted, “@BJP WB Pres asks in public meeting why Mamatadi is wearing a saree, she should be wearing “Bermuda” shorts to display her leg better. And these perverted depraved monkeys think they are going to win Bengal?”The BJP, however, said that Ghosh’s statement was being misinterpreted. “A lot of remarks are made during election campaigns. Ghosh’s statement is being taken in a wrong way. Nobody has any intention to insult the chief minister,” BJP’s Bengal unit spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.The state goes to polls in eight-phases beginning March 27. The counting of votes will be held on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmchits-out-at-bjp-s-bengal-unit-chief-for-bermuda-shorts-remark-101616612837696.html
25-03-2021||India||BJP offers a ‘love jihad’ law in Kerala manifesto||Thiruvananthapuram: A legislation to protect customs of Sabarimala hill temple and a special law to contain ‘love jihad’ feature in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance’s manifesto, released by Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar here on Wednesday, for the April 6 assembly elections in Kerala. The manifesto also promises free laptops for students and free cooking gas cylinders to economically weaker sections. Releasing the NDA’s manifesto -- which is full of sops, just like in the manifestoes released by the ruling Left Democratic Front and opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front — the Union minister termed it “progressive, dynamic and development-oriented”. “Unlike our opponents we only promise that we can do. We will take Kerala out of stagnation,” he said.Some of the promises made in the manifesto include free housing, drinking water and power connections to all. It also promises six free cooking gas cylinders to economically weaker sections and free laptops to school students. A pension ₹5,000 per month is promised to the family if the main bread-earner falls sick or is unable to work. The manifesto also promises free title deeds of land to the landless among SC&ST communities. Javadekar said time has come to stop alternating between the LDF and UDF in the state, adding that there was enough scope for a third front this time. “The state suffered due to alternating power equations but this time people are looking for a change,” Javadekar said.Other highlights of the manifesto include welfare pension to be raised to ₹3,500 per month, a strict ban on the ‘Nokku Kooli’ and ‘Attimari Kooli’ (militant trade union practices in Kerala). It also promises to do away with the eligibility test prior to the main public service commission examination, besides restructuring Kerala Infrastructure Development Fund in line with constitutional provisions and be subjected to audit of theComptroller and Auditor General. The manifesto said that all temples in the state should be taken out of the control of thestate government and be entrusted with believers, priests and religious leaders. The manifesto added that a special legislation will be brought in to protect the age-old customs of Sabarimala temple, which witnessed unrest three years ago when the government tried to implement the Supreme Court judgment removing bar on women of child-bearing age from entering the temple. Similarly, a special law will be introduced on the lines of BJP-ruled states in north India to contain ‘love jihad,’ an alleged practice of enticing Hindu girls feigning love and later converting them. The term was first coined in the state after 21 people from north Kerala disappeared in 2016 and later believed to have joined the Islamic State in Syria. Among missing three women and two men were converts from other religions. “In Kerala, many central programmes have been hijacked by the Left regime, which present them to people making slight changes. Most of the programmes are named differently to fool people,” the minister said. Taking a jibe at the UDF and LDF, Javadekar said that in Kerala, the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were sworn enemies, but the two are friends in West Bengal. “It is hypocrisy: ‘Bengal mei dosti, Kerala mei kushti’,” he said. “During the last Lok Sabha polls also, the BJP made big promises on Sabarimala. But it failed to do anything in two years. Even a school child knows the issue is before the Supreme Court. It is fooling believers,” said CPI(M) leader A Ananthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-offers-a-love-jihad-law-in-kerala-manifesto-101616612777714.html
25-03-2021||India||Shah promises action as row over nuns’ harassment in UP intensifies||Kochi:Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday assured action in the alleged attack on nuns by a group of Bajrang Dal activists on a train in Uttar Pradesh’s Jhansi soon after Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation. Shah was speaking at a poll rally in Kochi ahead of the April 6 state elections. “Those involved in the Jhansi nuns’ harassment incident will be brought before the law. I want to assure the people of Kerala that the culprits behind this incident will be brought to justice at the earliest,” he said. In a detailed statement on Tuesday, the church media commission said that the nuns, from a congregation of Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Church, and a group of girls were on their way from Delhi to Odisha in a train on March 19 for Easter celebrations when they were confronted by the Bajrang Dal activists in Jhansi. The church said that the nuns were verbally abused and activists tried to attack the girls, whom they believed, were being taken away for religious conversion.While the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference (KCBC) and Syro-Malabar Church have sought action against the alleged attackers, Vijayan in a letter to Shah sought strict action against those “who disrupt and impair the freedom of individual rights” guaranteed by the Constitution.The CM said the nuns and the postulants were forcefully removed from the train by the police following a complaint from the Bajrang Dal activists alleging that the two girls were being taken for forceful religious conversion.“You would agree with me that such incidents tarnish the image of the nation and its ancient tradition of religious tolerance and practice. Such incidents require utmost condemnation by the Union Government,” Vijayan said.What happened in Uttar Pradesh should not have happened in the country and it is a “very serious matter,” the CM said, attacking the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in UP. “Violence in the name of religion is on the rise in many parts of our country. Violence against women and marginalized groups are on the rise…Uttar Pradesh is notorious for such matters. All such illegal activities are taking place under the ruling BJP government there. It should also be taken seriously that all this is happening on an uncontrolled scale,” Vijayan said.The incident occurred at a time when the BJP is wooing Christian minorities who form 16% of the votebank to get a foothold in the central Travancore area.At the rally in Kochi, Shah accused Vijayan of having close links with the prime accused in the gold smuggling case. “Who appointed the principal secretary who was arrested in money laundering and smuggling cases? Why was he sacked later? The CM can’t wash away his hands like this. Did the secretary and CM travel abroad with the main accused or not,” Shah said.Without naming the prime accused in the case, Swapna Suresh and M Sivasankar, who were arrested by central agencies in connection with case, the Union minister asked, “Why did the accused woman come to the CM’s residence regularly? Who appointed her in a key post with ₹3 lakh salary? Did the accused make foreign trips with state fund with the permission of the state government.”Justifying the investigation by central agencies in the case, he said if any scandal took place in the country, it will be probed by the Indian agencies and not those from the UN.Last week, the state government booked officials of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly trying to implicate the CM in the gold smuggling case. Shah said the people of the state see BJP as an alternative for the opposition UDF and ruling LDF.Addressing a road show in Tripunithara on the outskirts of Kochi, Shah said also targeted the LDF government for its handling of the Sabarimala temple issue in 2018. “It is not easy for believers to forget the way the government trampled their customs and jailed thousands of them. The government is answerable to faithful for its various criminal acts at the holy shrine,” he said. During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the Kerala witnessed large-scale violence when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women of child-bearing age to the Sabarimala temple. Nearly a dozen women in the age group of 10-50 were stopped from entering the temple. “It is time to bring a change in Kerala. Senior bureaucrats such as E Sreedharan are also joining the BJP because they know only the BJP can help develop Kerala further under the leadership of PM Modi. LDF-UDF cannot,” he said.The senior BJP leader also hit out Congress’s Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, calling his frequent visits to the state “picnic trips”. “In Kerala he talks against left but in West Bengal both are thick friends and fighting elections together. Congress has no qualms in aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he said.

25-03-2021||India||BJP is committed to ensuring error-free NRC: Sarbanand Sonowal||Guwahati: Assam chief minister Sarbanands Sonowal is confident that his government’s performance will ensure it will return to power with an improved tally in the upcoming assembly elections. He believes the unrest over the discrepancies in the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the opposition to the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, have died down, and the concerns that still exist in some pockets will not adversely affect the BJP’s poll prospects.In an interview to HT, Sonowal, popularly known as the “jatiya nayak” (community hero) for his activism as a student leader with the All Assam Students Union and for the role he played in getting the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act repealed by the Supreme Court in 2005, said the BJP is fighting to persevere Assamese identity and ensure freedom from the threats posed by illegal intruders.Edited excerpts:Why does the performance of your government give you the confidence of returning to power?Our idea is to protect the people of Assam. We want to make a self-reliant Assam, and in the last five years, we’ve worked with honesty. We gave everyone a chance to move ahead and live with dignity; everybody’s rights were protected; all communities were brought together. Peace and security have been strengthened on the ground. We have ensured a corruption-free administration, and restored the people’s faith in the government. For example, two members of the Assam Pubic Service Commission are still in jail for taking money for appointments. When the Congress was in power, students were in a bad state; they used to tell their parents that even if we complete studies, we don’t have the money [to pay bribes] for jobs. Today, all jobs are provided on merit. This transparency and accountability is our victory.In the next five years, we want to take Assam to greater heights. The people of the state are happy, and they want to bring back the BJP government so that they can get more benefits.In your manifesto, you have promised 100,000 government jobs by March 2022, and another 800,000 in the private sector. The 2020 government estimates pegged the unemployment rate at 11%-12%. How are you going to provide these jobs?Jobs will be created in all the sectors, particularly the petroleum sector, agriculture, and the veterinary sectors. We have a scheme called the Chief Minister’s Samagra Gram Unnayan Yojana. Under this scheme, we have started work in eight mission modes. There is a lot of scope for generating jobs in many areas. (The scheme aims to double farm incomes and to offer livelihood, logistical assistance, and community support).The BJP is up against an opposition coalition that has the Congress and the AIUDF. How will this alliance impact the elections, especially in the Barrack valley?One has to first look at how the AIUDF emerged. People know how the Congress ruled the state, and how it allowed intruders space to create its own vote bank. During the anti-intruders agitation, (Assam Movement) over 800 people who were protesting were killed. They (Congress government) even brought the brought the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act, 1983 to protect illegal intruders. We fought a legal battle, and after the Supreme Court stayed that order, Ajmal emerged. Fourteen fundamental groups came together to save illegal intruders -- that is how the AIUDF came into existence. What do the people make of this alliance? What does it signal? It is clear that if they come to power, they will threaten Indian people in Assam and give space to illegal entrants. We call their alliance an unholy one because anyone who protects illegal intruders cannot have the best interest of the country at heart. That is why people in the state don’t want to make them win.How will the BJP face the opposition to CAA and NRC? You have also mentioned the need for a corrected NRC -- will that assuage concerns ?There were many factual errors in the list ; the state government has decided that only Indian citizens should be in the list. We are committed to making an error-free NRC. As far as CAA is concerned, there is no concern anymore; people were misled into believing that it will disenfranchise millions, but none of that has happened. The Congress, by saying it will not allow its implementation, are engaging in doublespeak. Our leadership has already said its a central law that will be implemented.The condition of tea garden workers has become a talking point in these elections. Rahul Gandhi needs to answer this: what are the real problems of the people who work in the tea gardens? Look at the changes we have brought about in the last five years;we’ve made roads, provided water and power, and started providing money from central and state government schemes through DBT (direct benefit transfer). We have hiked the wages, apart from providing facilities for health and education. Self-help groups for women have been offered financial assistance; there are scholarships for students. Can the Congress give an account of what they did during their rule? People never saw the Congress leadership here in times of need, whether it was during the floods or the pandemic. What impact will the newer political formations -- the Asom Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and the Raijor Dal, which are being seen as a anti-BJP -- have on you vote share?They will not have any impact on the ground. Their network is not strong. People have seen the BJP perform; why will they put their faith in newer political parties that have just emerged?There is speculation of a tussle between you and Himanta Biswa Sarma for the CM’s post.This is a media creation. My interest is to have a BJP government in Assam. I am a committed party person, and want the party to come to power. We work as a team, and the stories of our tussle are made up by the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-committed-to-ensuring-error-free-nrc-sarbanand-sonowal-101616612717728.html
25-03-2021||India||PM fires fresh salvos at Mamata, Cong-AIUDF||Silchar/Kolkata With just a few days left for the polls to begin, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday stepped up his attack on political opponents as he cautioned the people against the Congress-AIUDF ‘Mahajoth’ (alliance) in Assam and conveyed to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee that no Indian was an “outsider” in the state.Polling, which is slated to begin from March 27, will be held in three phases for 126-member Assembly in Assam and in eight-phases for 294 seats in West Bengal.Targeting the Congress at an election rally in Assam’s Silchar, Modi said that the Grand Old Party did not have any ideals or able leaders. “Congress ke paas na neta hai na niti, sirf Mahajhoot hai (Congress neither has a leader nor ideals, it only has a grand lie),” he told the crowd.The Congress in the state has tied up with the All India United Democratic Front, Bodo People’s Front, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Anchalik Gana Morcha to fight the polls.Accusing the party of going to any extent to win the elections, Modi said: “I have come to awaken you to the fact that Congress’s hand is with those forces that are a danger to the state’s identity and culture.” The Prime Minister claimed that it was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that helped Assam get rid of the violence that, he claimed, was common during the Congress regime. “Look at West Bengal today… there are news of violence every day. Assam was going through a similar situation during the Congress’ rule. In the 2016 assembly election, the people of Assam chose BJP with a hope that this will bring peace with development. Today, there is a flow of development in every part which has helped us restore peace in the state,” he said. “The Congress has always taken sides of infiltrators and illegal migrants while the BJP wants to protect the original indigenous people of this land. I appeal to the people of Assam to reject Congress for the lies and choose BJP for development to protect the pride of this state,” he added. While campaigning for the saffron party in West Bengal later in the day, the Prime Minister lashed out at the chief minister over her “bohiragoto” (outsider) remark, saying that nobody can be called an outsider in a land where icons such as Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Subhas Chandra Bose talked about unity and one nation. “You call me an outsider? This is the land where Gurudev wrote Punjab Sindhu Gujarat Maratha Dravida Utkal Banga…..No Indian is an outsider here. We are all Indians,” Modi said in Bengali in East Midnapore’s Contai area.“Bengal brought together the people of India through Vande Mataram, and on that land, Mamata-didi is talking about ‘bohiragoto’. No Indian is an outsider here, they are the children of Bharat Mata,” he added.The ruling Trinamool Congress has been describing the BJP as “a party of outsiders” as a strategy in the West Bengal assembly election. Banerjee has regularly asserted that she won’t allow the state to be ruled by “outsiders” from Delhi or Gujarat, in a reference to the BJP and the prime minister.Modi also said that a son of the soil would be appointed as the chief minister if the party was voted to power. Besides this, he also accused the chief minister of insulting the people of Nandigram through allegations of an attack on March 10 that left her with an injury on her leg. “You are maligning the people of Nandigram before the country. The people of Nandigram will not forgive you. They will give you a befitting reply,” Modi said. Banerjee, meanwhile, accused the BJP of cash distribution to seize votes. “They are bringing a lot of money. Keep your eyes open. If you can catch someone red-handed you will be awarded with a job,” she told a rally in Bankura district.The TMC also approached the State’s Chief Electoral Officer, accusing the BJP of misusing government infrastructure for political campaigns in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-fires-fresh-salvos-at-mamata-congaiudf-101616612657682.html
25-03-2021||India||K’taka boy lynched over suspicion of theft||Bengaluru: A 10-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries seven days after he was beaten up by four people for allegedly stealing snacks from a grocery store in Uppanashi in Karnataka’s Haveri district, police said on Wednesday. According to the police and the boy's family members, the boy was allegedly held captive on March 16 for several hours, beatenup by the owners of the shop, and released only after his mother pleaded with them. Later that night, when the boy’s condition worsened, he was rushed to a hospital in Haveri, from where the doctors referred him to Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubballi, where he died on Tuesday.The post-mortem examination report is still awaited, a KIMS spokesperson said. A second official at the hospital said on condition of anonymity said that boy developed a fever while undergoing treatment, and died due to brain haemorrhage. What led to this will only be found in the post-mortem report, he added. A case of murder, wrongful restraint, and assault, was registered on Tuesday against four people -- shopkeeper Pavan Karishettar, his mother Basavannevva Karishettar, his uncle Kumar Haveri, and his maternal grandfather Shivarudrappa Haveri. They are all absconding, police said. In a video shot at the hospital before this death, the boy named the four people, and recounted what happened during his alleged captivity. He said that he was first locked up in a room. After a while, the old woman (Basavannevva) in the house took him out of the room and made him sit outside. “An old man came and hit me twice. He asked me not to move from there. Then, the shopkeeper came and took me to the backyard, where two others joined. They hit me on my legs, neck, and legs. Pawan made me bend down and hit me with a stone,” he said. The statement has been recorded by the police. According to the police complaint lodged on March 17by the boy’s father, Nagayya Hiremath, their son was sent to the store to buy some groceries. When he did not return home for over two hours, Hiremath went to the store. He found that the boy was in the shopkeepers’ custody, and was being beaten on the suspicion of the theft. He requested the shopkeeperto release the boy, but Pavan Karishettar told Hiremath that he wanted to teach him a lesson. At around 3pm, the boy’s mother went to the shop and pleaded with him, but the owners firstasked her to come back at 5pm. Only after she fought and pleaded with the shopkeepers, did they release the boy, the complaint said. Rani Hiremath, a relative of the boy’s family, said that police did not register an FIR on March 17. She said they just took a written statement from the boy’s father. When asked about this particular complaint, SP Devaraju said he would “look into the allegation”.According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were 94 instances involving the murder of children, and 107 children were killed in 2019. Sabhiya Saldana, a Bengaluru-based child rights activists said that the police not filing an FIR on the day of the incident was a matter of concern. “Filing an FIR only after the child has died means the police did not take assault seriously,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-boy-lynched-over-suspicion-of-theft-101616611878279.html
25-03-2021||India||Isro’s Chandrayaan-3 launch next yr: Govt||New Delhi: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) plans to launch its third mission to the Moon next year, the government said on Wednesday. In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for the department of space, Jitendra Singh, said that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will carry only a lander and a rover.The space agency earlier planned to launch the Chandrayaan 3 mission either in late 2020 or early 2021. However, most missions were rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The integrated spacecraft is being realised for planned launch during 2022,” Singh said, adding that the spacecraft is in “advanced stages” of realisation, with the propulsion system already built and undergoing tests. The lander structure has also been built and is currently being fitted with its propulsion system, he said.India’s second mission to the Moon, Chandrayaan-2, lost contact with Earth just 2.1km away from the surface of the Moon in 2019. While the lander, Vikram, made a hard landing on the lunar surface, the orbiter is expected to remain in position for seven years.“There was a problem at the very last leg of the journey of the lander. For the third mission, we have to ensure -- one, there is no problems with the thrusters; two, the system is fault tolerant so that even if there is some issue, for example thrusters not working, the system can automatically course correct; three, we have to ensure that the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter communicates with the lander throughout the powered decent because it is capable of giving last-minute commands if necessary,” said Dr M Annadurai, former director of the Isro satellite centre in Bangaluru.The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover aboard the Chandrayaan-2 were to land near the lunar south pole, where the mission was expected to observe water molecules frozen in the darker regions of the Moon. This year, Isro has planned two missions in December – the first unmanned flight under the Gaganyaan mission, and India’s first solar mission. The unmanned flight will bring India’s human spaceflight programme one step closer to sending humans to low earth orbit; the final mission will be undertaken after a successful second unmanned flight scheduled for next year. The solar mission, Aditya L1, will see the space agency send a satellite 1.5 million kilometres away to the Lagrangian point, between the Earth and the Sun, which is where the gravitational pull of both the bodies on the satellite is equal to the centripetal force needed to keep the satellite in orbit. These points are like parking spots in space from where a satellite can make observations without expending much fuel. This point between the Earth and the Sun allows an uninterrupted view of the Sun. The mission will carry six scientific payloads that will study the visible surface of the sun (photosphere), the irregular layer over it called the chromosphere, and the layer of plasma called corona that extends for thousands of kilometers and has a temperature of around 6,000 Kelvin (5726.85 degrees Celsius), according to Isro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-chandrayaan-3-launch-next-yr-govt-101616611817626.html
25-03-2021||India||HC again makes-ve Covid report mandatory for Kumbh after CM Rawat scrapped it||Days after Uttarakhand’s new chief minister Tirath Singh rolled back Covid-19 precautions for pilgrims arriving in the state for the Mahakumbh, the state high court on Wednesday directed the government to ensure that the visitors possess negative RT-PCR test reports not older than 72 hours or a vaccination certificate.The order came after a court-appointed team of epidemiologists raised concerns over the mass congregation potentially acting as a superspreader event and the union health ministry warned of the dangers of a mega event if Covid-safety protocols were not followed. Tirath himself, who lost no time in scrapping the requirement for a negative Covid test report put in place by his predecessor, tested positive on Monday, two days after he invited devotees across the world to come to Haridwar for the Mahakumbh saying “nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19 as the faith in God will overcome the fear of the Corona virus.” His statement came after a health ministry expert panel recommended several measures to control spread of Covid during Mahakhumb such as an increase in RT-PCR testing capacity and restrictions on people coming from eight states reporting most Covid cases in the country.The high court issued the directions to enforce strict Covid restrictions after state chief secretary Om Prakash on Wednesday gave an undertaking to the court that the condition of the mandatory negative Covid report will be implemented at the festival. The chief secretary’s submission came in response to a report submitted by a court-appointed committee to check arrangements at the Mahakumbh. “Pilgrims will have to comply with the court directions on mandatory testing and vaccination certificates,” Om Prakash told reporters in Dehradun. Between 30 and 50 million pilgrims are expected to visit the shortened month-long festival in April, for which an official notification is yet to be issued. Before the pandemic, over 120 million people were expected to visit a four-month Mahakumbh. The first shahi snan (royal bath) that kicked off the festivities on March 11 saw over 3.3 million people visit Haridwar. Covid cases have been surging across several states, including some that account for a significant number of pilgrims.The high court gave its directions while hearing a bunch of PILs (public interest litigations) on Covid-related issues in the state. On March 5, the court constituted a committee with the mandate to inspect the preparations for the Mahakumbh and submit a report by March 23 with photographic evidence. The team comprised the district judge, Haridwar, the mela adhikari, the petitioner’s counsel Shiv Bhatt and the chief standing counsel. Bhatt said in the report that much of the arrangements were yet to be completed. “We suggested to the court that as some people have completed the vaccination, such pilgrims should also be allowed at the Mahakumbh if they submit a certificate,” Bhatt said.He added the court directed chief secretary Prakash, health secretary Amit Negi, inspector general of police Sanjay Gunjiyal, mela adhikari Deepak Rawat and the petitioner’s counsel (Bhatt himself) to inspect the Mahakumbh area for the following three days and try to address any shortcomings at the earliest. “The court has directed that an interim report based on the action taken after the inspection be submitted by March 30. The next date for hearing the matter has been fixed for March 31,” he said. The Mahakhumb officially starts from April 1.On February 22, the court directed the state government to submit a detailed affidavit by March 3 on its preparations in the light of the standard operating procedures released by the Centre. The court sought details of how many frontline workers had been vaccinated in Haridwar and how much medical staff was available for the Kumbh. The Centre had issued the standard operating procedures on the Mahakumbh in January after the state government approached it for the same on the order of the Uttarakhand high court.The latest court directions came in the wake of new chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat repeatedly saying that there would be no unnecessary restrictions on pilgrims. On March 13, Rawat announced that negative Covid-19 reports were not necessary to participate in the upcoming shahi snans during the mega event. Soon after, Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, wrote to the Uttarakhand chief secretary to take stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during the Kumbh Mela. Uttarakhand has so far reported 98,646 Covid-19 cases, of which 14,629 cases are from Haridwar district. Currently, Haridwar has the highest active cases among all 13 districts in the state, 351 of a total of 930. The high court noted in its order that “already alarm bells are being rung in some parts of the country, especially from the south, that the Covid-19 pandemic is again raising its head. Therefore, the pandemic continues to be a cause of concern for all of us. Some of the southern and northern states, like Rajasthan, have started imposing a partial lockdown. This is a clear indication that we are again entering the phase where the country will face the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the state government is expected to be vigilant and to ensure that the Mahakumbh mela does not turn into a breeding ground for the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-again-makes-ve-covid-report-mandatory-for-kumbh-after-cm-rawat-scrapped-it-101616611758135.html
25-03-2021||India||From a student leader to next CJI||New Delhi From a student leader who fought for civil liberties during the nationwide Emergency in 1975 while sacrificing an academic year to taking over as the 48th chief justice of India next month, justice NV Ramana has had a remarkable journey. Born into a humble family of agriculturalists in Ponnavaram village of Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district, justice Ramana was asked by his father in June 1975 to pack an extra change of clothes after he presided over a public meeting against the Emergency. “My father was convinced that I will be arrested,” justice Ramana recounted his experience at an event in the national capital in January when he added that he had no regrets losing a year of college when he saw so many young people sacrifice their lives for the sake of human rights. Before he joined a law college in 1980, justice Ramana worked as a journalist for a regional newspaper for two years. He was enrolled at the Bar in 1983. As a lawyer, he practised in the Andhra Pradesh high court, central administrative tribunal, the AP state administrative tribunal, and the Supreme Court in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters, with specialisation in constitutional, criminal, service and inter-state river laws.He was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judge. Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held. Justice Ramana delivered another important verdict in the Karnataka assembly case, clarifying the legal position that disqualification under the Tenth Schedule for defection could not operate as a bar for contesting re-election. Emphasising the role of the Speaker, justice Ramana wrote in the judgment: “There is a growing trend of the Speaker acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Further, horse-trading and corrupt practices associated with defection and change of loyalty for lure of office or wrong reasons have not abated. Thereby the citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, there is need to consider strengthening certain aspects, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged and checked.” By a judgment in January this year, justice Ramana held that fixing a notional income for a non-earning homemaker was a step towards the constitutional vision of social equality and ensuring dignity of life to all individuals. The verdict highlighted that fixing a notional income for homemakers was a step towards “recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms. It signals to society at large that the law and the courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers.” In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-a-student-leader-to-next-cji-101616611757627.html
25-03-2021||India||India to focus on its vaccination drive, limit exports, say officials||India will focus on its domestic vaccination programme following a spike in Covid-19 cases and the planned expansion of the immunisation drive, and there will be no expansion of vaccine exports, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The people said on condition of anonymity that there will be no ban on exports, though supplies to other countries will be made only after meeting domestic needs. They also said future exports are linked to the ramping up of domestic production capacities. “We have helped countries around the world with commercial supplies and grants of vaccines and we will continue to do so,” said one of the people cited above. The people said all commercial deals and export commitments will be honoured by the country. The people said the government’s priority will be the vaccination of the country’s population. As the country’s vaccine production capacity increases and emergency use authorisations are granted for more vaccines, the government will review the situation related to exports after about two months, the people said. Several factors are behind the government’s move to slow down vaccine exports, including a need to ramp up the domestic vaccination programme following an increase in the total active caseload after it had touched its lowest mark in mid-February, and the decision to open up the immunisation drive to everyone above the age of 45 from April 1. The emergence of a double mutation in the Sars-CoV-2 virus in Maharashtra has added to the concerns related to the rise in Covid-19 cases in recent days. With 11.7 million cases, India has reported the highest number of Coronavirus infections after the US and Brazil. Vaccine manufacturers too have indicated that the current focus is on meeting domestic needs. Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla had tweeted on February 21: “Dear countries & governments, as you await #COVISHIELD supplies, I humbly request you to please be patient, @SerumInstIndia has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world. We are trying our best.” India has so far supplied more than 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, mostly Covishield, to 76 countries. This includes 8.5 million doses provided as grants and commercial supplies of 34 million doses. However, according to data maintained on the external affairs ministry’s website, the last shipments went out almost a week ago to Namibia and Bolivia on March 18. The move will also affect supplies to the WHO-backed COVAX facility through which more than 180 countries are expected to get doses. COVAX has so far received 17.7 million doses of Covishield from India. Besides providing 200 million doses to the COVAX facility this year, India is also expected to manufacture one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines with US and Japanese funding for the new Quad Vaccine Partnership by the end of 2022. So far, more than 51 million doses have been administered across India, of which 47 million were Covishield doses and the rest were COVAXIN. The government has asked SII to supply 141 million doses. SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, plans to boost production of the AstraZeneca vaccine to 100 million doses a month by April, up from the current level of 70 million. On Tuesday, SII sought permission from Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to supply five million doses of Covishield to the UK this week, saying the move wouldn’t affect the domestic vaccination programme. The firm cited its licence agreement with AstraZeneca for transfer of technology for manufacturing Covishield, which states SII must treat AstraZeneca as a priority customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-focus-on-its-vaccination-drive-limit-exports-say-officials-101616611697633.html
25-03-2021||India||Court summons PC and Karti in INX Media case||New Delhi A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, his son Karti Chidambaram and eight others on April 7 taking cognizance of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) charge sheet in connection with their alleged role in the INX Media money laundering case.Special judge MK Nagpal said that there were sufficient grounds to proceed against the accused including Karti’s chartered accountant S S Bhaskararaman, Peter Mukerjea and six firms including INX Media and INX News.The charge sheet by the ED was filed under section 3 (money laundering) read with section 70 (offences by companies), which is punishable under section 4 (punishment) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). According to the ED’s charge sheet, the first instalment of illegal gratification of ₹3,08,62,044­, in furtherance of criminal conspiracy, was allegedly paid by INX Media to M/s Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL) and two other shell companies beneficially owned or controlled by Karti, namely M/s Kriya FMCG Distributors Pvt Ltd (Kriya) and M/s CBN Placement and Management Centre (CBNPMC) and this amount was paid during the year 2007-08 through the companies named SpanFibre and M/s Satyam Fibre (India) Pvt Ltd (Satyam Fibre).“Thus, in view of the background and after going through the contents of this complaint and the documents referred to therein and being relied upon in support of the allegations contained in complaint, I find sufficient material and grounds for proceeding further in the matter against all the 10 accused persons named in the complaint, out of which six accused are companies, for commission of offence under section 3 read with section 70 of the PMLA, which is punishable under section 4 of the Act,” the judge said in his order. The ED’s case arises out of a complaint registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) where it had contended that P Chidambaram had “misused his official position”, in conspiracy with his son Karti and others, in granting approval to a FDI proposal of INX Media and INX News Pvt Ltd in lieu of “illegal gratification” in India and through offshore payments. The CBI registered an FIR on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as the Union finance minister. Subsequently, the ED had lodged the money-laundering case.Both Chidambaram and his son Karti are currently on bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-summons-pc-and-karti-in-inx-media-case-101616611637604.html
25-03-2021||India||Akbar moves HC against acquittal of Ramani||New Delhi: The Delhi high court will hear on Thursday an appeal by former Union minister MJ Akbar against the dismissal of his criminal defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani.A single judge bench of justice Mukta Gupta will hear Akbar’s petition that has challenged the February 17 decision of a city court, clearing Ramani of defamation charges for her allegations of sexual harassment against him.The appeal, filed by Karanjawala & Co, has referred to portions of the trial court’s judgment which admitted in one part that the content referred to by Akbar was “defamatory in nature”, and that the “defence of the accused regarding” only part of the article referring to Akbar and the rest to “other male bosses is rejected” .Akbar has sought to highlight that once the trial court held that the content was defamatory in nature, there was a duty cast upon the trial judge to explain what exactly Ramani opted as her defence to this charge, and how her defence was accepted.It has further pointed out that the trial court dismissed Ramani’s defence that only part of the article was about Akbar and rest were about other male bosses since the article did not mark any distinction but failed to explain why she was not held culpable. Further, Akbar questioned the trial court’s verdict for accepting Ramani’s defence when she called an incorrect tweet by her about resignation by Akbar as an “honest mistake”. The appeal said the trial court did not analyse the evidence in this regard nor did it assess the impact of the wrong post on his reputation.On February 17, the trial court judgment had held that “Akbar was not a man of stellar reputation”, and reasoned that “the right to reputation cannot be protected at the cost of right to life and dignity of women as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution...”.It added that “.. perpetrators of sexual harassment ... can also be a person of reputation...”. Based on this reasoning, laid out in the verdict, judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey acquitted Ramani.The case concerns Ramani’s tweet in 2018, read in consonance with an article she wrote for Vogue magazine in 2017. In the article, she wrote about a situation where an editor interviewing her made her feel uncomfortable by conducting the interview in his hotel room.In the tweet, which came in the wake of the MeToo movement, she named Akbar as the editor. Several other women spoke about their experiences with him at the same time; one of them Ghazala Wahab even testified in favour of Ramani during the case. Akbar resigned as junior foreign minister after the allegations surfaced, and sued Ramani for defamation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akbar-moves-hc-against-acquittal-of-ramani-101616611577642.html

25-03-2021||India||Indian universities, 2010-2020: A decade in protest||This week, Ashoka University students boycotted classes for two days, demanding changes in the functioning of the institution following the resignation of professors Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian. While the protests were limited to a private university in this case, it is the latest in a series of student-led protests in the country, indicating a ferment in universities over the past decade.Here is a snapshot of the key moments in universities in the past decade, where students have expressed their disenchantment either due to issues specific to their university or on larger national issues, leading to a tussle with the administration, and in some cases, with the government of the day:Anti-corruption movement, 2011In August 2011, when social activist Anna Hazare launched a 15-day hunger strike in Delhi demanding a Jan Lokpal Bill to eradicate corruption, students from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), DU, JMI, and Banaras Hindu University (BHU), among others, backed the movement. Students of DU, Jamia, and JNU also held a series of protests on campuses and parts of the national capital. A group of university students also waved black flags at then Union minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal at New Delhi’s Constitution Club as he stood to address a meeting on Lokpal Bill. The larger protests prompted Parliament to pass a resolution accepting Hazare’s demand in August 27. Hazare called off his hunger strike the next day. More protests followed before the Lokpal Act was enacted in 2013.Also Read | Ashoka University students begin class boycott, demand changesDelhi gang-rape agitation, 2012The gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in Delhi on December 16, 2012, sparked nationwide protests. Students from across the country participated in the demonstrations demanding strict laws to prevent crimes against women and speedy trial and prosecution of the accused. At Delhi’s India Gate, students from DU, JNU, Jamia, and other Delhi-based institutes held protracted protests demanding justice for the woman, who died on December 29, 2012. Students in other cities including Bengaluru and Mumbai also held protests.Amid protests, the Centre formed a judicial committee and asked a former chief justice of India, J S Verma, to submit a report within 30 days suggesting amendments to criminal law to sternly deal with sexual assault cases. On February 3, 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance was promulgated. The ordinance provided for a death penalty in cases of rape. On March 20, 2020, four adult convicts in the case were executed.Delhi University protests, 2013-14 DU’s 2013 move to introduce a four-year programme to promote interdisciplinary learning and research at the undergraduate level triggered protests. Students and teachers said the programme was introduced without proper planning, consultations, resources, and course content. In June 2014, during the admission process, students held protests seeking a roll-back of the programme and prompted the newly-elected Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to scrap it.Jadavpur University protest, 2014-15 The hok kalorob (let there be uproar) movement at Kolkata’s Jadavpur University was one of the longest student protests in the country between September 2014 and January 2015. The protest was held against an alleged police attack on students while they were demanding an inquiry into the molestation of a student on the campus. The alleged attack also triggered a series of student protests in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.The students demanded resignation of vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakrabarti for allegedly calling the police to the campus. Final year students also boycotted the convocation ceremony and a student declined to accept her degree in the presence Chakrabarti. At least 10 students started an “indefinite hunger strike” on January 5, 2015, before Chakrabarti resigned.Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) protests, 2015 In July 2015, FTII students launched an agitation questioning actor Gajendra Chauhan’s credentials for his nomination as the institute’s chairman. They alleged he was named as the FTII head because of his political affiliation. The protest lasted for 139 days as students boycotted classes and refused to take exams. Protests were held in other places as well in solidarity with FTII students. On August 15, 2015, police carried out a midnight raid on the campus and arrested five protesting students for allegedly confining the institute director to his cabin. Chauhan was replaced by actor Anupam Kher in October 2017 before his three-year term ended.Protest over Rohith Vemula’s death, 2016Dalit scholar Vemula’s death by suicide at Hyderabad University triggered nationwide protests over alleged discrimination on the campus. Vemula was found dead days he was among the five students, who were expelled from the university’s hostel and provided limited access to the campus for allegedly assaulting a student leader. Vemula also left behind a note blaming the “system” for his death.JNU sedition row, 2016In 2016, police complaints were filed alleging “anti-national” slogans were raised during a protest over Afzal Guru, who was hanged for his role in the Parliament attack. Three students, JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and Anirbhan Bhattacharya, were arrested under sedition charges. The arrest sparked protests across the country. Students at universities including DU, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Jadavpur, Punjab University, University of Kerala also held protests in support of JNU students.The JNU authorities conducted an inquiry and took action against 21 students. The action ranged from rustication to fines. In response, students went on an indefinite strike. The Delhi high court suspended the university action on the condition that students end their strike in May 2016. After almost three years, the Delhi police in January 2019 filed a charge sheet against Kumar and nine others. In January this year, the Delhi government gave its nod to prosecute Kumar and others.Banaras Hindu University protests, 2017In September 2017, thousands of students, mostly women, protested when a BHU student was allegedly molested by three men on campus. The students alleged that instead of raising the matter with authorities, the hostel warden questioned the students for staying out till late. The students launched a protest outside the campus alleging lack of safety on the campus and “victim shaming” by the officials.Three days after the protest was launched, Uttar Pradesh Police launched a crackdown and lathi-charged the students to end the protest. A video of woman students being beating up by policemen triggered outrage. The police detained several students and filed cases against over 1,000 protesting students.Aligarh Muslim University’s Jinnah portrait controversy, 2018An armed group of Hindu Yuva Vahini entered the AMU campus and clashed with the students in May 2018 after former BJP lawmaker Satish Gautam objected to a portrait of Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah on the campus. AMU Students’ Union leader Maskoor Usmani was among those injured in the incident. AMU authorities insisted the portrait had been at its students’ union office since 1938 since Jinnah was a founding member of the University court-- the highest decision-making body. There are portraits of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the Dalai Lama, among others, in the same office. Many questioned why similar objections were not raised over Jinnah’s plaque at the Bombay high court museum.The AMU students boycotted classes and began a sit-in on the campus seeking action and an inquiry into the attack on them. The protest continued for weeks and the university was forced to postpone exams.Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest, 2019-2020A group of JMI students, locals, and teachers began a march towards the Parliament in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and triggered protests across the country. Clashes broke out between the protesters and the police when they were stopped. As many as 50 students were detained as police used tear gas and lathis to disperse the protesters.Another protest march was stopped on December 15, 2019 and several students were allegedly attacked by the police. The same evening, police stormed into Jamia’s central library and attacked students leaving many severely injured. The videos of policemen beating students, who were studying in the library triggered a nationwide uproar and international condemnation. Thousands of students gathered outside the police headquarters to protesting against the attack and demanding the release of the detained students. Students gathered at the university to protest against the CAA and police brutality. Locals also joined them for the next three months until the protest was called off due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-universities-2010-2020-a-decade-in-protest-101616585103634.html

25-03-2021||India||For the BJP, the battle in states — with an eye on Rajya Sabha||For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the upcoming state assembly elections are not just an opportunity to consolidate and expand its footprint across southern and eastern India, but also ramp up its strength in the Rajya Sabha, where it is still in minority.As many as 22 Rajya Sabha seats in these states—all held by non-BJP parties—will be up for grabs between the state election results and May 2024, when the term of the current Lok Sabha will be over. West Bengal, where the BJP is pitted against Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, accounts for half of these seats. The BJP has a strong presence in Bengal and won as many as 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 election. But it has never had a Rajya Sabha member from the state.Whether it wins or not, if it gets at least 43 seats in the assembly, which is highly likely, the BJP can elect its first Rajya Sabha MP from West Bengal in August 2023—when six seats from Bengal will face biennial elections. And any gain in Bengal for the BJP might lead to losses for Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress that holds five of those six seats.Also Read | HT Interview: ‘BJP provided road map for Sonar Bangla,’ says Amit ShahOf the current 237 seats of the Upper House of Parliament, the BJP has 95 seats while its broader National Democratic Alliance has 110 seats—just nine seats short of the majority mark. With the support of friendly parties such as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) (nine MPs), Biju Janata Dal (nine MPs) and Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (six MPs), clearing bills in the Upper House has become smoother for the government in this term than it was in its first term, but the absence of a direct majority means more political work and negotiations with smaller forces.In the past two years, after it retained power in the 2019 elections, the BJP has rapidly improved its position in the Upper House. It had just 73 seats before the 2019 national elections. The Congress has less than 50 seats for the first time in the Upper House.Two Rajya Sabha seats from Assam, currently held by the Congress, will go to polls early next year. The BJP might get an opportunity to grab at least one of them, if not both, if it does well in the assembly polls.Three Rajya Sabha seats from Kerala and six from Tamil Nadu will go to the polls between now and May 2024. While the BJP’s prospects in Kerala are rather limited, in Tamil Nadu, it has a partnership with the AIADMK. But in both the southern states, the BJP’s chances of getting a Rajya Sabha seat are minimal. It is the Congress which can hope to gain here, but this will be contingent on its performance in Kerala and its negotiations with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu, provided the opposition alliance wins.India’s bicameral Parliament—inspired from the British system—has the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The Upper House enjoys nearly all the power of Lok Sabha except that it can’t veto a budget or any money bill.As India’s federal laws need the approval of both Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House—although not directly elected by the public—can reject a bill or seek amendments. Also, a legislation introduced in Rajya Sabha has no shelf life and will remain alive till it has been passed by the House.While Lok Sabha members are elected directly by the voters, the Rajya Sabha members come through a complex process of proportional representation and by votes of the MLAs of their respective states. The calculation is: (total number of MLAs of the state ÷ no of seats going to poll in the state +1) +1.Each MLA ranks candidates according to his or her preference. If a candidate gets the minimum requisite votes, he or she would be elected. But if in a contest, a candidate fails to get the requisite votes from the first preference of the voters, the second preference votes would be counted.The strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, out of which 233 are elected from the states and union territories. The remaining 12 members are nominated by the President. The number of Rajya Sabha MPs will depend of the size of the population of that state. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India, sends 31 MPs to the Upper House, while Arunachal Pradesh has just one seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-the-bjp-the-battle-in-states-with-an-eye-on-rajya-sabha-101616565482268.html

The ancient cave shrine of Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy on the picturesque hills of Yadagirigutta, about 70-km away from Hyderabad, is getting ready for inauguration with a complete makeover at cost of nearly ₹1,000 crore. Hundreds of sculptors and artisans are working round the clock to give final touches to this magnificent 1,000-year-old Vaishnavaite temple, which civil engineers and civic officials are racing against the time to complete the necessary civic infrastructure to provide all amenities for the pilgrims. A sprawling 14.5-acre temple complex consists of seven temple domes, including a 100-foot main dome. “All the works related to the main temple complex including architectural works like inner and outer prakarams (compound walls), various types of stone-carved pillars, affiliated temples, sculptures of various gods and goddesses and Alwars (Vaishnavaite preachers) have been completed,” G Kishan Rao, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Yadadri Temple Development Authority (YTDA), said. Similarly, works on pushkarni (tank where devotees take a holy dip before having darshan), Kalyana Katta (tonsuring hall), circular road and queue lines, prasadam complex will be completed by March end and the temple will be ready for inauguration by the first week of May.The total cost of the Yadadri project is around ₹1,800 crore. “Till now, we have spent ₹837 crore for the project which includes construction of retaining walls, development of temple city in 250 acres, land acquisition cost and development of infrastructure like laying of roads, construction of VVIP cottages and augmentation of drinking water supply,” Rao said. Works on various other developmental works in the pilgrim town including provision of tourist facilities comprising cottages, multilevel parking and housing for the temple priests in a total area of 1,400 acres are going on, he said. The centuries-old temple on Yadagirigutta, renamed now as Yadadri, was originally confined to just 2,500 square yards of area. Now, the temple complex is spread over 14.5 acres. The main hillock where the cave temple is located and eight other hills and lush green forests adjacent to it are being developed into a beautiful temple town. The works which began in April 2016 are nearing completion. The temple is being redeveloped according to the ancient Agama shastra (scriptures dealing with construction of temples) and other Vedic scriptures. “The uniqueness of the temple is that it is reconstructed without using cement, concrete or bricks, but only with Krishnashila (black granite) used by Kakatiya emperors of Telangana for the temple architecture. It can remain intact for another 10-11 centuries,” the YTDA CEO said. Like Lord Venkateshwara of Tirumala, who devotees believe would fulfil all their desires, people of Telangana believe Lord Narasimha of Yadadri is most powerful, who wards off evil spirits and cures psychological disorders. They even believe that they could get cured of physical ailments. “That is why the chief minister felt the need to develop Yadadri into a globally-known shrine on the lines of Tirumala,” Rao added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1000year-old-yadadri-temple-in-telangana-gets-complete-makeover-101616554081666.html
25-03-2021||Today's||In Maharashtra, khakhi and khadi in the dock||Minister log mere peeche aur police log mere jeb mein rehte hai” (Ministers follow me, and the police is in my pocket). The Hindi film industry has a unique way of staying ahead of real-life narratives. The dialogue from the 2011 blockbuster, Singham, pits the villainous don against an honest inspector, Bajirao Singham, and forces the latter to retort in anger: “Aata majhi satakli!” (loosely translated from Marathi to mean, now, I have lost it!)Watching the political developments in Maharashtra, any right-thinking citizen would be well prompted to echo Singham’s memorable one-liner in sheer frustration. After all, when both the political and police leadership are caught in a web of egregious lies, deceit and possible criminality, it makes one wonder whether lawmakers and law-enforcers have abandoned any notion of public service, but instead become partners in a cash-and-carry private enterprise. How else is one to interpret the unprecedented war of words between the state home minister, Anil Deshmukh and the ex-Mumbai police commissioner, Param Bir Singh? The commissioner, on being transferred, suddenly accuses the minister of seeking a “vasooli” (collection money) of ₹100 crore per month from Sachin Vaze, an assistant police inspector, now arrested in the Ambani bomb scare case. The home minister, in turn, claims that the police commissioner is only trying to protect himself from being implicated in the same case in which one person, Mansukh Hiran, has been found dead. Amid these allegations and counter-allegations, here is the inconvenient truth — the chickens have come home to roost and Maharashtra’s, and dare one say, India’s politician-police nexus has been laid bare.A few years ago, a senior Maharashtra police officer Sanjay Pandey admitted as much during actor Aamir Khan’s popular Satyamev Jayate TV show while alluding to an “organised, institutionalised settlement” system by which dance bars and restaurants in Mumbai had to pay a “hafta” or fixed fee to the local police and their superiors.Which is why it is time to end this self-righteous indignation over the happenings in Maharashtra. If a police commissioner had not been transferred, it is more than likely that he wouldn’t have said a word. If Hiran’s body had not been found in the Thane creek, it is possible that the Ambani bomb case would have died a natural death, and Vaze would still be calling the shots. And if former Maharashtra chief minister (CM) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, Devendra Fadnavis, didn’t have access to confidential documents, may be the Shiv Sena-led government could brazen it out. Nor can Uddhav Thackeray or Sharad Pawar distance themselves from the murkiness of this episode. After all, Vaze joined the Sena after being suspended in a fake encounter case. What was the compulsion to reinstate him in 2020 when the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) came to power, but for the fact that he was seen as a “Shiv Sainik in uniform”? And can a hands-on, veteran politician like Pawar claim that he was unaware of what the home minister might have been up to? While Fadnavis can legitimately claim to have put the Maharashtra government on the back-foot, don’t forget that he, too, presided over the same system when he was CM. Will anyone believe that the politician-policeman nexus only surfaced in November 2019 when the MVA government came to power? Indeed, can any state government claim to have made an attempt to implement the police reforms recommended by the Supreme Court in the 2006 Prakash Singh case? At the core of those reforms is the urgent need to insulate the police from political pressures, be it in transfers or investigations. But no government has chosen to prioritise police reforms. But why would any government bite the hand that feeds them? The fact is, whether it is the alleged extortion racket or the lucrative “transfer-posting” industry, an increasingly corrupted politician-police culture has corroded and enfeebled institutional structures to the point where the lines between right and wrong have been blurred. It isn’t just the street constable who seeks a bribe with impunity: The chain it appears extends from the station house officers to shockingly even Indian Police Service officers and their political bosses. Which is why heads must roll in Maharashtra and any inquiry must go well beyond the usual political score-settling. Let the guilty be identified and given exemplary punishment. To protect the trustworthy police officer and yes, the upright politician too, the chain of fraudulence must be broken. Else every furious citizen will be entitled to scream: ‘’Aata majhi satakli’! Postscript: Some of the goings-on in Maharashtra seem bizarre in tragic times (remember the state has by far the highest number of Covid-19 cases and many beat policemen have lost their lives in the pandemic). Take, for example, Pawar’s suggestion that the 92-year-old former Mumbai police commissioner Julio Ribeiro be asked to probe the allegations. Ribeiro has rightly pointed out that he is hardly at an age where he can be the lead investigator. But the fact that a nonagenarian is considered as most apt for the task reveals the deep credibility crisis that confronts an entire generation of those in khakhi and khadi.

25-03-2021||Today's||Cementing Bangladesh-India ties through border haats||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s forthcoming visit to Bangladesh on March 26, will, among other things, celebrate the strong and multi-dimensional economic relations between Bangladesh and India. These relations include trade in goods and services, cross-border investment, energy trade and investment, coastal shipping and river-based connectivity. One indicator of the strength of a cross-border bond is the extent of people-to-people contact, and the evidence here is remarkable: Pre-Covid-19, Bangladesh was the single largest source of foreign tourists in India, as well as the largest international market for India’s medical services. Less well-known, except perhaps in academic, policy and local circles, is the singular success story of the Bangladesh-India border haats, which are local markets that enable small-volume trading along the densely populated border. In 2011, the two nations flagged off the first of their border haats, trying to recapture the once-thriving economic and cultural relationships that had been truncated by the creation of national borders. Conceived as a confidence-building measure between the two nations, four border haats were set up between 2011 and 2015: Two in Meghalaya and two in Tripura. Initially, only local produce was permitted for trade. But subsequently, the range of items has been broadened to include goods of household consumption.Also Watch | ‘PM Modi to visit Bangladesh, hold talks with Sheikh Hasina’: Foreign SecretaryAs part of a World Bank-CUTS study team that analysed the functioning of border haats, we were surprised at how well the haats had fulfilled their original mandate and perhaps even gone beyond it. What is the secret of their success?One, haats boost the local economies around the border. They create new opportunities for all participants by increasing the income of vendors; opening new business opportunities for buyers who source from the haats and sell locally; enabling transporters to earn more on days when the haats operate; and allowing small businesses such as food joints and vehicle repair shops to set up outside the haat premises.Two, haats enable women to participate and be more visible, as compared to their near-absence in formal cross-border trade. Women are active as buyers in all haats. In the Meghalaya haats at Kalaichar and Balat, all the women buyers were also mini entrepreneurs, reselling the products they bought from Bangladeshi sellers. Much more is possible, across all haats.Three, and most important, haats have helped build trust by connecting people. Haats have not only created new bonds and friendships among people residing on either side of the border, but have also rejuvenated old family ties that were temporarily disconnected by political barriers. For example, a young woman in Srinagar, Tripura, met with her aged mother after a 13-year separation. Mitali was a young girl living in Bangladesh. After her marriage 15 years ago, she moved to her in-laws who were living in the neighbouring area, in Indian territory. When a fence came up along the Bangladesh–India border, the requirement of passports and visas stood in the way of Mitali’s visits to her parental home. The border haat that links East Madugram and Srinagar has given them a place to reconnect. Also Read | March 25, 1971: When the Indian subcontinent changedFour, the haats are not a substitute for formal trade, which means that the commerce ministries of the two countries need not fear a loss of control over cross-border commerce. A simple thought experiment makes this clear. If the purchase limit for each individual at the haats were doubled, the haat operational days increased to two days a week, and 50 haats established along the border, compared to the current four, the total trade generated would still be only about 1% of the total formal trade between the two countries. Hence, commerce ministries should rest easy about the potential loss of tariff revenue or leakages into the formal trade system.Five, haats are strongly supported by border agencies. They have reduced smuggling and contributed to a peace dividend in their localised precincts, and provided relief to the border enforcement agencies. Thus, border agencies have called for a large increase in the number of haats along the Bangladesh-India border.Given such a strong endorsement from almost all stakeholders, and the unambiguously positive impact on local communities, it is surprising that more border haats have been somewhat slow in coming. According to a press release from the department of commerce, India, 10 more border haats are in the offing. Both countries would do well to increase the pace of construction and implementation of the new haats, while also streamlining procedures and improving facilities, especially for women.The success of these border markets also prompts a more ambitious thought.Could countries with more fraught bilateral relations, such as India-Pakistan or Afghanistan-Pakistan, also pilot a border haat model, putting people at the centre of the endeavour? Could the Wagah-Attari border provide the venue for a controlled border haat experiment that could be gradually scaled up, depending on the experience?

25-03-2021||Editorials||Covid-19 throws up a new challenge||New variants of the coronavirus have spread in India, particularly in Maharashtra and Punjab. The two states have recorded some of the sharpest increase in cases over the last month, with Maharashtra contributing more than half the new cases recorded across the country daily. Health authorities have held off on concluding that the variants are responsible for the surge, but experts believe a correlation is likely, given what the world knows about Sars-CoV-2 mutations. In several countries, most notably in the United Kingdom (UK), at the outset of winter last year, a variant set off a runaway outbreak — not unlike what appears to be building in India at the moment. A variant of the Sars-Cov-2 arises when the pathogen picks up multiple changes in its genome. It is natural for viruses to mutate when they replicate as they spread within a population. Molecular clock calculation estimated that the Sars-Cov-2 picked up two mutations on average every month. But the virus also picks up a combination of mutations that could change how it affects individuals — it can become less or more infective or lethal. In August, scientists in Singapore said they found a mutation that was milder — but in line with laws of evolution, it was overtaken by variants that were “fitter” in spreading. In mid-November, the first such significantly fitter variant arose in the UK, triggering a wave that the country took months to surmount. Scientists believe this sort of evolution will become a large part of the new normal. But science has also given us the tools that make adapting to this new normal possible. The process begins with identifying these mutations, their behaviour and prevalence. Thanks to global scientific collaboration, the first two are relatively easy to determine. It is the third aspect — determining how far a variant has spread and its containment — that is particularly difficult. This will require the government to step up genome surveillance; pharmaceutical companies to double down on vaccine production (and perhaps even come up with more resilient doses); and citizens to arm themselves with the two tools that can stop the virus, no matter what the variant — vaccines and appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid19-throws-up-a-new-challenge-101616682023905.html
25-03-2021||Editorials||The ecological concerns around river-linking projects||This week, the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to start work on the country’s first major project interlinking two rain-fed rivers, Ken and Betwa. The agreement was signed 18 years after the project was first conceived as a part of country’s programme to interlink rivers to provide water to areas facing scarcity. The project is expected to ensure drinking water to 6.2 million people and irrigate one million hectares of land in 13 districts across both states, the majority of which fall in the water-starved Bundelkhand region, which has seen back-to-back droughts in the last decade.Experts have flagged two concerns. First, project proponents fail to take into account the fact that the water crisis is not just a natural one; it’s partly man-made. The region’s granite topography does not allow rainwater to seep in and recharge the groundwater table, but this problem has been aggravated by policies that support faulty cropping patterns, encourage groundwater exploitation, degrade the soil and hack away at forest cover. Second, the project may submerge 6,107 hectares of the old and biodiverse forests of the Panna Tiger Reserve and Ken Ghariyal Sanctuary. This can impact water availability, rainfall patterns and destroy local ecosystems. Instead, the government could have pushed for low-cost, local interventions such as renovating and building water harvesting systems, desilting reservoirs and lakes and working towards a change in cropping patterns.The controversy over the river-linking project is not new; it’s a part of a larger development versus ecology debate that India faces with every big project. But in an era of climate crisis, which has a multi-sectoral impact, addressing ecological concerns is crucial and ensure long-term safety and benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-ecological-concerns-around-river-linking-projects-101616681844091.html
