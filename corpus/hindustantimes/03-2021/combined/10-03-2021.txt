She was admitted to IGM Hospital in Bhiwandi, which referred her to Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital or Kalwa hospital where she is now undergoing treatment. The girl, Abrish Fatima Irfan Ansari, is a resident of Noori Nagar in Bhiwandi. Her maternal grandfather Abdul Samad said, “Her father is a loom worker and was at home and her mother was busy with household chores. Abrish was playing outside when a stray attacked her face. Locals tried to rescue her, but she had suffered few serious injuries by then. We took her to IGM Hospital where she got anti-rabies shot.” Samad alleged that IGM Hospital made them wait for over half-an-hour and did not arrange an ambulance to shift the girl to Kalwa. “We had to pay for the ambulance. The doctors at Kalwa hospital said they will have to perform a surgery on her face after 48 hours.” Rajesh More, superintendent of IGM Hospital in Bhiwandi, said, “The patient arrived around 12.30pm on Wednesday. She had third stage of injuries, wherein it is essential to give anti-rabies serum which is available only at district hospitals or medical colleges. We cleaned the wounds and applied first aid. We also gave anti-rabies injection to the patient and recommended her to Kalwa. The family themselves arranged private ambulance.” Bhimrao Jadhav, dean of Kalwa hospital, confirmed that the patient was undergoing treatment at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3yearold-girl-attacked-by-stray-dog-near-mumbai-101615400911112.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||MVA ups ante on Delkar suicide case; Mumbai Police books Praful Patel||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has upped the ante over the suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar. A day after declaring a special investigation team (SIT) probe in the matter, state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday told the state Legislative Council that the Mumbai Police booked Dadra and Nagar Haveli administrator Praful Patel in connection with Delkar’s suicide. Patel, , who was named in Delkar’s suicide note, has been booked under Prevention of Atrocities Act.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the case was registered only after statements of his family members were recorded. “We would have booked him long back, but we waited for his family to come. A case was registered only after recording their statements,” Thackeray told reporters.“We did not jump the guns like opposition has been doing in Hiran case. The case against Patel has been taken only after Delkar’s wife and son gave us statement against him,” he said while taking to mediapersons in the Vidhan Bhavan complex. In Lok Sabha, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule on Wednesday demanded a probe by the committee on privileges of the parliament into the allegations made by Delkar in his last speech in September last year. She said the committee should probe the reasons that lay impediments in discharging duties by MPs. Sule also submitted a memorandum in this regard to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla along with MPs from other parties such as the Congress, Shiv Sena, Samajwadi Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC).The Sena along with other opposition parties also took up the issue of Delkar’s suicide in the Parliament. Sena’s Lok Sabha MP Vinayak Raut said the Union Territory’s administration was harassing the seven-time MP.Delkar, 58, a sitting MP from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, was found dead in a hotel in Marine Drive, south Mumbai on February 22. In his suicide letter, he blamed Patel, who was the minister of state for home when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat.“There has been a demand for inquiry in the suicide of Mohan Delkar. His suicide note mentions that he committed suicide due to pressure from Patel. Based on the complaint received by Abhinav Delkar, a case has been registered under Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989. Dadra and Nagar Haveli administrator Praful Patel has also been booked,” Deshmukh said in the upper House.“The fact that a seven-time member of Lok Sabha was reportedly frustrated to such an extent that it would drive him to extreme despair and steps to end his life is traumatic for all of us. In his last speech in Lok Sabha, he had expressly mentioned the pressure and humiliation mounted on him by officials of the local administration of Dadra and Nagar Haveli... I humbly request you (Speaker) to inquire into the allegations made by the late member on the floor of the House in September 2020 by referring it to the committee on privileges,” she said in the memorandum.“It is not just a loss of life but also a strike on the dignity of the Parliament. The independence and supremacy of the Parliament rests on the discharge of duties by its members fresh of any fear and duress,” states the letter.She also said the Maharashtra government has ordered a SIT to probe his death, and the inquiry by committee of privileges will have no bearing on the criminal investigation by the SIT.“Mohan Delkar, who was an MP for nearly 30-32 years, unfortunately had to commit suicide due to harassment by many administrative officers there. Mohan Delkar wrote a letter in Gujarati and through it we can come to know how much he was harassed by the Dadra and Nagar Haveli administration. He also complained to the privilege committee. Delkar, in the meeting of the committee, had said that if they do not intervene, he would have to commit suicide. Why should such a time arise for a MP to say this,” the Sena MP said in Lok Sabha.“MVA in Maharashtra has given the probe to SIT. I wish to appeal to the Prime Minister to hold whoever is responsible for the death of Mohan Delkar. Superintendent of Police, Administration, Collector, etc should be suspended and booked under [section] 304 [of the Indian Penal Code],” Raut added.On Tuesday, Delkar’s wife Kalaben and son Abhinav met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and the home minister at Vidhan Bhavan. Later, the Mumbai Police recorded Abhinav’s statement at Marine Drive police station.“My late father has named Praful Khoda Patel in his suicide letter, who is the administrator of the Union Territory. His public humiliation is the main cause behind his suicide that was going on for the past 16-18 months,” Abhinav told reporters in Vidhan Bhavan premises.“Formation of a SIT in this case is a big thing for us. We trust the Maharashtra government and the police. We believe that we will get justice in the state. Our only request to the state government is to complete the probe at the earliest and take action against the guilty. The CM (Thackeray) has assured us of the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-ups-ante-on-delkar-suicide-case-mumbai-police-books-praful-patel-101615400610651.html
10-03-2021||Lucknow||Father of 13-year-old rape survivor run over by truck in Kanpur||The father of a 13-year-old gang rape survivor died in Kanpur on Wednesday after being hit by a truck outside a health centre where the girl was undergoing medical examination. The incident occurred a day after the father pressed gang-rape charges against the son of a local police officer and his friends.In an FIR filed by the brother of the deceased on Wednesday, the family alleged that the incident was orchestrated by the accused. They also alleged that the police was initially reluctant to file a gang-rape complaint and that they made the survivor undergo medical examination five times.“They were not given any protection. We want stern action against those police officers, their tactics broke my brother in a matter of hours, and he is not with us as a result,” said the survivor’s uncle.Superintendent of police (rural) Brijesh Srivastava said the allegations were being looked into.A truck hit the father when he stepped out of the health centre in Ghatampur for a cup of tea, Kanpur deputy inspector general of police Preetinder Singh said. He was rushed to the Lala Lajpat Rai hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, Singh added. The truck driver was yet to be traced.“The incident is tragic and it will be investigated by a team headed by an ASP-rank officer,” said Srivastava.On Tuesday morning, the father told police that three men dragged her minor daughter into the fields while she went out to collect fodder and raped her. The gang-rape allegedly occurred on Monday evening.The accused were identified as Golu Yadav, Deepak Yadav and Saurabh Yadav. Golu was arrested but Deepak — the son of a sub-inspector — and Saurabh were absconding, officials said. Five teams have been formed to track the accused.The family said shortly after the gang-rape complaint was filed on Tuesday, the accused assaulted the father and were pressuring him to withdraw the case filed under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. Police said Saurabh also threatened the minor of dire consequences if she told anyone about the incident.“When my brother was coming to the police station, the accused Deepak Yadav and others accosted and assaulted him,” the uncle said. “They threatened him with dire consequences for pursuing the case,” he added.The family said the police was reluctant from the beginning to register a complaint and sent the minor girl for medical examination five times in a span of eight hours. She was examined twice at the local health centre, twice at the community health centre in Ghatampur and once at the hospital in Kanpur, some 70 km from her village.The girl and her father left for Ghatampur around 11pm on Tuesday for the fifth medical examination. They remained at the CHC the entire night as the doctor was not available.“All these points would be covered in the inquiry that would be conducted by additional superintendent of police level officer,” said a police officer on condition of anonymity.Protests erupted after the death of the father on Wednesday. In a statement, the district administration said the family will be given ₹5 lakh from the chief minister’s relief fund.In 2019, UP reported the most number of crimes against women, roughly one every 10 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Experts say that uneven law enforcement, feudal attitudes and lack of education contribute to the lack of safety for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/father-of-13-year-old-rape-survivor-run-over-by-truck-in-kanpur-101615400151259.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Praful Patel demanded ₹25 crore from my father, alleges Mohan Delkar’s son||Dadra and Nagar Haveli administrator Praful Patel had allegedly demanded ₹25 crore from late Member of Parliament (MP) Mohan Delkar. Patel also allegedly wanted to take over Delkar’s educational trust, alleged Abhinav Delkar, son of the late Parliamentarian, in his police complaint. Besides booking Patel and others on charges of abetting the suicide, cops charged them under relevant sections of extortion and Atrocities Act.Abhinav has further alleged that Patel conspired with key bureaucrats of Dadra and Nagar Haveli including district magistrate (DM) and superintendent of police (SP) and was allegedly harassing Delkar by various means and left him with no choice but to take the extreme step. Marine Drive police on Tuesday recorded Abhinav’s statement, on the basis of which an FIR has been registered. He has named a total of nine people in the complaint including Patel, DM Sandeep Singh, then SP Sharad Darade, deputy DM Apurva Sharma, sub-divisonal officer Manasvi Jain, police inspector Manoj Patel and Rohit Yadav, Fatehsingh Chauhan and Dilip Patel (Talathi). While Patel was not available for comment, Sandeep Singh and Sharad Darade did not respond to phone calls and messages.Delkar, who hails from Scheduled Tribes and known as a leader fighting for tribals rights, was found dead in a hotel in south Mumbai on February 22. Preliminary probe indicated that the seven-term MP died by suicide. Delkar had left behind a 15-page suicide note which he had written in Gujarati on his official letterhead. In the letter, he had blamed Patel and others for the extreme step, police officers said.His son Abhinav told the police that on Patel’s orders, local administration was targetting and harassing Delkar for nearly one year. “Patel had demanded ₹25 crore as extortion from my father and threatened to jail him under PASA (Puducherry Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act) if he doesn’t do so,” Abhinav alleged.“Patel wanted to take control of SSR College for Pharmacy and Management, which is a renowned educational institute in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and belongs to a trust established by Delkar. Patel wanted to usurp the college’s land which is worth ₹100 crore in today’s market and was intimidating Delkar through administrative actions,” his son alleged.Patel was threatening the MP since over a year over the college and wanted to have eight of the total 11 trustees. Abhinav has specified seven key instances in the FIR in which Delkar was being targeted by the local administration.He pointed out that his father’s name was removed from the official function of Dadra and Nagar Haveli’s Liberation Day, which is held on August 2. On this day, as part of the 66-year-old tradition, the MP gives a speech after administrator’s speech. But his father’s name was dropped from the function to insult him, Abhinav alleged. Later the parliamentary had also complained about this issue to Lok Sabha privilege committee and Speaker.Abhinav cited a letter of resident deputy DM Apurva Sharma, dated September 2, 2020, in which Delkar was insulted.Similarly Delkar was deliberately not invited in another government function held on December 17-18, last year, in which a Union minister had come to Dadra-Nagar Haveli for an inauguration function. Abhinav also alleged that to target his father, on the directions of then SP Sharad Darade, police inspector Manoj Patel had re-opened an old case (CR 137/2003) in order to try to implicate his father in the case. “One close aide of Patel, Fatehsingh Chauhan during 2019 elections had created a video in which false and serious allegations were made against my father and spread it all over on social media in order to harass him. My father had then slapped him a defamation notice too,” Abhinav said.He further alleged that the Talathi Dilip Patel had on February 18 this year made a false complaint of his father with the administrative office. Delkar’s son alleged that the accused people have conspired together and would not follow his father’s order, would not do his official works, ignore his directions and would not invite him in government functions and also intentionally ignore felicitating him.The FIR also states that between December 18, 2020 and January 19, 2021, Delkar had made complaints against the accused people to the Prime Minister, home minister Amit Shah, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Lok Sabha standing committee president Bhupendra Yadav. During the hearing of his complaint in Lok Sabha standing committee, Delkar had said, “If harassment to me is not stopped, then I would be left with no option but committing suicide.” However, after this, the accused got more aggressive and allegedly started harassing him more, states the complaint.Abhinav said that he had advised his father to file complaints, but Delkar had told him that he was scared that if he approached the court, Patel would go to any extent to make his life a hell.Patel and eight other accused have been booked under sections 306 (abatement to suicide), 506 (criminal intimidation), 389 (putting person in fear of accusation of offence, in order to commit extortion), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and section 3 (1)(n), 3 (1)(p), 3(2)(ii) 3(2)(va) of Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989.The allegations made by the complainant are yet to be proved and due verification and investigation would be carried out by the special investigation team ordered by the home department, said a police officer. Deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Shashi Meena refused to speak on the matter as it is an ongoing investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/praful-patel-demanded-25-crore-from-my-father-alleges-mohan-delkar-s-son-101615400371780.html

Officials said the action comes after the company allegedly failed to pay dues for the land in question, forcing the authority to take possession after cancelling the allotment on February 11, 2021. The realty firm, however, called the action “unlawful” adding that it will approach the courts for relief.The authority had decided to issue a notice to the Wave Group on December 12 last year during its 200th board meeting, warning them that if the realty firm does not pay up, the allotment of the mixed-use land (residential and commercial), located at a prime location in the city, will be cancelled.“Since the Wave Group has not cleared its financial dues of around ₹2,500 crore, even after having been given an opportunity via a notice, the authority decided to cancel the allotment on February 11. On Wednesday, the team of officials from the authority took possession over 108,421.13 sqm of the land. At least 44,853.13 sqm out of the seized 108,421.13 sqm have been developed by the realty firm while the remaining 63,568 is not covered. As of now, the Wave Group has an additional 56,400 sqm of land with it,” said Ritu Maheshwari, the chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority said the Wave Group has constructed a 43-story building and another complex where three-10 storey buildings have been built on a covered area of 44,853.13 sqm.“We have sealed these two buildings,” said Maheshwari.The authority had on March 11, 2011 allotted 618,952 sqm to the realty firm in Sector 25A and 32 in Noida for a mega mixed-land (commercial and residential) use project. It was the biggest land deal of the year and the Wave Group had said it had wanted to develop a mega mixed-land use project with premium residential units and commercial space right in the centre of the city, said officials of the authority. However, amid slowdown in the real estate sector, the firm could not develop the land and returned about 454,131 sqm to the authority under a policy.When contacted, a spokesperson for the Wave Group, who asked not to be identified, said the action will affect the interest of investors and other stakeholders.“The Noida authority’s high-handed action is an illegal act which will cause massive loss to all stakeholders, including buyers. For reasons best known to them, the Noida authority is acting against settled norms and its own policies. We believe that we have a strong case. We are in the process of taking appropriate legal recourse against Noida authority so as to protect the interest of all stakeholders,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-100-000-sqm-owned-by-wave-group-in-noida-seized-firm-says-will-approach-court-101615400129880.html

10-03-2021||Noida||Noida: Health dept holds mental health camp at Bhangel CHC||Noida:The Gautam Budh Nagar health department organised a mental health camp at the community health centre (CHC) in Noida’s Bhangel on Wednesday and examined 35 patients from the neighbouring areas.A specialised team of doctors and psychiatrists examined the patients and gave them free medicines.A number of people suffered stress and mental health issues and the camp is important for them, according to Bhangel CHC medical superintendent Dr Yatendra Singh. “People are stressed due to financial problems, family issues and personal issues. People suffer from anxiety and insomnia. On the direction of the Uttar Pradesh health department, we organised a health camp where physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists provided overall treatment and counselling, and prescribed medicines to the patients,” Singh said.The health department started preparations for this camp a week ago. “We had informed the Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery and ASHA workers to visit the neighbouring areas and inform people about the camp,” he said.According to the doctors, lack of sleep, shivering in hands and legs, unnecessarily doubting people, unwanted fear, thinking about the same thing repeatedly, mobile phone addiction, etc. could be a sign of mental issues. “At times, people also fear supernatural elements. It is also a mental health issue,” Singh added.Some of the patients said they lost jobs and started suffering from insomnia, headache and panic attacks.Amit Kumar, a resident of Salarpur village, said he had lost his job during the lockdown and returned to his hometown in Raebareli in April 2020. “I was jobless for about six months and developed symptoms of insomnia. I always wondered how to feed my family. I recently found a job at a private company in Noida. I had gone to the mental camp,” Kumar said.Satvinder Singh, a resident of Noida Sector 101, said he works at a mobile phone company. “I started feeling stressed following the Covid-19 lockdown. There is always a sense of insecurity that if I go outside, I may get infected. I have been suffering from insomnia for a few months,” he said.Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Noida chapter, said there is a need for more mental health camps. “We need to create awareness about mental health issues among the people. If people sneeze or suffer from fever, they suspect they have Covid-19 infection. They overthink, which leads to mental health issues. Many people lost jobs and are stressed. Private and government hospitals should organise similar camps and help people get out of this situation,” Sharma said.The CHC had also organised a parallel camp for the general Outpatient Department (OPD) where some 275 patients were treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-health-dept-holds-mental-health-camp-at-bhangel-chc-101615399949405.html
10-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: One killed, two hurt as security guard fires at sleeping workers||Ghaziabad: One man died while two others were injured when a 46-year-old security guard early Tuesday allegedly opened indiscriminate fire at some workers of a private firm in the Bulandshahr Industrial Area.Police said the suspect was nabbed by a police team during a search operation and 18 live cartridges were recovered allegedly from his possession.The suspect, Gyandendra Singh, from Farukkhabad in Uttar Pradesh, was booked for murder and attempt to murder (sections 302 and 307, of the Indian Penal Code, respectively) in an FIR lodged at the Kavi Nagar police station. The police also levied provisions of the Arms Act.The deceased victim was identified as Raju Yadav, from Siwan in Bihar, while the two injured were identified as Umesh Kumar and Vijay Kumar. All nine workers on which licensed fun was allegedly fired were engaged in welding and grinding jobs at the company.The incident took place around 3.30am at the guard room situated near the main entrance of the firm, where the nine workers were sleeping.“Hearing a loud noise, I woke up and realised that someone was firing gunshots from the window. All of us woke up and rushed to find corners of the room where we could hide to avoid bullets. The suspect fired two more rounds and one hit Raju Yadav, while others sustained pellet injuries,” alleged one of the survivors, also named Raju Yadav, who filed the police complaint.“After firing three shots, we heard more shots being fired in the air. The suspect was searching for another guard, Satish Kumar, with whom he had had a fight and whom he wanted to kill. But Satish was sleeping in the other room. Yadav (the victim) had the night shift, but he came back early from work and went to sleep. After firing the shots, the suspect latched the room from outside and fled to a nearby park,” the survivor added in his police complaint.The workers then called up the police emergency helpline number and a team was rushed.“The suspect was nabbed from the industrial area after a three hour search. He tried to resist but our team overpowered him. We seized his licensed gun and live cartridges. The suspect had a fight with one other guard (Satish Kumar) and fired into the workers’ room thinking he must be asleep there. But Satish was in the other room and the suspect ended up killing another worker and injuring two others. The victim was rushed to a hospital but was declared dead. The two injured victims are stable,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-one-killed-two-hurt-as-security-guard-fires-at-sleeping-workers-101615399649340.html
10-03-2021||Noida||2 Bawaria gang members nabbed in Noida||Noida: The Noida police nabbed two members of the infamous Bawaria gang early Wednesday morning, following a gunfight in which the duo was injured.The suspects were identified as Pawan and Shivram, both residents of Jarcha village in Dadri of Gautam Budh Nagar.Police teams were formed and check posts were set up following an input that the suspects were in Noida and planning to commit a crime in the city, according to the officials. The duo was stopped near a roundabout in Noida Sector 1 around 4.30 am, but they escaped. Other police teams were informed about this and they tried to stop the duo’s motorcycle — which they had stolen earlier — near Sector 14 A.“The duo opened fire at the police team chasing them, and was injured in a retaliatory firing. They were admitted to a district hospital.

10-03-2021||Gurugram||District administration starts survey to assess women’s safety in city||The district administration has started a public survey to assess the safety parameters of streets, public transport and workplaces for women in Gurugram. From gauging factors important for safety on roads to identifying black spots where women feel unsafe, the survey, which is being conducted online, will help the administration and other government agencies to take necessary measures for increasing security for women in the city. “The ultimate aim of the survey is to get an account of the problems at the ground level — like areas where women feel the most unsafe, identifying black spots so that police patrolling can be increased and similarly, changes required in the public transport system to make women feel secure,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram. The survey is part of the women’s safety campaign that is going to be launched on March 12. It has been divided into parts to gauge safety in public places, workplace and awareness and effectiveness of existing systems and services for women in distress, such as women helpline number and one-stop centre. A link to the survey has been made available on the social media pages of the district administration. It includes topics of public safety on streets, taking into account important factors of the presence of streetlights, people, street vendors and women on the streets, public transport connectivity, condition of footpaths and presence of CCTV cameras. The survey will assess safety in popular markets, malls, parks and religious places, and also gauge accessibility, functionality and maintenance of public toilets in Gurugram. “The purpose is to get quantitative and qualitative suggestions on existing public safety in the city along with awareness regarding existing government services. For this, the district administration has aligned with different departments to resolve concerns that will emerge through the survey,” said Nayonika, associate, Chief Ministers Good Governance Associate (CMGGA) Programme, who has been handling the project. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), Gurugram police and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) are also aligned with the programme. The survey also seeks suggestions on creating pedestrian-only stretches and seeks opinion on cycle tracks and safe pedestrian crossings to encourage non-motorised transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/district-administration-starts-survey-to-assess-women-s-safety-in-city-101615398690065.html
10-03-2021||Gurugram||Realtors, industrialists bank on upcoming budget for relief||City-based industries and businesses that are still reeling under the after-effects of the Covid-19-induced lockdown last year are expecting the Haryana government to announce relief measures in the upcoming state budget. Representatives of various organisations are hopeful of some relief to stakeholders as well as a boost to consumer sentiments. While the real estate industry, which is trying to make a comeback, wants tax cuts and stamp duty reduction, factory owners are seeking a package for small and medium industry to overcome the impact of the lockdown. The first budget since the lockdown will be presented by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday. Khattar had met industry leaders in Gurugram and Manesar on February 13 and 14, and taken feedback from the stakeholders over their expectations for the forthcoming budget. He had subsequently announced that the feedback would be taken into consideration while formulating the budget. Prashant Solomon, the spokesperson for the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), NCR, said that the government should try to cut stamp duty and taxes, which constitute almost 25% of a real estate cost and also create a mechanism to ease terms for finance to execute projects. “Neighbouring states have reduced taxes but Haryana has a higher rate, which makes housing expensive. Also, there is a need to create investment options like Reits (real estate investment trust) so that retail investors can put money in residential realty,” he said. Developers and industry leaders also want the Haryana government to review the local job quota introduced recently. “Entire labour force in the construction industry and allied works comes from outside. This move will greatly impact real estate and other industries and must be reviewed. The recent move to increase the tax on property registration in municipal areas is also a regressive move,” said Praveen Jain, vice-chairman, National Real Estate Development Council. Owners of factories engaged in manufacturing processes based in Udyog Vihar and Manesar want the government to provide easy funds for upgrading technology and machinery, measures to reduce pollution in industrial areas and also financial support to switch to green technologies. Associations have also sought that the government regularise non-conforming industrial areas as promised in 2017 and improve infrastructure in the industrial estates. JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association, said that industrial zones in non-conforming areas should be regularised and infrastructure in industrial estates and Industrial Development Centre, Gurugram, should be upgraded on priority. “Conversion charges for converting from industrial to commercial plots is very high at present and needs to be reduced. The augmentation charges for use of increased FAR should also be reduced. A relief package for the industry is the need of the hour,” he said. Deepak Maini, general secretary, Federation of Indian Industry, Haryana chapter, said that there is a need for budgetary support to upgrade machinery, allocate for pollution control and infrastructure augmentation in non-conforming industrial zones. “The government needs to take steps to ensure manufacturing remains competitive and sustainable if it wants the state to prosper, and see job growth. Special measures will have to be taken so that pollution is curtailed and industry can switch to green fuels,” he said. Many city-based factory owners also want the government to announce welfare measures for workers who are staying in unauthorised colonies and rented accommodation in villages. “There is a need to announce some monetary benefits for workers by the government, apart from what the industry is contributing to insurance and provident fund. There is a need to announce measures for promoting industrial and rental housing on a large scale,” said Pawan Yadav, president, IMT Industrial Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/realtors-industrialists-bank-on-upcoming-budget-for-relief-101615398689375.html

He said that officials will be making phone calls or be visiting the premises of defaulters. “If consumers fail to clear their dues or part of it within the given time period, we will disconnect the power supply to them and remove the meters from their premises,” he said.Officials said that the drive would continue till April-end, with the power supply to 5,000 defaulters, who owe ₹8 crore to the DHBVN, has already been disconnected.Residents across the city have previously complained of inflated electricity bills, with many having received more than double the amount they had paid for the corresponding period last year. Residents alleged that the problem has intensified since the DHBVN started issuing bills based on average consumption, following the installation of smart meters. It has also been alleged that the slow dispute resolution system of the power corporation has left them in the lurch. Several protests had taken place across the city last year due to the inflated bills.DHBVN caters to approximately 400,000 consumers in the city. As per official figures, 300,000 consumers are domestic users while the remaining comprises commercial, small power, medium supply, large supply, and bulk supply users. On average, the department generates annual revenue of ₹500 crore.Yadav said that they disconnected power after repeated notices elicited no payment. “If the payment is not made, DHBVN would have no option but to disconnect power. The consumer has to make the payment in every cycle and only then the electricity will be restored,” he said.The number of defaulters generally ranges between 6,000 and 8,000, and it has increased this time around, he said.A senior official said they have found that many consumers who rented properties had shifted their locations without paying their bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/power-department-to-remove-meters-of-bill-defaulters-101615398629747.html

This sheds light on the extent of information control and surveillance being carried out in Tibet,” he said.Sangay said that on December 24, 2020, authorities in the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) announced criminal prosecutions against individuals who use online communication tools to “split the country” and “undermine national unity”.It is not surprising, the 52-year-old exiled leader said, that China has been listed as the worst internet abuser in the world in Freedom House’s 2020 report on internet freedom.Similarly, China is ranked at the near bottom at 177th in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), he said.“Today, China’s tentacles have reached beyond Tibet by using its growing economic clout to jeopardise global democracy, according to Freedom House,” added Sangay.The political heir of the Dalai Lama said China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world. It highlights the CCP’s efforts to control and pressure Chinese citizens, he said, political dissidents and minority communities such as Tibetans, Uighurs and Hong Kong beyond its borders. The democracies around the globe must come together to thwart such assaults on global democracy.Over a million Tibetans have lost their lives in the past six decades under Chinese rule. Today, we have come together to collectively mourn this loss, said the Tibetan leader.But we are also here to mark the undaunted resilience of people in Tibet. Even under the threat of losing their lives, they continue to protest by protecting and preserving our language, our religion, our land, and our identity, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/china-violating-tibetans-rights-with-heightened-censorship-surveillance-cta-101615395449830.html

Punjab’s farmers have also targeted malls and petrol pumps belonging to Reliance, and have not allowed them to function. On March 8, deputy chief engineer, administration, PSPCL north zone, Jalandhar, issued a letter to other deputy chief engineers, superintendent engineers and others, seeking details of SIMs that the department has issued to employees. The letter had gone viral on social media. “Employees will be given Reliance Jio SIM, replacing the current Vodafone-Idea. You must send details of Vodafone-Idea SIM cards of your respective jurisdiction by 3pm. If details are not received, then the information of those who send in the details will be forwarded to the headquarters,” added the letter that RSP Randhawa had written. “This information was sought by the headquarters, so my office issued this letter. The contents of the letter (especially on Jio SIM cards) was written by mistake by the staff.” PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Prasad said, “We had floated tenders for mobile services for our employees. Three companies Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio took part, with Reliance Jio the lowest bidder and Vodafone-Idea the second lowest bidder in the tender process. The difference was around ₹60 lakh. As per rules, the tender went to Reliance Jio. No final decision has been taken yet.” With the letter going viral, several netizens and social media users slammed the Punjab government for, what they claimed, was its hobnobbing with Reliance Jio. Some comments also dubbed the move a betrayal of farmers’ cause. In January, Reliance Jio had moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking action against those involved in damaging its infrastructure and other properties in the state, amid the agitation against the three farm laws. The company claimed that over 1,500 of its telecom towers had been vandalised, crippling its mobile network in Punjab, where it has 14 million subscribers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farm-stir-pspcl-asks-staff-to-switch-to-jio-draws-flak-101615395090437.html

This was achieved without any collateral damage, Kumar said.“During the search operation, as the presence of militants was ascertained, they were given the opportunity to surrender, however, they fired indiscriminately upon the joint search party, which was retaliated, leading to an encounter,” a police spokesperson said, adding that one terrorist (Khwaja) was killed in the encounter and his body was retrieved from the site.Police said Khwaja was involved in several terror cases including attacks on security forces and civilians, besides being the main recruiter.“Dozens of cases have been registered against him in north Kashmir, which include grenade blast at Sopore bus stand in which 19 civilians sustained injuries on October 2019; rifle-grenade attack at Warpora police post which injured two cops in March 2019; attack on joint police/ CRPF party at Bismillah Colony, Sopore, in which four CRPF personnel got seriously injured and one among them, while being evacuated to hospital, succumbed to injuries; among several others.”Police said he was also involved in providing arms and ammunition to overground workers of the terrorist outfit for carrying out subversive activities in the area.“He was operating in the areas of north Kashmir, including Langate, upper/lower Qaziabad, Handwara, Sopore, Zainageer, Tujjar, Barahampora etc,” the spokesperson said.Incriminating materials, including arms and ammunition, were recovered from the site of the encounter. “All the recovered materials have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe his complicity in other terror crimes.”IGP Vijay Kumar said, “He was a resident of Kralgund, Langate, and one of the old militants who went to Pakistan in 2002 and returned the same year. A few years ago, he became an active terrorist again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sopore-encounter-al-badr-chief-s-killing-a-big-success-says-j-k-police-101615393173101.html

The UPPCB will aim to identify spots where the air pollution levels are high in a city so that effective measures can be taken to prevent it.The survey will be held in Ghaziabad, Noida, Kanpur, Lucknow, Prayagaraj, Varanasi and Agra.Barring, Varanasi and Prayagaraj, remaining cities usually record, poor, very poor, or severe, Air Quality Index as per CPCB data.“Our teams will work with local traffic department to identify crossings or certain sections of road where the air pollution levels are recorded higher than other places. If needed, we will divide the city into grids and work to identify the grids with higher air pollution. The focus will be on identifying areas with higher air pollution and permanent source of pollution which causes it,” said VK Singh, senior environmental engineer, UPPCB.“Once the two factors are identified we will work to eliminate source of the pollution in coordination with concerned departments,” Singh said.As per UPPCB officials, the survey will begin by late March and will take at least a month to complete. The board has also proposed a similar survey during winters to get more reliable data. “Pollution sources can change over a period of time. For example, in summers, emissions from generators cause more pollution than in winter. The survey will look into such aspects,” said Singh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcb-traffic-dept-to-identify-pollution-hotspots-in-up-cities-101615392808931.html

Tikait was addressing first Kisan Mahapanchayat in Sikandarpur of Ballia to mobilize the farmers of this region in support of the farmers’ movement. Tikait said, “Harvest your crops. After that a tractor and 15 people from every village should march to Delhi in support of the farmers’ movement against the new farm laws. As soon as the 15 farmers with a tractor each from the villages in the region will start marching towards Delhi, the government will have to repeal the laws.” Taking a dig at the centre, Tikait said, “The new agri laws are meant to snatch the lands of the farmers. Despite 12 rounds of dialogue and continuing farmer movement against these laws, the government is neither ready to repeal them nor making a concrete law on minimum support price (MSP).” Tikait alleged that the government ws plotting to divide the farmers. The farmer movement was sometimes referred to as the movement of Punjab and then movement of farmers of Haryana and then it was linked to Khalistan. But the farmers didn’t move away. Now it had become the movement of every farmer, he said. Tikait said that the farmers’ movement against the new agri laws was being discussed all over the world today, but the government was ignoring it. He said 2021 would be year of farmers’ movement, which would continue till the government repealed the farm laws and enacted a concrete law on MSP to give minimum support price to the farmers. He alleged that the centre wanted markets and small shops closed. “If small shops are closed, employment will come to an end.

Dalal said the official was reinstated in October 2020. As Sharma informed the House about the gravity of the matter, agriculture minister offered to hold a fresh probe, repeatedly promising that guilty will be punished.

10-03-2021||Lucknow||Discoms barred from levying electricity duty on those buying power from open market||The state’s all the five government-owned power distribution companies (discoms) have been restrained from realizing the electricity duty (ED) from the industries that buy power from other states through Open Access.The ban, according to a senior energy department official, comes after some industry captains recently met chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari and urged him to issue orders preventing discoms from levying ED on open access consumers against the rules, failing which, they cautioned, many industries might shift to other states for cheaper power.The development is being seen as a big ‘shock’ to the cash-strapped UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) that holds the five discoms since for it this will mean loss of around ₹800 crore revenue that it realises as ED from the Open Access consumers alone. Open Access is a system that enables consumers with heavy load to buy cheap power from the open market. This allows consumers to choose from a number of competitive power suppliers anywhere in the country rather than being forced to purchase electricity from local power utility. The local utility may realize wheeling charges from such consumers for wheeling other company’s power to them.Present rules allow any consumer having a contracted capacity of 1 MW or above, connected to an 11 kv or above to procure power under Open Access in UP. The electricity duty is charged on consumption at the applicable rate per unit of power consumed which means higher the consumption, higher the duty. The current ED rate in the state is 7.5% and it matters more to big consumers with heavy power consumption.Though electricity duty is levied and belongs to the state government, the same is collected by the UPPCL through monthly power bills but retains the entire amount as revenue grant by the government. UPPCL chairman M Devraj wrote a letter to all the discoms on March 2 asking them to keep in abeyance the realization of the ED from the Open Access consumers till the state government issues directions in this regard.“Presently, there is no clarity on the levy of electricity duty on the Open Access consumers. We have sought guidelines from the energy department in this regard. In keeping with the facts brought to our notice it would be desirable to keep the recovery of electricity duty liability from the Open Access consumers suspended till the UP government gives directions in this regard,” Devraj said in his letter.The development came after Gini Filaments Ltd chairman and managing director Shishir Jaipuria met chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari handing over a representation to him on the behalf of all industries here on February 12.In his representation he complained that discoms were recovering ED even from those industries that bought power from other states through the Open Access.Quoting the UPERC’s December 10, 2019 regulations, he pointed out that the regulations only talked of levy of Open Access charged and nowhere did they mention levy of electricity duty. “In any case, electricity duty cannot be levied on inter-state purchase of power and also the same cannot be levied on consumers as the duty is levied on the licencee,” Jaipuria argued.Demanding that the levy of ED on purchase of power under Open Access be withdrawn immediately to mitigate heavy financial burden on industries badly hit by the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic, he cautioned that not doing so might force many industries to migrate to neighbouring states in search of cheaper power.Earlier, Amit Gupta of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Ranjeet Mehta of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry also made the same demand through separate representations to the CS and then additional chief secretary, energy, Arvind Kumar.Another energy department official aware of the issue said industries’ demand for abolition of levy of ED on inter-state sale of power was legally justified. “The UPPL may try to get the rules changed to get the legal right to levy the ED on Open Access consumers but it is unlikely to succeed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/discoms-barred-from-levying-electricity-duty-on-those-buying-power-from-open-market-101615387648512.html

Rashmi’s family, including mother and brothers, now live in proper Meerut where there are many people who remember the couple’s deep association with western UP. “She was a student of psychology in CCS University from where she also contested student union polls for the post of president on ABVP ticket,” recalled Manoj Kumar Tripathi, a former lecturer of political science at CCS University. “The one thing that stands out about the couple is their easy approach as they are down to earth,” Tripathi recalled. “While Dr Rashmi is very humble, the new Uttarakhand CM also has a cool temperament. I remember the time when I was also in ABVP. There was BJP government in the state and we had gone to Garhwal for the ABVP convention when some political opponents burnt down the gate of the convention. Tirath was ABVP’s national secretary and yet he exercised great restraint and told us to not lose our cool. He said only dialogue could bring lasting peace,” Tripathi recalled. Ashwani Tyagi, an old RSS hand, treasurer of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh’s UP chapter and close family friend of the Rawats was expecting them in his village in Meerut sometime later this week. “They are fabulous people and I was expecting them at my place next week. But, now of course, it won’t be possible. I will invite them later,” Tyagi (who was present at the swearing-in ceremony) said on phone from Dehradun. Lal Singh Deshbandhu, an old RSS hand and another close family friend of the Rawats, said he was present when the Uttarakhand CM got married. “The marriage took place in Meerut. The couple knew each other from their ABVP days,” said Deshbandhu, who back then was an RSS functionary in Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-uttarakhand-cm-wife-have-a-strong-up-connect-101615387408519.html
10-03-2021||Other||Lockdown not “useful” now, but might be inevitable of people don’t follow rules: advisor to state govt on Covid-19||PUNE Even as multiple districts in the state are under lockdowns, or some sort of a curfew, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19, said that while lockdowns would restrict transmission, it would not be useful for the economy. Pune has been reporting the highest number of cases in the state over the past few days, with 2,000 cases being reported in a 24-hour period. An earlier study conducted by the National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune (NCCS), BJ Government Medical College, and the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), found that transmission of the virus was restricted during the lockdown. In the next two days, the state government is likely to take a review meeting to decide on local lockdowns, if need be. However, Dr Salunkhe is of the view that there is no need for a lockdown at this stage. He said, “Lockdown is not necessary as of now. While it does help in stopping transmission, it will prove counter-productive. If a lockdown is imposed then it would have to be parallel to the incubation period of the disease; so at least eight-10 days of lockdown would be needed. Those who are active right now have to stop the spread of the disease, so localised restrictions like micro-containment zones, contact tracing and testing is needed in these areas.” Dr Salunkhe added, “The focus should be on the concerned areas instead of imposing a lockdown on the entire city. I will project this same view in the upcoming meeting too.” A genomic study of samples of suspected Covid-19 patients were collected in April and May 2020 by the NCCS, BJ Medical and AFMC study.The samples were then confirmed positive by a real-time PCR for Sars-Cov-2 by the three institutes. The study published states: “A distinct novel pattern of mutations in closely located different districts of the same state, perhaps due to a strict and effective lockdown. In Pune, a novel variant has overtaken other strains. “Satara and Nashik also have unique mutations, but at a lower frequency. It would be interesting to study how these mutations affect viral fitness and virulence. Nonetheless, the lockdown resulted in an independent evolution of the Sars-Cov-2 viral variants.” The sudden rise in the number of cases in the district is raising questions of a second wave in Pune. Dr Salunkhe further added, “If cases keep rising this way and citizens continue to avoid Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, then the administration might be forced to impose a lockdown.” A Covid review meeting is to be held on Friday, and will be attended by officials and public representatives, including MPs, MLAs and health experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockdown-not-useful-now-but-might-be-inevitable-of-people-don-t-follow-rules-advisor-to-state-govt-on-covid19-101615386868709.html

All India Congress Committee in-charge for Himachal affairs Rajeev Shukla condemned the NDA regime.Shukla, in his speech, called ex-CM Virbhadra Singh ‘Sher-e-Himachal’.Addressing the protesters, he recalled PM Modi criticising the Congress party over inflation. “Oil prices are skyrocketing and the government says it’s not in their control. Then who should be held responsible?” he wondered.“Government properties are on sale and Modi is selling them one by one. It is clear that Modi is working for the capitalists. He doesn’t have any concerns for the country or the people,” he said.“In a way, the country’s heritage is being sold. Factories are being sold. It is clear that the country is not in safe hands,” he said.Shukla criticised the BJP and said that the party came to power by showing dreams of good days, but has pushed the country into unemployment and inflation.He heaped praises on the UPA government’s fiscal management and said that the government had kept inflation and prices well under control.“Despite reduction in crude oil prices, petrol and diesel are being sold at double the cost,” he said.Shukla accused BJP of trying to undermine the farmers. He said the government is buckling under pressure of corporate giants.State party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore, during the rally, said he is working dedicatedly on implementation of programmes assigned to him by the party high command.Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri slammed the Jai Ram Thakur-led Himachal government for it’s “financial mismanagement”.He hit out at the government over increasing unemployment rate. He even accused the government of making back-door recruitments.Former CM Virbhadra Singh also credited Congress for the country’s development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hp-cong-hits-at-bjp-for-spiralling-fuel-prices-101615386273406.html
10-03-2021||Other||TCS-Prayas report forecasts worst-case Covid scenario for Pune: Cases at 60% of last year’s peak||PUNE A joint report prepared by Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) and Prayas Health Group has suggested more curbs in Pune to control the number of Covid cases. The report has also predicted that in a worst-case scenario, Pune will have 60 per cent of the number of cases when the Covid infection was at its peak in September-October last year. A final decision on restrictions will be taken on Friday at the Covid review meeting, chaired by Pune guardian minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “Experts from TCS and Prayas have compared the proportion of infections prevailing last year and the percentage of infection today. They have also taken factors such as herd immunity and sero-prevalence into account, which was there last year. It has been correlated with the present scenario. They have forecast that in a worst-case scenario, the situation is not going to be as bad as last year. In quantifiable terms, the recount infection and the number of positive patients will not cross 60% of last year’s peak,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, following a meeting with the experts and the district and municipal authorities. To control the spread of infection, the report has suggested interventions. The continuation of closure of schools and colleges for at least the next two months has been recommended. Restrictions on bars, restaurants and eating joints have been recommended, but the type of restrictions has not been specified.“They have come up with the conclusion that bars, restaurants or any other place where people sit together for more than 30 minutes and interact with each other makes for low compliance of Covid norms. Hence, chances of infection are very, very high. So there should be clear measures and restrictions on these activities,” Saurabh Rao said. The report has also analysed the impact of reopening of gardens and playgrounds on the spread of Covid and it has been concluded that these places could be potential sources of infection. The report has also recommended a very low number of attendees at social, political gatherings and wedding ceremonies. Currently, 200 people are allowed to be present at public gatherings and wedding ceremonies. “There will be a pointwise discussion on Friday and decisions will be taken. MPs and MLAs have also been invited for the meeting on Friday,” Saurabh Rao said. Reacting to the curbs, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol denied any possibility of a lockdown, but hinted at more restrictions. “It is true that the number of Covid patients has been increasing in Pune. The number of active patients has reached around 7,000 in a month. We had imposed some restrictions earlier, but the number hasn’t reduced as expected. There will not be a lockdown, but to break the chain of the infection more restrictions are under consideration. Restrictions on gardens, swimming pools and marriage halls are under consideration,” Mohol said.Dr Vinay Kulkarni, coordinator, Prayas Health Group, clarified that the report can only guide the administration in the decision-making process, but the ultimate decisions are taken by the administration. “This is just an agent-based model. We just try to modulate the requirements of the administration. I do not give recommendations per se. Through our modelling, we can only indicate the cause and effect aspect. Those are futuristic predictions. We can only make predictions. Ultimately, administration has to decide,” Dr Kulkarni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tcsprayas-report-forecasts-worst-case-covid-scenario-for-pune-cases-at-60-of-last-year-s-peak-101615385968500.html

10-03-2021||Mumbai||One year of Covid: ‘We were never short of food’||Mohammad Shamshad Sher, 41, runs a small-scale embroidery business in Dharavi, catering to designers, tailors, wedding parties, and apparel brands. He had to shut shop on March 24 when the national lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.At the time, Mohammad rented three gallas, or makeshift shops in Dharavi, from where he operated his business. On his request, his landlords waived his rent, which cumulatively came to ₹45,000 a month, during the lockdown. Most of the 60 employees were migrants and returned to their villages in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and North Maharashtra, soon after the lockdown was announced.Mohammad’s business was affected almost immediately. With barely a few thousand rupees in the bank, he had several payments from customers still pending and unfinished consignments left to deliver. All work came to a standstill and even routine customers, customers spread across Maharashtra in Jalna, Aurangabad, Akola, Jalgaon, Mumbai and Pune, refused to advance him money.What followed were months of uncertainty and financial instability for Mohammad and his employees.“In our line, we have money only if there is work. We need a pipeline of consignments to earn. There is no concept of saving as such. It’s not hand to mouth, but it is close. Lockdown months were hard. I had no hope of recovering my losses and debt began to mount month after month. But the situation was worse for my employees,” said Mohammad.Also Read: Lessons in lockdown in MumbaiSome who remained continued to live in the gallas -- each galla has an attached toilet and a small stove to cook meals on; the work tables are folded up and set against the wall at night to make space for sleeping -- but they could not continue to work due to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's instructions, despite having pending items on their list.Food was available in plenty, because of the charity work many organizations took up in Dharavi during lockdown. “We never had to worry about what we will eat. Someone or the other came and gave us food packets. But then, we lived through eight-nine months with no concept of savoury food. Everyone ate whatever they got,” he said.By November, some of his former employees began to return to work, but Mohammad cannot afford to hire more than 10 people. Work has come down to four days a week, from six. “I cannot call my labour back from their home towns. If I do, I have to guarantee them work. But what if another lockdown is announced? I am giving employment to whoever has come of his own will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-year-of-covid-we-were-never-short-of-food-101615383518127.html

We had already completed all the necessary planning and technical drawing. Therefore, it was not possible to extend the flyover. So, PMC took the decision to cancel the project.”“We will consider the demand of APMC in future with a fresh proposal of the flyover with extension up to Gangadham chowk,” he said.PMC standing committee had approved around 15 crore to construct another Y-shaped flyover at Warehouse chowk near Market Yard to avoid traffic congestion which will be created due to Dice plot slum area to Giridhar Bhavan fly over.The Poona Merchant Chamber had also demanded to extend the flyover stretch. However, the municipal corporation sanctioned the original plan of a Y-shaped flyover.According to APMC officials, Shivneri road and Nehru road are passing through APMC premises and are a part of APMC. A Y-shaped flyover is being constructed in the APMC area.“We had already demanded to extend the flyover towards Gangadham chowk by 150 metres to avoid traffic congestion on Shivneri road. More than 100 shops will be affected if the flyover will not be extended. We had raised our concern during PMC officials’ site visit for the project,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-scraps-y-shaped-flyover-project-at-market-yard-101615377028029.html

10-03-2021||Chandigarh||Rift in SAD after Kairon backs kin on Valtoha’s turf for 2022 poll||A rift in the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has come to the fore with former minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon announcing his support for a family member in Khemkaran constituency, the turf of SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha, in the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. Though the elections are scheduled early next year, Kairon has started holding village meetings in Khemkaran. He addressed public meetings at Punian, Margindpura, Khara Ram Singh and Amarkot villages of the constituency on Tuesday and a gathering at Sursingh village on Wednesday. During his address at one of the meetings, Kairon said that voters of Khemkaran have been asking him to serve in the area and he couldn’t ignore their request. “After discussing with my family, I’ve accepted the people’s decision. A member of our family will serve you. Though we will all serve you, but the candidate will be from our family,” Kairon said. He said at the time of his grandfather and former chief minister Partap Singh Kairon, many villages of Khemkaran were a part of Patti constituency. He said his family was emotionally attached to the people of the area and promised that he would be available whenever the need arises. Kairon lost the Patti seat in 2017 to Harminder Singh Gill of the Congress. Kairon’s political adviser Gurmukh Singh Ghulla of Balehar village in Khemkaran has been at the forefront of organising the recent public meetings. Akali rally at Amarkot on March 15 Former Khemkaran MLA Valtoha termed Kairon’s actions as an attempt to join the Congress. Valtoha said Kairon and his family members can fight the election from Khemkaran, but not on the Akali ticket. “The SAD is not the party of Kairon’s father. He has already lost ground in Patti, where he has not shown up. I will urge the party high command not to give him the ticket from Patti as he has been betraying us for years. If the party allows, I’ll field one of my family members to contest from there,” Valtoha said. There are reports that the Kairon family wants to put up its loyalists in Tarn Taran, Khadoor Sahib and Jandiala constituencies also. This comes days before the Akali Dal rally at Amarkot in Khemkaran on March 15 against the working of the Congress government in the state. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal will be at the rally. Valtoha confident of getting SAD ticket Valtoha said, “I’ll fight the election from Khemkaran on the SAD ticket. The party chief will announce this from Khemkaran.” An aide of former minister Bikram Singh Majithia, Valtoha is also the party’s Tarn Taran district president. Kairon and he have been at loggerheads, though not publicly, for the last one decade. Valtoha won the 2007 and 2013 assembly elections on the party’s ticket from Khemkaran. He lost to Sukhpal Singh Bhullar of the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rift-in-sad-after-kairon-backs-kin-on-valtoha-s-turf-for-2022-poll-101615374868657.html

10-03-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal announces free Ayodhya pilgrimage for senior citizens||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced free pilgrimage to the Ram Temple in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya for senior citizens when it will be ready. Speaking in the assembly, Kejriwal invoked Lord Hanuman, Lord Ram, and the idea of Ram Rajya to present 10 principles for governance in Delhi including those related to access to food, quality education, shelter, water, electricity, and employment.“Lord Ram is revered by all. I am a devotee of Hanuman and Lord Ram. Ram Rajya [the rule of Lord Ram] is considered an ideal welfare state. If we can take inspiration from Ram Rajya to achieve an ideal welfare state in Delhi, our lives will be successful. In Delhi, we are now trying to do that. Therefore, we have made 10 principles based on Ram Rajya, which my government will follow,” Kejriwal said.The first principle, which he said will be followed, is to ensure nobody is left hungry in normal times or in a Covid-19 pandemic-like situation. He added the remaining principles will ensure quality education for every child, universal access to good medical services, clean water, electricity, respect of senior citizens, shelter, the safety of women, equality for all irrespective of religion, caste, economic status. Kejriwal said the excuse that the Delhi police is not under the state government for ensuring the safety of women will not do.Also Read | Kejriwal calls budget inclusive, says education will be made a mass movementKejriwal highlighted how his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government installed CCTV cameras across the city and now plans to set up mohalla clinics exclusively for women.“Delhi cannot progress if it does not respect the senior citizens living in the city. For them, we launched the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana, which allows them to visit various places of worship across the country free of cost. Everything from their travel, accommodation, and food is taken care of by the Delhi government under the scheme,” he said.“Now, the grand Ram temple is being built in Ayodhya. Once the temple is ready, the Delhi government will include Ayodhya’s Ram temple also to its free pilgrimage scheme,” Kejriwal said.He took a swipe at his Uttar Pradesh counterpart, Yogi Adityanath, for “staging” a government school inspection in what he called “Manish Sisodia style”. Sisodia is the deputy chief minister and education minister of Delhi, who recently challenged the Uttar Pradesh government for a debate on the condition of government schools in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state as compared to those in Delhi under the AAP government.“It was evidently a set-up location for the video. But I am happy that ministers are now focusing on such aspects of governance... The work done on the education front in Delhi by the AAP government in the last 5-6 years is a revolution. But why did it not happen in the last 70 years?” he asked. “The two main political parties that ruled this country for decades seem to have deliberately kept its people uneducated so they could serve as crowds at their rallies and public events... would never question their policies effectively. The two parties deliberately kept people uneducated to create their vote banks, so the rich could get cheap labour. If the people of this country get access to good education, then these parties will be routed just like the Congress got wiped from Delhi,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-announces-free-ayodhya-pilgrimage-for-senior-citizens-101615373968587.html
10-03-2021||Dehradun||Tirath Rawat emerges as BJP's surprise selection for CM post in Uttarakhand||The BJP leadership on Wednesday morning named Pauri Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat as the new chief minister of Uttarakhand, ending the buzz around the likes of cabinet minister Dhan Singh Rawat, former CM and Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Rajya Sabha member Anil Baluni.The decision however, surprised many including state leaders and ministers as till Tuesday night nobody thought about Tirath's name for the post until the BJP legislature party meeting on Wednesday morning, presided over by party’s central observers including former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and state unit in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam."With the names of Dhan Singh, Nishank and Baluni making the rounds since the last few days, nobody in the party expected that MP Tirath would be named for the CM post," said a party MLA on condition of anonymity.He said, "We all were surprised when his name was announced as it was the decision of party central leadership."Another party leader and a senior cabinet minister said they never expected Rawat to emerge as the chief ministerial candidate till Tuesday night. "Dhan Singh and Central minister Nishank" were among the top two candidates."Dhan Singh was seen as a balancing act being a Thakur from Garhwal division as the party state president is a Brahmin from Kumaon division. Also, he is a close aide of Trivendra Singh Rawat. On the other hand, former CM Nishank was strongly lobbying for the post since the last three days. His aides in Haridwar were in Dehradun projecting Nishank as the new CM," said the minister.He however, added that despite running ahead in the race, both Dhan Singh and Nishank's names had some constraints."Dhan Singh would not have been accepted by other leaders as he is a junior among the major party leaders and his closeness to Trivendra Singh Rawat would have again created a problem among other senior leaders, who don't have a good equation with the outgoing CM. On the other hand, Nishank would have also faced opposition within party, as he too doesn’t have good equation with many senior leaders," said the minister, adding, "Tirath is a non-controversial person and rose in the state politics after starting as an RSS member, which went in his favour."State school education minister Arvind Pandey, who was present in the legislature party meeting on Wednesday morning, said Tirath's name was proposed by Trivendra Singh Rawat."It was Trivendra Singh Rawat who proposed his name in the meeting which was supported by all. In BJP, organisation is always big and not any leader. Today's decision made this fact evident," said Pandey.Also Read: Tirath Singh Rawat sworn-in as Uttarakhand CM, to be in office for nearly a yearThe Opposition Congress, however, attacked the BJP by saying that the change in leadership "confirmed that four years of this government were a complete failure."Leader of Opposition, Indira Hridayesh said, "Since the last four years, we have been saying that this government is anti-development and a complete failure. Now, our claim has been confirmed by the BJP high command which changed the CM.""However, nothing will happen with this change as the public has decided to throw BJP out of power in 2022," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/tirath-singh-rawat-s-choice-as-new-uttarakhand-cm-surprised-many-party-leaders-101615373703071.html
10-03-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 9 including 5 women held for assaulting & stripping girl, mother||Nine persons have been arrested by Rajasthan police for allegedly assaulting and stripping a 19-year-old girl and her mother, police said on Wednesday. Police came to know about the incident after the video of the assault was highly circulated on local groups on social media.“During investigation we came to know that the incident was almost one month-old and the root cause of the scuffle was ‘Nata’,” said a senior police official familiar with the development of the case.Nata Pratha, a centuries-old custom in Rajasthan, allows men to live with women they are not married to. Women who follow the regressive practice leave their children behind when they go to live with another man. In this tradition, a man has to pay money to the woman he wants to be with, outside his marriage. And the amount is decided by the woman's parents and members of her community.“This social evil still exists in many communities of the state. In this case too, the victim got married to a man some five-years-ago and later went on Nata with another man. Further, the victim entered into a relationship with another married man, whose family is accused in the case. Both decided to live together,” the police official said.Also Read: Rajasthan CM: 1st dose of vaccination stopped at health centers due to shortageHe added, “On February 6, when the victim and her mother went to convince the family members of the wife of the accused, they stripped the mother-daughter duo naked and also beat them. Somebody filmed the entire incident and two days ago, the video went viral. However, when police investigated the case, the matter was settled in a community gathering in writing. But on Monday, the video was circulated in the groups after which a case was registered, and nine accused were identified and arrested.” Five of the nine accused are women.

10-03-2021||Delhi||A home away from home||One often relates old age and retirement with a sedentary lifestyle, giving up one’s own interests and only having familial responsibilities to look after. However, as times change, many are willing to treat these golden years of life as the time to be independent and socially connected within a safe environment, instead of battling isolation, social poverty and being dependent on their children.“In old age, there are three categories. There is young-old (60-75 years), middle-old (75-85 years) and old-old (85-plus), where one typically needs support in day-to-day living due to various personal or medical reasons,” says Arun Gupta, managing trustee and chief executive, Age Ventures India (AVI), which has been working with real estate developers and other social organisations, supporting them in setting up retirement homes as well as providing care and service to the elders. After successfully running two such homes in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, new ones are set to come up in Gurugram, Kolkata and Jabalpur.There’s also a new vertical — AVI Care Home — for elders needing assistance with activities of daily living, care for dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and post-surgery care for short to long term. There will also be a day care facility. Elaborating on the need for elderly day care, Gupta says, “It could get difficult for the elderly to stay with three different generations. Maybe their children are going to work, grandkids are at school; who will be there to take care of the aged then?” He states that these care homes — one such named Hibiscus-AVI Care Home in Gurugram — allows elders to spend time among people of their own age group and build new bonds rather than being lonely.The facility in Gurugram has a medical room, physiotherapy room, wellness corner, a well-equipped kitchen, and a multi activity room. As per their website (www.ageventuresindia.org), there are three types of rooms — a fully-fitted high dependence care room, a semi-fitted flexible dependence/ normal care room, and suites as well. Residents can opt for single rooms, shared rooms or on double occupancy basis. The monthly cost of day care facility starts from ₹30,000. Long-term care for a couple with normal medical care, physiotherapy, rent, meals, power, etc. costs roughly over a lakh a month, excluding taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-home-away-from-home-101615369470174.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||JNU students reclaim library, reading room spaces||With the month of May approaching, students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University are nearing their deadline to submit thesis, dissertations and research papers. The students of JNU protested on the campus on Wednesday - after days of requesting the administration - to reopen libraries in the campus, so that they may be able to complete their research work in time. The BR Ambedkar library and reading rooms, have been one of the focal points of congregation for all research scholars on campus, who often head to these facilities for a study and research session in their day to day student life at JNU. “There was a demand of opening the library by the students since a long time. The need for the library and reading rooms has become urgent now because we have our NET and JRF papers by May and students also have to submit their thesis by then,” shares Qasim Masumi, an MPhil student who was one amongst the scores of students who had protested physically for the library to open. “Hundreds of students gathered, protested, entered and reclaimed the library premises at JNU today,” adds Masumi.The students protested and entered the library claiming myriad of reasons that have been impacting their studies. “Some students had left books and reading materials in library. How will we do our research work without access to the journals there? All students facing these problems united to protest along with the university’s student union. The guards were stopping us from entering the library but we managed to step in. We maintained all Covid guidelines inside the library. And now we are trying that the administration doesn’t shut the library down again, by studying there and we will make sure we use it so it’s not shut down. The library won’t be empty any time soon. We have our exams coming up and we need this space,” says Vasudev Chakravarti, a Master’s student.Online classes aren’t much help to research scholars and students in the university and the need for books and reading rooms is felt by hostellers too. “Hostels don’t have proper reading rooms or places to study. If now the university doesn’t take regard of our needs then there will be drop outs. We are research students. We need access to reading material. Online classes and webinars won’t suffice. Students in JNU come from rural areas of our country and don’t have internet access or smart phones so it is a complete digital divide. We protested because we had no other choice,” says Harendra Sheshma, a PhD student at JNU.Aishe Ghosh, president, JNUSU shares that many students had been reaching out to her regarding the problems they were facing in absence of access to libraries. “The JNUSU , time and again had reminded the JNU Administration, to re-open library along with seating capacity, which didn’t come to any conclusion. Today, we had given a call for a protest to study at library, thereby reclaiming the library which was forcefully locked for past one year,” she adds.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jnu-students-reclaim-library-reading-room-spaces-101615368330086.html
10-03-2021||Kolkata||Split in Gorkha Janmukti Morcha may help BJP in Bengal's hill region||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s efforts to establish peace between her allies, the two rival factions of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), by leaving three assembly seats in the Darjeeling hills for the party has not yielded any result. It is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that stands to gain from the split in GJM, the biggest outfit representing the Gorkhas, feels a section of local leaders.The GJM factions, led by Bimal Gurung and Binoy Tamang, are allies of the TMC but both groups said they will contest each other even if that leads to a triangular contest with BJP in the fray with some allies.Till October last year, Gurung, who founded the GJM and was the most popular Gorkha leader, was an ally of the BJP. With his support, the BJP won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice since 2009 and even wrested the Darjeeling assembly seat in the 2019 by-poll, defeating Tamang by more than 46,000 votes.In sharp contrast, the Darjeeling assembly seat was won by the undivided GJM in 2011 and 2016 although the BJP held the Lok Sabha seat with its support.This time around, the BJP is planning to contest all seats in the hill region as an ally of the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM).Though the GNLF was the most powerful force in the hills in the 1980s and 1990s and its founder, Subash Ghising, started the violent movement for Gorkhaland, the party is now a much smaller force. The CPRM, on the other hand, has presence only in a few pockets.Gurung and Tamang have plans to field candidates at Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong assembly constituencies that Banerjee left out for the GJM while announcing the names of 291 TMC candidates last week.Elections in the hills will be held in the fifth phase on April 17. Bengal has 294 seats.Before the Lok Sabha poll in 2019, the BJP promised to find a permanent political solution to the long-standing demand for Gorkhaland and accord schedule tribe status to 11 Gorkha sub-communities.The Gorkhas have been fighting for a separate state since the 1980s and 11 people were killed in police firing during a violent agitation in 2017 when the Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills witnessed a 104-day general strike. A police officer was also gunned down.BJP’s Raju Bista won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat in 2019 but so far his party has not delivered on its electoral promises. In the north Bengal region, the BJP won seven of the eight seats and bagged 18 out of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha constituencies.Gurung went into hiding in 2017 after he was charged under anti-terror law by the state government because of the violence witnessed during the Gorkhaland stir. After coming out of hiding in October last year Gurung said he will no longer support the BJP. “The BJP has betrayed the Gorkhas,” Gurung said.A section of local political leaders feels that in the coming elections, the BJP may get a significant number of votes although it has not delivered anything since 2009 and has no political base of its own in the hill region.The apprehension of these voters is based on the strong differences between the two rival factions of the GJM.Roshan Giri, general secretary of the Gurung faction said, “We will contest all three seats on our own. There is no question of entering into an understanding with the Tamang group.”Leaders of the Gurung faction have promised to back the TMC in the rest of the 14 seats in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts.Anit Thapa, general secretary of the Tamang faction and chairman of the board of administrators in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) said “It is going to be a triangular contest in the three seats in the Darjeeling hill region. We left Gurung long ago.”The only thing common in Tamang and Gurung is their strong stand against the BJP. Many people feel that it is this opposition to the BJP that may help the saffron camp.Tilak Chandra Roka, the former chief coordinator of the GJM (Gurung faction) has joined the BJP with this belief. He said, “The BJP is the only party in the country that has delivered on its promises. Take for example the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, ban on instant triple talaq or construction of the Ram temple. Promises that TMC made to the Gorkhas are just an eyewash.”Sardha Subba, the TMC’s former Darjeeling district (hill segment) women’s unit president and a popular face, has joined the BJP as well. “I believe that if it comes to power in Bengal the BJP will fulfill the promises. It is time to think rationally,” she said.Subba was the TMC’s candidate from the Darjeeling assembly seat in 2016 and she also unsuccessfully contested as an independent in the 2019 by-election.On December 1, Nimesh Sundas retired as deputy director of the pension department at Uttarkanya, the TMC government’s secretariat in Siliguri. Surprising many, he joined the BJP on January 12.Also Read: West Bengal: CM Mamata Banerjee files nomination from NandigramSundas said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes in serving common people. The BJP has been waiting for the Bengal polls because it can introduce laws only when it is in power in the state.”Not willing comment on record on Mamata Banerjee’s strategy for the hills, a TMC core committee member said, “The chief minister does not want the Gorkha population to feel that she is interfering in their politics. Hence, she gave both factions of the GJM the opportunity to represent the people. Now it is up to them to decide whether they will contest as a united force against the BJP or as opponents.”Dr G S Yonzone, former principal of Kalimpong College and a noted academician in the region, however, feels that it is too early to predict the winner."Everything is in mess in the hills and the situation is fluid. The hills, which suffer from so many problems, need the right people at the right place. However, the political players as well as the common people need to take things more seriously. It is difficult to say which party has an edge in this election," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/split-in-gorkha-janmukti-morcha-may-help-bjp-in-bengal-s-hill-region-101615367423255.html

After six years in the business, the actor admits that he puts in a conscious effort to be different from each movie and role. “I am always learning with every film, as every film teaches you something different either personally or professionally. As an actor, I would say, I am still figuring that out as every day is different and our goal is to reach and entertain all and not just stick to one section of the audience. I like to challenge myself. The scripts and roles I pick are based on the screenplay and the narrative. The art of storytelling, the characterisation of the role and the conviction/confidence in the director is what I look for before I green light any film,” he says, adding that last year, he learnt a lot of new things and got the chance to “view matters from a different perspective in life”, while professionally, he is glad to be “back to doing what we love”. With two films lined up this year - F3 and Ghani and two others that he is working on, the actor shares that he prefers this pace. “I always love to work, the more busy I am the better because entertaining the audience is what we aim at, along with keeping our passion alive on day-to-day basis. I never force myself into projects, if it is interesting and I believe I can pull it off to give a different experience to everyone watching, I’ll take the leap of faith and hope for acceptance for the risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/varun-tej-i-want-to-entertain-all-not-just-one-section-of-audience-101615364968440.html

Journalist Arnab Goswami had been arrested in connection with the case.Fadnavis said a Supreme Court ruling clearly stated that the FIR filed by the state government under Indian Penal Code Section 306 regarding abetment to suicide was prima facie wrong."What Deshmukh said was contempt of court and also amounted to preventing me from conducting my duties as a member of the Legislature," he said.Deputy Speaker Narhari Zirwal said he would examine the notice and take an appropriate decision.Later talking to reporters outside the House, Fadnavis said the state government decided to transfer API Sachin Vaze under pressure.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh On Wednesday announced the removal of Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze from the Crime Intelligence Unit till the inquiry into the mysterious death of automobile parts dealer Mansukh Hiran is not completed.Fadnavis said, "If the government can decide to remove minister Sanjay Rathod from the cabinet, why is Vaze so important that the government is scared to take action against him.""We will continue to fight till Hiran gets justice," he added.Hiran was in possession of the SUV with explosives found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in south Mumbai on February 25.Police said the vehicle was stolen from Hiran's possession on February 18. The mystery deepened after Hiran's body was found in a creek last Friday in neighbouring Thane.Hiran's wife has alleged in her statement to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) that police officer Sachin Vaze might have killed her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-moves-privilege-notice-against-maharashtra-home-minister-deshmukh-101615363586899.html

The lack of vaccine availability here will not only have an adverse effect on the pace of the vaccination campaign but will also weaken the enthusiasm of the citizens of the state and the Corona Warriors,” he said.He said that the Center's claim of having provided 37.61 lakh Covid vaccine doses to Rajasthan, including 24.28 lakh administered doses by Monday, was completely wrong. “Till March 8, Rajasthan had a stock of only 31 lakh 35 thoursand and 340 vaccines, of which, 2 lakh 15 thousand and 180 vaccine doses were made available to the army,” Gehlot said.Gehlot said that 29, 30, 160 vaccine doses have been made available according to the order of priority and till March 8, 23, 26, 975 vaccine doses have been administered and 1,62, 888 vaccine doses were wasted, which is less than the 10% limit allowed by the central government.“More than two lakh people are being vaccinated every day in the state. In this way, on March 8, the vaccine was available only for two days of vaccination, so the state government demanded additional vaccines from the center. After which, the state received 85 thousand vaccines on March 9,” Gehlot said.Also Read: Illegal opium farming on Jaipur outskirts, 13 cases found in a year: PoliceGehlot said that the Central government officials should be told not to give “false” information about Rajasthan on Covid 19 vaccines.He said that the ‘delay’ in sending vaccines and ‘misinformation’ on the drive in the state will hurt people’s spirits in the state and disappoint the Corona Warriors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-cm-1st-dose-of-vaccination-stopped-at-health-centers-due-to-shortage-101615362163029.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran: The mysterious death that has gripped Mumbai||Maharashtra leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis claimed in the Assembly on Tuesday that Mansukh Hiran, a 48-year-old auto spare parts businessman, was likely murdered and demanded the arrest of a police officer of the Mumbai crime branch.Fadnavis based his claims on the statement that Hiran’s wife, 43-year-old Vimla, gave to the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) investigators two days after her husband’s body washed up on the Reti Bunder creek in Mumbra, Thane district. Vimla told investigators that she was certain her husband had been murdered, and that she suspected Vaze had a hand in it.Till he went missing on the night of March 4, Hiran cooperated with the police who questioned him repeatedly after an SUV that he had been driving for three years and reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Antilia, the house in which billionaire Mukesh Ambani lives with his family. The car had 20 sticks of gelatin (no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani.Who owned the SUV parked outside Ambani’s house? Who is Vaze? What were the events that preceded Hiran’s death? Why does Vimla think that her husband was murdered and did not drown? Read our explainer of what we know so far.A Scorpio outside AntiliaOn February 25, police sub-inspector Amit Kadam was on duty as station house officer at Gamdevi police station when he received a call around 3pm. Bharat Patil, a security officer at industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, informed Kadam of a Mahindra Scorpio SUV parked on Carmichael Road near Shikhar Kunj building. What piqued their suspicion, Patil told Kadam, was that the registration number of the vehicle was the same as that of a Range Rover that is part of Nita Ambani’s security convoy.By the time Kadam reached the spot with a constable, Ambani’s security personnel had also called the Mumbai police control room, after confirming that the vehicle did not belong to them.Also Read | ‘Something fishy’: Uddhav after NIA asked to take over Ambani bomb threat probeKadam called the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) team, which examined the vehicle with the help of sniffer dogs and bomb detection equipment. The teams found a blue sack with a Mumbai Indians logo on the co-driver’s seat left seat, (an Indian Premier League team owned by the Ambanis) which contained 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambani family.Two identical sets of three different registration number plates were kept beneath the rear seat of the vehicle. Bharat Patil, the security officer at Antilia revealed that all the three registration numbers belonged to vehicles registered in the name of Reliance Industries Limited.The BDDS squad and the Gamdevi police found that the plates that carried the engine number and body number of the vehicle were removed, and even the chassis number embossed on the car near right front wheel was wiped out. Clearly someone had gone into great trouble to remove traces of all identification from the car.The same day, the Gamdevi police registered an offence in connection with the incidence against unknown persons under sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (punishment for forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation, if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4(a)(b) (1) (punishment for attempt to cause explosion, or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) of the Indian Explosives Act, 1908.Other police officers including senior police inspector Rampiyare Rajbhar of Gamdevi police station, Rajiv Jain deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2 and a crime branch team including assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze of the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU), arrived at the scene. Vaze was later to be made the lead investigator in this case.A BDDS officer present there that day said on the condition of anonymity that the 2.5 kg gelatin was enough to trigger a low intensity blast, but that the gelatin sticks found in the SUV were not in the form of an assembled explosive device. The mark of a Nagpur-based company found on the gelatin sticks indicated that the explosive was procured from Nagpur where it is commonly sold for mining purposes.At 5pm, the SUV was towed to Gamdevi police station at Girgaon Chowpatty, and was later shifted to Yellow Gate police station premises.The real owner of the SUVShortly after Hiran’s body washed up in a creek in Thane district on March 5, his family stopped talking to the media. Till then, Hiran — who left his home at night on March 4 never to return — Vimla; brother, Vinod (50), and older son, Meet (21), had understood and even addressed the scrutiny that accompanied the discovery that the Scorpio, found parked outside Ambani’s home on February 25, had been traced back to them.On March 7, Vimla gave a statement to the Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) investigating team, in which she said that she was certain that her husband had been murdered. She also said that Sachin Vaze, the police officer from CIU who went to Antilia on February 25, was probably involved in the death.Based on her statement, the ATS filed a case of murder against unknown persons, and began to treat Hiran’s death not as a case of suicide or accidental drowning.Also Read | Ambani security: ATS registers murder case in SUV owner’s deathIt was this statement, among others, that caused uproar in the state assembly when leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis brought up Hiran’s death on the penultimate day of the House in session.In her statement, Vimla told the investigators that the vehicle belonged to a certain Dr Peter Newton who was known to her deceased husband. The Scorpio, however, was in possession of the Hirans for the past three years. Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop in Thane, on February 5, 2021.On February 17, at around 6.30pm, Hiran took the vehicle heading towards south Mumbai, the statement read. However, its steering was not smooth which prompted Hiran to park the car on the side of the road, and continue his journey in a taxi. The following day, the statement added, Hiran took a mechanic with him to bring the vehicle back to his shop. However, when he reached the spot, he found that the car had been stolen following which he lodged a complaint with Vikhroli police station.In fact, it was Hiran’s FIR that gave the investigators their first break in the case.What initial investigation revealedOn February 26, home minister Anil Deshmukh released a video statement stating that the Mumbai crime branch would investigate the case. Vaze, who heads the CIU, took the lead in the investigation.But the investigations had already kicked off the previous evening. The Mumbai crime branch formed several teams apart from the CIU including officials of unit 2, unit 3, and property cell. They were assigned different tasks such as checking CCTV camera footage, making enquiries about stolen, gathering footage from toll points, among other things.The police checked the footage of CCTV cameras installed outside a departmental store called Vijay Store, just across the road from where the Scorpio was parked. They found that two vehicles, the Scorpio and an Innova, coming from Peddar Road and heading towards Altamount Road, reached Carmichael Road an hour past midnight on the intervening night of February 24 and 25. The Scorpio stopped opposite Vijay Store, and the Innova stopped, a few metres behind it.“The Scorpio driver was seen sitting for about two hours,” store owner Rajesh Singh who also saw the footage, said. “There was hardly any movement inside or outside the vehicle. Two hours later, the Innova moved ahead slowly, but it is not clear as to when the driver of the Scorpio came out of the car and where he went.”It is likely that the Scorpio driver left the car from the left hand side rear door [an angle that would not be caught in the CCTV camera], the police claimed.Investigators further found that the Innova had entered the city at 1.20pm on February 24, from the Mulund toll naka. After leaving Carmichael Road, it returned to the toll point at 3.05am on February 25 morning. Police claimed they could not track the Innova after that as the CCTVs in Thane area captured blurred images due to night hours. The registration number of the Innova car was also found to be a fake and the police suspected that this vehicle too was stolen.Also Read | Uncovering truth behind Mansukh Hiran’s death crucial for MVA: Sanjay RautDuring investigations, the police came across a report filed in Vikhroli about a green coloured Scorpio that had gone missing. The police placed a call to Hiran, asking him to visit the CIU office located in the police headquarters near Crawford Market.“On February 25, an ATS official named Salvi called my husband and asked him to meet him in the building compound. My husband and son went down and met Salvi, who showed them a picture on his phone of an SUV found near Ambani’s house. My husband identified the vehicle and also informed him that he had filed a complaint with the Vikroli police station that it had been stolen. He also showed the FIR copy to him,” Vimla’s statement to the ATS, read.The same night, ATS officer Shivaji Chavan visited their residence and took Hiran to the Vikroli ATS unit. There, he was shown some CCTV footage. He was brought back to his house at 6.30am on February 26, the statement added.Later that day, Hiran reached the CIU office, where the police recorded his statement. Emerging from the building, Hiran spoke to mediapersons and told them that the car was indeed his, but it had not been in his possession for over a week.Between February 25 and March 4, when Hiran left his home in the evening, he was questioned by several police officers, Vimla’s statement said.Vimla’s statement to the ATSOn March 2, Hiran wrote a letter to various authorities complaining that he was being harassed by police of various units and police stations and a particular media person, who kept calling repeatedly.The following day, Hiran told her that Vaze had advised him to get arrested in case and he would be out on bail within a few days, the statement read.On March 4, Hiran returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road.Vimla told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, her son spoke to Hiran’s brother, Vinod to inform him that Hiran had not returned home. Vinod called Vaze, who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde.The following morning, Meet and Vinod lodged a missing person’s report at Naupada police station. Hiran’s body was found by fishermen on March 5 around 10.30am. The Mumbra Police handed over the body to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa and filed an Accidental Death report. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran had died by suicide. But Vimla contested that claim. In her statement, she told the ATS team that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned. Besides, the body had no identifying markers on it — his wallet, gold chain, gold ring studded with a pukhraj stone and wrist watch were not found on him when his body was recovered. What’s more, his body was found in a creek at Mumbra with handkerchiefs stuffed into his mouth, which was also covered by a scarf.The missing person’s report filed by Hiran’s family helped identify the body. Later, on March 6, Vimla gave a statement to the press — Hiran was cooperating with the police; there was no reason why he would try and die by suicide. She demanded an investigation into his death. The family asked for another autopsy to be conducted, as the earlier one released a post mortem report that said the cause of death was inconclusive, and the viscera needed to be tested further. Hiran’s family showed the report to four doctor friends of the family.“Our doctors said his lungs were not filled with water and were soft. His death happened 10 to 12 hours before he was found dead at the creek. Therefore to investigate further we have asked to preserve his lungs and demanded a diatoms test which established death by drowning,” Vinod told the press.Later that evening, the family cremated Mansukh Hiran.On March 7, an ATS team questioned the family for over three hours and filed an FIR against unknown persons for the murder of Mansukh Hiran.“Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of Vimla’s statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Sachin Vaze did not respond to repeated calls and messages. The story will be updated when and if he responds.Mark of respectOn March 8, the family organised a prayer meet for Hiran, which several people attended. His community remembered his as a helpful neighbour and a musician who loved to play the guitar.A resident of the society where the Hirans live said, on condition of anonymity, that Hiran had taught the neighbour’s 12-year-old son how to swim. “Mansukh often taught children how to swim. He loved children and got along well with them. He was always so happy when he played the guitar and he would always encourage children to get involved in different hobbies.”Ashok Badla, Hiran’s relative said, “Mansukh was involved in various sport activity and always took out time to play old medleys on his guitar. This was one of his favourite pastimes.” Badla said that Hiran was also deeply involved in charity work offered by the Terapanth community, a group within the Jain community.At his place of business, shopkeepers downed their shutters for five days as a mark of respect for their friend.“He was like an older brother to all of us. He taught us how to expand our business. We met each other daily during the day and spoke on various issues. Around 10 of us collectively took the decision to keep our shops closed as a mark of respect till the death rituals were completed,” said D Anand, whose car accessories shop adjoins Hiran’s.Kamlesh Jain, another businessman and friend recalled how Hiran had helped one of his employees set up a business in his native village. “He used to encourage his staff to start something of their own. Who trains their own employees in different skills to help them set up their own business? The employee could not control his emotions after he learned of Mansukh’s death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mansukh-hiren-the-murder-mystery-that-has-gripped-mumbai-101615362148177.html

10-03-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: Pataleshwar cave temple is rock-cut legacy and monolithic marvel of Rashtrakuta period||Did you know one of the oldest monuments in Pune was never built? It was excavated. You may have passed it innumerable times as you moved around Deccan and Shivajinagar gaothan. To truly know this monument you have to literally climb down a historical staircase, to enter a nether-land.“Mangal Desha, Pavitra Desha” is the famous poem by Ram Ganesh Gadkari describing Maharashtra in his lucid style. He aptly calls Maharashtra, “Dagdanchya desha”, or stone country. This basalt rock-dominated area provides unique material for raising rock-cut monuments.Capitalising on this resource, Maharashtra, especially western Maharashtra, sees intense rock cutting activity since the second century BCE, starting at places around Pune such as Bhaje, Karla, Bedse, and Junnar, as part of a Buddhist religious endeavour. The Vruddheshwar caves on the Fergusson hill and the cave at Hinjewadi mark the Buddhist viharas and water tanks used in the early historic period. However, the Brahmanical cave excavations begin some centuries later at multiple centres (Konkan, Badami and Central India). The Punya Vishaya from the Rashtrakuta copper plate inscriptions we discussed last week did not provide us with a material manifestation of what Pune might have been during that period. This can be seen in the form of the Pataleshwar cave, excavated underground on a huge bedrock of basalt, next to the Jangli Maharaj Math, and on the road by the same name. This area was once part of the Bhamburda village, which forms an older part of the Shivajinagar suburb today.The Pataleshwar cave is not an isolated monument, but connects with the larger rock-cut landscape of the Deccan. The Pataleshwar caves can be accessed by a flight of stairs, which takes us to an open square-shaped courtyard with a central rock-cut monolithic mandapa. This free standing mandapa is the highlight of the entire cave.This vahana manadpa is built to house the mount of the central deity, in this case Nandi, the mount of Shiva. The current Nandi installed is much smaller in size and might be a later addition.At the entrance of this mandapa is Chandra-shila or a moon-shaped stone. This free standing mandapa and a similar one at Ambejogai, are precursors to the elaborately carved monolithic Kailasa rock temple at Ellora (Unesco world heritage site) under the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The courtyard once had a stepped well to provide for water, but was buried due to frequent water contamination and lack of upkeep.The horizontal and vertical rows of rectangular pillars occupy a major portion of the east-facing hall to leave space for three connected shrines facing the entrance. Each shrine has a chandrashila flanked by auspicious symbols.The doorways of the three shrines are decorated and the lintel has miniature shikharas carved in relief. A circum-ambulation path is carved around the three shrines. As you circum-ambulate the shrines you notice a big chunk of uncut rock left at one of the corners. This feature, combined with roughly chiselled surfaces, is tell-tale sign that the cave has been left incomplete. Flanked by pillars, wall niches on all sides show some signs of carving, while others are plain. Thus, based on comparison with Ambejogai cave, Rameshwar cave at Ellora and Elephanta caves, we can identify some episodes with sufficient certainty. There also exists an inscription at the entrance in Nagari script, but it is quite illegible except for a few alphabets. Thus, the enigma about the creator of Pataleshwar still remains firmly buried. The central shrines, today, house Shivlinga and modern idols. However, based on the analysis of architecture and symbols, Dr Manjiri Bhalerao proposed that the three shrines might have been dedicated to a trinity. We do not know exactly, when the Pataleshwar or Panchaleshwar name stuck to this cave temple. But, the medieval archives inform us that in 1810, Bajirao II offered a dakshina to all the temples in, Pune including donation of 1 rupee to “Bhuyaratil Mahadev”, which has to be Pataleshwar.James Wales, the artist under the patronage of Sir Charles Malet at the Peshwa court in the 1790s was fascinated by the rock-cut caves around Pune and has drawn a picture of “Pandoo’s cave”, aka Panchaleshwara. James Wales in September 1792 had sent his assistant Robert Mabon to make a drawing of “Pandoo’s cave”, and he almost certainly visited it himself later. When James Douglas visited the temple in 1882, the temple was occupied by small group of fakirs. They prohibited him from entering, fearing he would make them leave.The occupation of Jangli Maharaj (1806–1890) brought a new identity to the place and subsequently, the expansion of Pune city, the building of the road in 1952 (named Jangli Maharaj road), made it a part of the core city. Excavated 1,300 years ago (eighth century CE), the Rashtrakuta period’s Pataleshwar cave temple stands as a testament to Pune’s first religious expression in timeless rock-cut form. It is our collective misfortune that insensitive modern infrastructural development in the form of roads, flyovers and underpasses, threatens the existence of Pune’s first monument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-pataleshwar-cave-temple-is-rock-cut-legacy-and-monolithic-marvel-of-rashtrakuta-period-101615360167431.html

He will be moved from the Crime Branch. An impartial inquiry will be done and whoever is guilty will face action," Deshmukh told the legislative council on Wednesday amid the din.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has fronted the opposition attack on the Maharashtra government, demanding the police officer's arrest in connection with the death of auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran. The businessman is said to be the owner of the vehicle found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter.The vehicle, a sports utility vehicle, was found near Ambani’s house on February 25. Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane resident, claimed it was stolen from his possession a week earlier.Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5; handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth. His wife, Vimla, blamed police officer Sachin Vaze for the murder.Fadnavis has extensively cited Vimla's statements to target assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze. On Tuesday, the BJP leader cited the statement by Mansukh Hiran’s wife where she claimed that the car found outside Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s South Mumbai residence, was in possession of Sachin Vaze from November 20 last year."The car was given to him for use as Hiran knew Vaze who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiren after four months,” Fadnavis said on Tuesday.Vaze, who heads the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai police crime branch, has not commented on the charges despite several requests to seek his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-police-officer-at-the-heart-of-bjp-shiv-sena-slugfest-in-mumbai-transferred-101615358725832.html

They will be produced at a city court later in the day," he said.A case has been registered against them under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, the officer said.Earlier this week, the Kolkata Police informed that one Priyanka Singh (alias Sweety) was arrested in connection with the New Alipore PS drug case (Pamela matter).The woman, who was arrested from the New Town area on Monday, used to purchase drugs from the two, the police said, adding that sleuths have so far apprehended 10 people in connection with the case.BJP youth leader Pamela Goswami, her friend Prabir Kumar Dey and private security guard Somnath Chatterjee were arrested last month from south Kolkata's New Alipore area with allegedly around 90 gm of cocaine that was found in her car.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-two-more-arrested-in-pamela-goswami-drugs-case-10-held-so-far-101615357320563.html
10-03-2021||Jaipur||Illegal opium farming on Jaipur outskirts, 13 cases found in a year: Police||More than a dozen illegal opium farms discovered by the Jaipur Rural police in the last one year indicate that areas located on the periphery of the state capital have become hot spots of illegal cultivation of opium, also known as ‘black gold’.The Jaipur Rural police, under its campaign ‘Highway’, seized 13 illegal opium farms between February 1, 2020 and March 4, 2021.“The farms were found in Andhi, Chaksu, Shivdaspura, Pragpura, Jobner, Jamwaramgarh and Dudu. In all, 320,699 opium plants were seized and 11 cases were registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act 1985 and 11 people were arrested,” said Shankar Dutt Sharma, superintendent of police (SP), Jaipur rural. “Besides 103 kg lanced poppy husk was also recovered, which is a by-product of opium plant,” he added.In India, opium cultivation is prohibited under Section 8 of the NDPS Act, 1985, except under a licence issued by the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) under Rule 8 of the NDPS Rules, 1985. In Rajasthan, opium cultivation can be done only in Chittorgarh and Pratapgarh districts.“The drug smugglers have understood the fact that in Pratapgarh, various agencies like CBN, police and NCB keep a strict watch on opium cultivators. Hence, they have started targeting areas of various other cities where opium can be cultivated, as it needs certain weather conditions for growth. Most of the farms where opium was grown on Jaipur outskirts were amid fields of paddy and mustard surrounded by hills,” Sharma said.He said some big smugglers lure the farmers to grow opium offering them huge profit. “Analyses of our cases revealed that most of the arrested people were farmers and they would buy seeds from Madhya Pradesh. The smugglers would pay them between ₹1 and 1.5 lakh per kg opium,” he added.“From planting to uprooting, accused learned illegal cultivation in Chittorgarh and Pratapgarh, which produce 60% of the total opium production in India. We have identified big smugglers involved in the illegal cultivation. Soon, they would be arrested,” Sharma said.Also Read: Rajasthan, Centre at odds over supply of Covid-19 vaccineOpium poppy or papaver somniferum, a medicinal herb, produces a variety of alkaloids such as morphine and codeine, and is best known as a pain reliever in modern medicine.

10-03-2021||Delhi||Pet parents ahoy! Here’s a team of experts at service of furry friends||In the middle of the night, if your pet hurts itself, the first thought that comes to the mind is to rush to the nearest healthcare facility available and consult the vet. But honestly, how many places do really provide emergency services to pets when needed?And not just emergency cases, even in moments when your pet needs some warmth and care, there’s no better feeling than having an animal expert standing by its side, tending to it. “Once I took my dog for a surgery, and after that we had to carry it back in a bedsheet since the clinic was to be shut. It broke my heart to see that there are hardly any post-operative care services for pets. And that’s what drove my love for animals into the passion to create a place where a pet parent could bring in their pets and feel relaxed, for we are there to take care of its needs,” says Pratapsinh Gaekwad, founder of Crown Vet. Pet parents in Delhi, worry not for Gaekwad’s team of next generation passionate animal lovers have now ventured into the Capital, to provide state-of-the-art animal care with five senior vets, seven junior vets and a well-trained staff including two receptionists and even a pharmacy, which is open from 9am to 9pm.The recently opened clinic of Crown Vet in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, is an extension of the team’s initiatives they have been taking in Mumbai and Pune. “We came in the essential services group when the lockdown happened last year. So even though we had to send cars with drivers to pick and drop the doctors, we did that and incurred all costs so that pets who needed consultation, could be attended online. Touch wood, none of our staff in Mumbai and Pune tested Covid positive,” adds Gaekwad, who is so dedicated to the cause of animal care that he has plans to open a training academy for vets. “Finding trained vets is where the bottleneck is today. Training of vets is very important,” says Gaekwad, adding, “To train a few vets and make them part of a clinic is easy, but once we open an academy, then we can position them at different centres. And then eventually we can also have more animal lovers receive training and get going.” Talking about the facilities available at the clinic, Sheroy Wadia, chief executive officer, says, “We have a dedicated waiting area, and encourage appointment based visits (+91 11-40810640) because vets need time with pets. Alongside, we have a fully equipped theatre, an imaging room, and we rely heavily on diagnostics. Also, we maintain all records for the pets so that when you come in, you don’t really have to carry any files or papers since we’ll have all their history. What’s special about our service is that the vets are here to ensure that pet owners have a stress-free, comfortable environment for their pets.” Author tweets @HennaRakhejaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pet-parents-ahoy-here-s-a-team-of-experts-at-service-of-furry-friends-101615355335901.html
10-03-2021||Patna||Centre's push for generic drugs yet to gather pace in Bihar||Despite the Centre's push, the Bihar health department is yet to ensure that the state-employed medical practitioners prescribe generic drugs to patients. It also does not have a well laid down plan to open Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) outlets on hospital campuses for the sale of high quality generic drugs at heavily discounted price compared to branded medicines at retail outlets.One such initiative by the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), an autonomous institute of repute, has failed to make much headway after becoming the first among state-run or autonomous medical colleges to offer patients a discounted package for cataract surgery in January last year, the system is yet to be fully functional in other departments.Hospital officials say the process of listing requirements in terms of drugs, implants and consumables required for different procedures at clinical departments was going on. The consolidated list will be sent to the Pradhan Mantri Bharatiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) outlet and the Amrit store, set up on the hospital campus, to arrange for the supply of generic drugs and implants.Depending on the cost of drugs and implants, the institute would work out packages for different procedures and integrate them with its hospital management information system (HMIS).This would immensely benefit patients in getting standard, quality medicines and implants at a heavily discounted price, as compared to branded medicines available at retail outlets. Besides it will weed out touts and attendants of patients will not need to run around and arrange for medicines that are not available in the hospital formulary after a patient has been admitted.“We are in the process of collecting the list of requirements for different procedures and hope to introduce the package system of charging patients for different procedures around May, this year,” said Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent, IGIMS.Patna’s AIIMS has had the package system for over the last two years but does not have a PMBJP outlet on its campus.“No one has approached us with proper authorization for opening the PMBJP outlet on our institute campus. We will be happy to lease out our space for such an outlet if we get a proper proposal,” said AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh.He, however, was critical of the Amrit store, managed by the HLL, a PSU of the Central government that supplies generic drugs and implants, existing on its campus.“The Amrit store is unable to fulfill all our requirements,” said Dr Singh.Also Read: Over 16K CCTV cameras installed in Patna for strict surveillanceMeanwhile, the state health department will on Wednesday hold a meeting with representatives of the Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India, a PSU of the Central government, to work out modalities on preparing a standard operating document for opening PMBJP outlets on campus of government hospitals.The state has only 222 outlets against the requirement to have at least one outlet under the PMBJP in each of its 534 blocks.The state registered a 57% increase in sales under the PMBJP, when it rose from ₹3.19 crore in 2019-20 to ₹5 crore between April 2020 and February, this year. This was, however, 3% less than the national average growth of 60% till February, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/centres-push-for-generic-drugs-yet-to-gather-pace-in-bihar-101615354683177.html

In their letter, representatives of the students’ wing have highlighted that several MU-affiliated colleges charged students fees for laboratories, ID cards as well as educational tour fees, all of which were not implemented in the current year as classes were being held online.“Computer labs, ID card fees as well as other such heads which are only applicable if students physically study in colleges have been applied in the fee structure of several colleges, which is unnecessary. The university should send a clear message to all such colleges to either refund such fees to the students or adjust this amount in the fees they will charge in the next academic year,” said Amol Matele, advocate and president of the NCP students’ wing.Also Read | 17,921 new cases of Covid-19 take India’s tally to above 11.26 million; 133 deaths recorded in 24 hoursIn September last year, the Association of Non-Government Colleges (ANGC) had approached MU asking that the varsity refund 60% of the examination fees that all affiliated colleges had paid the University in advance. This academic year, due to the Covid-19 imposed lockdown, the exams were held online by individual colleges and therefore, said ANGC, colleges’ expenses increased and they were in need of the refund.“In the last one year, MU has reached out to colleges on various occasions and asked them to accommodate students, especially since many are facing financial crises due to loss of income of their family members. Keeping the same spirit, MU should also consider this demand,” added Matele.In October last year, less than a month after colleges reopened and started holding virtual classes, the University of Mumbai released a circular addressed to all affiliated colleges asking them to let students, whose families are facing the economic strain of the Covid-19-imposed lockdown, pay fees in instalments. During admission to first-year courses for the 2020-21 academic year as well, several colleges had dropped the basic admission fee in order to accommodate all students.Reopening of colleges, for the time being, has been put on hold after the city and several parts of the state started witnessing a rise in Covid-19 cases. The winter 2021 examinations for the current semester are also, as of now, slated to take place in online mode only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-student-wing-asks-mumbai-varsity-to-refund-excess-fee-or-adjust-it-next-year-101615353328403.html

With the current growth rate, the cases in the state are likely to reach 4,000 by the end of March.School, colleges fuelling infectionsThe CMCH report has mentioned that schools and colleges have turned out to be the major drivers of the pandemic. It has been observed that youngsters carry a high viral load but mild symptoms of infection which could result in the spreading of the virus among the elderly leaving them seriously ill.The reports suggest that grandparents are at greater risk. “Majority of us have joint families with the elderly living in the same house. The parents and grandparents who drop and collect the children from school have a higher risk of catching the infection,” say experts.As per the report, after a spike in Covid cases in SBS Nagar, Jalandhar, Patiala, Hoshiarpur, Rupnagar and Gurdaspur, the number of infections will increase in other districts, including Ludhiana, Amritsar and SAS Nagar.The CMCH community medicine department, which is sharing its observations with the state health department since June last year, has advised that schools and colleges should strictly adhere to Covid-safe behaviour. The report has also appreciated the fact that senior citizens were showing enthusiasm in getting themselves vaccinated.“Coronavirus has not gone anywhere, and it is important to adopt the guidelines of social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding visits to crowded places and washing hands frequently,” said an expert from the department.The expert has urged the healthcare and frontline Covid warriors to get inoculated at the earliest.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia, who is the nodal officer of the vaccination process, said, “It is important that people follow the guidelines even after inoculation as it lessens the severity of the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cmch-warns-of-doubling-of-virus-cases-in-punjab-if-sops-not-followed-strictly-101615352727945.html

Senior officials held a security review on Tuesday, where measures like CCTV surveillance were discussed.In the review meeting on Tuesday, attended by Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, district magistrates, superintendents of police, traffic SPs, municipal commissioner and other officials, it was pointed out that 15,122 cameras have been installed at residential apartments, 1345 at malls and 341 at police stations, while installation work was going on at several other places. Officials said that cameras were being installed at residential apartments, jewellery shops, hospitals, petrol pumps and banks in the Patna division.Agarwal instructed the concerned officials to identify places without CCTV cameras at present and ensure their speedy installation. He also asked the municipal corporation to provide a police station-wise list of apartments for better coordination.“We often receive complaints from apartment residents and societies regarding poor security in their buildings. To check on unscrupulous activities, it is mandatory to install CCTV cameras at the main entry, stairs, lift, parking, every floor and at an outer location from the gate. For future constructions, it is mandatory to indicate CCTV camera points while passing the construction map for apartments and commercial complexes. Camera surveillance is a helpful tool for effective monitoring and tracking crime by scanning the footage of entry and exit of people,” said Agarwal.Also Read: Bihar woman ‘kidnapped and killed for dowry’ 4 years back, returnsHe also stressed on keeping the cameras in working condition to serve the purpose.“Police superintendents and municipal commissioners should ensure proper functioning of CCTV cameras.

Later, stringent provisions of the MCOCA were invoked against him.Baswant’s first bail application was rejected by the local designated MCOCA court on October 24, 2017 and second one on July 9, 2018. He then moved the high court. His plea was rejected on January 30, 2020 in view of the evidence collected by the police against him. This prompted him to approach the Supreme Court.

Accepting his plea, the Supreme Court on April 8, 202, granted him bail on medical grounds for four weeks. The temporary bail was then extended by the Supreme Court twice, first on May 8 and later on May 26, when it was extended for three months.On June 13, 2020, he again filed a bail application before the designated MCOCA court at Pune, relying on his medical reports. On July 9, 2020, the designated court rejected his bail plea, primarily in view of the fact that he required chemotherapy and the facility was available at state-run Sassoon Hospital at Pune.Baswant then moved the high court, challenging the MCOCA court order, and also filed a miscellaneous application before the Supreme Court and on August 25, secured a fourth extension of for two months, and on October 27, a fifth extension for three months.However, when his plea came up for hearing before the high court, additional public prosecutor AA Takalkar pointed out that there was no question of considering Baswant’s case for bail on its own merit as a similar plea was rejected on January 30 and there was no change in circumstance to reconsider it. Regarding his claim of serious illness, Takalkar pointed out that Baswant had relied on false medical records to obtain bail on medical grounds and he suffered only from tuberculosis for which he was treated at Sassoon Hospital. He was now cured and medication had been stopped in January 2021.She further pointed out that on February 23, 2021 Shivaji Nagar police station in Pune had registered a fresh FIR against him for fabricating medical records.The high court accepted her contentions, noticing that a medical investigation by Sassoon Hospital in February 2021 ruled out possibility of cancer and the police investigation that led to the registration of fresh FIR against him revealed that the man had relied on fabricated medical records. “In the light of these circumstances, it is apparent that the applicant has been misleading the courts,” said justice PD Naik. “The applicant is not entitled for bail on merit as well as on medical grounds,” the judge added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-junks-bail-plea-based-on-forged-medical-reports-101615348407718.html

10-03-2021||Bhopal||MP to hold Ram Leelas to remind tribals of Hindu ‘past’ amid call for Sarna code||At the time some tribal groups are demanding a distinct religious code for themselves, the culture department of Madhya Pradesh has decided to hold Ram Leelas in the 89 tribal blocks of the state this April to inform them about the 'influence' of Lord Ram in their lives, a state government official said.“When there is a debate going on whether tribals were Hindus or not, the cultural department of MP has decided to organize three Ram Leelas to establish the fact that tribals were followers of Lord Ram,” said Ashok Mishra, coordinator of the project and officer of the culture department.“Through Ram Leelas, we would be telling tribals that Shabri, a tribal woman and a tribal ruler Nishad Raaj, were ardent followers of Lord Ram. Also, the Gonds in MP and Chhattisgarh had their own version of Ramayan.”Mishra said that the state government decided to conduct research on Shabri, a tribal sadhvi, and Kevat, a tribal who helped Lord Ram to cross river Ganga to prepare Ram Leelas to inform tribals about their roots and how Lord Rama belonged to them.“After research for five months, I prepared scripts of three Ram Leelas for tribals,” said Yogesh Tripathi, the senior scriptwriter of these Ram Leelas. He said there were a lot of documents to suggest that Lord Ram spent most of his 14 years in exile with tribals and learnt a lot from them.“In all three Ram Leelas, we will try to explain that Lord Ram belongs to the tribals and the tribals belong to Ram. Through Shabri, we will present how a tribal woman dedicated her whole life to Lord Ram. Through Kevat and Nishad Raaj, we will present courage and self-respect among tribals and how they helped Ram and their emotional connection with Lord Ram,” said Tripathi.Tribal rights activists, however, termed the decision as an attempt to “spoil” the tribal culture.A Dindori based tribal rights activist, Naresh Biswas, said it was “surprising” that the government had taken over the RSS programme to 'enforce' Hinduism on tribals.“It is surprising that the state government is trying for ‘Hindukaran’ of tribals. It is a dangerous move and will change the traditions of tribals,” he said.An expert on tribal culture and tradition, Vikram Acchalia, said, “Tribal communities existed before the advent of religions. Like Hindus converted into Islam after Mughals came to India, some tribal also adopted Hinduism but it doesn’t mean that the tribal is a Hindu.”He said the tribal tradition and festivals are based on nature and not on any idol worship. “We celebrate Diwali to honour our cattle, which help us in ploughing,” he said.“Among tribals, most of the rituals are performed by women only. Tribals offer non-vegetarian food and liquor to god and goddess, but in the Sanatan Dharm, non-vegetarian food and liquor are consumed by demons only,” he added.Jay Adiwasi Yuva Shakti convener Dr Anand Rai said the tribals in Madhya Pradesh want a separate column in Census to identify their religion as separate from the Hindus.Tribal bodies in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha have demanded inclusion of a separate Sarna code in the Census to formally register tribal population as non-Hindus, and the Jharkhand assembly even passed a resolution over the matter in December 2020.Also Read: MP Assembly: Uproar on farm loan waiver, Congress members walk out“Tribals were not Hindus in the past, nor are they Hindu now,” Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, the only tribal CM in the country, said at a Harvard University virtual seminar on January 19.Madhya Pradesh’s minister of culture and tourism, Usha Thakur, said, “A section of people are trying to prove that tribals have no religion, but we know that these ‘vanvasis’(forest dwellers) are Hindus. Ramayan is one of the most ancient books and it clearly says Shabri, Kevat and Nishad Raj were tribal and followers of Ram. We will entertain and inform people through Ram Leelas.”Her department has allocated ₹70 lakh for scriptwriting, costume designing and for paying the artists to perform Ram Leelas in the state.“To avoid confusion, the culture department recorded all the dialogues and music of the script. Now, the artists need to just lip-sync. The culture department will choose tribal artists to present the Ram Leelas,” Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-to-hold-ram-leelas-to-remind-tribals-of-hindu-past-amid-call-for-sarna-code-101615345665426.html

10-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the bare peepal tree||Leaves are falling. As brutal summer inches closer, scores of trees across Delhi have started shedding their leaves. If it’s windy the yellowed leaves drop continuously in a gentle shower. By noon, roads are carpeted with a golden-coloured layer. Many leaves find their way onto the subway stairs, into ATM cabins and even into the open kettles of roadside tea vendors. In the evening, when office-goers reach the parking stands, they first have to wipe the papery leaves from their cars’ windshields.One recent morning in Panchsheel Park, leaves were falling like a steady snowfall upon and around a security guard stationed outside a bungalow. He remained absorbed by his mobile phone.Indeed, one of the more stunning sights in the city these days is the spectre of currently leafless trees—their naked branches raised upwards like limbs of mourners, their shadows on the ground looking like wrecked umbrellas.And one of the most stunning bare trees to be seen is in Lodhi Garden, on the west-facing side of the Bada Gumbad monument. This evening, even as the garden’s life continues in its usual hyper-energy (Bollywood dance practice, badminton matches, push-ups, yoga, photography, dog walking, etc.), this peepal tree, almost the height of the adjacent monument, is looking even more grand than it would with its leaves. You can see all its branches—there are hundreds of them, thick and thin, densely entwined into each other, and making such a web that in some sense they don’t seem bare at all. A few black birds are perched at different places, freely flitting from one branch to another as if playing badminton. The shadows of these branches have made a pattern on the monunent’s wall too, where it is looking like an embroidery set on stone. Some of the higher branches taper into barely perceptible stalks.In the western world, leaves fall in autumn. In Delhi, the patjhar, or leaf fall, arrives for certain trees after a short spell of spring, heralding the coming of harsh dry months. For a tree to survive in prolonged drought, it temporarily shuts down by dropping its leaves so as to stop transpiring water.But new leaves will come soon in most of these bare trees. So come to pay your respects to this naked peepal as soon as you can. It’s already glinting with spotlights of new green.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-bare-peepal-tree-101615327052473.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Opposition slams Delhi budget, says it lacks vision||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress on Tuesday criticised the Delhi government’s budget for the year 2021-22, calling it “hollow” and “directionless” and “visionless”.Leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the budget had fewer allocations for development projects that could be taken up in the next one year.“What is even more shocking is that there has been no mention of Trans-Yamuna Development Board or the Delhi Gramin Vikas Board in the budget, indicating the anti-rural and anti-people mindset of the Kejriwal government,” Bidhuri said.“There is no concrete plan to deal with the menace of pollution in Delhi despite Delhi’s air turning poisonous and deadly. The budget is hollow, directionless, lacking in vision and is a tale of broken promises by the Kejriwal government. The people of Delhi have been left to fend for themselves,’’ the leader of the opposition added.The Delhi Congress called the budget a pointless exercise. “It was a pointless exercise to sell a distant dream, as far away as 2047 when Delhi’s quality of living will be supposedly turned into Singapore-like, instead of addressing the existing issues, of here and now. They said that the budget proposals, instead of taking Delhi 100 years ahead, will drag it back by 100 years,” former Delhi minister Kiran Walia said.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the budget 2021-22 is silent on the present and states no short-term plans for Delhi.“This must be the first state budget in the country which shows dreams to people for what could possibly happen 26 years later. The budget is silent on today’s deteriorating pollution and public transport situation in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/opposition-slams-delhi-budget-says-it-lacks-vision-101615326063812.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Covid shock: Tax revenue estimate slashed by 33.5%||The Delhi government on Tuesday pegged the revised estimate (RE) of tax revenue for fiscal 2020-21 at ₹29,300 crore, down from a budget estimate (BE) of ₹44,100 crore. The government attributed the estimated loss in tax collection to the Covid-19 pandemic.For the upcoming fiscal, the government has pegged tax revenue at ₹43,000 crore (BE), on the hopes that the economy will recover soon. Finance minister Manish Sisodia said the government is working on a multi-pronged strategy to ensure optimum tax collection the coming fiscal and that involves improving GST collections, scaling up excise revenue through a new policy and boosting real estate sales.Sisodia, who tabled the Delhi Budget in the assembly on Tuesday, said tax collections were severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21 — by an estimated 40% of the budget estimate till January 2021.In 2020-21, the budget estimate for tax revenue was ₹44,100 crore, which has now been revised to ₹29,300 crore.“This is an extreme revision,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified. For instance, the BE for tax revenue for 2019-20 was ₹42,500 crore and the RE was ₹39,550 crore.The actual tax revenue figures for 2020-21 would reflect in the 2022-23 budget.The break-up of the budget tax revenue of ₹43,000 crore for 2021-22, showed a share of ₹6,000 crore from state excise, ₹5,000 crore from stamp duty, registration fee on properties and land revenue tax, ₹2,000 crore from motor vehicles, and ₹30,000 crore for state goods and services tax (GST) and value-added tax (VAT) taken together.In 2020-21, budget estimates of tax revenue through state excise was ₹6,300 crore, stamp duty and registry was ₹5,297 crore, motor vehicle tax was ₹2,500 crore and GST along with VAT was ₹30,000 crore.Sisodia said the government will work on a multi-pronged strategy to increase revenue.“We shall use data analytics and business intelligence to prevent any possible leakages in taxes this year. We have commissioned a study on improved GST implementation. We have started keeping an eye on the commercial vehicles going in and out of Delhi through RFID (radio frequency identification) and have initiated a dialogue through SMS with businesspersons on tax issues,” the deputy chief minister said.Sisodia further said, “Comprehensive changes are being made to the excise policy to improve the collection of taxes. This will include preventing the sale of non-duty paid liquor (smuggled from other states) and various new changes to bring liquor shopping in Delhi up to international standards. To come out of extraordinary circumstances, we often need to take extraordinary measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-shock-tax-revenue-estimate-slashed-by-335-101615324436467.html
10-03-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata: Blame game starts after high-rise fire||A day after nine people were killed in a fire on the 13th floor of the Eastern Railway’s office in central Kolkata, a political blame game started with the BJP and the TMC accusing each other days ahead of the assembly elections in West Bengal.Even governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who visited the spot, blamed the Mamata Banerjee-led state government. A case of negligence under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code was lodged and Kolkata police started a probe. The fire department and the railways ordered separate probes into the incident.By Tuesday afternoon, authorities could identify all the nine bodies which were found on the top floor of the building.“I salute the bravery of 3 Railway personnel, including RPF Constable Sanjay Sahni, Dy Chief Comm. Mgr. Partha Sarathi Mondal & Sr Technician Sudip Das, along with 5 firefighters & a police ASI, who laid down their lives to stop fire at Eastern Railways Strand road office, Kolkata,” Piyush Goyal, Union railway minister, tweeted.On Monday night Banerjee said, “The property belongs to the railways, it’s their responsibility but they were unable to provide a map of building. I don’t want to do politics over the tragedy but no one from the railways has come here,” she said.BJP leaders hit back with a alleging that there had been no improvement in firefighting over the past decade. “WB needs a proactive disaster management policy, equip local bodies with fire-fighting equipment and put in appropriate protocols... Pishi has failed Bengal,” tweeted Amit Malviya, BJP’s IT cell head.Meanwhile governor Dhankhar, who has acrimonious relations with the Banerjee administration, blamed the TMC government after visiting the spot.Preliminary investigations revealed that all the nine persons who died used the elevator.“Nearly all (seven) the bodies were lying inside the elevator. One or two were just outside the elevator.

10-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand jinx: Except ND Tiwari, no other CM could complete 5-year term||Politicians across the political spectrum believe that whosoever lives in the CM house in Dehradun is not able to complete his five-year tenure in the state.With Trivendra Singh Rawat’s resignation as the chief minister a year before the completion of his five-year tenure, the belief has got stronger in the state's political circle.The state has seen chief ministers change almost ten times in the past 20 years since it was carved out of Uttar Pradesh after a violent agitation in 2000.The only chief minister to complete his tenure of five years was Congress' Narayan Dutt Tiwari who became the chief minister in 2002.Also read: Replacing Rawat - 3 frontrunners, 2 parliamentarians in race for post of U'khand CMIndira Hridayesh, leader of opposition said it was Vijay Bahuguna first who had lived in the CM house and couldn’t complete his term. “When Harish Rawat became the CM, due to fear of the jinx, he didn’t live in the CM House. He lived in the Bijapur area in Dehradun. ND Tiwari was the only CM who completed his five-year term and also stayed there. Due to the fear of this jinx, many CMs didn’t live there. But Trivendra Singh Rawat chose to live in the CM house. I think some Vastu experts had also been brought to check it in the past,” she said.Historian Shekhar Pathak said though many believe in this jinx, the fact is that it was the weakness of the respective governments that the chief ministers couldn’t complete their terms.“There is another jink that may be talked about now. After the Kedarnath tragedy in 2013, Vijay Bahuguna lost his post of CM and now post the Chamoli tragedy the same has happened with Rawat. But these are just speculations. People, including politicians, try to see a pattern in such developments,” he said.Professor MM Semwal, a political analyst from Garhwal University, said this jinx has been always talked about in state politics as no CM except for ND Tiwari could complete his five-year term. “But from a logical point of view, I don’t think we can link political developments to such superstitions. All these major political changes in the state over the years have political reasons. One house cannot affect or bring such changes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-jinx-except-nd-tiwari-no-other-cm-could-complete-5-year-term-101615320470264.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||3 hammer, stab senior citizens in Goa, arrested in Mumbai||The Mumbai crime branch along with Goa police arrested three accused from Dadar on Tuesday for allegedly killing two senior citizens – son and mother-in-law – in Goa over payments. The victims were hit with a hammer and iron rod on their head on Monday morning.The arrested accused are RavinKumar GhanshyamKumar Sada, 18, Akash Ajaykumar Ghosh, 20, Adityakumar Kharwal, 18. Sada is originally from Bihar, while Ghosh and Kharwal are from Jharkhand.According to police, the deceased, Minguel Miranda, 65, stayed in Ambaji in South Goa, along with his family and 86-year-old mother-in-law, Caterrina Pinto. Miranda was a contractor. Miranda had not paid the three accused for the past three months, said police official. The incident occurred on Monday around 8:30am, when the accused visited Miranda’s residence and asked for their money. The argument turned into a fight. Pinto who was in the house tried to intervene when an accused pushed her and she fell to the ground, said official. “In a fit of rage, one of the accused picked up a hammer lying nearby, while another picked up an iron rod and started hitting the two on the head, said a police officer from Goa.“Another accused then picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed Miranda. They took a train to Mumbai,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-hammer-stab-senior-citizens-in-goa-arrested-in-mumbai-101615320384164.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Big push for health in Delhi's budget||The Delhi government on Tuesday presented its budget for 2021-22 with a total outlay of ₹69,000 crore, themed around “deshbhakti” (patriotism), promised to make the per capita income in the city state equivalent to that in Singapore by 2047, and get the Capital ready to bid to host the 2048 Olympic Games.The budget, tabled by Delhi’s finance minister (and also deputy chief minister) Manish Sisodia in the legislative assembly, saw an increase of 6.15% from the previous year’s budgeted outlay of Rs65,000 crore, now revised to Rs59,000 crore. This is the government’s first budget after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to a revenue loss of around 40%, said Sisodia.Sisodia announced an “aam aadmi free covid vaccine” scheme under which the Delhi government will provide free Covid vaccination at all state-run health care centres. In private hospitals, however, doses will cost up to ₹250 per dose. He also said the government will increase its daily Covid vaccination capacity from 45,000 persons to 60,000 in the “next few days”.Like its last six budgets, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government proposed the highest share for the education sector in which it plans to build a “virtual model school” and a university specifically for teachers’ training. The proposed outlay for education is ₹16,377 crore, which is 23.7% of the total budget estimate, and an increase of ₹1,285 crore from the previous year’s budgeted allocation on education. This was followed by the health sector, which has been allocated ₹9,934 crore, an increase of ₹2,230 crore more from last year’s budget– the highest sector-wise increase. “The vaccine for freedom from Covid-19 will be available in the market for ₹250, but we have families in Delhi who would have to choose either to buy a full month’s ration for their family or get the vaccination for corona from their monthly salary,” said Sisodia.The announcement drew flak from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which alleged that the same scheme is being run by the central government across all states and union territories.Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India, said: “Extensive vaccine coverage is needed even for people below the age of 60, because of a high prevalence of comorbidities in younger age groups. Many people with those health conditions are unaware of them, especially in the lower socio-economic groups. Both to protect such people and to slow down the transmission, vaccines have to be administered free of cost in government hospitals. The decision for free vaccine administration for all in government hospitals is a welcome move.”With around at least 2,300 new buses, including 1,300 electric buses, planned over the next one year, the Delhi government allocated ₹9,394 crore for transport and road infrastructure which is an increase of ₹2,050 crore from last year.The budget also laid out the government’s vision for the next 25 years, which includes bidding for the 2048 Olympics and making Delhi’s per capita income equivalent to that of Singapore’s by 2047. Delhi’s current per capita income is ₹3.54 lakh a year; Singapore’s is around $60,000. To be sure, comparisons will also have to factor in purchasing power parity.To commemorate 75 years of independent India (August 15, 2022 is the 75th independence day), the government allocated ₹45 crore for installing Indian flags, like the giant one in Connaught Place, across 500 locations in the city. The Indian tricolour in Connaught Place is hoisted on the top of a 207 feet high mast. The flag is 60 feet in width and 90 feet in length.The government also plans to organise patriotic programmes running for 75 weeks at a stretch, a daily class to teach patriotism in government-run schools, and also allocated a separate budget for events to celebrate the lives of Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar .Addressing a press conference after the assembly session, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi budget is a reflection of “efficient financial management” as the Capital’s revenue continued to be in surplus despite actual collections declining by 40% against the targeted budget estimate due to the strict lockdown. He explained that despite the pandemic, the budget is 6% more than the previous year’s outlay which was possible because the Delhi government kept its establishment costs (cost incurred on running the government machinery) at 45% and assigned 55% of the proposed funds towards subsidy schemes, programmes and infrastructure projects. “The budget covers all aspects of the society, from women to the elderly, students, youth, all religions, and all castes. This budget has laid the foundation for what India should be like in 2047 when she completes 100 years of independence. The aim for 2047 is to bring Delhi’s per capita income at par with Singapore.”Sudhir Krishna, former chairman of the 5th Delhi Finance Commission, said: “The primary sector of agriculture and secondary sector of industry contribute as much as 37% to the GDP of India as a whole, whereas for Delhi, it is just about 20%. Owing to environmental and geographical constraints, Delhi cannot expect to push these sectors and needs to strengthen the tertiary sector such as trade, hotels, restaurants, and real estate, which contribute as much as 80% to the Gross State Value Addition (GSVA) of Delhi. Therefore, Delhi should work on travel, tourism including medical tourism and education tourism and service activities like call centres, BPOs etc. Enhancing the quality of life of the residents through the improved safe water supply, cleaner air and water, quality education and healthcare would not only provide greater well-being for Delhi residents, but would also attract visitors from within India and abroad, which will add to Delhi’s GSVA.”On plans to host the 2048 Olympics in Delhi, Kejriwal said his government will take up whatever infrastructure and other necessities are needed to be created for the same. “We will also discuss this with the Central government as without their efforts achieving this dream would not be possible,” he said.In the budget the government emphasised on women’s empowerment with new schemes such as Mohalla clinics for women, using its anganwadi hubs as a resource to help women entrepreneurs develop micro business enterprises and promoting self-help groups, enhancing safety at tourist spots, and setting up 33 self-help units to make women aware of existing government schemes for women such as free bus rides, widow pensions, scholarships for school-going girls, etc.Sisodia cited a government survey and said that before the Covid crisis, in February 2020, 26% of women in Delhi were unemployed. In February 2021, this statistic was 40%, he said. “This reveals that among the women of Delhi, who are available for employment, 40% are unable to find any work; 45% of these women have completed 12th class and 60% of these women are less than 30 years of age. It is essential to economically empower these women and integrate them with the economy of the family and the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/big-push-for-health-in-delhi-s-budget-101615319176597.html
10-03-2021||Chandigarh||ED raids Punjab MLA Khaira, 8 others over ‘links with drug syndicate’||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday raided premises belonging to Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira and his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal along with seven others for allegedly being part of an international drug smuggling syndicate having links in Pakistan and the UK as well as a human trafficking racket, agency officials familiar with the development said. The central agency registered two cases a few weeks back to investigate money laundering, the first on the basis of a trans-border drug smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab, in 2015, in which 1,800g heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by police; and the second pertaining to a fake passport racket being run in Delhi. Nine smugglers were sentenced in the Fazilka case in October 2017, including Gurdev Singh, Manjit Singh, Harbans Singh and Subhash Chander, raided by the ED on Tuesday. Khaira, who was present at his Sector 5 bungalow in Chandigarh during the ED raid, denied any wrongdoing. “Those who speak against the government are often targeted by them. It has not happened for the first time. My father and I have been fighting injustice throughout our lives and my crusade continues,” said Khaira, adding that those supporting the farmers’ protest and speaking against the central government were being targeted by the Centre. “There is no question of any money laundering. In fact, I am under debt. I have taken an agriculture loan of ₹2 crore, for which I am paying ₹22 lakh as annual interest,” he said. Khaira was elected to the state assembly in 2017 on an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket but later quit the party and launched his own political outfit. Khaira’s name cropped up in the case in 2017. Although not named in the Punjab police charge sheet, Khaira was issued summons by a Fazilka court on November 30, 2017. He was Punjab’s leader of the opposition as an AAP legislator at that time. However, the Supreme Court granted him relief by staying the proceedings against him. An ED official, requesting anonymity, said: “Sukhpal Singh Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime”. The lawmaker is likely to be called for questioning at the agency’s Delhi office. After the raids, Punjab MLAs cutting across party lines raised the issue in the state assembly and described the move as “political intimidation” by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-raids-punjab-mla-khaira-8-others-over-links-with-drug-syndicate-101615319547486.html

10-03-2021||Chandigarh||Old water rates till pandemic lasts, resolves Chandigarh MC||After a heated debate over the water tariff hike, which saw the opposition Congress and ruling Bharatiya Janata Party councillors coming face-to-face in the well of the House several times, the Chandigarh municipal corporation on Tuesday resolved to roll it back.The old rates, in effect before the UT administration notified the hiked water tariff in September 2020, will continue till the Covid-19 pandemic lasts, the House stated in its resolution.With residents already getting inflated water bills, the MC House decided that these would be adjusted in subsequent bills.After the pandemic gets over, the MC House proposed a partial rollback to the September hike (see box).The resolution will now be sent to the administration for its approval and withdrawal of the notification.Notably, this is the third resolution and second within six months, in which the MC has sought reduction in water tariff rates after its initial December 2019 resolution to increase it.Admn had asked MC to reconsider rollback resolutionIn September 2020, the administration had notified up to threefold hike in water tariff, depending upon the category of users and consumption level.After facing a public outcry and criticism from the opposition, the MC House had passed a resolution in October, asking the administration to withdraw the notification and stick to the existing rates till the pandemic lasts. However, the administration this year asked the MC to reconsider its resolution, citing the huge revenue losses in water supply management.BJP-Cong indulge in blame game, commissioner opposes moveDuring the debate, Congress and BJP councillors exchanged heated jibes. The House proceedings were disturbed when Congress councillors offered bangles to BJP councillors, who in turn presented them with lotus flowers. Both groups kept shouting “shame, shame” against each other.Demanding a rollback, Congress councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla criticised BJP for imposing the hike. During the entire House proceedings, Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla sat on a dharna outside the House.Chandigarh BJP chief and councillor Arun Sood said: “Rates should not be increased till the Covid-19 pandemic lasts. After that, it should be increased only gradually, so that there is no financial burden on residents. MC’s financial health should also be improved.”MC commissioner KK Yadav said the rollback would negatively impact the civic body’s capacity to improve water supply. He also contended that slashing of water tariff hike would benefit only those who are wasting water.For post-pandemic times, rates revised, sewerage cess slashedFor the post pandemic period, the House decided to slash the hike in two consumption slabs of residential supply. For households with monthly consumption of 31-60 kilolitre, in which most consumers fit, the rate has been cut from ₹12/kl to ₹9/kl. For the top slab, with monthly water consumption over 60kl, it has been slashed to ₹16/kl from ₹24/kl.Charges for industrial establishments have been cut from ₹30/kl to ₹25/kl (there are no consumptions slabs for them), while for shops and booths, the House has recommended doing away with flat minimum charges and imposition of rates as per actual consumption.Meanwhile, the hefty sewerage cess has also been proposed to be reduced from 30% of the water bill to just 5%.When it comes to the annual hike, the UT notification imposed 3% rise in water tariff every year. The House in its latest resolution decided to go for 5% automatic hike on the basic rate after every three years.Penalty for misuse of drinking water has also been revised. Instead of a flat rate of ₹5,000, it has been stratified. The MC House decided that the first violation will invite a fine of ₹3,000. If there is a second violation within 30 days of the first one, it will lead to ₹5,000 fine, and subsequent ones will also lead to the same fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/old-water-rates-till-pandemic-lasts-resolves-chandigarh-mc-101615318044635.html
10-03-2021||Lucknow||CISH’s seed exchange concept to boost garlic farming||LUCKNOW The Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) has come out with a new seed-exchange concept, which, the scientists say, will not only help in meeting the increased demand of garlic but will also act as an alternate source of income to farmers.What is the seed village or seed-exchange concept? Shailendra Rajan, director CISH said that under this, the first thing the scientists do is to identify the high-yielding crop that can be cultivated by farmers of a particular place. Once identified, the farmers of the area are provided with the high variety seeds so that they can multiply the variety by sharing the seeds among farmers hailing from other villages and areas.“However, in this case, a particular variety of garlic seed—Yamuna Safed that was procured from National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) were supplied to farmers so that they can multiply this variety which has bold clove and higher yield than local clove,” said Rajan.He said, the initiative will not only help farmers successfully produce garlic for their own use but will also help them in increasing the farming of garlic, which in turn will bring down its prices.Initially, the institute has picked farmers from Mall, Kakori and Malihabad development blocks for the seed-exchange concept.Rajan said that recently, the CISH had also organised a field day in Thari village of the Mall block. The event was attended by the more than 200 farmers from Kakori and Mall blocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cishs-seed-exchange-concept-to-boost-garlic-farming-101615317984006.html

The aviation regulator said air crew getting inoculated will be monitored for 30 minutes at the Covid-19 vaccination centre for any anaphylactic and idiosyncratic reaction, following which, they will be termed to be medically unfit for flying for 48 hours after getting inoculated. “We have laid down the protocol for vaccination of the flight crew and it will be applicable with immediate effect,” said Arun Kumar, director general of DGCA. DGCA said any and every air crew that has no reactions even after 48 hours of getting inoculated, will be declared fit to resume their ‘unrestricted’ flying duties. The circular read, ‘If, after 48 hours, the pilot experiences any symptoms, he/ she will be reviewed by treating physician/ company doctor or his/her AMA. Such pilots can be declared fit for flying duties provided they are asymptomatic without any medications and a ‘medical cure certificate’ to this effect to be obtained.’ However, DGCA clarified that if the air crew’s medical unfitness, post his/her inoculation is more than 14 days old, then a ‘special medical examination’ will be required to ascertain their fitness for operating flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aircrew-to-be-unfit-to-fly-for-48-hours-after-being-innoculated-dgca-101615317684511.html

10-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Gangster Ravi Pujari’s police custody extended till March 15||The special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court on Tuesday extended the police custody of gangster Ravi Pujari till March 15 after he pleaded for an extension of his remand, claiming that he wanted to share more information with the police.Pujari was produced before the special MCOCA court on Tuesday morning after his custody period expired. Pujari is arrested by Mumbai Police in connection with a case of firing outside the Gajalee Hotel, on October 22, 2016, in Vile Parle.The public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves sought his further custody claiming that they needed to confront Pujari with several facts. The prosecution claimed that his confession statement has been recorded and the investigating officer needs to question him on his statement. Meanwhile, the plea was objected by Pujari’s lawyer DS Manerkar.After hearing both the side when the court was to pass an order, Pujari stepped into the witness box to make submissions before the court. To everyone’s surprise, Pujari pleaded the court to send him to police custody for five more days has he wanted to reveal more information.After hearing the prosecution and Pujari, the court extended his custody till March 15. Pujari was brought to Mumbai from Bengaluru on February 22 in connection with the 2016 firing case. As per the prosecution, a few men of Pujari’s gang fired at the complainant to intimidate the hotel owner. They allegedly gave the owner Pujari’s contact details, threatening to kill him if he didn’t call the gangster.Last year in November, the Mumbai Police did not get the custody of gangster Ravi Pujari from Bengaluru court as Pujari’s defence lawyer claimed that the Senegal authority had not permitted any cases registered by Mumbai Police against Pujari. The Senegal court extradited Pujari to India only in one case, which was registered in Karnataka in February 2020.The Mumbai crime branch had then approached Senegal court through the ministry of external affairs (MEA) again in January 2021 and sent details of 10 cases that were approved by the Senegal court last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-gangster-ravi-pujari-s-police-custody-extended-till-march-15-101615317085097.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran death: Fadnavis demands cop’s arrest||Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday demanded the arrest of a police officer Sachin Vaze in connection with the death of Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer linked to the SUV found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter. Fadnavis’s comments in the Maharashtra assembly caused uproar among the legislators, who traded accusations and brought up other unrelated cases, including the death by suicide of Dadra Nagar Haveli parliamentarian Mohan Delkar in Mumbai last month, leading deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal to adjourn the penultimate day of the House in session several times. Later in the day, state home minister Anil Deshmukh announced that a special investigation team (SIT) will be formed to probe Delkar’s death by suicide. In a note, Delkar referred to an administrator of the Union Territory who had been a minister in a BJP-led government in Gujarat. Fadnavis accused the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of shielding Vaze and called for his arrest under section 201 of Indian Penal Code, which pertains to causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information. Fadnavis referred to the statement that Hiran’s wife, Vimla, 43, had given to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) after her husband’s body was found washed up in a creek in Thane district neighbouring Mumbai on March 5, hours after his family had reported him missing since the previous night. In the statement reviewed by HT, Vimla stated that she was sure that her husband was murdered, and assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, who heads the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai police crime branch, and was known to Hiran, may have committed it. “In her statement, Mansukh Hiran’s wife has said that the car found outside Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s South Mumbai residence, was in possession of Sachin Vaze from November 20 last year. The car was given to him for use as Hiren knew Vaze who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiren after four months,” Fadnavis said on Tuesday. On March 7, the ATS registered a case of murder of the 48-year-old Thane businessman against unknown persons based on Vimla’s statement. “She had said her husband was with Vaze on February 27, 28 and March 2. The complaint letter (of Hiran) addressed to the chief minister, home minister and police commissioners of Mumbai and Thane which surfaced in public after his death, was written on the instructions of Vaze,” Fadnavis said. Hiran wrote the letter on March 2, after sustained interrogation by several police officers starting February 25. Fadnavis said Hiran’s wife also claimed in her statement that her husband had told her that Vaze had asked him to get himself arrested and he would ensure his bail in a few days. “On April 4, Mansukh told his brother Vinod to speak to a lawyer for anticipatory bail as he might be arrested. But, the lawyer said anticipatory bail will not be accepted as Mansukh is not an accused,” Fadnavis said. Vaze did not respond to several calls and messages seeking his response to the allegations made by Vimla and the former chief minister. Fadnavis further claimed that Hiran’s last location was found with Dhananjay Vithal Gawde, against whom an FIR was lodged in 2017 for seeking a ransom of ₹40 lakh. The other person who was mentioned in the FIR is Sachin Vaze, Fadnavis said. “The last location of Hiren before his death was at Gawade’s office in Thane, 40-km away from the creek where the body was found. The Anti-Terrorism Squad has been investigation case of murder, but Vaze should first be arrested under section 201 of Indian Penal Code,” Fadnavis said. “I deny of any involvement with Sachin Vaze or Mansukh Hiran,” Dhananjay Gawde, a former Shiv Sena corporator in Vasai, said. “I closed my old office two years ago so how can anyone say that the location [of the body] was near my office,” Gawde, who was later expelled from the party, added. Vimla’s statement The days leading up to Hiran’s mysterious death saw him cooperate with various police officers investigating this matter, Vimla told the ATS investigators. The vehicle belonged to a certain Dr Peter Newton who was known to her deceased husband. The SUV – a Scorpio -- was in possession of the Hirans for the past three years. Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop in Thane, on February 5, 2021. On February 17, at around 6.30pm, Hiran took the vehicle heading towards south Mumbai, the statement read. However, its steering was not smooth which prompted Hiran to park the car on the side of the road, and proceed further by a taxi. The following day, the statement added, Hiran took a mechanic with him to bring the vehicle back. However, when he reached the spot, he found that the car had been stolen following which he lodged a complaint with Vikroli police station. “On February 25, an ATS official named Salvi called my husband and asked him to meet him in the building compound. My husband and son went down and met Salvi, who showed them a picture on his phone of an SUV found near Ambani’s house. My husband identified the vehicle and also informed him that he had filed a complaint with the Vikroli police station that it had been stolen. He also showed the FIR copy to him,” Vimla’s statement read. The same night ATS officer Shivaji Chavan visited their residence and and took Hiran to the Vikroli ATS unit. There, he was shown some CCTV footage. He was brought back to his house at 6.30am on February 26, the statement added. For three days, Hiran was called for questioning by the Mumbai police crime branch and he had told his wife that Vaze had been with him throughout, the statement said. On March 2, Hiran wrote a letter to various authorities complaining that he was being harassed by police of various units and police stations and a particular media person, who kept calling repeatedly. Vimla said that she had asked him if he had been tortured, which Hiran denied.The following day, Hiran told her that Vaze had advised him to get arrested in case and he would be out on bail within a few days, the statement read. On March 4, Vimala said that her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road. Vimala told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, her son spoke to Hiran’s brother, Vinod to inform him that Hiran had not returned home. Vinod called Vaze, who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde. The following morning, Hiran’s son Meet and Vinod lodged a missing person’s report at Naupada police station. Hiran’s body was discovered later in the afternoon, and Vinod went to identify it at Kalwa hospital in Mumbra. Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Mumbra and when police removed it, five to six handkerchiefs were stuffed in his mouth, and the mouth was covered by a scarf. Vimala claimed that her husband was a good swimmer and could not have died by drowning. “Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of the statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.” Shiv Sena leader and parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab demanded action in Delkar’s suicide in response to Fadnavis’s accusation. Parab said that Delkar mentioned administrator of the Union Territory Praful Kheda Patel in his suicide note. Patel was earlier a minister in the Narendra Modi-led cabinet in Gujarat. Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh later announced that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) would probe Delkar’s suicide. The Union government on Monday asked the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mansukh-hiran-death-fadnavis-demands-cop-s-arrest-101615317083974.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Submit report on impact of construction on Banganga tank: Bombay HC||After the Bombay high court (HC) had permitted two developers to continue the piling and construction activity around the Banganga tank last week, the court on Tuesday directed the Central groundwater board to be made party to the petition filed by the trust opposing the piling and construction work. The court has issued directions to study the impact of the construction activity on the spring water, which flows into the tank, to ensure that the supply does not dry up, and the grade I heritage structure should not become dead. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by the Temple Trust of Walkeshwar temple and Banganga tank, was informed that as per the directions of the bench last week a survey had been done of the water in the tank while construction activity was on and a sample of the water was also brought before the court. After hearing the apprehension of the trust, through the petition that the state-protected grade I heritage structure was under threat due to the piling and construction activity undertaken close to the temple and tank premise. The petition had alleged that there was water contamination which caused an imminent threat to the water springs. The court had stayed the construction and asked the director of archaeology and museums to conduct a survey to verify the allegations. After the report said that the allegations were incorrect, piling and construction work was allowed to restart. Another survey was ordered, while the work was in progress. However, on Tuesday, after the report was submitted, the petitioner still had grievances that the directorate of archaeology and museums and the Geological Survey of India, were not the proper authorities to survey and comment on the potential damage to the lake due to the piling and construction work. The bench took cognizance and observed, “These are natural springs by virtue of which Banganga lake survives. It’s acknowledged that some activity is affecting natural springs. Now the direction of the spring is to be studied. Also, will Banganga become a dead monument if complete water supply is gone? It is a serious issue. It should be studied by an authority which deals with spring water/deep water study,” said justice Kulkarni. He added that the underground report submitted by the state government, based on the finding of geologists, was insufficient. Thereafter the chief justice asked the petitioner to add the Central Groundwater Board as a party to the petition and posted the hearing to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/submit-report-on-impact-of-construction-on-banganga-tank-bombay-hc-101615316964469.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||No coercive action against Usmani during interrogation: State assures Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed Sharjeel Usmani, the former student leader of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), who is booked for making a provocative speech during the Elgar Parishad conference at Pune, to add Pradeep Gawade - the complainant, as a party to the petition and also asked Usmani to attend the police station for interrogation. The court has posted the hearing of the petition to March 15.The directions were issued after the police orally assured the court that no coercive action would be taken against Usmani when he attends the police station.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing Usmani’s petition seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) filed against him by the Swargate police station on February 2 for the alleged provocative speech, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the complaint was frivolous. He said some of his client’s statement was being taken out of context to show that he was inciting people and creating enmity between different communities.Desai further submitted that while the petition sought quashing of the FIR and proceedings arising out of it, protection was also sought against coercive action while attending the police station where he has been called for interrogation. Desai said that Usmani was willing to cooperate and attend the police station, but he must be provided protection, lest he be arrested. Before the bench or police could respond, advocate Aniket Nikam sought permission to intervene in the petition on behalf of Gawade, the regional secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuwa Morcha (BJYM), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who had given a letter to Swargate police station alleging that Usmani’s speech was against the Hindu community and aimed at creating animosity between communities. Usmani was thereafter booked under section 153 (A) of the Indian Penal Code.On its part, the state through additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik informed the court that Usmani had been called for initial interrogation and also gave an oral assurance that under the notice issued to Usmani, the police could not take coercive action, hence the apprehension of Usmani of being arrested on attending the police station was unfounded. After hearing the submissions, the HC directed Usmani to add Gawade as a party to the petition and also directed him to attend the police station and posted the petition for hearing on Monday, March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-coercive-action-against-usmani-during-interrogation-state-assures-bombay-hc-101615316784334.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||No lockdown or night curfew for now, says Mumbai civic chief||Amid the recent surge in Covid-19 cases and consequent tightening of norms to contain the spread in Mumbai, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said no new lockdown measures will be announced in Mumbai and also no night curfew, as of now.This was after Chahal’s review meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday evening. Chahal told HT: “No new lockdown measures are introduced in Mumbai. There are no micro containment zones in Mumbai.” Also, in a significant development, the civic body has also allowed vaccination centres in the city to work 24x7 and even on Sundays. Meanwhile, there has been a substantial increase in the number of sealed buildings in the city, in view of the spike in infections since the first week of February. According to its protocol, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been sealing buildings with more than five cases and floors of buildings that house a single case. A senior civic official said, “BMC has already reduced containment zones to prevent inconvenience to the people. It is sealing one entire building, or just a single floor of a building on the basis of our protocol.” As of March 8, Mumbai has 21 containment zones, and 214 sealed buildings. In the past week, this figure has substantially increased. On February 28, Mumbai had 12 containment zones, and 137 sealed buildings. According to BMC’s press note of February 18, however, there are 57 containment zones and 258 sealed buildings in the city.On Monday, Thackeray had asked district and city administrations to earmark micro containment zones. He also directed that areas that are most affected and have a high positivity rate should increase tracing to 30 people per infection. A containment zone is an earmarked area that has a high Covid-19 positivity rate or presence of large number of cases. The number of cases needed to earmark an area as containment zone depends on the density of population. In a city like Mumbai, an area can become containment zone if four-five cases are found. An entire building can become a containment zone and hence sealed, preventing movement of people. A micro containment zone is relatively smaller in area or in places like Mumbai it could just be a floor instead of an entire building. Micro zones are suggested to minimise inconvenience to people and for better management of containment measures as movement can be restricted effectively to check spread of the epidemic.In Mumbai, containment zones are typically slums or chawls, which do not have a compound or gate to seclude them naturally from the rest of the area. In case of high-rise buildings or gated communities, buildings are sealed.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “Our containment zone and sealed building policy is as good as micro-containment zoning. In such cases, no one is allowed to enter to exit a sealed building. Essential goods can be left at the gate of the building.” In case of sealed buildings, it is the job of the secretary of the housing society to ensure everyone follows containment rules. Regarding the CM’s directions of increasing the number of contacts traced per positive patient to 30, Kakani said, “We are in fact doing more and exploring other options in contact tracing as well. When we come across a case, we go back 15 days to see where all the person went, whom he or she met, if he or she attended any function or ceremony. This way it becomes easier to trace the source of the infection.” As per data available on Monday, within 24 hours leading to Sunday evening, BMC traced over 6,000 high-risk contacts. Presently, BMC traces up to 25 high-risk contacts per Covid-19 patient.On February 18, at a meeting with top civic officers, including deputy municipal commissioners in charge of the zones in Mumbai and assistant commissioners in charge of wards, Chahal directed the administration to tighten containment and quarantine measures in the city. Following this, the number of sealed buildings and containment zones increased.Among these measures, were hand stamping of high-risk contacts, so that they can be easily identified should they break home quarantine rules; reverting to the older practice of sealing an entire building if more than five cases are found in them; and increasing the number of contacts traced per patient to 25, from the earlier 15 or 16. BMC also filed police complaints against anyone who broke home quarantine rules, which can result in a jail term up to 6 months or fine, or both.A senior civic official said, “We still have a larger number of cases from buildings than from slums. Moreover, we are able to seal one building, even in a gated community of say eight or nine buildings. Hence the number of sealed buildings is more than containment zones.”When a building is sealed, no resident can exit it during the duration of its containment, which is usually 14 days from the time five cases or more are discovered in the building. No visitor can enter the building either. Essential workers and frontline workers who are residents of the building can take permission from the ward officer to report to work every day. Essential commodities can be supplied by relatives or vendors at the gate of the building.In case a floor is sealed, residents of the remaining floors of the building can exit the building, but no one is allowed to enter the floor. High-risk or close contacts of Covid-19 patients have to be under home quarantine. Other residents of the floor do not have strict restrictions on mobility.An assistant commissioner who did not wish to be named said, “In case of containment zones, of slums, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage mobility. It was easier during lockdown. Now with the entire city unlocked, and in slums that have multiple entry exit points, it is not possible to ensure strict quarantine.” BMC institutionally quarantines a large number of high-risk contacts from slums. During the February 18 meeting, Chahal also directed the administration to increase the number of Covid Care Centres (CCC1) by reactivating dormant CCC1s to quarantine high-risk contacts of patients, to at least one centre per ward.Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner in charge of north-west Mumbai, said, “We mark lanes that lead out of containment zones, typically slums, and we shut the entry with bamboos or tin sheets. The security aspect of this is managed by the police, who station policemen at entry or exit points. Containment zones are demarcated if we see a large cluster of cases being reported from a single area.”The BMC has now given blanket permission to all vaccination centres in the city to operate 24X7 and even operate on Sundays, according to Kakani. He said, “It is their call to operate 24X7, depending on resources available. But we have intimated all hospitals to do so.” Presently there are 68 active vaccination centres in the city. Kakani said, “15 more private hospitals are being added to the list of vaccination centres to increase our capacity. They can start the centres from Wednesday itself.” Meanwhile, a day after announcing lockdown in hotspots, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has backtracked and said there will be no complete restriction on movement and all facilities as per the state government’s “Mission Begin Again”, will continue as before. Only a few restrictions will be imposed in these containment areas as per government guidelines. The corporation is also making a list of micro containment zones based on guidelines from the state.

10-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fadnavis demands Vaze’s arrest; MVA govt announces SIT probe in Delkar suicide case||Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday raised suspicion over the role of police officer Sachin Vaze in businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death case and demanded his arrest. This led to an uproar in the state assembly.From the treasury benches, Shiv Sena and Congress demanded the arrest of those involved in Dadra and Nagar Haveli’s member of Parliament (MP) Mohan Delkar’s suicide and accused Fadnavis of hushing up Anway Naik suicide case when he was at the helm of the state.Meanwhile, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh announced that a special investigation team (SIT) will probe the Delkar suicide case.Fadnavis, while raising the issue in the state assembly, alleged that Hiran was murdered in a car and his body was thrown in Thane creek last week and Vaze should be immediately arrested under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code for his involvement in it. Fadnavis accused the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi of shielding Vaze by not initiating action against him.“In her statement to the police, Mansukh Hiran’s wife has said that the car found outside Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence, was in possession of Sachin Vaze from November 20, last year. The car was given to him for use as Hiran knew Vaze, who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiran after four months,” he said.Fadnavis said that Vaze and one Dhananjay Gawade were named in an FIR lodged for extortion in 2017. “The anti-terrorism squad has been investigating the case of murder, but Vaze should first be arrested under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code,” said Fadnavis.Vaze was the investigation officer in the case being probed by the Mumbai crime branch after the vehicle was found abandoned outside Ambani’s house. It had some sticks of gelatine, an explosive.Fadnavis also said that according to the statement, Vaze had asked Hiran to get arrested in the case which was being investigated by the Mumbai crime branch. “The letter submitted to the chief minister, home minister and police commissioner of Mumbai by Hiran was written on behest of Vaze,” alleged Fadnavis.Hiran’s body was found near Retibunder area in Thane creek last Friday hours after he went missing. Hiran, a Thane businessman, was the owner of the vehicle found outside Ambani’s residence in Mumbai two weeks ago. In response to the allegations by Fadnavis, Shiv Sena leader and parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab demanded action in Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar’s suicide in Mumbai two weeks ago. Parab said Delkar had named the union territory’s administrator in his suicide note, despite which, no arrest has been made so far. Congress’s Nana Patole said that Delkar, who was found dead in a south Mumbai hotel on February 22, has held the administrator of the union territory responsible for his suicide in a note left behind.Shiv Sena member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) and former minister Bhaskar Jadhav accused Fadnavis of hushing up the Anway Naik case when the latter was chief minister and home minister. “Vaze is being targeted because he was in the team which arrested Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami for the alleged involvement in Anway Naik case. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not want Vaze to remain in the investigation team, hence the pressure is being mounted for his suspension. Fadnavis had hushed up the Naik suicide case,” he alleged.Naik died by suicide in 2018, holding Goswami and the other two responsible for non-payment of the interior design work allotted to his firm.Fadnavis told reporters outside the house that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was worried that Vaze might disclose links to some people in the government if he was grilled. He also said there is one more officer from the anti-extortion cell involved in the entire case. He added that one more vehicle used in the case is missing and he would soon reveal more details. “After we raised the issue in the lower house, state home minister admitted during our meeting in the presence of deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal to suspend Vaze. However, the latter chief minister intervened and the decision was changed,” he said.Responding to allegations in the Hiran case, home minister Anil Deshmukh told the assembly that the ATS (which is probing the case) will investigate the case thoroughly. “Nobody will be spared if found guilty in the case,” he insisted.In response to the accusation of suppressing the Anway Naik case, Fadnavis dared the state government with his inquiry in Naik case. He said that the government should not threaten him just because he raised questions over Vaze’s involvement in the Hiran case. Fadnavis also raised questions over Vaze’s reinstatement in the police force. The officer was suspended from the force in March 2003, on charges of the alleged custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, a suspect in the December 2002 Ghatkopar bomb blast case. In June 2020, the MVA government reinstated him in the force.Meanwhile, Deshmukh also announced an SIT to probe Mohan Delkar’s suicide. He said that the family members of Delkar will be given necessary protection.The announcement of the SIT was made by the home minister in Assembly after the opposition raised the issue of police officer Sachin Vaze’s alleged involvement in Mansukh Hiren’s death case. Deshmukh said in the lower house that in his suicide note, Delkar had named Dadra and Nagar Haveli’s administrator responsible for his suicide and chose Mumbai to take the drastic step as he was sure that he will get justice in Maharashtra. Deshmukh said that Delkar’s wife Kalaben and son Abhinav met him and sought thourugh investigation. Kalaben and Abhinav also met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh at Vidhan Bhavan on Tuesday. Abhinav alleged that public humiliation, harassment by administrator and administration in Dadra and Nagar Haveli forced his father to take extreme step. Deshmukh said that police will ensure protection to Delkar family.Delkar found dead in a south Mumbai hotel on February 22. Pandemonium in the house led to eight adjournments and was later adjourned for the day after opposition continued to raise demand for the suspension of Vaze.

10-03-2021||Lucknow||No substitute for development, says Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday targeted the Congress for neglecting the Bundelkhand region and said instead of working for welfare of the poor, the party caused hindrance in the construction of Ram temple. “The Congress ruled the state for nearly 55 years. It did not work for development of villages and the poor. It also did not take ahead the development projects and instead caused hindrances in the way of construction of Ram temple,” said Yogi while addressing a public meeting at Lalitpur. At Jhansi too, the chief minister referred to the Congress without naming the party, saying when his government was fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, he was being given fake numbers of buses. The Congress party had offered 1000 buses to the state government to carry the migrant labourers to their native places. Yogi, who earlier reviewed progress of Bundelkhand Expressway at Jalaun and later addressed two public meetings at Lalitpur and Jhansi, said there was no substitute for development. He said his government had given in principle approval for an airport at Lalitpur that would enable the people to fly to New Delhi in an hour and Mumbai or Bangkok in two hours. “Besides laying a network of roads, we are also giving an airport to Lalitpur. We have given in principle approval to the project. Now, you will be able to travel to New Delhi in an hour and to Mumbai or Bangkok in two hours. A medical college is also coming up here. I can see the enthusiasm you have. We will make Bundelkhand a heaven,” he said. Once the Bundelkhand expressway is constructed, it would go a long way in ensuring socio-economic development of the area that had been neglected for decades, he claimed.At Jhansi, Yogi said he had laid foundation stones of projects worth ₹500 crore and launched projects of ₹1100 crore. If projects involving such a large amount had been brought to the Bundelkhand, the region would have been a heaven by now, he said. He also referred to the valour of Jhansi Ki Rani and said the people were not able to visit the region due to poor connectivity. He said the state government was working to provide better road and air connectivity and the upcoming defence corridor project would bring the region into focus. “The fighter planes to be manufactured at the defence corridor would demolish the enemy,” he said. Listing projects launched by his government for development of the region, he said the poor could not get their basic facilities that were like a dream for the poor. He said the state and central government were now providing these facilities. He said the government proposed to provide insurance of ₹2 lakh and health cover of ₹5 lakh to the poor. He said this would ensure that those who move out for work in India and abroad would get the insurance cover there too. Earlier, the chief minister reviewed the progress of Bundelkhand Expressway and enquired about the pace of implementation and steps taken to ensure quality. Additional chief secretary (Home) and CEO UPEIDA Avnish Kumar Awasthi informed the chief minister that the Covid-19 pandemic did not have any impact on the project that was being implemented ahead of the schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/no-substitute-for-development-says-yogi-101615316483779.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||No lockdown, only a few curbs: Thane civic body||A day after announcing a lockdown in hotspots, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) backtracked and claimed there will be no complete restriction on movement and the facilities opened up as per the state government’s Mission Begin Again will continue as before. Only a few restrictions will be imposed in these containment areas as per the state government’s guidelines. The corporation is also making a list of micro containment zones based on the guidelines from the state. On Monday night, the civic body announced a list of 16 hotspot zones, most of which include high-rises in Majiwada-Manpada ward. Moreover, plush societies from all other wards except Diva and Mumbra are part of the hotspot list. The notice claimed there will be lockdown in these zones till March 31, which led to panic among residents who believed there will be restriction on movement and other curbs. The TMC though clarified the notice was merely to make people aware about the containment zones in the city and ensure all Covid protocols are followed strictly, said TMC officials. The TMC has appealed to residents to not panic or believe in rumours, as they will continue to get all basic facilities and can step out for essentials as well. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, Thane, said, “There is no complete lockdown anywhere in the city, people should not believe such rumours. There will be restrictions only in micro containment zones, apart from that there will not be any lockdown. We are currently preparing a list of areas where there is an increased number of cases; these will include a floor or wing of any building.” Sharon Abrol, 38, resident of Hiranandani Meadows, said, “We got calls and messages from relatives and friends regarding the lockdown in the city. Our society was also among the hotspot areas listed by the civic body, however, we had no idea if the lockdown meant that we would get our regular supply of groceries and milk. Also, my husband goes to work every alternate day and we had no idea if he could continue to do so. The clarification issued has put us at ease.” G. Mohiuddin Jeddy, Navi Mumbai The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has ordered curbs in the city to control the spread of the virus. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar on Tuesday ordered all restaurants will now shut at 11pm, while shops will down shutters at 10pm. Restaurants in Navi Mumbai were earlier allowed to remain open until 1am, while shops till 11pm. Cases in Navi Mumbai that had dropped considerably in the past couple of months have been showing an upward trend with over 100 cases being reported daily. Bangar said, “I have ordered all canteens, restaurants, café, dining halls among others to operate at 50% capacity only till 11pm. All malls, including shops, will be allowed to remain open till 10pm. We will strictly implement the orders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-lockdown-only-a-few-curbs-thane-civic-body-101615316184462.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Three of Khar family booked for forging Covid report to take a flight to Rajasthan||The Khar police have booked three members of a Khar family, including a minor, who had tested positive for Covid-19, but allegedly forged a Covid report, claiming they all were negative, in order to travel to Jaipur.Police said the accused Lakhmichand Thavani, 53, is a 15th Khar Road resident. Thavani, his wife, Leena, 51 and their 15-year-old daughter wanted to travel to Jaipur on February 27. “As per the rules, they could travel only if they tested negative for Covid. Hence, the family underwent testing through a private lab on February 26. Their report came positive on the morning of February 27,” said a Khar police official.As the family wanted to catch a 9am flight to Jaipur, they didn’t disclose the findings of the report to anyone and left for the airport. But as the private lab had already intimated the concerned BMC officials, a civic doctor called Thavani for assistance. However, Thavani told the doctor that his family has already left for airport as they all tested negative for Covid. When the doctor asked him to send the report, Thavani allegedly sent him a forged report that showed all three family members Covid-19 negative, another officer said.By the time Thavani reached outside the airport, the BMC doctor informed him that they already received original report from the private lab and warned the family from traveling.The family returned home and was directed to remain in home quarantine. After conducting an inquiry, the BMC official on Tuesday approached the Khar police station. On their complaint, the police lodged an FIR under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger¬ous to life), 465 (forgery) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector of Khar Gajanan Kabdule said they would arrest the accused after their quarantine period is over and they test negative for Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/three-of-khar-family-booked-for-forging-covid-report-to-take-a-flight-to-rajasthan-101615316063820.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra districts asked to ramp up measures to curb Covid surge||With the number of cases of Covid-19 increasing in the state, district administrations have been asked to implement measures to control the surge. These include identifying micro-containment zones; increased contact-tracing; and not allowing any large gatherings, which includes weddings as well as political and religious events. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to address citizens this week. On Tuesday, Maharashtra recorded 9,927 cases of Covid-19 and 56 fatalities, taking the Covid tally to 22,38,398. Of these, 95,322 are active cases. There were 12,182 recoveries on Tuesday. The total death toll stands at 52,556. Mumbai recorded 1,012 new cases of Covid-19 and two deaths on Tuesday. The city’s Covid tally is 3,35,595 cases and the total number of deaths from Covid is 11,510. Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said the possibility of imposing partial lockdown or night curfew in the city could not be ruled out. Local authorities have been empowered to take a decision on enforcing a lockdown as and when necessary, he said. “If numbers continue to rise the same way then there is a possibility of night clubs being closed down first in the city. We cannot deny the possibility of a night curfew or partial lockdown if this continues. We are fining people for not wearing masks. We may have to shut places like beaches and Gateway of India where people gather in the evenings. People need to take precautions,” said Shaikh. On Monday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had held a meeting with the state’s task force and district collectors. The task force has also asked the state to ramp up vaccination drive and consider door-to-door services. Thackeray may address citizens later this week. Officials said Maharashtra has around 70 pockets with positivity rates that are higher than their neighbouring areas, officials said. “Districts have been asked to increase contact tracing to 30 people in these specific pockets,” a state official said. On Tuesday, Thane district released a list of 16 zones where lockdown will be in place till March 31. Thane Municipal Corporation has announced limited lockdown in micro-containment zones in 16 hotspots, which include prominent areas like Hiranandani Estate, Srinagar, Runwal Garden city, Balkum and Shivai Nagar. On Tuesday, Thane city and Pune city reported 210 cases and 1,110 cases of Covid-19 respectively. Last week, Pune Municipal Corporation had identified containment zones in areas like Hadapsar-Mundwa, Bhavanipeth and Kotrud. Jalgaon district administration announced a janata curfew between March 12 and March 15. District collector Abhijit Raut said only essential services will be allowed to function during this period. Jalgaon has reported over 400 cases daily for the past three days. On Tuesday, Jalgaon (city and rural) recorded 761 cases. In the past month, lockdown has been enforced in Akola and Amravati districts, while weekend lockdowns were in place in Aurangabad and Nagpur districts. Some districts also imposed night curfews to restrict movement. So far, there are no restrictions on inter-district movement. Jitendra Papalkar, district collector of Akola, said, “The state machinery has been asked to make sure Covid protocol is strictly adhered to. While these measures have been in place over the year, all districts have been asked to ramp it up.” Even districts that are not seeing as sharp a spike in cases are exercising precautions. Nidhi Chaudhary, district collector of Raigad, said, “While cases in Raigad have not increased as much as compared to Jalna, Akola or Amravati, we have been asked to not permit any big gatherings.” Chaudhary said that those eligible for vaccination in containment zones will be permitted to visit the nearest centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-districts-asked-to-ramp-up-measures-to-curb-covid-surge-101615316004370.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Indian Ocean humpback dolphin washes ashore Bandra||MumbaiAn Indian Ocean humpback dolphin that washed ashore in Bandra was reported to the forest department (mangrove cell) late on Monday night, by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s disaster management cell. The dolphin was found dead and subsequently buried at an undisclosed location soon after it was retrieved from the Carter Road promenade around midnight. Officials in the mangrove cell said this is the second such incident reported this year in Mumbai. In January, a dead dolphin had washed up at Bandra Bandstand. Though unable to provide official data, deputy conservator of forests (mangrove cell) Neenu Somraj said, “We see between 40 to 50 marine wildlife deaths annually and they are dominated by sea turtles. Dolphins are much fewer, definitely not more than 10 each year. We believe they are mainly natural deaths. They live in shallow, coastal waters and the carcasses sometimes end up on our beaches.” They usually wash up on the shoreline between Bandra and Versova, said S Deshpande, the mangrove cell’s range forest officer in the western suburbs. Since the Indian Ocean humpback is a schedule I species, an autopsy is mandatory unless the carcass is extremely decomposed. “As with most cases, the carcass we found on Monday night was already very putrefied and cause of death could not be established. There were no grievous injuries or signs of struggle on the animal,” said Deshpande. Protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and categorised as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the Indian Ocean humpback dolphins have sporadic distribution and are found in localised areas, mainly in shallow waters, close to the shore (less than 20 metres deep; less than 1.5km from the shore; and around river mouths or estuaries), according to the Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Network of India. This dolphin species feeds primarily on fish including mackerel, mullet, sardines and pomfret. Experts said deaths of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins around Mumbai are frequent and sightings of carcasses have been on the rise. E Vivekandan, former chief scientist and national consultant, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. said, “I would say that over the past two or three years, the number of deaths reported is increasing not just from Mumbai, but also places further down the coast, like Kochi. This may be because there are simply more eyes on the ground, but we cannot rule out other causes. Ideally, we should be collecting data from autopsies to know why these animals are dying. A coordinated effort is needed so that their deaths are reported more quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-ocean-humpback-dolphin-washes-ashore-bandra-101615315944320.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||India, UK scientists form consortium to solve environment problems||Scientists from India and the United Kingdom (UK) have formed the Innovation and Sustainability Chemistry Consortium, which aims to bring together scientists from both countries to solve challenging sustainability problems pertaining to the environment or industries. The consortium aims to start taking up projects from April this year. On February 26, led by the Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), Mumbai, a consortium of 14 scientists — seven each from India and UK— was officially launched. It has received a seed fund of £100,000 from UK’s department of business energy and industrial safety. Founding member of the consortium and assistant professor at ICT Anant Kapdi said, “The aim of the consortium is to establish research collaborations to tackle fundamental questions with potential commercial applications; promote academia-industry partnerships to solve key problems associated with current chemical process developments, optimisations, environmental remediations; as well as the proliferation of future technologies and conduct outreach programs using virtual reality to spread scientific awareness, encourage mentorship and training of early-career scientists and wider audiences.” The seven scientists from India are from institutes such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. “We are spanning areas such as environment, future technologies, flow chemistry, electrochemistry, sustainable material and technologies, alternative and efficient synthetic pathways. Some of the selected members also have extensive experience collaborating with industries and would be beneficial in creating a conducive environment for promoting more such interactions,” said Kapdi. Kapdi said the consortium expected to be “ completely functional” by April and would take up projects related to challenges associated with academia and industry. “This is a first of its kind in India and would promote a more conducive dialogue between academia and industry. Mentoring the next generation to further proliferate this idea along with the sustainability goals would be achieved as a part of the consortium,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/india-uk-scientists-form-consortium-to-solve-environment-problems-101615315823706.html
10-03-2021||Other||Privatisation of vizag plant: Protests grow as Centre sticks to plan||Hyderabad : Massive protests erupted again in the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) in Visakhapatnam, also known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), following a statement by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Lok Sabha on Monday that the Centre would go ahead with the privatisation of the steel plant. Following a call given by the Joint Action Committee of trade unions of the steel plant, thousands of workers took to the streets on Monday night and blocked the traffic on the Visakhapatnam-Kolkata national highway (NH-16) till midnight, raising slogans against the Centre for taking a unilateral decision to privatise the steel plant. RINL made a loss of ₹3,910 crore in 2019-20, as per the latest data available. The plant, which makes steel products used primarily in the construction sector employs around 17,000 permanent and 14,000 contractual employees. Later, the workers observed a sit-in protest near the steel plant’s gate at Kurmannapalem through the night. On Tuesday morning, the protestors laid siege to the administrative block of RINL and refused to allow senior officials to enter the premises. They gheraoed Varanasi Venkata Venugopal Rao, director (finance) of RINL Visakhapatnam, held him captive for nearly six hours, and refused to allow him enter the office. They let him go at around 3 pm after the police intervened and the trade union leaders, who held talks with the top management, assured the workers that their demands would be taken up. “We shall intensify our agitation. There is no question of allowing the steel plant to be sold out to the private parties at a throw-away price. It is a question of do-or-die battle for the workers,” said J Ayodhya Ramu, president of Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the recognised union of the RINL. On Monday, the Union finance minister, replying to questions raised by Visakhapatnam MP M V V Satyanarayana and Araku MP Goddeti Madhavi, asserted that the Centre would go in for 100% disinvestment of Government of India’s shares in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). The Centre would also withdraw RINL’s stakes in other joint ventures through strategic disinvestment. “While deciding conditions for strategic sale of RINL, concerns of employees and other stakeholders will be suitably addressed through share purchase agreement,’’ she said. Sitharaman also said the Andhra Pradesh government did not have any equity in the RINL, but the Centre was consulting the state government in specific matters as and when needed and would solicit its support in the matters that required its intervention. The privatisation of RINL is part of the government’s effort to divest in stake in state-owned companies. The government hopes to raise ₹1.75 lakh crore from its divestment programme in 2021-22 according to the Union Budget. As the agitation by the steel plant workers began to intensify and with the elections to the Greater Viskahapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) scheduled to be held on Wednesday, the YSR Congress Party government led by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy quickly began a damage control exercise. On Tuesday morning, the chief minister dashed off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing grave concern over Sitharaman’s statement in the Lok Sabha. He sought an appointment with the Prime Minister at the earliest, so that he would explain the situation on ground and discuss the alternatives to revive RINL. Jagan also offered to lead an all-party delegation and also take along trade union representatives to Delhi to discuss the issue with the Centre. He said the steel plant would definitely turn profitable, given some support from the Centre by implementing some turnaround measures such as allotting captive iron ore mines to bring down input costs, swapping high-cost debt with low-cost debt, converting debt into equity through equity conversion, and monetization of vacant land. “We, together, can revive the plant for unlocking greater value to the society and in particular to the people of Andhra Pradesh,” Jagan wrote in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/privatisation-of-vizag-plant-protests-grow-as-centre-sticks-to-plan-101615315764708.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||ED swung in action only after I changed party: Eknath Khadse to Bombay high court||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday was informed by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse that the inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him in the Bhosari land deal case was only after he changed the political party. Khadse submitted that while the land deal complaint was registered in 2016 and a closure report was filed in 2018, ED had not been in the picture but came only after he changed party loyalties, hence he was eligible to seek protection against the ED summons. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing Khadse’s petition, was informed by senior advocate Aabad Ponda that there were multiple grounds to prove the maintainability of the petition and he was justified in seeking protection against coercive action by ED officers. While reiterating the argument that there was no option for appealing against summons, hence the writ jurisdiction of the HC was the only avenue for Khadse, Ponda said that as per the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) any person not cooperating with the investigation was liable for arrest. In light of this, Khadse had a valid apprehension of being arrested when he responded to the ED summons as he would not disclose any incriminating material during the interrogation. Ponda then added that as an economic offence case was made out against Khadse and there was no bail for such offenders, hence through the petition, Khadse was seeking recourse before any action was initiated against him. Lastly, on the point of maintainability, Ponda submitted that as Khadse was having multiple health problems and had to be hospitalised regularly. His petition seeking quashing of proceedings arising out of the summons issued by ED and all future summons was valid, and his prayer from protection against coercive action was also valid, Ponda said. While making submissions on the ED action, Ponda submitted that after Khadse shifted loyalties from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to NCP in October 2020, the ED proceedings were set in motion and he was summoned in December 2020. “Till then, ED was not in the picture. While the case was of 2016, the closure report was filed in 2018, ED was not involved. However, in June 2020 the ED filed the Enforcement Case Information Report and after I (Khadse) moved to another political party, the ED summons were issued,” Ponda said, on Khadse’s behalf. Due to paucity of time, additional solicitor-general Anil Singh on behalf of ED, could not argue against the contentions canvassed by Ponda, hence the bench adjourned the hearing till Monday, March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-swung-in-action-only-after-i-changed-party-eknath-khadse-to-bombay-high-court-101615315764244.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government looks at redevelopment of slum clusters||The state government on Tuesday it was tapping the possibility of redevelopment of slum clusters in Mumbai through Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) for quicker development and monetisation of the land. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad told the legislative Assembly that redevelopment through the government agency may help the government earn revenue from these prime plots worth crores. Congress MLAs Zeeshan Siddique and Amin Patel raised the issue of delayed development of the SRA project at Khar Golibar road, claiming it was forcing residents to live in transit camps for years. Other Mumbai MLAs, including Ashish Shelar and Yogesh Sagar, raised questions related to the other SRA projects in the city. They questioned if the residents who have been deprived of their homes can be financially assisted by the SRA and the state was revising the rule related to the sale of the redeveloped flats in such schemes. Replying to the question, Awhad said his department was tapping the possibility of development of the slum projects by Mhada and SRA. “The plots from Bandra to Cuffe Parade are worth crore of rupees. Builders delay projects for years, depriving slumdwellers from rightful homes. We are thinking of developing such plots. This would help the SRA and Mhada earn revenue out of the saleable components after rehabilitating the tenants. I will discuss this with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state cabinet,” he said. Awhad said the state government had decided to bring down the mandatory period of 10 years for which slum dwellers are prohibited from selling their apartments in redeveloped buildings to five years. “Before we could issue the order, the decision was challenged in the court. By reducing the period, we want to reduce the hardship of the slum dwellers. We have informed the court about our resolve,” he said. Awhad said of the 5,572 eligible slumdwellers at Khar Golibar Road, only 1,944 have been rehabilitated in the redeveloped buildings, while remaining are staying at transit camps for more than 15 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-looks-at-redevelopment-of-slum-clusters-101615315703678.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Thumbs-up to health infra boost in Maharashtra’s budget||The Maharashtra government’s budget announced on Monday primarily focused on improving the health infrastructure, especially in rural parts, to keep the state prepared to face any possible disease outbreak in the future. The new proposals will add another 3,190 medical seats across colleges. Also, the overall budget allocation for health has been given a boost of 10.25% – ₹19,061 crore, compared to the 2020-21 budget estimates of ₹17,288 crore. As of March 8, over 22lakh people have contracted the Covid-19 infection in the state. As per doctors, the fight against the Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the novel coronavirus, is not over yet. Taking this into consideration, the state on Tuesday announced plans to build a post-Covid care centre—‘Post Covid Counselling and Treatment Centres’ in every district. “Establishment of the post-Covid care centres across districts is the need-of the hour. Because like other flu and coronavirus, Covid-19 will remain in the air for years to come. So, in the long run, we have to be ready to treat recovered patients with complaints of Pulmonary Fibrosis, long Covid-19 syndrome, among others. Also, there is a need to focus on mental health issues among the recovered patients,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital. The state officials have decided to set up a ‘modern hospital’ for treatment of infectious diseases like swine flu, Covid-19, among others, on the premises of Aundh district hospital. However, health activists have flagged it stating there is a need to establish such a specialised infectious hospital in all districts, especially in cities like Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur. “When the pandemic started in March last year, Kasturba Hospital, the only hospital to treat infectious patients, had only 150 beds for a population of 2crore. There is a need to strengthen the already existing infrastructure, rather than just adding to the number,” said Dr Abhijit More, attached with NGO— Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. “The infrastructure should also focus on mental health issues, since post COVID patients do grapple with mental health issues. Large parts of rural India and Maharashtra are deprived of these facilities. In addition to this, the current expenditure will be a way ahead,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, Director-Critical Care, Fortis Hospitals, Mumbai and part of the Covid task force. The state announced ₹7,500 crore for construction and upgrade of health infrastructure. “The proposal includes construction of district hospitals, psychiatric hospital, trauma centre, primary health centres and sub-centre, upgrading and construction of taluka level hospitals,” reads the budget speech. Along with that, the government has announced setting up of six new medical colleges in Sindhudurg, Osmanabad, Nashik, Raigad, Satara, Amravati and Parbhani. This will help add 3,190 medical seats across medical colleges. Of these, 1,990 will be undergraduate seats, 1,000 post-graduate seats and 200 for super-specialty. Doctors from the state Covid task force have welcomed the move. Dr Pandit said, “This is a very strong commitment in building infrastructure, providing expertise and necessary facilities in rural areas.” The state is further expanding its program for non-communicable diseases with 150 hospitals across the state to diagnose cancer, and eight CATH labs for emergency angiography procedures for heart patients. Following the fire incident in a hospital in Bhandara in January that killed 10 babies, the state government also announced plans to install fire safety systems in all government hospitals. “It is really encouraging to see the state focus on the overall development of the health infrastructure,” said Dr More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thumbsup-to-health-infra-boost-in-maha-budget-101615315524276.html

He crossed the border around a week ago and came to East Champran district in Bihar. He then boarded the bus for Jaipur in Rajasthan and after reaching there, he boarded another bus for Surat in Gujarat, added Nalawade.After reaching Surat Ansari again took a bus for Mumbai and reached the Borivli area on March 8. He was waiting outside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) when officials of the Kandivali ANC unit nabbed him on Monday afternoon.“We got a tip-off that a member of the Nepalese gang would be coming to the Borivali area to deliver a huge quantity of drugs to a Mumbai based supplier. As per the information we laid a trap and arrested him on Monday around 1pm. While searching his bag we found 14.56 kilograms of charas worth Rs. 2.80 crore from his possession,” added Nalawade.He was arrested under the charges of the Narcotics Drugs and psychotropic substances (NDPS) Act. He was produced in the court and remanded in police custody till March 14 and further investigation is going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-anc-arrests-nepalese-national-with-charas-worth-2-80-crore-101615315344205.html
10-03-2021||Bangalore||'Shrinking revenues may impact Karnataka’s economy in future as well': Report||A closer look at Karnataka’s financial situation shows that the deepening distress in the state’s economy is likely to continue well into the next fiscal (2022-23), if not more.According to the Medium Term Fiscal Plan 2021-25 (MTFP) the effects of the negative fiscal and revenue deficit will impact the state’s fledgeling finances in the coming year as well.“The Fiscal Management Review Committee (FMRC) states that the current decline in revenue collections has not only weakened the growth prospects of 2020-21 but it will also carry its effects to the next financial year. Hence it will have (a) negative impact on fiscal deficit, revenue deficit and total outstanding liabilities of the state,” according to the MTFP, released along with the state budget.Karnataka is one of India’s most industrious states in the country and is home to its flourishing Information Technology (IT) industry that is estimated to touch $194 billion in the current fiscal, according to Nasscom. Karnataka is also key to Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government's plans to grow into a $5 trillion economy by 2025.Also read: 'Big budget, bigger debts' - Yediyurappa's show of Karnataka's financesThe state is home to some of the world's biggest corporations but a steady decline in share in central taxes, goods and services tax (GST) compensation and meagre allocations for flood and drought relief has exacerbated the problems of the calamity-prone state.Karnataka saw its GSDP shrink 2.6% in 2020-21.With lower revenue inflows from the Centre, floods, droughts and declining revenues from the state’s own taxes, Karnataka is depending on higher borrowings that could further impact developmental activities, creation of assets and higher revenue expenditures.“Higher borrowings are the reason for (the) deficit. We may try to restrict the borrowings this year depending on the revenue collections,” said one senior official of Karnataka’s finance department, requesting not to be named.Karnataka’s revenue expenditure has risen to almost 10 per cent of the GSDP (gross state domestic product) to ₹179,779 crore, according to government data. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had budgeted an additional ₹10,000 crore in the 2020-21 budget for the rising revenue expenditure which includes payment of salaries, interest, pensions, subsidies, administrative costs and devolution to urban local bodies among others.Yediyurappa has set aside ₹52,529 crore specifically under a category termed 'stimulating economic growth', which includes infrastructure projects, water connections, ₹3000 crore for development of backward taluks, railway projects and building of new clusters for textile and drugs, among others.Data shows that there is a steady decline in revenue inflows from the centre in devolution and grants. The state received ₹28,591 crore in devolution in 2020-21 as against ₹30,919 crore the previous fiscal. Similarly, the state received ₹15,454 in grants in 2020-21 as against ₹19,983 the previous fiscal.The revenue deficit is estimated to be ₹15,134 crore in the 2021-22 period. The state’ revenues from its own taxes have also seen a marginal decline till 2020-21, data shows.Commercial taxes and excise duty saw an increase of 3.4 per cent at ₹76,837 crore and excise saw an increase of 5.2 per cent at ₹22,700 crore (till the end of March) respectively. But there has been a decline in other taxes like -18.3 per cent in motor vehicle tax, -12.4 per cent in stamps and registration and 14.0 per cent in other taxes.“Non-tax revenues may be reviewed to explore new sources of non-tax revenues as well as increasing the rates. Some fees/user charges, et cetera., were revised last year but collections are yet to pick up. Non-tax revenue hasn’t yet reached optimal levels. A big increase in tax revenues may not happen. So we will have to cut expenditure,” said the official cited above.The reduction in revenue inflows has increased the total liabilities of the state to ₹4,57,899 crore as against ₹3,68,692 crore in the previous budget.Analysts said that there was no visible effort to contain expenditure that would add to Yediyurappa’s problems that include infighting, dissent and lack of performance with just two years left to go for the assembly elections in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aspires to return with a majority on its own.The chief minister has instead set aside hundreds, if not thousands, of crores to set up boards of specific caste-groups with no tax increases and higher borrowings. The state government is expected to borrow an additional ₹71,332 to fund its schemes, programmes and development work this year.“This is a budget that borrows more to please all,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University said.He added that this was a year that the chief minister could have taken some difficult choices to set the economy back on track but there was no visible attempt to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/shrinking-revenues-may-impact-karnataka-s-economy-in-future-as-well-report-101615315018403.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to take up restoration of 15 heritage precincts in Fort||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will now take up annual restoration work on 15 prominent heritage precincts and statues in the Fort area, some of which have recently been restored. These include Flora Fountain, Fitzgerald fountain, Kothari Pyau, Baba Saheb Ambedkar statue on Madam Cama Road, the Firozshah Mehta statue on Mahapalika road, among others. Mini versions of the extensive repairs and restoration done on some of these monuments will be repeated every year. According to a senior civic official from the heritage department, this will help maintain the heritage look of the area, and avoid bigger and recurring restoration work in the long run.The officer said, “We have undertaken a lot of restoration work of heritage precincts in the past few years. However, the BMC administration is not able to keep up with the maintenance of heritage precincts, or statues. It is needed to maintain a pristine look of the area, ensure tourists continue to enjoy the heritage structures, and they do not fall into disrepair over the next few years.”BMC will hand out maintenance contracts of these precincts to contractors, and recently invited bids for this work.Work will involve repeated restoration, maintenance of the premise, cleaning and polishing of grills and protective structures, ensure lighting, or water engineering in case of fountains is in working condition. For example, work in the case of Flora Fountain at Hutatma Chowk at Fort, which underwent extensive restoration work in 2018-19, will include conservation of the fountain with steam cleaning, minor repairs to the structure if required, and algaecide application.Work on the 152-year-old Fitzgerald fountain, which was set up at Metro cinema and inaugurated earlier this year, will include checking nuts and bolts of the monument. This fountain is a 16-tonne monument that was extensively repaired and restored by the civic body in 2019 and 2020. Many of its missing parts were remade and replaced.The official from the heritage department said, “The Kothari Pyau was restored by BMC just a couple of years ago. But due to improper maintenance of its premises, not many people are using the fountain or noticing it even. The structures need constant care and repair.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-take-up-restoration-of-15-heritage-precincts-in-fort-101615315224214.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||To cut auto emissions, govt will focus on electric vehicle infra, says Sisodia in budget speech||To reduce vehicular pollution in the national capital, the Delhi government on Tuesday proposed to focus on electric vehicle infrastructure in the budget for 2021. Finance minister Manish Sisodia said by 2024, the government aims to increase the share of electric vehicles to 25% of the total number of registered vehicles. Sisodia said before the Delhi government’s electric vehicle policy, the share of these environment friendly vehicles in the capital was merely 0.2% of the total registered vehicles. However, after the policy was launched, this share has increased to 2.2% of the total registered vehicles. “The government now aims that by 2024, the share of electric vehicles in Delhi will improve to around 25% and to make that happen, we are working towards installing as many as 500 charging points. At present, there are 72 such points in Delhi. The idea is to have a charging facility every three kilometres,” Sisodia said. He also said the aim of his government through such policies is to get “100% freedom from vehicular pollution”. Presenting data before the house, Sisodia said after the launch of the EV policy, 7,000 buses would be added to Delhi fleet. “I am very happy to say that 6,693 buses are currently in Delhi’s public transport fleet. That’s the largest fleet in the history of Delhi. This year, after adding 1,000 more buses, this number will reach 7,693. The government has put a target of 11,000 bus fleet in Delhi’s public transport,” Sisodia said in his budget speech. “If we compare the figures of the past three months, 2,621 electric vehicles were purchased, of a total of 118,482 newly purchased vehicles,” he said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said while such focus on EV infrastructure was appreciated, it is doubtful whether the government will be able to achieve the target of having 25% of the total registered vehicles powered by electricity. “The emphasis on electric vehicles is an important move, but the target of 25% is huge and we will have to see if they have planned well enough to achieve this,” Roychowdhury said. She also said the government also needs to come out with a plan on the revenue-raising model to fund the EV programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/to-cut-auto-emissions-govt-will-focus-on-electric-vehicle-infra-says-sisodia-in-budget-speech-101615315043606.html
10-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro Bhavan on Aarey plot: MMRDA awaits clearances||In addition to seeking environmental clearance (EC) for the Metro Bhavan building inside Aarey Colony, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has also applied for a slew of other clearances that will be needed before construction work on the 32-storey structure can begin. Change of land use clearance for Metro Bhavan, which will involve converting 20,387 square metres of land in Aarey Colony from a no development zone to a residential zone, has been sought from the urban development department (UDD). According to a note on the project, which was shared with HT by an MMRDA official, the change of land use is “under consideration”. HT could not independently verify the status of the clearance. The note also says that work will begin once the multiple approvals and permissions have been granted to the project. “Till operationalization of the Metro Bhavan, the operation, command and control of Metro Line 2A and 7 will be done from Operation Command & Control Centre (OCC) planned at Charkop Depot,” says the note. Also, no objection certificates (NOCs) have been sought from the chief fire officer, tree authority and storm water drains department (SWD). Only the SWD has given the project an NOC so far. The rest are listed are at different stages of being processed. An NOC from UDD’s high rise committee (which will examine the impact of the building on nearby infrastructure and environment) is also pending, as per the MMRDA. HT had reported on March 8 that MMRDA has tabled a proposal before the state environment department to obtain an EC for the Metro Bhavan in Aarey Colony. For the time being, the EC has been deferred by the state environment department over a technicality. The construction of the Metro-3 car shed was stalled after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray assumed office in November 2019. While over 600 acres of Aarey Colony have been declared a reserved forest since then, the government has not publicly cleared its stance on Metro Bhavan, which has been proposed on land in an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) within Aarey Colony. “The stance seems quite clear now that various administrative nods for the project are being sought. MMRDA should first make public the minutes of the virtual public hearings from last year in which several citizens have voiced their objections to Metro Bhavan in Aarey [Colony]. The objections have to be acknowledged and responded to appropriately,” said D Stalin, director, Vanashakti NGO. Stalin has filed three petitions relating to the Aarey dispute in the Supreme Court. MMRDA has also clarified that Metro Bhavan will require clearance from a monitoring committee overseeing the implementation of the December 2016 ESZ notification by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change pertaining to Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Sources in MMRDA said an application has been submitted to the committee. Dr Sonia Sethi, additional metropolitan commissioner, could not be reached for comment despite multiple attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-bhavan-on-aarey-plot-mmrda-awaits-clearances-101615314985505.html

They should question their own patriotism even when they violate traffic rules or mistreat women,” he said.When asked to explain further, Kejriwal said, “It is about inculcating good behaviour. You must have come across stories of people who go abroad and come back with good experiences especially with the kind of help that they get from people there. We have to inculcate such good behaviour among our children. This is my vision of patriotism.”He said ever since the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government took over, they have only drafted surplus budgets. “Even the CAG says that Delhi does not make loss budgets. Today’s budget is also a surplus budget. We have often noted in budgets of other states and budgets of the previous Delhi governments that establishment costs are often around 70-80%. In our budget, establishment costs are only 45%, this means 55% can be redirected towards our subsidy schemes and programmes such as social security and other pro-people measures. This displays efficient financial management on part of the Delhi government,” he said.Kejriwal said as India celebrates 75 years of independence, Delhi will make education a people’s movement. “While continuous efforts are being made by the government, this is not enough. We need people to get involved. The youth of the city, of the country, will join hands and work towards educating the masses. If students without means, studying in 10th and 12th have queries about future careers and career prospects, they will be connected to those who are already in colleges and working, so guidance can be given over the phone. Through this education will be made people’s movement,” Kejriwal said.He added that yoga will also be a people’s movement.“Wherever people come forward and tell us that they want to do yoga as a community, we will create facilities for them - in their colonies, parks, etc. Yoga won’t be a single event in the day but a part of their daily life,” he said.Talking about the health sector, the chief minister said the Delhi government’s Mohalla Clinic project will be extended and exclusive clinics will be set up for women.“Additionally, in the health sector, every citizen of Delhi will be given a health card. There will remain no need to carry previous X-rays, MRI records — all your health data will be stored on the cloud so that you can go to any hospital and avail facilities. Initially, it will be done through government hospitals, later it will be extended to private hospitals as well. We are creating an elaborate Health Information Management System. Through your health cards, you will be able to take appointments and skip the long queues as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-calls-budget-inclusive-says-education-will-be-made-a-mass-movement-101615314984244.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi Budget: Exclusive mohalla clinics for women, anganwadi hubs||In order to provide women with a larger role in the economy, and to assure them better health-care facilities, while ensuring their safety and security, the Delhi government proposed several women centric schemes in its budget presented on Tuesday. The government has proposed to launch a new scheme -- Saheli Samanvay Kendra -- under which it will establish 500 anganwadi hubs in various parts of the city. These hubs will be used for imparting training to women to help them open micro-economic units and for holding meetings of self-help groups.The decision to formulate such a scheme was taken on the basis of a survey which was conducted by the government to understand the impact of Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent lockdown on the livelihood of people in Delhi. The survey showed that before the pandemic, unemployment among women was 26% last February and it rose to 40% by February 2021.The government has also proposed to set up 100 mahila (women) mohalla clinics across Delhi from next year where every woman in Delhi will get free gynaecology services and related diagnostic tests. “We all know that our mothers and sisters are not able to talk to us about their health issues openly. It is a fact of our society that women tend to neglect their own illnesses. The result of this is that many women live with ailments, assuming it as destiny. The Delhi government will now undertake the responsibility of having a Mahila Mohalla Clinic around every woman in Delhi,” finance minister Manish Sisodia said. The government has also planned to set up 33 self-help units to make these women aware of government schemes, counsel and help them. The budget also proposed a scheme to make tourist spots safer for women. CCTV cameras will be installed at entry points of all tourist spots and uniformed guards will be deployed there. An amount of ₹5 crore has been proposed in the budget for this purpose.Debolina Kundu, professor at the national institute of urban affairs, said, “Allocating funds for employment generation among the women is a welcome move. The government has proposed schemes that are growth-driven. Also, the proposal of setting up women exclusive mohalla clinics is also a step in the right direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-budget-exclusive-mohalla-clinics-for-women-anganwadi-hubs-101615314983633.html

The next, 32nd Olympics, games are to be held in Tokyo. The next three Olympics host cities have also been decided. Our government aims to bring the sports facilities and the sports atmosphere in the city to such a level through the new Sports University so that we can apply to host the 39th Olympics in 2048,” Sisodia said.Also Read: Big push for health in Delhi's budgetHe explained, “This may seem far away, but we have to bid for it 10 years before 2048. And before that it will take 15 years to build adequate infrastructure, to create an atmosphere where sports flourishes and to bring our players to a level where they bring medals in the sports competitions leading to Olympics 2048,” Sisodia said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal too said that Delhi will bid for the 2048 Olympics and the Delhi government will take up whatever infrastructure and other necessities that are needed to be created for the same.While welcoming the CM Kejriwal’s remarks over the bid of the 2048 Olympic Games, Indian Olympic Association’s general secretary, Rajeev Mehta said IOA will support this move. “It’s good for sports, and we welcome this announcement made by CM Kejriwal. IOA will support this move,” said Mehta. “If we receive this request from the government, we will put this before the (IOA) executive council and also the general house for approval.”Olympics host cities are chosen well in advance for adequate preparation time. For example, Rio de Janeiro was announced to organise the 2016 Games in 2009, while in 2017 the IOC confirmed Paris and Los Angeles as hosts for the 2024 and 2028 Olympics, respectively.Delhi hosted the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010.Also Read | Delhi Budget 2021: Allocation for urban infra up, govt to work on decongestionThe process to bid to host the Olympics comprises of an invitation phase, where the interested city conveys an informal commitment to bid after which its officials are invited by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a discussion and the candidature process, where the city officially submits a bid. The bid is then evaluated on these aspects – vision and strategy for the Games; legal, governance and financial mechanisms of the city; delivery of the Olympics and ensuring it has a sustainable legacy plan in place.The bidding process often includes top government officials, bureaucrats, corporates, et al, join in to lobby for their city. In 2009, US President Barack Obama flew to Copenhagen to go all out for Chicago’s bid to host the 2016 Games before the IOC’s vote. It was eventually unsuccessful. In 2017, French president Emmanuel Macron went a step further, turning up at the final presentation stage by Paris in an IOC meeting in July 2017. That September, Paris edged LA to host the Games in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-to-bid-for-hosting-olympics-2048-sisodia-101615314924816.html

Referring to the establishment of a new state education board that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced last week and a new syllabus for nursery till Class 8, Sisodia said the state will focus on preparing “patriots who take responsibilities for the country”, enabling job creation, and moulding “better human beings”.“During the pandemic, our teachers and students had to switch to online learning. Our educators, who did not know how to use a smartphone, took help from children and younger teachers to teach online without any formal training for nearly a year. Our teachers learned to use technology in imparting education and we plan to adopt it for the future,” Sisodia said in the state assembly on Tuesday.Notably, the AAP government has increased the budget allocation for the education and health sectors in the Capital every year since it presented its first budget for the 2015-16 fiscal. In its second budget, the AAP more than doubled the allocation for education, which leapt from ₹4,570 crore to ₹10,689 crore in 2016-17.The deputy chief minister said the government will start a “virtual model school” to open up the Delhi education model for people across the country. “There will be no walls or building but there will be studies, children, teachers, enrolment, and examinations. This will be a unique effort and this school may be the first of its kind in the world. We have started work on the design and will try to start it by next year. Any child in the country who wants to study under the Delhi model of education can make use of this,” the education minister said.This year, the government proposed doubling seed funding — distributed in Delhi government schools as part of the Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum — for students of classes 11 and 12 to ₹2,000.The government has proposed to increase the intake of students by around 8,500 in the higher education sector by expanding the campuses of two state universities — Guru Gobind Singh IP University and Ambedkar University.Sisodia also proposed a university to train teachers in line with the new National Education Policy (NEP), a move experts welcomed.Aejaz Masih, dean of the education faculty at Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “Ideal teacher training is possible only when there is integration between subject knowledge and pedagogical knowledge [for a particular discipline]. This is perhaps not possible if we set up an institute in isolation. So, it is a good initiative if we conceptualise a full-fledged teacher training institute. But NEP calls for the multidisciplinary institution of higher education instead of standalone educational institutes. This contradiction needs to be sorted out before establishing the institute.”The deputy chief minister also called for modification in Delhi School Education Act, 1973 and Delhi University Act, 1922. “These Acts are in contradiction of NEP. To implement the NEP, we need to change these two old Acts. We have started working on a new law and have requested the Centre to revise provisions of DU Act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/education-gets-biggest-share-of-delhi-budget-pie-once-again-allocation-bumped-up-this-year-101615314923633.html
10-03-2021||Other||‘Deshbhakti’: AAP’s Budget sentiment||Delhi finance minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday called his seventh budget for Delhi “Deshbhakti Budget” to mark India’s 75 years of independence, announcing a range of programmes and measures to evoke patriotism in the citizens including installation of 500 big tricolours across the city and organising several cultural events to commemorate leaders such as Bhagat Singh and BR Ambedkar.“As I present this budget, I feel it would be our great fortune if the schemes and plans mentioned here would make a positive contribution to the dreams of a liberated homeland as envisioned by those selfless patriots. Therefore, with your permission and of this House, today I want to name this budget the ‘Deshbhakti Budget’,” Sisodia said in his speech at Delhi assembly while presenting Budget 2021-22.“As part of the series of patriotic events to be initiated in Delhi from March 12, for the next 75 weeks, programmes will be organised across the city. These programmes will not only showcase Delhi but also highlight its role in the freedom movement, its journey in the last 75 years and the vision of Delhi in 2047,” Sisodia said.The Delhi government has earmarked ₹10 crore for programmes on the life of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and the contributions made by Dr BR Ambedkar in framing India’s constitution.Sisodia also proposed ₹45 crore for installing the national flag at 500 different locations across Delhi. With these 500 tricolours, on the 75th year of independence, we will decorate our entire city in such a way that you will find a flag every one or two kilometers, he said.While making the announcement Sisodia also quoted Bhagat Singh’s ‘jail diary’ and recited couplets in the memory of Ambedkar. “Rutba mere sar ko tere samvidhan se mila hai, ye samman bhi mujhe tere samvidhan se mila hai; auro ko jo mila hai muqaddar se mila hai, hume to muqaddar bhi tere samvidhan se mila hai. We want every Indian to remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar’s vision and foresight on the occasion of India’s 75th Independence anniversary,” the deputy CM said.The government also proposed to start a Deshbhakti curriculum in its schools this year. “There will be one class for this curriculum every day. Through this curriculum, we want to prepare responsible citizens who will contribute to nation-building,” Sisodia said.The government also proposed a mentorship volunteer programme -- youth for education -- to help students in Delhi government schools.Sisodia also proposed to set up a Sainik school and armed forces preparatory academy in the Capital to prepare students for services in the armed forces. “There are 33 Sainik schools across the nation. We will now have one in Delhi as well. We will also start an armed force preparatory academy where students will be prepared for NDA and armed force services,” he said.At a press conference later in the day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that through the Deshbhakti curriculum his government will help students understand their civic duties and become good human beings and patriotic citizens. “We will train our children in such a manner that they will think twice before even jumping a red light or thinking about breaking the rules of the system. We will ensure that every child is proud of their country.”The finance minister also allocated ₹26 crore for the families of martyrs and ₹2 crore for organising special programmes for the elderly.Bharat Arora, secretary of Action Committee of Unaided Private Recognised Schools -- an umbrella body of over 400 schools in Delhi ---- welcomed the proposals. “Patriotism should definitely be an important and integral part of any state or country’s curriculum. So this is definitely a positive step. However, the curriculum should include a variety of programmes, camps and activities.”Tanvir Aeijiaz, associate professor at Delhi University’s (DU) Ramjas College, said celebrating 75 years of India’s freedom is a good idea but cautioned that the government should not go overboard. “The government should not fall into the trap of pretentious competitive nationalism. The love for nation remains the same with one flag or 500 flags. At a time when the state GDP has gone down and the country is going through a pandemic, spending so much on such things doesn’t make sense,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deshbhakti-aap-s-budget-sentiment-101615314924182.html

10-03-2021||Delhi||All Delhi courts to resume in-person hearings from March 15||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said from March 15, all courts, including the subordinate judiciary, would resume in-person hearings as the number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital was relatively fewer these days. The current system of hybrid hearings (virtual and in-person) will be allowed only in exceptional cases, the high court said.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said virtual hearings cannot become the norm and that it is only an exception. The judges said the request for hybrid hearings would be entertained only if they clearly set out the exceptional circumstances and also their geographical location.The court also noted that several services, including schools, colleges, gyms and cinema halls, have been open for some time now and it is high time that courts also resume in-person hearings.“A beginning has to be made and the fear that has set in into the minds of people should not be a reason,” the bench said.“While making the requests, parties should clearly set out the exceptional circumstance/case and also indicate their geographic location from where they would be joining (the video conferencing hearing). Mere absence of the counsel or party within the NCT of Delhi may not be a sufficient ground for making a request for VC hearing,” the bench said.The court directions came on a plea seeking to defer commencement of in-person hearings by all judges from March 15, till the time all advocates are vaccinated against Covid-19.“As to what would constitute an exceptional circumstance would have to be left to the discretion of the concerned judge/ judges before whom the request is made. However, to put to rest any uncertainty, it would be appropriate that such a request is made at least one working day in advance and the decision be communicated by the court staff to the parties well in advance so that they are aware whether their request is accepted or not,” the bench said.The bench also directed the administrative authorities of the high court to provide adequate infrastructure and install computer systems to support hybrid proceedings in all its 25 courtrooms where regular in-person hearings would resume from March 15.Anticipating surge in footfall in the court premises, the bench also suggested the high court administration and district courts to see the feasibility of bringing two cause lists -- one for the pre-lunch and another for the post-lunch session to limit the number of people.It asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit on steps takento provide infrastructure to subordinate courts for hybrid hearings and listed the matter for further hearing to March 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-delhi-courts-to-resume-in-person-hearings-from-march-15-101615314804772.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Suspended DU V-C Yogesh Tyagi relinquishes charge, acting V-C to continue till successor is found||Delhi University (DU) vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, who was under suspension since last October, relinquished charge on Tuesday -- the day his term was scheduled to end. Officials at the university said that the acting V-C will continue in the position till the appointment of Tyagi’s successor. In a letter addressed to the university visitor, the President of India, Tyagi said, “On completion of my tenure as the vice-chancellor of the University of Delhi, I hereby relinquish the charge of the vice-chancellor of the University today, 09.03.2021.” The letter was also marked to the chancellor of the university, the vice-president of India, Union ministry of education, and the DU administration.Tyagi was suspended by the Union ministry of education in October after the Centre pointed out several shortcomings in the functioning of the university during his tenure. The suspension was followed by a high-voltage drama when a faction led by Tyagi — he was on medical leave since July — overrode the recommendations of the executive council to appoint a new registrar and a new pro-vice-chancellor. The President of India nullified all orders and appointments made by Tyagi.After Tyagi’s suspension, PC Joshi, the pro-vice-chancellor, took over as the acting V-C of DU. As per the DU ordinance, Joshi will now continue in the position till a new V-C is appointed. “The process for the appointment of the new V-C has already been initiated. The university’s executive council (EC) has already forwarded two names to constitute the search committee and one name has to come from the ministry. The three-member committee will then choose the next V-C. The application process is already over,” Joshi said.Tyagi did not respond to calls and texts sent by HT seeking his response. University officials said they are now waiting for an update on the appointment of the new V-C. VS Negi, an executive council member of DU, said, “Day-to-day functioning of the university may get affected if there is a delay in appointing a new vice-chancellor. So, we hope that the ministry takes this up at the earliest. We are expecting communication from the ministry on the search committee by Tuesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/suspended-du-v-c-yogesh-tyagi-relinquishes-charge-acting-v-c-to-continue-till-successor-is-found-101615314804206.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||Teachers’ body calls for ‘DU shutdown’ over pending salaries in govt-funded colleges||The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) on Tuesday gave a call for a university-wide shutdown beginning Thursday, to protest against the pending salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff of 12 DU colleges that are fully funded by the Delhi government. The salaries have been delayed as the government is yet to disburse grants to these colleges.Along with the shutdown, the teachers’ association has also given a call for a teachers’ rally from the university to the chief minister’s residence on March 15 and another march to the lieutenant-governor’s office on March 18. The decisions were taken by DUTA at an emergent meeting held on Tuesday, after receiving representations from the staff associations of government-funded colleges.Teachers of the 12 colleges had threatened a “complete shutdown of Delhi University” and said they would take to the roads in protest if their salaries, pending for the past three to four months, are not disbursed without further delay. Despite repeated attempts, Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter on Tuesday. Earlier, a spokesperson had said, “All funds have been released by the Delhi government as per the rules.” “In many units, employees have not received salaries for over six months now. Employees have also not received other dues,” DUTA president Rajib Ray said. The association will also hold a meeting with teachers of the College of Arts, which was recently de-affiliated from DU and merged with Ambedkar University.Ray also said that they would also send representations to the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, L-G Anil baijal, vice-chancellor, principals and chairpersons of the 12 DU colleges on the matter and hold meetings with staff and student associations in the coming days to decide the future course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-body-calls-for-du-shutdown-over-pending-salaries-in-govt-funded-colleges-101615314803643.html
10-03-2021||Other||Lawyer Mehmood Pracha alleges raid at his office||Advocate Mehmood Pracha, who represents many 2020 Delhi riot victims and accused, alleged that the Delhi Police on Tuesday tried to raid his office. Calling the police action “harassment”, Pracha said the raid was timed by the special cell to ensure that he was away from his office but “they did not know that the office was locked”.Though Pracha did not confirm if the police were able to enter his office on Tuesday, he filed a complaint at the Patiala House Court, which has summoned a senior officer of the special cell on Wednesday.No senior officer of the Delhi police offered a response on Pracha’a allegations or the searches at his office despite calls and text messages.After learning that police have reached his office for an alleged raid, Pracha moved a city court seeking modifications of an order of March 2, where the court had given permission to the Delhi police to search his premises at Nizamuddin east for the only purpose to seize a computer that could not be earlier taken due to the alleged obstruction by him and his associates.In his application, Pracha said the demand of the investigating agency for the hard disk of the computer is illegal as all the documents are already in the police’s possession from the earlier raid conducted on his December 25, 2020. Pracha said that the court on Tuesday issued notice on his plea and has asked the DCP concerned to be present on the Wednesday.The police are investigating Pracha’s role in a case of allegedly tutoring a riot victim to give false deposition and submitting forged documents in court. In December, the special cell conducted searches at Pracha’s office in Nizamuddin in connection with a case filed against him. A video of the raid, which showed police and Pracha arguing inside his office, was widely circulated on social media.Citing client-attorney privilege, Pracha refused to show some papers then. Police had accused Pracha of threatening them and misbehaviour. Police had on the other hand accused Pracha of not cooperating and refusing to give them access to one of the computers inside his office..Pracha said, “I had to be in court in a case related to the same agency [special cell] on Tuesday. I had to come to court to cross-examine one of their officers. The senior officer in this case is the same who has ordered the raids. The case is with him. They took a warrant and had two weeks to raid my office, but they chose to do it today [Tuesday]. They were aware that I would be in court. They did not know my office would be locked. Police want to steal importance evidence that I have, which is related to the Delhi riots.”After that raid in December, Pracha filed a police complaint alleging that imposters posing as police personnel visited his office and took crucial information related to the Delhi riots from his computers. Police had then denied this and said they had a court order to conduct searches and seize evidence. Police had also said that they had conduct similar searches at the chamber of another city advocate after getting warrant from the court. Police had said that there was no problem at the second advocate’s office but Pracha had deliberately misbehaved and refused to heed to the court’s order allowing police to conduct searches.On August 22, Delhi police had filed a case against Pracha after a riot victim told a court that Pracha allegedly asked him to depose falsely and frame three persons. Pracha, who denied the allegations and accused police of filing false cases to intimidate him as he is defending some riot accused, was a prominent face of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that preceded the riots. Delhi police have said that the the riots in north east Delhi, in which 53 persons died and over 400 persons were injured, were plotted by some prominent faces of the anti-CAA protests at the anti-CAA protest sites. Pracha, who has not been charged or named in any case, was an active voice at the protest sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lawyer-mehmood-pracha-alleges-raid-at-his-office-101615314744925.html
10-03-2021||Delhi||2 men, suspected of stealing, beaten to death in Azadpur Mandi||Two men, suspected of pickpocketing, were lynched to death by a mob at the Azadpur Mandi in north Delhi on Tuesday morning, the police said. Two traders at the mandi were arrested by Tuesday evening in connection with the murders, police sources said.The dead men have been identified as Lokesh and Ved Prakash alias Bhaiya, both 24 years old. Lokesh belonged to Bharola village nearby, while Prakash lived in a slum cluster in Jahangirpuri, not far from the mandi.By the time the police arrived, one of the men, Lokesh, was already dead and his body was being sewed up in a sack, in a bid to dispose of it, while the other man, Ved Prakash, was badly injured. Both were rushed to the hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival.“While suspicion of pickpocketing appears to be the only reason behind the lynching, we are still investigating the case from all angles. So far, we have not found any criminal antecedents of the two dead men,” said Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).The DCP said that cases of theft have been registered against the two killed men as well after the alleged killers wanted to file complaints against them. “While no previous criminal involvement against Lokesh has emerged so far, Prakash was found to be earlier involved in four theft cases and one each of robbery and snatching,” said Rangnani.Another investigator, not authorised to speak to the media, said two mandi traders, Rakesh and Sunil Pandey, were arrested by evening. “Rakesh was caught from the spot by the family of one of the victims and handed over to us. Pandey was arrested by us following a probe. We are identifying the other killers by analysing the CCTV footage,” said the investigator.The officer said a case of murder as well as tampering of evidence has been registered against the alleged killers at Mahendra Park police station. “The section on tampering of evidence was added because of their attempt to dispose of Lokesh’s body in a sack,” said the officer.Lokesh’s brother, Anuj, said his brother played the drums at weddings to earn a living. Ved Prakash, on the other hand, worked in the mandi itself.Anuj said an acquaintance called him from the mandi on Tuesday morning to inform that his brother was being thrashed by a mob. “When we reached there, we found some people sewing up a sack in a hurry. When we asked them about what was inside, they replied that it was just “goods”. But we forcibly opened the sack to find my brother’s body inside. He was already dead,” Anuj said.A few metres away was Ved Prakash, lay tied up and bleeding from the head.The investigator, quoted above, said the killers knew that their thrashing was fatal.“They thought that they could dispose of Lokesh’s body in a sack by placing it amid vegetable sacks and moving it away from the spot. They would have done the same with the other victim as well, but Lokesh’s family arrived there before they could go ahead with their plans,” said the investigator.Around the same time, at about 7.30am, the police at the Azadpur Mandi police post were alerted about the mob lynching. “We immediately reached the place to find the two men badly injured,” said the DCP, adding that Lokesh was found in a sack.The police moved both men to the Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where they were declared brought dead.Lokesh’s family handed over a couple of men, whom they claimed were the killers, but the police are yet to ascertain their involvement.The DCP said the initial probe has suggested that a few individuals, rather than a mob, was involved in the killings. “A crowd did gather, but they were mostly curious onlookers,” the officer claimed.This is not the first instance of someone being beaten black and blue on suspicion of stealing in Azadpur Mandi. Last August, a labourer was beaten to death by two truck drivers on the suspicion that he had stolen their cash. They tied him up and drove away with him stuffed in their truck until the traffic police stopped them and discovered the man all injured and tied up. He later succumbed to injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-men-suspected-of-stealing-beaten-to-death-in-azadpur-mandi-101615314743640.html

They have all been booked for murder, attempt to murder, wrongful restraint, rioting, voluntarily causing hurt and common intention, a case regarding which was registered at the Rajouri Garden police station, the police said.The man who died was identified only by his first name, Rupesh. The injured were his parents, brother Mukesh, sister-in-law and uncle. Rupesh ran a ready-made apparel business with his father.The police said on Monday night, Rupesh had organised a family get-together at his home. Around 11.30pm, Rupesh and his family were having dinner when they heard a commotion outside their home. Mukesh went out and found a woman, identified as Priyanka, allegedly quarrelling with her husband, Tarun, and her in-laws over some issue.“Tarun, Priyanka and their family members were creating a ruckus and using abusive words. Mukesh and their mother objected to the nuisance. At this, the other group started arguing with them and assaulting them. When Rupesh and the other family members came out to pacify them, the other group called their associates and they together assaulted Rupesh and family with sticks,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam.The Rajouri Garden police station received a call regarding the clash at 11.44pm. The alleged attackers fled by the time the local police reached the scene.

10-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana law secretary favours tabling of MSP guarantee Bill||Even as the Haryana assembly speaker had last week rejected the private member’s Bill guaranteeing minimum support price (MSP) to farmers, the state government’s law and legislative secretary had advised in favour of tabling the private member’s Bill.The private member’s Bill was submitted by Congress MLAs to amend the Haryana Agricultural Produce Markets Act, thereby ensuring dispensation of MSP to farmers under a legal framework.The grounds taken by the speaker to disallow tabling of the amendment Bill were that the intent of the legislation is to amend the central farm laws and the Supreme Court has stayed implementation of the central laws.However, Haryana’s law and legislative secretary-cum-legal remembrancer (LR), in its advice of February 17, had said that from a legal point of view it will be necessary to embark upon legislation as the purpose in view cannot be achieved otherwise.The advice by the law and legislative secretary was tendered in relation to four points mentioned in Rule 36 of Rules of Business of the state government. The law and legislative secretary said the subject matter of the proposed legislation is relatable to entry 14 of the state list in the seventh schedule to the Constitution and the state legislature is, thus, competent to enact the proposed measure. It is not a money bill, the advice said.Entry 14 of the state list pertained to agriculture, including agricultural education and research, protection against pests and prevention of plant diseases.The advice also said that it will be necessary to reserve the Bill for the consideration of the president after it is passed by the state legislature as required under the Article 254 (2) of the Constitution (inconsistency between laws made by the Parliament and laws made by the state legislatures).The law and legislative secretary also advised that the proposed measure would not be inconsistent with the Constitutional provisions including those relating to fundamental rights.Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Rohtak MLA BB Batra said that the amendment being sought by them was for a state law enacted by the Vidhan Sabha which is the competent forum to amend it.Batra, on Tuesday, again raised the matter in the assembly saying the speaker had used a hyper technical ground for rejecting the amendment Bill.“When the law secretary has favoured the Bill, the government should have tabled it. It could have then sent it for presidential assent. You could have also asked us to amend it further,’’ the Congress MLAs said.Referring to JJP legislator Jogi Ram Sihag’s demand for enactment of a state law to ensure minimum support price for every crop, Batra said even BJP’s ally JJP is supporting this Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/law-secretary-favours-tabling-of-msp-guarantee-bill-101615312405323.html
10-03-2021||Pune||Pune civic body denies regularising unauthorised properties in biodiversity park||The Maharashtra government has given an extension to regularise the construction in the gunthewari area which raises a possibility of regularising unauthorised construction in the Bio-Diversity Park (BDP), however, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has denied the possibility as the state has already mentioned that regularisation will not happen in the no-development zone. The BDP falls under the no development zone. The PMC reserved 979 hectares of land 19 years ago under the BDP reservation in Pune city development plan (DP) for 23 merged villages. The purpose of reserving the BDP is to save the hill slope and hilltop in order to maintain greenery in the city. The state government merged 23 new villages in 1997 in the old Pune city limit. After that, the civic body made a development plan for 23 merged villages in 2005. After that, the state government gave an approval to the 23 merged villages DP in parts. In 2015, the state government took a decision to give 8 per cent green Transfer Development Rights (TDR) to landowners as compensation and acquire the BDP land. However, owners are not happy with compensation and they want cash compensation instead of TDR as rates are very low. Most BDP land belongs to Private owners In the 23 merged villages development plan, the civic body proposed and reserved a total of 978 hectares spread over seven hills in the 12 villages. It includes 124.45 hectares of government land and 853.09 hectares of privately owned land. At present, due to less amount of compensation, most of the BDP land has encroached. Some landowners are selling land in small pieces in the market. Vandana Chavan, Member of Parliament (MP) of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said, “I met Kumar on the background of construction activity on various Biodiversity sensitive hills in the city. There has been no action taken by PMC despite the state government appointing a beat officer. The plotting on these sensitive zones is taking place without any obstacle. Various builders in the city are constructing on natural water sources blocking their flow. PMC has done the mapping of all the natural water sources and they should be made open to people.” Rajendra Raut, superintendent engineer of building permission and construction said, “The PMC is taking action on unauthorised construction in the BDP area. On the other hand, there will be no regularisation of constructions on BDP areas. The BDP has been reserved in the development plan. We will also set up a single system to scrutinise the plan, maps attached to the gunthewari proposal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-denies-regularising-unauthroised-properties-in-biodiversity-park-101615311803294.html
10-03-2021||Pune||Gangsters behind bars as Pune police crackdown on organised crime continues||The Pune police seem to be in action mode and the crime branch is going ahead with no tolerance policy towards hardened gangsters operating in the city. After the arrest of Gajanan Marne alias Maharaj, the city police have lodged as many as eight criminal cases against him. Earlier, there were 23 cases lodged against him at different police stations, the crime branch stated. Meanwhile, the Pune rural police have arrested gangster Nilesh Bansilal Ghaywal (44) from Sonegaon in Jamkhed tehsil of Ahmednagar district and lodged him in Yerawada prison for one year under the MPDA Act. The action was taken jointly by the local crime branch and Bhigwan police on March 2. According to the rural police, the action has been taken to prevent the gangster from spreading fear among citizens. Rural SP Abhinav Deshmukh recommended district collector Rajesh Deshmukh to extern the gangster for a period of one year and thereafter the action was taken. The crime branch has also booked gangster Sachin Pote in connection with a firing case in Mundhwa. The Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) had acquitted Marne (54) and his 13 aides in connection with the murder of rival gang member Santosh Hiraman Gawade alias Pappu citing lack of evidence. Earlier, the court had acquitted 21 Marne aides in the murder of another rival gang member identified as Amol Hari Badhe. Both Gawade and Badhe were affiliated to Marne’s rival Nilesh Ghaywal gang. While Gawade was gunned down on November 4, 2014, Badhe was murdered on November 29, 2014. On Feb 16, the supporters of the gangster after being released from Taloja jail took out a huge procession from Taloja to Pune via Mumbai-Pune Expressway where a convoy of 500 cars joined the procession which was shot on a drone and its videos went viral on social media. The convoy proceeded ahead without paying tax and the event was shot live by the supporters who burst crackers enroute to welcome the acquittal by a Pune sessions court. The city police had lodged a case against Marne at Hinjewadi police station for taking out the procession in violation of the law. Meanwhile, a Pune court on March 4 rejected Marne and his aides’ bail application on grounds of disobedience to the law. The police even seized drones from his supporters and inquired whether prior permission was taken for flying the drones. On March 3, the Khadak police arrested local gangster Suraykant alias Bandu Anna Andekar (60) and his aide in connection with an attempt to murder case after a complaint was lodged against them by Omkar Gajanan Kudle (21). According to the police, members of the Andekar gang including Rishabh Devdatta Andekar (21) allegedly attacked Kudle with sharp weapons around 9 pm on February 21. Police stated that Andekar gang believed that their “rivals” Kudle and Suraj Thombre were a threat to their supremacy in the area and they allegedly attacked Kudle after orders from gang leader Bandu Andekar. It may be recalled that former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during his address to the city police had reprimanded the department for its inaction against the gangster. He said that the police must have ‘vachak’ (control) over goons and not common citizens. “Commoners must feel confident and secure if they go to the police. We will strengthen the police force by boosting infrastructure and additional recruitment of personnel, but the police must take care that they come up to the expectations of the common citizens. Pawar was addressing a gathering of police personnel during the recovered stolen ornaments return programme for citizens organized by Pune police at Shivajinagar headquarters. Additional commissioner of police (crime ) Ashok Morale said, “We are taking strict action against all gangsters and different gangs in Pune are under our radar. The city police have adopted no tolerance for such types of criminals. The net is being cast wider against criminals and gangsters in the city.” Ghaywal arrested and booked The Pune police arrested gangster Nilesh Ghaywal and eight of his henchmen in connection with forcibly whisking away a four wheeler for a rally. They have been booked under IPC 395,294 (b), 109, 506 (2), 504, Maharashtra Police Act 37(1) in a separate FIR lodged at Kothrud Police Station. In addition, the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) has been invoked against Ghaywal and he was arrested on March 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gangsters-behind-bars-as-police-crackdown-on-organised-crime-continues-101615311743910.html

Pune city has 12 lakh beneficiaries due for the Covid vaccine in phase two of the vaccinations drive. These include senior citizens and those with comorbidities aged 45-59. Of these, 40,000 have been given the first dose since March 1. On Tuesday alone, close to 10,000 senior citizens and those suffering from comorbidities were vaccinated. In addition to the centrally located area of the hospitals, open space and hospitality has been the plus-point in attracting beneficiaries. While Inlaks & Budhrani is located at Koregaon park, the PMC-run Kamala Nehru hospital is located in Mangalwar peth. Kamala Nehru was one of the first hospitals to begin vaccination in the city. On Tuesday of the 9,721 senior citizens and comorbids who got the vaccine, 215 got the vaccine at Inlaks & Budhrani, while 222 got it at Kamala Nehru. On the first day of phase two vaccination on March 1, Kamala Nehru was one of only four locations in the city. Following that, the civic body started more centres, however, a huge crowd continued to go to the PMC hospital. Additional commissioner Rubal Aagrwal said, “Due to the huge response we had to begin two shifts for the vaccine starting from 9 am to 9 pm. There has been no major response, post-vaccination, which is further encouraging senior citizens. We even had a women’s special vaccination on March 8 to encourage women senior citizens.” Inlaks & Budhrani hospital director Dr Rhea Punjabi said, “It is difficult to manage senior citizens as they are impatient and most of them come for walk-in registration. They come to the hospital at 8am and then there is a huge crowd. However, we have allocated separate nursing staff, and also staff to attend to basic needs like water and tea. There is a clear demarcated space for waiting and there is shed outside also. We have the security in place to manage the crowd.” Dr Punjabi added: “After the vaccination is done, some are desperate to leave, but we ensure that they wait for at least 30 minutes no matter what. In addition to the medical certificate, we also check for vitals like blood pressure and temperature at the site. This crowd could go on for months and so we are contemplating increasing counters.” On Tuesday, Pune city saw a total of 12,091 beneficiaries get the vaccine, including first and second dose. No adverse effects following immunisation were reported||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/inlaks-budhrani-and-kamala-nehru-hospital-get-it-right-to-ensure-vaccine-drive-a-succes-101615308743033.html

According to the police, the value of a single gold coin ranges between ₹60,000 and ₹70,000 each. In other words, the worth of these 216 coins is more than ₹1.30 crore, said commissioner of police Krishna Prakash. “The historic gold coins weighing 2,357 grams were found with a broken bronze made of a copper-like metal weighing 525 gram. The seized coins date between 1720 to 1750 AD. According to the archaeological department, the gold coins have the seal of ‘Raja Muhammad Shah’ with the name written in Urdu and Arabic. The coins will be handed over to the archaeological department after informing the court. Further, action will be taken based on the report from the archaeological department,” said Prakash. According to police, during a routine patrolling on March 8, police naik Zameer Babalal Tamboli received a tip-off that Saddam Salar Khan Pathan, a resident of Vithhalnagar slums in Pimpri had illegally kept historical gold coins in his possession. A team led by police sub-inspector (PSI) Sanjay Nilpatrewar raided Pathan’s house along with jewellery experts including historians. After the genuineness of the coins was ascertained, police seized them as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 102 and brought them to the notice of the government. According to deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Sudhir Hiremath, during the investigation it was revealed that three to four months ago, Pathan’s father-in-law Mubarak Shaikh and brother-in-law Irfan Shaikh, both residents of Parbhani district had come to Chikhli to work as casual labourers. “Pathan had brought the relatives to work at a construction site in Chikhli. During digging work for columns, the duo found few coins buried in the ground. They showed the coins to Pathan and went to the same place and dug a mound of earth and searched for gold coins. The diggers had found broken metal bronze and scattered gold coins. Pathan brought home all the valuables and kept them in his illegal possession,” said Hiremath. Later, a dispute between Shaikh and Pathan broke out which led to information leaking out. The police went to his home with a notice after getting detailed information about the gold coins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/18thcentury-gold-coins-worth-rs-1-30-crore-seized-by-police-101615302862523.html

The demand triggered an uproar in the state assembly as ruling Shiv Sena demanded the arrest of those named by Dadra Nagar Haveli parliament member Mohan Delkar in his suicide note.The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad on Sunday registered a case of murder, criminal conspiracy, and destruction of evidence without naming anyone following the recovery of the businessman Mansukh Hiren’s body. Sachin Vaze was the investigation officer probing the recovery of the explosives from the car.Fadnavis alleged Hiren was murdered in the car and his body war thrown in Thane creek. “In her statement to the police, Mansukh Hirani’s wife has said that the car found outside Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s South Mumbai residence, was in possession of Sachin Vaze from November 20 last year. The car was given to him for use as Hiren knew Vaze who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiren after four months,” he said.Also Read | ‘Something fishy’: Uddhav after NIA asked to take over Ambani bomb threat probeFadnavis said that Vaze and one Dhananjay Gawade were allegedly named in an extortion case in 2017. “The last location of Hiren before his death was at Gawade’s office in Thane, 40-km away from the creek where the body was found. This establishes Vaze’s involvement in the case. The Anti-Terrorism Squad has been investigating the case of murder, but Vaze should first be arrested under section 201 [for causing disappearance of evidence of an offence or giving false information to screen offender] of the Indian Penal Code,” said Fadnavis.In response to Fadnavis’s demand, minister Anil Parab demanded action Delkar’s case. Parab said that Delkar has named Dadra Nagar Haveli administration in his suicide note and yet there has been no arrest so far.

Merck has agreed to partner with J&J to produce its vaccine.The United States has already paid over $1 billion for 100 million doses from J&J and had an option to purchase an additional 200 million doses.Biden has sought to speed up the vaccination process since taking office on Jan. 20. The pandemic has killed more than 528,000 people in the United States alone.J&J’s manufacturing has been slower than hoped, and it was not expected to be able to deliver any vaccine doses this week. It is expected to resume shipments later in March.The company indicated that another vaccine purchase by the US administration had not been finalized."Last August, Johnson & Johnson signed an agreement with the US government to deliver 100 million doses of our Covid vaccine, and we are on track to meet that commitment," spokesman Jake Sargent said."The US Government has the option to purchase additional doses under a subsequent agreement. We look forward to any future discussions with the US Government and to participating in the event at the White House later today," he added.J&J has come up short on its shipments to the United States this month, promising to deliver only 20 million of the 37 million doses it had originally promised to have ready by now.Merck will help with the final manufacturing steps called fill and finish - expected to be up and running in May - and the production of the vaccine itself. J&J, which has committed to producing 1 billion doses this year, also said it is continuing to seek more manufacturing partners.The United States approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc vaccines in December, and those companies have been working to increase their production since then.Pfizer and Moderna have committed to supplying the country with 120 million doses and 100 million doses, respectively, by the end of March. They have agreed to supply 300 million doses each by the end of July.As of Tuesday morning, more than 123 million doses of coronavirus vaccines had been distributed in the United States and 93.7 million shots had been administered, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-order-additional-100-million-doses-of-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-101615396639102.html

On Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel said Britain, like the United States, had "outright" banned exports of vaccines produced on its territory.London says it has no such ban, and credits the success of its vaccine programme to strong negotiations with drug companies last year and early investment in supply chains. EU officials say London has effectively prevented exports of AstraZeneca vaccines by invoking a clause in its contract that requires the company to fulfil Britain's order first.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament he had to "correct" Michel's suggestion. His government had "not blocked the export of any single COVID-19 vaccine or vaccine components", he said.The foreign office said it had summoned EU charge d'affaires Nicole Mannion "to discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications".Asked whether Britain was using its AstraZeneca contract to effectively block exports, a spokesman for Johnson said: "The movement of vaccines and their components into and out of the UK is driven by contractual obligations that vaccine suppliers have to their customers."After initially saying Britain had imposed an "outright" export ban, Michel later said there were "different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines".An EU official said the bloc had allowed exports of 8 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Britain since Jan. 30, and many more earlier. Manfred Weber, head of the largest political group in the European Parliament, told Britain's foreign secretary to "stop lecturing and to show Britain's export data."The vaccine dispute comes at a time when the bloc and its former member are also quarrelling over Brexit. An EU diplomat said such verbal jousting was "the new normal"."With more economic divergence and more competition ahead, pressure on our Brexit agreements will only grow," the diplomat said.Last week, Britain unilaterally extended a grace period on checks of food arriving in Northern Ireland from other parts of the United Kingdom, required under its Brexit deal. The move is expected to prompt a legal challenge from Brussels this week, two Brussels diplomatic sources said."This was another provocation. It's not the first, and nobody expects it to be the last. The EU will keep calm and react firmly," said a second senior EU diplomat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-denies-eu-charge-of-banning-covid-19-vaccine-exports-summons-diplomat-101615395834047.html

"Instead, the regime’s focus remains on developing weapons of mass destruction and the vehicles for delivering them," he said.North Korea's mission to the UN in Geneva did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. Pyongyang does not recognise the UN investigator's mandate and boycotted Wednesday's debate.It has previously rejected UN allegations of crimes against humanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-major-world-powers-ignoring-north-korea-s-crimes-against-humanity-101615395433049.html

Speaking at CNN’s New Day programme, Fauci said that a boost against the “regular virus” as well as a boost against the variant is “going to be promising.”“Boost against the regular virus which will have a spillover and protect you against the variant, or specifically boost against the variant. And I think both of those are going to be promising,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN when asked about the US’ plan of giving people boosters against variants.The 80-year-old immunologist’s comment on vaccine booster comes amid concerns over the efficacy of vaccines against new variants, particularly the one first detected in South Africa. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that it is still learning about the efficacy of vaccines against coronavirus variants. In its guidelines for fully vaccinated people, the CDC warned that the vaccines may work against some variants but could be less effective against others.“We’re still learning how well Covid-19 vaccines keep people from spreading the disease. Early data show that the vaccines may help keep people from spreading Covid-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated,” the federal agency added.Fauci noted that while the antibodies induced by vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are “quite effective” for B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the UK, the vaccine efficacy appears to be slightly diminished against B.1.351 variant first identified in a lab in South Africa. The B.1.1.7 is currently the dominant variant with its presence identified in at least 111 countries so far, followed by B.1.351 variant in 58 countries, according to the situation report released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday.“While many countries worldwide are currently experiencing a decline in overall SARS-CoV-2 infections, an increased number of reports of variants have been noted in a number of countries,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-reveals-two-promising-ways-of-boosting-covid-19-vaccines-against-variants-101615395164816.html

Around 2,000 people have been arrested and at least 60 protesters have been killed since the military takeover."We have seen reports on social media about India's role in deliberations on Myanmar in the UNSC. These reports are mischievous and biased. UNSC is seized of the matter and let us wait for the outcome. India's position on the issue is well-known and has been clearly articulated," the Embassy of India in Yangon said in a tweet on Wednesday.In a February 26 statement in the General Assembly during an informal meeting on Myanmar, India had said that as a close friend and neighbour of Myanmar and its people, New Delhi "will continue to closely monitor the situation and will remain in discussion with like-minded countries so that the hopes and aspirations of the people are respected.""Restoring democratic order should be the priority of all stakeholders in Myanmar. The international community must lend its constructive support to the people of Myanmar at this critical juncture,” India had said.India had said that it remains deeply concerned that the gains made by Myanmar over the last decades on the path towards democracy, should not get undermined."As the largest democracy, we have always been steadfast in our support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar for it to emerge as a stable democratic federal union,” India had said in the UNGA meeting."We believe that the rule of law and democratic process must be upheld, those detained be released and that calm prevails. We call on the Myanmar leadership to work together to resolve their differences in a peaceful and constructive manner,” India had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biased-india-tells-unsc-on-reports-in-social-media-about-its-role-in-myanmar-101615394705172.html

The two countries signed a cooperation agreement in 2010 and began construction in 2018.Turkey — whose electricity production is based on gas-burning plants and hydroelectric units — is largely dependent on power imports, buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia, among others.Nuclear power is a “strategic step” for energy security, Erdogan said.Last summer, Turkey announced that it had discovered 405 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the Black Sea, and is prospecting for hydrocarbon resources in the Eastern Mediterranean amid tensions with Greece and Cyprus over maritime rights.Energy Minister Fatih Donmez, said the Akkuyu plant would fulfill about 10% of domestic electricity needs. Erdogan said the share of locally produced and renewable energy resources has reached 63.7% in established power networks.Erdogan said the first reactor would become operational in 2023, to coincide with the centennial of the modern Turkish state. A total of four reactors are planned.Russia's Rosatom State Corporation holds a 99.2% stake in the project, whose total cost is estimated at 20 billion US dollars, according to the plant's website.The Turkish president also said cooperation between Ankara and Moscow played a “key role” in regional stability.“We have had the opportunity to see the results of Turkish-Russian dialogue in many fields, including in Libya, in Nagorno-Karabakh, in Syria,” Erdogan said. The two countries back opposing sides in these conflicts.Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the event via video-conference Wednesday.Speaking from Moscow, Putin called the nuclear plant a “truly flagship project.”Turkey's projects for nuclear power in the earthquake-prone region have triggered concern from neighboring Greece and Cyprus — where both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot environmental groups have voiced strong opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-putin-remotely-start-nuclear-reactor-construction-101615390309019.html

Myeik police station did not answer its phone. The army has previously said it is dealing with protests lawfully.The man provided photographs which he said were taken by his family showing injuries on his back, neck and shoulders.Reuters has verified that the photographs were of the man and that his family had taken them. The news agency, which spoke to the man by telephone, could not verify his account.The protesters were put in a truck and handed over to troops at Myeik air base, where the men were separated from the women, photographed and taken to a room, the man said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of being detained again.Reuters was unable to reach the air base for comment."We got beaten the whole time even while we were walking to the room," he said. "The soldiers said, 'This is the hell room, why don't you guys have a taste?'"He described being told to kneel and said five of the group were told to face each other while they were beaten on their backs, heads, necks and sides. He said he was later freed along with several others without explanation. Some others were formally arrested and sent to jail.Reuters was unable to contact the jail for comment.Pyae Phyo Aung, a former student union member in Myeik who has been in touch with released protesters, told Reuters 32 people were arrested in the incident, according to a list that he helped compile for civil society groups. He said he saw another protester with injuries on his back and hip."When I met him, he couldn't even sit," Pyae Phyo Aung said. "He was lying face down because of the injuries on his hips."Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in a coup on Feb. 1 and detained her and other politicians.The military says an election in November won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the national electoral commission - and has set up a junta to rule the country pending a new vote on an unspecified date.Security forces have cracked down with increasing force on daily nationwide protests, and more than 60 demonstrators have been killed and 1,900 people arrested since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has said.Reuters has not been able to confirm the figures independently.At least two people, both NLD officials, have died in custody since last Saturday after being arrested, according to party sources, although the reason for their deaths is not known. The military has not commented on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-hours-in-hell-room-myanmar-protester-describes-beating-in-custody-101615394098095.html

Tanzania prez who denied Covid-19 goes missing, reports say he is on ventilator||Tanzania's main opposition leader has demanded information on the health of President John Magufuli, a prominent COVID-19 sceptic whose absence from public view has brought speculation he is receiving medical treatment abroad.Tanzania's government has made no official comment.The Nation newspaper in neighbouring Kenya reported that an African leader not seen in public for nearly two weeks was being treated for COVID-19 on a ventilator at Nairobi Hospital, a private hospital in the Kenyan capital.It cited unidentified political and diplomatic sources for the report and did not identify the leader.Magufuli, a 61-year-old leader nicknamed "The Bulldozer," was last seen in public on Feb. 27 looking his normal self as he swore in a new chief secretary at State House in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam.He has been out of public view for periods in the past."The president's wellbeing is a matter of grave public concern. What's it with Magufuli that we don't deserve to know?", opposition leader Tundu Lissu said in a tweet late on Tuesday as rumours flew on Tanzanian social media."It's a sad comment on his stewardship of our country that it's come to this: that he himself had get COVID-19 and be flown out to Kenya in order to prove that prayers, steam inhalations and other unproven herbal concoctions he’s championed are no protection against coronavirus!" added Lissu, without providing evidence.On Wednesday, Lissu told Reuters that multiple sources had told him that Magufuli was in Nairobi Hospital but that there were now plans afoot to move him to India.Reuters was unable to confirm the accounts from the Nation or Lissu. Kenya's Foreign Ministry and Nairobi Hospital both said they had no information to disclose.Magufuli's director of communications Gerson Msigwa and government spokesman Hassan Abbas did not respond to Reuters messages left seeking comment.'VACCINES ARE NOT GOOD'Magufuli has played down the threat of COVID-19 in Tanzania and scoffed at global panic. He urged Tanzanians to put faith in prayer and homespun remedies such as steam inhalation rather than vaccines, which he said were dangerous and part of a Western conspiracy."Vaccines are not good. If they were, then the white man would have brought vaccines for HIV/AIDS," he said earlier this year. Last year he dismissed coronavirus testing kits, which he said had returned positive results on a goat and pawpaw fruit.Tanzania stopped reporting coronavirus data in May last year when it said it had 509 cases and 21 deaths, according to data held at the World Health Organization, which has called on the country to share its information.Fuelling concern about a possible hidden epidemic, a top opposition politician on Tanzania's autonomous Zanzibar archipelago, Seif Sharif Hamad, died last month of what his party said was COVID-19.Even as COVID-19 spread around Africa, Tanzanians were still allowed to gather, for example to watch sport.Magufuli was first elected in 2015 and beat Lissu to win re-election last year. He has faced accusations from Western countries and opposition parties of eroding democracy, which he denies.Magufuli has a history of heart issues, according to a senior Tanzanian medic close to the government who asked not to be identified, and a private security official in Kenya with extensive official contacts in Tanzania.

10-03-2021||World||Congress set to pass Covid rescue plan in major win for Biden||Joe Biden's enormous economic relief package is set to clear Congress Wednesday, delivering a major victory for the US president and a desperately needed cash injection to millions of families and businesses suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.The $1.9 trillion plan, months in the making, is one of the largest US rescue packages ever, and will impact every aspect of the world's biggest economy for years to come.And while Republicans appear to stand in lockstep in opposition, progressive and moderate Democrats have managed to remain united in order to get the measure to Biden's desk for his signature days before critical unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.A vote is expected in the House of Representatives at around 1:00 pm (1800 GMT), and if the bill reaches his desk, Biden -- who made the American Rescue Plan his top legislative priority -- could sign the historic bill into law by week's end.The plan funds Covid-19 vaccines, preserves unemployment benefits for millions, sends stimulus checks of up to $1,400 to most Americans and expands federal funding for health care.It also extends eviction and foreclosure moratoriums, increases food aid and sets aside $130 billion for schools.And Democrats argue that the bill's child tax credit expansion would slash child poverty by up to 50 percent."We are going to act with the fierce urgency of now (and) we will revive the economy," Democratic caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries said on the House floor."We will build back better for the people. Help is on the way."Republican lawmakers decry what they call the bill's "socialist agenda" and its massive cost, saying more than 90 percent does not go to directly combatting Covid-19.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called the plan "a long laundry list of left-wing priorities that predate the pandemic and do not meet the needs of the American families."House conservative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully sought to derail the vote early Wednesday, called spending so much money "reckless, irresponsible and the wrong thing to do."But Americans outside Washington see it very differently.Polls show overwhelming bipartisan support among voters for the bill, which also includes extensions of rental and mortgage assistance, help for small businesses and schools, and billions of dollars for state and local governments.- 'Keep the faith' -Nevertheless, Biden is signalling that he will soon hit the road on a mission to sell the package to the American people."Keep the faith, folks," Biden tweeted Wednesday. "We will get through this."A day earlier, Biden visited a business billed as Washington's oldest hardware store, which has benefitted from the Paycheck Protection Program begun under Donald Trump's administration to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis."We're going to continue this," Biden said of the PPP as he chatted with store owner Mike Siegel.Biden's administration says it will tailor the program so that it focuses on businesses with 20 employees or fewer.The last congressional plan to fight the coronavirus, which has to date left more than 527,000 dead in the United States and brought the economy to its knees, was enacted in December.It expanded unemployment payments and extended them through March 14.That deadline has loomed as Biden and congressional Democrats crafted their latest package, but it appears they will meet it and extend the benefits until early September.Democratic leaders have hailed the American Rescue Plan as historic and transformative.Progressive Democrats had pushed for higher supplemental unemployment benefits of $400, but after a last-minute standoff with a moderate Democrat, the Senate kept the payments at $300 a week.With the bill's passage likely, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development sharply raised its 2021 global growth forecast Tuesday amid greatly improved economic prospects.OECD says it now expects the global economy to grow by 5.6 percent, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from its December forecast.And it sees the US economy climbing by 6.5 percent this year, nearly double its previous forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-set-to-pass-covid-rescue-plan-in-major-win-for-biden-101615393373628.html
10-03-2021||World||UK parliamentary committee on $32bn Covid test and trace system was ineffective||England's $32 billion test and trace system has not made a significant impact on the Covid-19 pandemic and failed its key goals despite its "unimaginable" cost, a British parliamentary committee said on Wednesday.Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year promised a world beating test and trace system as part of the route out of the pandemic.But it has taken the successful development and deployment of vaccines to let the government plot a definitive route back to normality."Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project, test and trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic," said Meg Hillier, chair of the British parliament's Public Accounts Committee and an opposition Labour party lawmaker."The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice."The Public Accounts Committee said that test and trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.The system has been allocated 37 billion pounds in total to cover two years, a budget which includes the cost of testing people with symptoms and regular testing in schools, care homes and some work places.Johnson said that the system deserved credit for the proposed roadmap for reopening by the summer."It is thanks to NHS test and trace that we're able to send kids back to school and begin cautiously and irreversibly to reopen our economy and restart our lives," Johnson told parliament.Dido Harding, who runs the system, said that regular testing was "a vital tool to stop transmission" and that contact tracing made "a real impact in breaking chains of transmission", having reached more than 9.1 million cases and contacts.Last year, scientific advisers said test and trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn.Test and trace's use of highly paid consultants, at a time when health workers face below-inflation pay rises, has attracted particular ire.The committee's report said that test and trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. It found that in early February, the scheme was employing around 2,500 consultants from firms such as Deloitte, earning an estimate day rate of around 1,100 pounds, with some paid more than 6,500 pounds."It is concerning that the (health ministry) is still paying such amounts - which it considers to be 'very competitive rates' - to so many consultants," the report said."(Test and trace) should put in place a clear workforce plan and recruitment strategy which aim to reduce significantly, month by month, its reliance on costly consultants and temporary staff."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliamentary-committee-on-32bn-covid-test-and-trace-system-was-ineffective-101615392039838.html

Nationwide mass protests have been met with deadly force, with at least 60 people killed according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group.Jayanath Colombage, secretary to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Reuters by phone Myanmar’s "incumbent foreign minister" had been invited because the country was a member nation of BIMSTEC and had not been removed or suspended."That doesn’t mean we have accepted the Myanmar military government," he said. "We have not taken a position on that."A spokesman for Myanmar’s junta did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment. The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.BIMSTEC is a grouping of nations – Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand – that are dependent on the Bay of Bengal.Myanmar protesters have called on nations across the world to reject the military leadership and deal with a civilian committee set up by ousted lawmakers – the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH)."Every nation in the world needs to clearly understand that the coup in Myanmar is not complete, it's still an attempted coup," Myanmar-based activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi told Reuters."So I ask Sri Lankan activists to give pressure to the Sri Lankan government not to invite the military junta because they are not the legitimate government of Myanmar," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lanka-denies-endorsing-myanmar-coup-as-junta-representative-invited-for-meet-101615391852348.html
10-03-2021||World||Czech Airlines goes bankrupt as Covid-19 impacts operations||A Czech court said on Wednesday it had declared bankruptcy on struggling national carrier Czech Airlines, following a request by the company itself."The court calls on the debtor's creditors who have not registered their claims yet to do so within two months at the latest," the Prague Municipal Court said.A specialist transport website, zdopravy.cz, said the company had debts reaching 1.8 billion Czech crowns (70 million euros, $80 million).Czech Airlines, a unit of the Prague-based Smartwings group, said last month it had filed a proposal for reorganisation with a court in line with the insolvency law, blaming the coronavirus crisis for its financial woes.The company, which is still running flights as scheduled, has complained that unlike its foreign rivals it has never received Covid aid from the government.It has been forced to lay off hundreds of staff because of the virus.Founded in 1923, Czech Airlines posted losses of 60 million euros for 2020 as its sales slumped to 20 percent of 2019 levels because of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czech-airlines-goes-bankrupt-as-covid-19-impacts-operations-101615390702135.html
10-03-2021||World||South Korea agrees to pay more for hosting US troops in 2021||Striking a delicate balance, the United States and South Korea have agreed Seoul will pay 13.9% more this year for hosting American troops as part of a multiyear deal crafted to keep Seoul's share of the overall cost within historical norms, officials said Wednesday.The deal, which had been announced earlier this week but without financial details, ends a long stalemate that had strained relations between allies after the Trump administration demanded a five-fold increase in Seoul's contributions.President Joe Biden's willingness to quickly accept smaller increases is cast by the State Department as evidence that the Biden administration wants to repair relations with key allies in East Asia as it focuses on regional unity in confronting China and North Korea.The State Department announced Wednesday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Tokyo and Seoul next week for security consultations to “reaffirm the United States’ commitment to strengthening our alliances.” Blinken will be joined in both meetings by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also will visit India.American and South Korean officials, in separate briefings for reporters in Washington and Seoul, said the 13.9% increase will apply to the South Korean government's payments this year. In each of the following four years, the increase will match increases in Seoul's national defense budget.The previous agreement had expired at the end of 2019; the new deal covers 2020 retroactively by keeping South Korea's payment the same as 2019 at about 1.04 trillion Korean won, or the equivalent of about $910 million at current exchange rates. For this year, Seoul agreed to pay 1.18 trillion won, or about $1 billion. That is a 13.9% increase, which a State Department official said is the largest since 2004.Overall, South Korea will be paying about 44% of the overall cost of having American troops based on the peninsula, not counting US military and civilian salaries. The State Department said that is similar to Seoul's share over many years. The US has about 28,500 troops in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-agrees-to-pay-more-for-hosting-us-troops-in-2021-101615388901011.html
10-03-2021||World||India, South Africa lock horns with West over bid to waive Covid-19 vaccine patents||A push to increase production of Covid-19 vaccines for poor nations hung in the balance at the World Trade Organization on Wednesday amid disagreement between richer and developing countries over the issue of patent rights.South Africa and India planned to renew their bid at a two-day meeting to waive rules of the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement, a move that would allow generic or other manufacturers to make more vaccines.Their proposal is backed by dozens of largely developing countries at the WTO, but opposed by Western countries including Britain, Switzerland, EU nations and the United States, which have large domestic pharmaceutical industries.Proposals need backing by a consensus of the WTO's 164 members to pass.The issue was set to come up at the WTO's TRIPS Council on Wednesday afternoon. Members would then hold an eighth discussion on the topic since it was first raised in October.Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who became WTO director-general on March 1, called the intensifying TRIPS discussions "vitally important", but said governments and businesses needed to act now to increase production, especially in emerging markets.She said in a speech on Tuesday that manufacturers should come together with bodies such as the World Health Organization and vaccines alliance GAVI, whose board she used to chair, and business associations to look into options."We must make sure that in the end we deliver so that the millions of people who are waiting for us with bated breath know that we are working on concrete solutions," the former Nigerian finance and foreign minister said.The next TRIPS Council meeting is set for June 8-9, but the group will probably be convened again to discuss vaccines before then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-south-africa-lock-horns-with-west-over-bid-to-waive-covid-vaccine-patents-101615388887012.html
10-03-2021||World||Meghan Markle filed formal complaint about UK TV host Piers Morgan comments||Meghan Markle filed a formal complaint with British broadcaster ITV, after a presenter criticised her claims against the royal family and later quit.Piers Morgan left his role as host of Good Morning Britain on Tuesday following a scathing attack on the Duchess of Sussex's interview with US chatshow host Oprah Winfrey.She and her husband, Prince Harry, accused the royal family of racism, while the former television actress said she had suicidal thoughts during her time in Britain.Former CNN host Morgan's comments that he did not believe her sparked 41,000 complaints to Britain's broadcasting regulator Ofcom.Britain's domestic Press Association news agency said it understood Meghan formally complained to ITV before he resigned, confirming a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.The complaint focused on how his remarks may affect those trying to deal with their own mental health problems, it added.It did not concern his repeated criticism of her or allegations of racism, which have rocked the monarchy.Morgan, a former tabloid newspaper editor, has been a consistent critic of Markle after she cut off contact with him after she met Harry and they married in 2018.On Tuesday, Morgan stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain as he clashed with a fellow presenter who defended the duchess.In a tweet as the programme aired on Wednesday, Morgan said he stood by his remarks and said he would fight for freedom of speech."On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't," he wrote.Buckingham Palace on Tuesday responded to the explosive claims.Queen Elizabeth II said Meghan and Harry, who quit royal life last year, and their son Archie would remain "much-loved family members".But she also said the accusations would be dealt with "privately".Asked to respond to Buckingham Palace's statement, a spokesman for Meghan and Harry said they would not be commenting any further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-filed-formal-complaint-about-uk-tv-host-piers-morgan-comments-101615385755206.html

"I don't know, I haven't seen it. Isn't it something the prime minister should know first?"In the live briefing, Prayuth then left the podium, grabbed a small bottle of sanitiser, casually walked over to the journalists and sprayed each of them while holding a surgical mask in front of his face.Prayuth, a former military coup leader, is known for his casual, at times comical, remarks to media but he often lashes out at reporters.He was later filmed speaking with the same group of journalists and looking increasingly vexed, talking inaudibly while spraying them with broad sweeps of his hand before walking off again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irked-thai-pm-sprays-hand-sanitiser-on-reporters-to-duck-tricky-questions-101615384985995.html
10-03-2021||World||FBI releases new video of bombs left at RNC, DNC offices before Capitol riot||The FBI has released new video showing someone placing two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night before the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol.The explosive devices were placed outside the two buildings between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5 and were located by law enforcement the next day.US Capitol Police and agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were called to the Republican National Committee’s office around 12:45 p.m. on Jan. 6. About 30 minutes later, as the agents and bomb technicians were still investigating at the RNC, another call came in for a similar explosive device found at the Democratic National Committee headquarters nearby. The bombs were rendered safe, and no one was hurt.The video, released Tuesday, shows a person in a gray hooded sweatshirt, a face mask and gloves appearing to place one of the explosives under a bench outside the DNC and separately shows the person walking in an alley near RNC before the bomb was placed there. The person also wore black and light grey Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers with a yellow logo.It is unclear whether the bombs were related to planning for the insurrection — when thousands of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win — or whether they were unrelated to the deadly riot. Both buildings are within a few blocks of the Capitol.The pipe bomb suspect carried the explosives in a backpack, according to Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington office. The bombs were made of threaded galvanized pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder, he said.Federal agents hope the new video will spark additional tips to help identify the person. A $100,000 reward is being offered in the case.“We are asking for you to come forward and speak to us about any odd or out-of-character behaviors,” D’Antuono said in a video statement released by the FBI.The placement of the pipe bombs has been particularly concerning for law enforcement as officials continue to secure the Capitol and the number of threats against lawmakers remains high. For weeks, investigators have been worried about the potential for attacks on soft targets in the nation’s capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-releases-new-video-of-bombs-left-at-rnc-dnc-offices-before-capitol-riot-101615383162026.html
10-03-2021||World||Malaysian court rules non-Muslims can use 'Allah' ending a 35-year old govt ban||A Malaysian court ruled Wednesday that non-Muslims can use the word “Allah” to refer to God, in a major decision in a divisive issue for religious freedom in the Muslim-majority country.The High Court decision squashed a 35-year-old government ban on the usage of Allah and three other Arabic words by Christian publications, deeming the ban unconstitutional, said the plaintiff's lawyer, Annou Xavier.The government has previously said Allah should be reserved exclusively for Muslims to avoid confusion that could lead them to convert to other religions, a stance that is unique to Malaysia and hasn't been an issue in other Muslim-majority nations with sizeable Christian minorities.Christian leaders in Malaysia say the ban is unreasonable because Christians who speak the Malay language have long used Allah, a Malay word derived from Arabic, in their Bibles, prayers and songs.The high court ruling appeared to contradict an earlier decision by the country’s Federal Court in 2014 that upheld the government ban following a legal challenge by the Roman Catholic Church, which had used the word Allah in its Malay-language newsletter.“The court has now said the word Allah can be used by all Malaysians,” Xavier said. “Today’s decision entrenches the fundamental freedom of religious rights for non-Muslims in Malaysia" enshrined in the constitution, he added.Muslims account for about two-thirds of Malaysia's 32 million people, with large ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities. Christians comprise about 10% of the population.Most Christians in Malaysia worship in English, Tamil or various Chinese dialects, and refer to God in those languages, but some Malay-speaking people on the island of Borneo have no other word for God but Allah.Three other words — “kaabah" or Islam's holiest shrine in Mecca, “baitullah" or house of God, and “solat" or prayer, were also banned in the 1986 government directive.Government counsel Shamsul Bolhassan was quoted by The Star newspaper as saying that the four words can be used in Christian materials according to the court's ruling, as long as there is a disclaimer saying it is intended for Christians only and a symbol of a cross is displayed.The ruling was a result of a long legal challenge by a Christian woman whose religious materials containing the word Allah were seized by authorities at the airport when she returned home from Indonesia in 2008.The controversy over the usage of Allah has provoked violence in Malaysia. Anger over a lower court ruling against the government ban in 2009 led to a string of arson attacks and vandalism at churches and other places of worship. That ruling was subsequently overturned by higher courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-court-rules-non-muslims-can-use-allah-ending-a-35-year-old-govt-ban-101615383324419.html
10-03-2021||World||US narrows in on organized extremists in Capitol siege probe||As members of the Oath Keepers paramilitary group shouldered their way through the mob and up the steps to the U.S. Capitol, their plans for Jan. 6 were clear, authorities say. “Arrest this assembly, we have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud,” someone commanded over an encrypted messaging app some extremists used to communicate during the siege.A little while earlier, Proud Boys carrying two-way radios and wearing earpieces spread out and tried to blend in with the crowd as they invaded the Capitol led by a man assigned “war powers” to oversee the group’s attack, prosecutors say.These two extremist groups that traveled to Washington along with thousands of other Trump supporters weren’t whipped into an impulsive frenzy by President Donald Trump that day, officials say. They’d been laying attack plans. And their internal communications and other evidence emerging in court papers and in hearings show how authorities are trying to build a case that small cells hidden within the masses mounted an organized, military-style assault on the heart of American democracy.“This was not simply a march. This was an incredible attack on our institutions of government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason McCullough said during a recent hearing.The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers make up a fraction of the more than 300 Trump supporters charged so far in the siege that led to Trump’s second impeachment and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer. But several of their leaders, members and associates have become the central targets of the Justice Department’s sprawling investigation.It could mean more serious criminal charges for some rioters. On the other hand, mounting evidence of advance planning could also fuel Trump's and his supporters’ claims that the Republican former president did not incite the riot and therefore should not be liable for it.Defense attorneys have accused prosecutors of distorting their clients’ words and actions to falsely portray the attack as a premeditated, orchestrated insurrection instead of a spontaneous outpouring of election-fueled rage to stop Congress’ certification of Trump’s defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.And prosecutors’ case against a man described as a leader in the Proud Boys’ attack took a hit last week when a judge ordered him released while he awaits trial, calling some of the evidence against him “weak to say the least.”The Oath Keepers began readying for violence as early as November, authorities say. Communications show the group discussing logistics, weapons and training, including “2 days of wargames.”“I need you fighting fit” by the inauguration, one Ohio member, Jessica Watkins, told a recruit in November, according to court documents. “If Biden becomes president our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights,” she said in another message later that month.As the mob swarmed the Capitol, Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, was communicating with some of the alleged rioters.“All I see Trump doing is complaining. I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into their own hands. They’ve had enough,” he said in a Signal message to a group around 1:40 p.m., authorities say. A little later, Rhodes, who has not been charged in the attack, instructed the group to “come to South Side of Capitol on steps.”Around 2:40 p.m., members of a military-style “stack” who moved up Capitol stairs in a line entered the building through a door on the east side, authorities say. Lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence had been evacuated from the House and Senate chambers just about 20 minutes earlier.“We are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing grenades, they are fricking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here,” Watkins declared over a channel called Stop the Steal J6 on the walkie-talkie app Zello, prosecutors say.The Proud Boys met at the Washington Monument and were already at the Capitol before Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House. Listening to the president’s speech wasn’t part of their plan, prosecutors say.Ethan Nordean led the way with a bullhorn while they wore headgear marked with orange tape. Dominic Pezzola appeared to have an earpiece in his right ear. Joseph Biggs had what looked like a walkie-talkie device on his chest.Nordean was spotted having a brief exchange near the Capitol with Robert Gieswein, a bat-wielding Colorado man. Proud Boys planning for Jan. 6 had discussed using non-members, or “normies,” like Gieswein to “burn that city to ash” and “smash some pigs to dust,” prosecutors said.Nine people linked to the Oath Keepers have been indicted on charges that they planned and coordinated with one another in the siege. At least 11 leaders, members or associates of the Proud Boys charged in the riots are accused by the Justice Department of participating in a coordinated attack.Several from both groups remain in federal custody while awaiting trial.In testimony to Congress, the acting Capitol Police chief said officers had worked to intercept “the radio frequency used by some demonstration groups and monitoring the communications of those groups,” though it's unclear if those groups included the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers.Their defense attorneys claim prosecutors have painted a misleading account of the day’s events based on shaky evidence. Other lawyers for those charged with storming the Capitol have tried to pin the blame on Trump for inciting the rioters.Nordean’s lawyers said prosecutors haven’t presented any evidence that he used encrypted communications to lead a group’s attack on the Capitol.“The government has made repeated claims about Ethan’s activities and then backed away from them without providing any support,” said one of his attorneys, Nicholas Smith.___Richer reported from Boston and Kunzelman reported from College Park, Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-narrows-in-on-organized-extremists-in-capitol-siege-probe-101615376056348.html
10-03-2021||World||Post-Brexit tensions: UK says EU damaged vaccine programme, affects Britons||The UK accused senior European Union politicians of damaging its vaccination program by making “misleading” statements that cast doubt on the AstraZeneca shot, in an escalation of post-Brexit tensions between the two sides.Cabinet minister Grant Shapps said fewer British people had taken up the offer of shots in the UK after EU figures questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, a clear reference to remarks from French President Emmanuel Macron, among others.Shapps’s intervention risks stoking an already heated row over vaccine nationalism and further souring the atmosphere between the EU and its former member state, who are in a separate dispute over Brexit trade rules that could end up in legal action.The latest chapter in the increasingly acrimonious new relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday, when the British government reacted with dismay to comments from European Council President Charles Michel, who accused London of putting an outright ban on exports of coronavirus vaccines.The British side fiercely denied this, with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab writing a letter of protest to Michel and summoning a senior EU diplomat in London for an urgent meeting.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson weighed into the row, saying he wanted to “correct” Michel.“Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single vaccine or vaccine component,” he said in his regular weekly appearance in the UK Parliament. “We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms.”European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer refused to comment directly on Michel’s remarks when asked by reporters in Brussels.“We know that different countries have got different measures in place -- this doesn’t concern vaccines, as far as we understand, coming from the UK,” he said. “But we know as well that we, the EU, are a very, very active exporter of vaccines and this is not necessarily the case of all our partners.”During broadcast interviews on Wednesday morning, Shapps, the transport minister, said he presumed Michel had “just a mistake” or didn’t have the right information.“Unfortunately, there’s been a number of different statements made out of Europe, including misleading information on the effectiveness of some of these vaccines, which eventually have been unwound, but not until they’ve done damage to the number of people, the uptake on some of the vaccines, which I think is all very unfortunate,” Shapps told Times Radio.“We just need to get on and vaccinate people,” Shapps said. “We want the rest of the world to vaccinate as well.”At the end of January, President Emmanuel Macron raised doubts about the Astra vaccine’s benefits for the elderly, saying it was “almost ineffective” for those 65 and older. France subsequently endorsed the AstraZeneca vaccine for elderly people to use.In a newsletter published Tuesday, Michel said he was “shocked” by accusations of “vaccine nationalism” against the EU. “The facts do not lie,” he wrote. “The UK and the U.S. have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory.”‘Completely false’Raab hit back in a letter to Michel, saying the claim is “completely false,” according to a person familiar with the matter. “The UK government has not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components,” Raab wrote.Michel appeared to row back later Tuesday, writing on Twitter that he was “glad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports.”The spat marks an escalation in tensions between the two sides since Britain completed its departure from the bloc in December.Johnson is facing a legal challenge from the bloc after unilaterally announcing he will not introduce export documents on food crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland from April 1, as previously agreed.European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic outlined details of the action to EU ambassadors meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. Measures could include imposing penalties on the UK that include trade tariffs, an EU official said.Vaccines have become a flashpoint in the relationship as the EU’s program -- dogged by delays -- has struggled to keep pace with the British. About a third of the UK population has received a dose, compared with 6% in the EU, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.In January, the EU briefly threatened to control the flow of vaccines into Northern Ireland, and thus the UK, by using an emergency clause in the Brexit agreement. In doing so, the bloc reopened one of the most sensitive disputes in the entire divorce: how to avoid the return of full customs checks on the island of Ireland.On Monday, Johnson called the tensions “teething problems” which could be “ironed out” with “goodwill and imagination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/postbrexit-tensions-uk-says-eu-damaged-vaccine-programme-affects-britons-101615381591544.html
10-03-2021||World||Russia slows down Twitter, part of social media clampdown||Russian authorities said Wednesday they are slowing down the speed of uploading photos and videos to Twitter over its failure to remove banned content — part of growing efforts to clamp down on social media platforms that have played a major role in amplifying dissent.The state communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, said it began the slowdown after it said the platform failed to remove the content encouraging suicide among children and containing information about drugs and child pornography.The agency warned that if Twitter refuses to abide by Russian law it could be blocked entirely, but voiced hope that the platform would “take a constructive stance” and comply with the demand to remove the banned content. Vadim Subbotin, deputy chief of Roskomnadzor, said in televised remarks that Twitter is the only social platform that has “openly ignored the Russian authorities’ demand to remove the banned content.”Twitter’s user policies outline a host of banned behaviors, including prohibiting content that involves child sexual exploitation or material that promotes or encourages suicide or self harm. An email seeking comment on the Russian action was sent to Twitter.The action against Twitter comes as the authorities have criticized social media platforms that have been used to bring tens of thousands of people into the streets across Russia this year to demand the release of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The wave of demonstrations served as a major challenge to the Kremlin.Russian authorities have assailed the platforms for failing to remove calls for children to join opposition protests — which is against the law in Russia.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the government has “no desire to block anything,” but added that it was necessary to enforce compliance with the law.The move against Twitter is part of continuous efforts by the government to tighten control over social platforms.In 2014, the authorities adopted a law requiring online services to store the personal data of Russian users on servers in Russia and have since tried to make Facebook and Twitter to comply with it. Both companies have been repeatedly fined, first small amounts of around $50 and last year the equivalent of $63,000 each, for not complying.The government has stopped short of outright bans even though the law allows it, probably fearing that the move would elicit too much public outrage. Only the social network LinkedIn, which wasn’t very popular in Russia, has been banned by the authorities for the failure to store user data in Russia.As the Russian authorities moved Wednesday to slow down Twitter, some Russian government websites suffered outages and access problems. It's not clear if those are connected, and some experts suggested they could have been the result of unrelated cyberattacks.Russia's Ministry of Digital Development acknowledged that some government websites suffered outages, but charged that they were linked to equipment problems at communications provider Rostelecom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slows-down-twitter-part-of-social-media-clampdown-101615381777070.html
10-03-2021||World||'Ticket to recovery': Australia to offer subsidised flights to support tourism||Australia will subsidise 800,000 domestic flights, help its two main airlines and offer cheap loans to small tourism operators as part of A$1.2 billion ($921 million) package to revive the travel sector, Prime Minister Scott Morrison will say on Thursday.Tourism is one of Australia's biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion and employing about 5% of the country's workforce. But the sector was crippled when the country shut its international borders in March 2020 to curtail the spread of Covid-19 - leaving tens of thousands of people on the country's wage-subsidy scheme.Seeking to prop up the industry when the subsidy scheme ends this month, Morrison will pledge another stimulus package for the travel sector, according to extracts of an announcement seen by Reuters. Morrison will say Australia will subsidise the flights of 800,000 domestic flights between Apr. 1 and July 31 while its international borders remain closed. It will pay 50% of the cost of flying to 13 destinations, he will say. Airlines have agreed to provide additional flights to those places."This is our ticket to recovery - 800,000 half-price air fares to get Australians travelling," Morrison will say. The premier will also say that his government will provide financial support to Qantas and Virgin Airways between Apr. 1 and Oct. 31 - when international flights are expected to resume.Morrison did not disclose the scale of the funds, which will be used to keep 8,600 workers employed, planes in "flight-ready condition" and international passenger services at a pre-pandemic levels.Australia will also offer loans of up to A$5 million to tourism businesses such as tour companies, with two-year repayment holidays, the prime minister will say."We need Australians to do their patriotic duty and book a holiday this year," trade minister Dan Tehan will say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ticket-to-recovery-australia-to-offer-subsidised-flights-to-support-tourism-101615376666324.html

10-03-2021||World||Iranian oil shipments clogs up Chinese ports despite US sanctions||China is gorging Iranian oil even as other nations wait for US President Joe Biden to remove sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Crude shipments from Iran to the province of Shandong, home to a quarter of China’s refining capacity, have surged so much this month they’re causing congestion at ports and filling up storage tanks, according to traders and analysts.Chinese imports of Iranian crude will hit 856,000 barrels a day in March, the most in almost two years and up 129% from last month, said Kevin Wright, a Singapore-based analyst with Kpler. His figures take into account oil that’s undergone ship-to-ship transfers in the Middle East or in waters off Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia to obscure their origin.Most refiners and traders are reluctant to purchase Iranian crude for fear of repercussions that can include being cut off from the American banking system and having cargoes seized by the US. Tehran has used aggressive marketing as it tries to increase export income and boost an economy reeling from the sanctions.The waiting time for tankers looking to offload in Shandong was estimated at 12 days last week, compared with eight the week before, according to Kpler. Oil inventory levels at ports in the province climbed to a one-year high last month, data from SCI99 showed.Big discountIranian cargoes are heavily discounted due to the sanctions putting off most buyers around the world. In China, their price is usually between $3 and $5 barrel below benchmark Brent crude, according to traders, who say it’s prompting local companies to stock up as global prices rise.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the US out of a nuclear accord with Iran in mid-2018 and tightened sanctions. Iran’s oil exports have cratered since them from around 2.5 million barrels a day. It still produces roughly 2 million barrels a day, but most of those are used domestically.Frictions have remained high since Biden came to power in January. Still, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week said his country was ready to revert to full or partial compliance with the nuclear deal if the US did the same. His government has repeatedly said the Americans should lift the sanctions before the two sides start talks.Oil surgeBrent prices have leapt since November to more than $65 a barrel as major economies roll-out coronavirus vaccines. They briefly topped $71 a barrel this week after a drone and missile attack on Saudi Arabia’s largest oil export terminal, which the kingdom blamed on Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebel group.The rise in prices has caused importers such as India to call on the OPEC+ cartel of exporters to increase production.In China, fuel consumption has already recovered to pre-pandemic levels. It’s continuing to grow on the back of strong factory activity and infrastructure building that left the capital, Beijing, blanketed in smog this week.China’s imports of crude oil climbed to an average of 11.1 million barrels a day in January and February, up more than 20% from December, according to Bloomberg calculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-oil-shipments-clogs-up-chinese-ports-despite-us-sanctions-101615380193438.html
10-03-2021||World||Elon Musk makes a new record adds $25 billion in one day, closes gap with Bezos||Elon Musk just hit a new milestone: He made a record $25 billion in one day.Tesla Inc.’s 20% jump on Tuesday -- its biggest in more than a year -- pushed the billionaire founder’s fortune to $174 billion, closing the gap with Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The top 10 largest wealth gainers, all from the tech industry, added $54 billion combined.After three weeks of declines that sent the Nasdaq 100 Index down 11% from a peak, US tech shares staged a stellar rally on Tuesday that lifted almost all of the gauge’s members. The surge in Bezos’s Amazon.com Inc. helped him gain $6 billion, taking his net worth to $180 billion, while Colin Huang of Chinese online shopping platform Pinduoduo Inc. added almost as much.Musk and Bezos have been battling for the top spot on the Bloomberg wealth index since the Tesla founder took over in January, the month his fortune hit $210 billion. Since then, Bezos regained the title of world’s richest as shares of the electric-car maker sank as much as 36%. Now the two tycoons are less than $6 billion apart.On Tuesday, Tesla also benefited from an upgrade by New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, who recommended buying the stock, and a rally in Bitcoin.The gains contrast with the remarkable fall of China’s bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan, who in December unseated India’s Mukesh Ambani as Asia’s richest person and surpassed Warren Buffett in January, becoming the sixth-wealthiest in the world. Zhong is now the biggest loser of the year and has dropped off the list of the top 15 on the Bloomberg ranking. Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma is back to being China’s richest, with a fortune of almost $64 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-makes-a-new-record-adds-25-billion-in-one-day-101615379331736.html
10-03-2021||World||US Covid-19 drive fails to reach outs to Black, Hispanic Americans||It’s a life-threatening problem that’s been long predicted - but that few in the government or private sectors have yet done much to solve. Now the consequences are hitting some of America’s most vulnerable communities.America’s Covid-19 vaccine drive is failing to reach Black and Hispanic communities, despite pervasive warnings about their lack of healthcare access and heightened vaccine hesitancy, rooted in distrust of the government and historical episodes of medical exploitation.The issue has been highlighted by polls and government focus groups since last summer. But there’s been no comprehensive national effort to address the problem from the federal government or major philanthropists, leaving a patchwork of underfunded local activists struggling to fill the void, according to Reuters interviews with fifteen nonprofits and philanthropic groups.The results of inaction are stark: While US communities of color are at higher risk for severe or fatal Covid-19 infections, white people have been vaccinated at twice the rate of Blacks and two-and-a-half times the rate of Hispanics, according to a March 1 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation.“We need to get out there and start connecting with people before it’s too late,” said Betsy MacLean, who runs the urban planning nonprofit Hester Street.Grassroots organizers in Black and Hispanic communities have struggled to secure private or public funding for outreach efforts to promote vaccination. Advocates focused on the issue say philanthropists are juggling competing priorities and tend to view such crisis response as largely the government’s job. The federal government, under the new administration of Democratic President Joe Biden, is only now getting started on serious efforts to promote vaccination in minority communities.What’s needed, the advocates say, is a nationally coordinated marketing campaign, combined with critical efforts at personal outreach by respected local influencers in communities of color. An effective effort, they said, could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Some community groups are seeking to revive a nationwide network of nonprofits that helped boost response rates to the 2020 Census in minority communities, saying a similar strategy could work to promote vaccination.The Biden administration announced Monday that it would spend $250 million to “encourage Covid-19 safety and vaccination among underserved populations,” which could include minority communities but also other vulnerable groups, such as rural residents. Localities will have to apply for that money; grants would finance 30 urban projects and 43 rural projects, according to an administration news release.The administration also plans to use money from its proposed Covid-19 stimulus package to promote vaccination, in minority communities and others, but the specifics of that effort remain unclear. The White House plans to partner with local officials and nonprofits to overcome government distrust, said Dr. Cameron Webb, the White House’s senior policy adviser for Covid-19 equity.Roots of distrustA Reuters/Ipsos poll in December showed Black people, in particular, were far more likely to fear vaccination than white people. Their skepticism stems in part from historical traumas such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, when government researchers left hundreds of Black men untreated for the disease to study its effects. Many Hispanic communities are fearful of interacting with the government in an era of widespread anti-immigration sentiment. Both communities have less access to medical care than white populations.Some nonprofits are pushing for funding to reactivate the network that successfully encouraged people in minority communities to fill out the 2020 Census - another federal initiative dogged by fear and distrust.In that effort, hundreds of grassroots groups knocked on doors and held information sessions to dispel fears. They recruited pastors, school teachers and other trusted locals to push the message. A similar model could work for vaccines, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy expert who ran a census outreach effort in southern California.“Just like you had census hesitancy and equity issues, you have vaccine hesitancy and equity issues,” said Ramakrishnan, who now leads a nonprofit devoted to leveraging census infrastructure for future initiatives, including vaccines.The White House acknowledged the parallels between vaccine and census outreach, but stopped short of committing to finance similar NGO-led efforts to boost vaccine trust.“We’re talking about how we can dovetail from the work that was done on the census, not just to learn from it, but also tap into the same human resources and networks,” Webb said.Rosyo Ramirez, deputy public health director for the heavily Hispanic Imperial County, California, said local nonprofit groups could play a key role in raising vaccination rates because they have deep ties in minority communities. “People need to feel comfortable with who the message is coming from,” Ramirez said.Ramakrishnan has held Zoom meetings with nonprofits and philanthropic groups, pitching them on a centralized campaign, modeled on the census efforts. But reactivating that network for vaccine education is “not as simple as snapping your fingers,” said Megan Thomas, interim president of the San Diego-based funders’ coalition Catalyst.The census effort’s financiers had years to plan and fine-tune the census push, whereas the pandemic came as an unexpected and fast-moving crisis - one that Thomas said the government might be better equipped to handle.Hester Street’s MacLean reached out in February to the New York Community Trust, a key donor to her work on census outreach, urging it to revive “the amazing social infrastructure we all built out for the Census for vaccines!”Patricia Swann, who approved MacLean’s census grant, said she was “agnostic” on the new request - not because she doesn’t support the work, but because she is not in charge of the Trust’s public health initiatives. She said she planned to pass MacLean’s request on to a colleague in another department.“The foundation world, unfortunately, is very siloed,” Swann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-drive-fails-to-reach-outs-to-black-hispanic-americans-101615378244695.html
10-03-2021||World||European parliament to debate on declaring 27 member bloc an LGBT 'freedom zone'||The European Parliament is scheduled to debate a resolution on Wednesday that would declare the entire 27-member European Union to be a “freedom zone” for LGBT people.The resolution comes largely in reaction to developments over the past two years in Poland, where many local communities have adopted largely symbolic resolutions declaring themselves to be free of what Polish conservative authorities have been calling “LGBT ideology.”The towns say they are only seeking to defend their traditional Catholic values, but LGBT rights activists say they are discriminatory and make gays and lesbians feel unwelcome. The areas have come to be colloquially known as “LGBT-free zones.”But the resolution also stresses that it wants to address problems across the bloc faced by gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender, intersex and queer people.The resolution says the fundamental rights of LGBT people have been “severely hindered” recently in Hungary due to a de facto ban on legal gender recognition for trans and intersex people. It cites problems in Latvia, and notes that only two member states — Malta and Germany — have banned “conversion therapy,” a controversial and potentially harmful attempt to change a person's sexual orientation.The resolution is the work of the a cross-party group in the European Parliament, the LGBTI Intergroup, which says it has the support to pass the largely symbolic resolution.Liesje Schreinemacher, the vice chair of the group and a Dutch lawmaker with Renew Europe, a liberal political group, said the resolution is timed to roughly mark the second anniversary of the first Polish community, Swidnik County, passing an anti-LGBT resolution.Also read: Sydney's LGBTQI Mardi Gras goes ahead, with Covid restrictionsShe also referred to problems elsewhere, including suspicious that a man murdered in Belgium recently was the victim of a homophobic attack.“We wanted to send a strong signal in Poland that we consider all of Europe to be an LGBTI freedom zone,” she told The Associated Press. “But every European country has work to do.”Dozens of local governments across conservative eastern and southern Poland began in March 2019 to pass either resolutions declaring themselves to be free from “LGBT ideology” or family charters defending traditional families in the mostly Catholic nations.They have proven hugely costly to Poland's international image, and to the finances of local communities. The EU and Norway — a non-EU member that funds some development in EU nations — have cut off funds to policies they view as discriminatory.Bart Staszewski, a Polish activist who created an art project on the “LGBT zones” that drew the ire of the government and conservatives, said he sees the EU resolution as “important and necessary.”But he also notes that local governments stopped passing such resolutions months ago and some communities have already withdrawn theirs. Others have passed resolutions declaring support for all types of familes.“There is some very good change,” Staszewski said. “I see this as a very good sign for the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-parliament-to-debate-on-declaring-27-member-bloc-an-lgbt-freedom-zone-101615372969796.html
10-03-2021||World||UN urges Houthis to give African migrants access to Yemeni capital||The UN migration agency has urged rebels who control the Yemeni capital Sanaa to provide access to dozens of African migrants who were seriously injured in a weekend hostel fire.The Sunday blaze at an overcrowded holding facility in Sanaa killed an unconfirmed number of migrants and injured more than 170, over half of them seriously, the International Organization for Migration said."As many migrants are in a critical condition, meeting their health needs must be an urgent priority," IOM Middle East and North Africa director Carmela Godeau said in a statement Tuesday."We are facing challenges accessing the injured due to an increased security presence in the hospitals," she said."Humanitarians and health workers must be given access to support the treatment of those affected by the fire."There has still been no word from the Huthi rebel authorities on what caused Sunday's fire or how many people it killed.Also read: 16 million Yemenis going hungry, 5 million on the brink of famine: UN aid chiefThe IOM said more than 350 migrants, most of them from Ethiopia, were in a hangar area where the fire broke out."While the cause of the fire is still unconfirmed, its impact is clearly horrific," said Godeau.Despite more than six years of devastating conflict in Yemen that have created what the UN describes as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, the impoverished country is still a magnet for migrants from the nearby Horn to Africa seeking a better life in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.Restrictions on movement imposed during the coronavirus pandemic have led to a reduction in migrant arrivals from more than 138,000 in 2019 to just over 37,500 in 2020.But they have also led to "thousands of migrants becoming stranded with little access to basic services or protection," the IOM said.It said it was working with Ethiopian authorities to restart a voluntary repatriation programme for stranded migrants.More than 6,000 have registered to return home from Yemen's government-held second city Aden, of whom a first 1,100 are are expected to leave in the coming weeks, the IOM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-houthis-to-give-african-migrants-access-to-yemeni-capital-101615367963360.html

As its border disputes with China have not been settled, anti-China voices in India still remain a force. The Modi administration intends to divert attention from its domestic contradictions by underlining China’s threat,” Yuan claimed in the opinion piece.Media reports from New Delhi on US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s likely visit to India in mid-March also has been closely followed in China.Yang Xiyu from the China Institute of International Studies told state media that Washington and New Delhi always have their own interests in their minds.“The US wants to seize India as weight to retake its hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region and counter China; and India plans to showcase its cooperation with the US to bluff China regarding its influence,” Yang added.State councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had called it the “so-called Indo-Pacific new Nato”.Wang was quoted in a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry as saying that the “Indo-Pacific strategy” proposed by the US is in essence aimed at building a so-called Indo-Pacific “new Nato” underpinned by the quadrilateral mechanism involving the United States, Japan, India and Australia.“The strategy is to trumpet the old-fashioned Cold War mentality to stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition, in a bid to maintain the dominance and hegemonic system of the United States,” Wang was quoted as saying during a visit to Malaysia last October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uphold-peace-not-the-opposite-china-tells-quad-members-ahead-of-summit-101615378228915.html
10-03-2021||World||Myanmar police raids railway workers' homes in Mingalar Taung Nyunt area||Myanmar security forces early Wednesday raided a neighbourhood in the country's largest city that is home to state railway workers who have gone on strike to protest last month's military coup.Police sealed off the Mingalar Taung Nyunt neighbourhood in Yangon where the Ma Hlwa Kone train station and housing for railway workers are located. Photos and video on social media showed officers blocking streets and what was said to be people escaping. At least three arrests were reported but it was not immediately possible to independently confirm that.The raid comes just days after several Myanmar unions, including the Myanmar Railway Worker's Union Federation, issued a joint call for a nationwide work stoppage. The statement said the strike would be part of a broader effort for “the full, extended shutdown of the Myanmar economy.”Myanmar has been roiled by protests and other acts of civil disobedience since the Feb. 1 coup that toppled elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi's government just as it was to start its second term. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.Also read: Google to review advertisements for Myanmar military-backed telecoms firmSecurity forces have responded with mass arrests and at times lethal force. At least 60 protesters have been killed since the military takeover, according to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.Authorities have also moved to shut down independent reporting on the situation, both through arrests of journalists the closure of media outlets.Despite the increasingly violent tactics of security forces, protests continued Wednesday in cities and towns across the country, including Yangon, Mandalay, Monywa, Dawei and Myitkyina.State railway workers were among the earliest organized supporters of the protest movement and their strike began soon after the coup.Police last month made an effort at intimidating railway workers in Mandalay, the country's second-biggest city, by roaming through their housing area one night, shouting and randomly firing guns.The junta now in control of the country, formally called the State Administration Council, indirectly acknowledged the effectiveness of the rail strike.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper in a Tuesday report on a junta meeting, cited officials as saying that rail transport between Yangon-Mandalay would resume “in the near future.” It also acknowledged that the banking sector has been affected by the protest movement.The dawn raid on the railway workers followed another night of intimidation by police marching through residential areas in several cities after an 8 p.m. curfew, firing guns and stun grenades, and staging selective raids to arrest people.There were more reports Tuesday of protesters dying in custody after being arrested. The latest was a school principal who died of unknown causes after being taken into custody by security forces, according to media reports and an activist who knew him.Previously, an activist with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party died in custody. Witnesses said his body had wounds consistent with torture, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 1,930 people have been arrested in connection with the coup. Dozens of journalists have been arrested, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, who has been charged under a public order law that carries a penalty of up to three years in prison.Authorities continued their assault on the media on Tuesday, raiding the offices of Kamayut Media and detaining its co-founder and editor-in-chief. The military also raided the offices of Mizzima, an online news service. No one was arrested in the latter raid, though equipment was vandalized and property was taken away.The military government on Monday announced that the licenses of five local media outlets — Mizzima, DVB, Khit Thit Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News — had been canceled. All five had been offering extensive coverage of the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-police-raids-railway-workers-homes-in-mingalar-taung-nyunt-area-101615362925555.html
10-03-2021||World||US crude oil production slips for 3rd session before inventories: EIA||Oil fell for a third straight session on Wednesday as investors took profits while looking ahead to US inventories data due later in the day for pointers on where prices will head next.Brent crude for May dropped 63 cents, or 0.9%, to $66.89 a barrel by 0721 GMT, after earlier hitting an intraday low of $66.50, while US West Texas Intermediate crude for April was at $63.47 a barrel, down 54 cents, or 0.8%.Prices gained support last week from the OPEC+ decision to largely maintain production cuts in April. They then initially jumped on Monday, with Brent rising above $70 a barrel, after attacks by Yemeni Houthis on Saudi's oil heartland, before settling back as the alarm subsided."It's a realisation that there was no impact on supply from the attack," Virendra Chauhan, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects said.A combination of factors including top importers China and India drawing crude from storage at current high prices and expectations of a return in Iranian supplies have also cooled prices, he added.In the United States, crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to trading sources, citing data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Analysts had expected a build of about 800,000 barrels in a Reuters' poll.Official figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) are expected Wednesday at 10:30 am ET.Meanwhile, higher prices are expected to bring more US crude supplies back online.Also read: Disruption in oil supply from Saudi Arabia causes US oil prices to fallUS crude production is still expected to fall by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.15 million bpd, the EIA said on Tuesday, but that's a smaller decline than its previous monthly forecast for a 290,000-bpd drop.The OPEC+ grouping - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers - may become the victim of its own success, analysts at EFG bank said, as higher prices resulting from supply restraint could incentivise US oil production."The current WTI oil price is well above the level needed to incentivise a substantial increase in US production, which according to surveys by the Dallas Fed and the Kansas City Fed stands at around $56 per barrel," EFG said."The longer it remains above this threshold, the greater the incentive for US and other non-OPEC+ producers to increase production."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-crude-oil-production-slips-for-3rd-session-before-inventories-eia-101615362801584.html

But it has taken the successful development and deployment of vaccines to let the government plot a definitive route back to normality."Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project, Test and Trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic," chair of the committee, opposition Labour party lawmaker Meg Hillier, said."The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice."The Public Accounts Committee said that test and trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.The system has been allocated 37 billion pounds in total to cover two years, a budget which includes the cost of testing people with symptoms and regular testing in schools, care homes and some work places.Dido Harding, who runs the system, said that the team had carried out over 83 million coronavirus tests, more than any other comparable European country, and that testing still had a role to play in lifting lockdown."Test and trace is essential in our fight against Covid-19 and regular testing is a vital tool to stop transmission as we cautiously ease restrictions," she said, adding that contact tracing made "a real impact in breaking chains of transmission".The committee's report said that test and trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. Consultants working on the system cost 1,000 pounds a day.Last year, scientific advisers said test and trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn.British minister Grant Shapps said on Wednesday the system had been set up from scratch, it was playing a critical role in helping stop the spread of new variants and the pandemic would have been "one heck of a lot worse" without it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-32-bn-covid-test-and-trace-not-making-a-difference-overly-reliant-on-contractors-and-consultants-lawmakers-say-101615377404021.html
10-03-2021||World||China accuses US admiral of 'hyping up' threat of Taiwan invasion||China on Wednesday accused a top US commander of attempting to "hype up" the threat of an invasion of Taiwan to inflate Washington's defence spend and justify its own military chicanery in Asia.The US' top military officer in Asia-Pacific, Admiral Philip Davidson, on Tuesday said China could invade Taiwan within the next six years, as Beijing accelerates its moves to supplant American military power in Asia.Democratic and self-ruled Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by authoritarian China, whose leaders view the island as part of their territory and which they have vowed to one day take back."I worry that they're (China) accelerating their ambitions to supplant the United States and our leadership role in the rules-based international order ... by 2050," Davidson said."Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before that. And I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, in the next six years," he told a US Senate committee.Taiwan split from China at the end of a civil war in 1949 and exists under the constant threat of invasion by the mainland.Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but remains the island's most important unofficial ally and military backer.Beijing was swift to bat away the admiral's comments."Some US people continue to use the Taiwan issue to hype up China's military threat," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing."But in essence this is the US searching for a pretext to increase its military spending, expand its forces and interfere in regional affairs."Donald Trump embraced warmer ties with Taiwan as he feuded with China on issues such as trade and national security.President Joe Biden's administration has offered Taiwan cause for optimism for continued support aside from the State Department saying in January that US commitment to the island was "rock-solid".Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the US was formally invited to Biden's inauguration, an unprecedented move since 1979.China also has made expansive territorial claims in the resource-rich South China Sea and even threatens the American island of Guam, Davidson stressed."Guam is a target today," he warned, recalling that the Chinese military released a video simulating an attack on an island base strongly resembling US facilities in Diego Garcia and Guam.He called on lawmakers to approve the installation on Guam of an Aegis Ashore anti-missile battery, capable of intercepting the most powerful Chinese missiles.Guam "needs to be defended and it needs to be prepared for the threats that will come in the future," Davidson said.In addition to other Aegis missile defence systems destined for Australia and Japan, Davidson called on lawmakers to budget for offensive armaments "to let China know that the costs of what they seek to do are too high."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-admiral-of-hyping-up-threat-of-taiwan-invasion-101615367228120.html

A part of SBG1 is destroyed. Firefighters are protecting SBG3. No impact SBG4," founder and chairman Octave Klaba said on Twitter, referring to different units housing servers."We don't have access to the site. That is why SBG1, SBG3, SBG4 won’t be restarted today," he added.The Strasbourg site is one of OVHcloud's 17 data centres in France, out of 32 globally.#Strasbourg Un bâtiment de stockage de serveurs informatiques @OVHcloud_FR ravagé par un incendie #DNAinfos https://t.co/EuELb9Nux3 pic.twitter.com/MKlXDInhWPThe fire risked disruption for some customers.PR agency Caroline Charles Communication, whose clients include brands such as Thom Browne and Fila in the midst of Paris Fashion Week, said it had lost access to emails."We've not lost any data but for now we don't have emails," Caroline Charles told Reuters, adding the company's data was held on a server at another site.The French government holds national data that is open to the public with OVHcloud. A spokeswoman for an inter-ministerial office for digital services told Reuters that teams were investigating the scale of impact. Its website data.gouv.fr appeared to briefly go down.Founded by Klaba in 1999, OVHcloud is the biggest European-based cloud services provider, competing against U.S. giants Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud, which dominate the market.French politicians have championed OVHcloud as a possible alternative to U.S. cloud services providers, but it has so far lacked the scale and financial clout to dent their market share.Klaba said the fire had been extinguished and firefighters were spraying the site with water to cool it down."The goal is to create a plan to restart, at least SBG3/SBG4, maybe SBG1. To do so, we need to check the network rooms too," he said in an update shortly after 0900 GMT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-destroys-some-servers-at-french-data-company-ovhcloud-101615375357289.html
10-03-2021||World||Ukraine faces vaccine resistance from citizens in new struggle against Covid-19||After receiving its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine, Ukraine found itself in a new struggle against the pandemic — persuading its widely reluctant people to get the shot.Although infections are rising sharply, Ukrainians are becoming increasingly opposed to vaccination: an opinion poll released earlier this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of the country's people don't want to get vaccinated, up from 40% a month earlier. The nationwide poll of 1,207 had a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.The resistance appears to be rooted in longstanding suspicion of vaccines dating back to the Soviet era, amplified by politicians' allegations about low-quality vaccines, corruption scandals and misinformation spread through social media. Even more surprisingly, the reluctance still appears even among those highest at risk who administer life-saving drugs to others every day: medical workers.In the mining town of Selydove, 700 kilometres (420 miles) east of Kyiv, only 5% of the medical staff agreed to be vaccinated. Those declining included Olena Obyedko, a 26-year-old nurse who works in the hospital's intensive care ward for COVID-19 patients, where people die every week.“I decided not to get vaccinated. I doubt the quality of the vaccine. I’m afraid there will be side effects," she said.So few people chose to get the shots that the mobile brigade who came to Selydove to administer them ended up giving vaccinations to themselves in order not to let the vaccine go to waste.“Such a low number of vaccinated people is associated with low confidence in the vaccine that has entered Ukraine,” brigade head Olena Marchenko said of the AstraZeneca vaccine that was manufactured in India. “This is due to prejudice and information that is spread on social networks. People read a lot, they have a negative attitude towards the Indian vaccine.”Prominent politicians have fed that suspicion.Former President Petro Poroshenko said in parliament this month that he asked doctors in one region about why there was resistance to vaccination and was told: “Because they brought shit. And they brought it because of corruption and incompetence.”Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko added to the discontent by demanding that parliament pass a law to give government compensation to those who face vaccine side effects.Vaccine corruption scandals had started even before the first doses arrived in the country. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine reported that it began an investigation into a September deal to purchase 1.9 million doses of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine at 504 hryvna ($18) per dose. Its Chinese makers have not released full reports on its efficacy and one study in Brazil said it only has a 50% efficiency.“What these attacks lead to are consequences that will affect every Ukrainian," said Health Minister Maxim Stepanov. “We are talking about an attempt to disrupt the vaccination campaign in Ukraine.”Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccine — 500,000 AstraZeneca doses — in late February. Yet, only about 23,500 people have been vaccinated since then.In that same period, as many as 10,000 new infections a day have been recorded. Overall, the country of 41 million has recorded 1.4 million infections and more than 28,000 deaths.The health minister says only about 40% of medical workers treating coronavirus patients have agreed to receive the vaccine.Speaking in parliament, Oleksandr Kornienko, a leading member of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's Servant of the People faction, said medical facilities were forced to destroy many doses of the vaccine — which can only be stored for a few hours after a vial is opened — because the medical professionals who had been prescribed vaccinations did not show up.“Now they are forced to destroy the coveted vaccine because they fail to give it to people in time,” said Kornienko.Zelenskiy, who contracted the virus in November, tried to encourage vaccinations by publicly getting a shot himself.“The vaccine will allow us to live again without restrictions,” Zelensky said. “I believe that this vaccine is of high quality, it is one of the best in the world.”Yet his action seems to have had little effect.The country designated 14,000 doses of its first vaccine shipment for the military, especially those fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east. But only 1,030 troops have been vaccinated thus far.In the front-line town of Krasnohorivka, soldiers widely refused to vaccinate.“I have little faith in a pandemic, I don’t think it’s some kind of serious disease,” said Serhiy Kochuk, a 25-year-old soldier. “I am healthy, but the vaccine can provoke illness. Because of this vaccine, you can get sick.”The head of the Kyiv sociology institute, Volodymyr Paniotto, told The Associated Press that a recent decline in the popularity of Zelenskiy’s government has contributed to vaccine resistance.“The super-critical attitude of Ukrainians to the authorities was superimposed on the struggle of politicians and the information war, which led to a massive distrust in society,” he said.Ukrainians have been sceptical about any vaccinations since Soviet times. In 2019, the country had Europe’s largest measles outbreak due to widespread refusals to get a measles vaccine shot.“Over the past 20 years, Ukraine has been among the European countries most opposed to vaccination as such,” said Vadym Denysenko, an analyst at the Ukrainian Institute for the Future.The United Nations Development Program says the country is suffering an “info-demic” of misinformation about the vaccine and has called on the government to step up its fight.“Conspiracy theories, rumours and malicious disinformation can quickly go viral on social media, especially when there is a low level of public trust in state institutions," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-faces-vaccine-resistance-from-citizens-in-new-struggle-against-covid19-101615373018688.html

He said educational institutions in Islamabad, Peshawar and Muzaffarabad will also be closed.“All educational institutions will remain closed from March 15 to March 28 in specified cities and districts. Half of the students will keep attending classes in other districts,” Mahmood said.The minister said that all steps have to be taken while keeping in mind the nearly 50 million children that attend schools, colleges and universities.He said the situation in Sindh and Balochistan wad satisfactory and the policy of 50 per cent students attending will continue.Covid-19 first emerged in the country in February last year and hit a peak in mid-June. However, it started to decline in the following months but surged again in October 2020, prompting the government to issue a warning of a second wave.Fatalities and confirmed cases from the coronavirus have increased steadily since March 1, when Pakistan resumed regular classes at schools.Pakistan has reported 595,239 coronavirus cases, including 13,324 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pakistan-to-shut-down-educational-institutions-for-2-weeks-from-mar-15-101615367812009.html

UK scientists say it is about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant circulating coronavirus variants.In the UK study, published in the British Medical Journal on Wednesday, infection with the new variant led to 227 deaths in a sample of 54,906 Covid-19 patients, compared with 141 among the same number of patients infected with other variants."Coupled with its ability to spread rapidly, this makes B.1.1.7 a threat that should be taken seriously," said Robert Challen, a researcher at Exeter University who co-led the research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-variant-has-significantly-higher-death-rate-study-finds-101615372810400.html
10-03-2021||World||Sudan officials, Saudi crown prince talk Red Sea investments||Sudan’s prime minister and Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince met Wednesday to discuss Saudi investment opportunities in the Red Sea, the Sudanese government said, as the kingdom seeks to boost its influence across the strategic Horn of Africa.The high-level Sudanese delegation flew to Saudi Arabia this week for a two-day visit as the northeastern African nation struggles to revive its ailing economy and secure a transition to democratic rule. After years as a pariah under now-ousted autocrat Omar al-Bashir, Sudan has increasingly returned to the international fold, overhauling its economy to attract badly needed foreign investment.The meeting between Sudanese officials, including Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, “was friendly and establishes a new chapter" in the countries' ties, said the sparse Sudanese statement. It did not offer specifics on Saudi investment projects, but said talks focused on the “transformation” of the Red Sea into “a large development area to eradicate the roots of terrorism and poverty” and increase tourism.The Red Sea features heavily in Saudi Arabia’s so-called Vision 2030 to diversify its economy away from oil with business zones along the coast. The Saudi-led military coalition’s intervention in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-backed Houthis has sharpened the kingdom’s focus on wielding influence along the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Thousands of Sudanese troops have fought against the Houthis, a contentious deployment that aided the country's treasury.Sudan’s ruling Supreme Council, which is meant to steer the country toward democratic elections next year, is split between civilians and army generals. This week marks the first time since al-Bashir's overthrow that significant numbers of Sudan’s civilian leaders visited Saudi Arabia, which had cultivated close ties with al-Bashir and previously appeared to favor the country’s military strongmen over its pro-democracy movement.Following al-Bashir’s overthrow, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates pledged $3 billion in aid to Sudan’s military council, with half of the amount already delivered.Sudanese Finance Minister Gibril Ibrahim praised the “very successful” talks with Prince Mohammed, noting plans for the kingdom to increase investments in Sudanese infrastructure, including agriculture and livestock. Sudanese agricultural land remains a key interest for desert Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which import the majority of their food from abroad.Sudan’s economy has teetered on the brink in recent months, with inflation soaring past 300% in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-officials-saudi-crown-prince-talk-red-sea-investments-101615370720848.html

YouTube is owned by Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google. Justice for Myanmar, an advocacy group looking at the army's business interests, said on Wednesday it had found that Google and Rakuten-owned messaging app Viber were running new advertisements for Mytel, a Myanmar telecoms partially owned by the army, following a ban by Facebook.Mytel, Viber and Rakuten did not respond to requests for comment.Justice for Myanmar representative Yadanar Maung said while the group welcomed Google’s recent steps to disable some military-linked accounts on its platforms, it was "appalled" if Google and Viber profited by selling advertisements for "the Myanmar military business" Mytel.Reuters reviewed three Mytel advertisements published on Google and Viber over the last week, soon after Facebook announced it would block the Myanmar army from access to its platforms as well as advertising by all army-linked military entities.Vietnamese operator Viettel, which is partly owned by Vietnam's ministry of defence, is also a backer of Mytel.Viettel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook in 2020 removed more than a dozen user accounts and pages for "coordinated inauthentic behaviour", which it said were being used to covertly promote Mytel and disparage rivals.Documents published by Justice for Myanmar, whose website has been blocked by authorities in Myanmar, found that Mytel is under large control of the Myanmar military, for which it provides a significant source of income."The military's business interests help finance the brutal atrocities they are committing against the people of Myanmar," said Maung, who called on technology firms to ban all military businesses from its platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-review-advertisements-for-myanmar-military-backed-telecoms-firm-101615368259062.html

"We are always going to have the lowest fares in the market."Australia's international borders are largely closed, meaning domestic travel is the only option for most residents.Qantas does not expect widespread international travel to return until at least Oct. 31, in line with the country's Covid-19 vaccination programme.Jetstar has delayed the delivery of its first Airbus SE A321neoLRs, aimed at the international market, to 2022 or 2023, Evans said. Before the pandemic hit, it had expected the first of 18 of the planes to arrive in August 2020.Jetstar plans to resume using its Boeing Co 787s in the international market as soon as borders reopen, Evans said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qantas-airways-ltd-s-flying-90-of-pre-pandemic-domestic-schedule-jetstar-ceo-101615350610457.html

So this is a capacity that will come online later this year, and it will substantially increase our capacity, collectively," he said.Some of the additional vaccine capacity created in India would be used in vaccination efforts in Southeast Asian countries, the official added.The White House announced earlier on Tuesday that President Joe Biden will participate in an online Quad meeting on Friday, the first leader-level meeting of a group seen as part of efforts to balance China's growing military and economic power.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she expected a range of issues facing the global community to be discussed "from the threat of COVID, to economic cooperation and ... the climate crisis."India has urged the other Quad members to invest in its vaccine production capacity in an attempt to counter China's widening vaccine diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-nations-to-announce-financing-to-boost-india-s-vaccine-output-us-official-101615366958240.html

We have coordinated with all the stakeholders so that these people are protected," he said.He further said, "From the outset, we were very careful with considering the consequences if the virus spread in a big way.

Both the U.S. and Europe have sought to accelerate vaccine deliveries this year as new, more aggressive variants of the virus spread.“We have an order book of already 1.3 billion orders, which is already fixed,” Sahin said. “We are discussing additional doses -- hundreds of millions of doses as options -- with government organizations.”BioNTech shares rose as much as 1.3% early Wednesday in Frankfurt.The two companies have committed to make 2 billion doses of their two-shot vaccine this year. Pfizer promised to ship two-thirds of the U.S.’s 300 million-dose order by the end of May. In the European Union, the partners have promised to ship at least 500 million doses this year, with an option for an additional 100 million doses.Pfizer has projected about $15 billion in revenue this year from Covid vaccine sales, and CEO Albert Bourla said the price of the shot may increase.Mutant StrainsConcerns about mutated versions of the virus may also drive demand if new variants evolve with the ability to evade current inoculations. BioNTech is already discussing potential orders for boosters, Sahin said.BioNTech and Pfizer have begun laying the groundwork for a booster shot of their vaccine, which uses a new technology called messenger RNA. One trial, begun in February, is examining the safety and immune response of a third dose of the vaccine in people who took part in an early study of the shot last year. The partners have also said they’re planning a human test of a new vaccine that’s specific to a particularly problematic vaccine variant that emerged late last year in South Africa.“We now understand the evolution of the virus can result in new variants that come with new biological and medical features,” Sahin said. “The whole world was not prepared for this pandemic, and we now understand that this could happen again.”In lab studies using blood of people who’ve been inoculated, the existing form of the vaccine seems to be less effective against the South Africa strain than against other mutant versions of the coronavirus. While the vaccine still appears to offer some protection, the implications of the variants remain unclear.The companies will gain more data on the South Africa variant within six to eight weeks, Sahin said.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is cleared in more than 50 countries. Aside from the EU and the U.S., other major orders have come from Japan, Canada and the U.K.EU SolidarityThe BioNTech chief called for continued solidarity among EU countries, despite concerns in countries like Germany that tethering vaccine purchasing and distribution to the bloc has slowed the immunization push. In the U.K., more than a third of the population has received a shot, compared with 6% in Germany, according to Bloomberg’s vaccination tracker.“At the end of the day we have to see that Germany is not an isolated state,” Sahin said. “It’s part of Europe, and Europe decides and has to come to a common solution.”As vaccine campaigns pick up, Sahin said he’s optimistic that inoculations will become more widespread this year and next.“I’m pretty confident that we will be able to provide vaccines in Europe and the U.S. and that everyone who requires a vaccine gets a vaccine by the end of summer,” Sahin said, provided there are no production glitches. “Within 2022, we hope to have enough to vaccinate around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-sees-potential-to-supply-3-billion-doses-next-year-101615364461255.html
10-03-2021||World||South Korean hospitals extract extra Covid-19 vaccine doses from vials||In a handful of South Korean hospitals, designated nurses are using specially designed syringes to squeeze extra doses of coronavirus vaccine out of each vial in a bid to stretch the still limited number of vials to cover more people.The practice has raised debate over medical safety and commercial concerns from the manufacturers who charge by the dose.But at Seoul's National Medical Center, healthcare workers say it's actually a safe and easy process that should be a no-brainer for countries struggling to provide enough vaccines quickly."Two designated nurses take shifts to extract the doses and each of us had no trouble getting seven doses from each vial, vaccinating everyone," said Kim Eun-suk, an intravenous therapy specialist who was taking a shift extracting doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine from vials that officially only hold six.On Tuesday, Kim said the centre vaccinated 629 people with 90 vials of Pfizer vaccine co-developed by its German partner BioNTech, compared with the 540 people possible had they only extracted six doses from each vial.It takes about five minutes to extract the doses using "low dead space" syringes designed to minimise the residual volume, she said.“Extraction itself is not difficult. It requires squeezing the exact amount with the syringe. The most important is sterilization and I think any nurse would be able to pull through."At the suggestion of frontline nurses, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said it was up to providers whether to use of remaining doses, but did not make it a new standard or mandatory because it said it could burden the healthcare workers on site.National Medical Center president Chung Ki-hyun said that the contracts with manufacturers - who sell by the dose - should not be a roadblock for on-site healthcare workers to use the remaining doses when they can save lives."With care and precision, the extra dose isn't as hard to extract," he said.It's not clear how many South Korean clinics are using the extra doses, but Chung said following the official limit means throwing away potentially life-saving vaccines.Experts were divided about the decision to extract extra doses, as pooling leftover vaccine from multiple vials can lead to contamination. With the specialised low dead space syringes, however, a full extra dose can typically be pulled from a single Pfizer vaccine vial, and as many as two extra doses from AstraZeneca's vaccine vials.Urging caution over imprecise extraction, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) has advised its members to discard the remaining doses in the vials, according to a statement seen by Reuters.KDCA said 446,941 people were given first doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots by Tuesday midnight. South Korea has reported 470 new cases on Tuesday, adding to the total coronavirus cases of 93,733, with 1,648 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-hospitals-extract-extra-covid-19-vaccine-doses-from-vials-101615363614883.html
10-03-2021||World||China producer prices jump, adding to global inflation risks||China’s producer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in February, joining more expensive oil, computer chip shortages and soaring shipping costs as tailwinds for global inflation pressures.The Chinese producer price index rose 1.7% from a year earlier, official data showed Wednesday, stronger than economists’ forecasts for a 1.5% increase and up from 0.3% in January. Consumer prices fell 0.2% last month from a year earlier, slightly better than a projected 0.3% decline.As manufacturer to the world, resurgent producer prices in China raise the prospect it will start exporting inflation globally as factories hike prices for goods sold abroad. Bond markets have already been roiled by expectations that faster global growth and massive fiscal stimulus in the U.S. will push up inflation.Chinese producer prices have been a major contributor to global inflation in recent decades as supply chains became more integrated. Falling prices were a key disinflation driver in 2012-2016, and made it difficult for central banks elsewhere to meet their goals of sustained inflation.This time around, inflation risks are moving in the other direction. Oil has surged close to $70 a barrel, while prices of copper and agricultural goods have rallied. Shipping rates have soared and a global shortage of computer chips could push up prices.“Metal prices were on the rise due to global fiscal stimulus money to be spent on infrastructure projects,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Groep NV in Hong Kong. “If crude oil price keeps increasing it would push up other prices, like transportation, and therefore production cost, then it could generate inflation.”Rising commodity prices were the main boost to China’s producer inflation last month. The biggest gains were in mining, which climbed 6.8% in February from a year ago, while raw material prices rose 2.9% after several months of declines.What Bloomberg Economics Says...Producer price inflation looks set to pick up further on a low base, assuming commodity prices remain buoyant. This would support increases in profits for industrial enterprises -- a positive for the economy.-- David Qu, China economistHowever, the government’s conservative economic growth goal of more than 6% for this year, and its gradual withdrawal of stimulus mean China could play a lesser role in driving demand for commodities this year than in the years following the global financial crisis.“China may play a less dominant role in exporting global inflation, given that the government’s on the course to tighten fiscal stimulus and property measures,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. “The recent commodity price upswing to a very large extent is responding to the recovery in major advanced economies on the back of vaccination and Covid-19 containment.”Consumer PricesConsumer deflation in China eased last month, with prices still largely dragged down by cheaper pork, a key element in the country’s CPI basket. Pork prices declined 14.9% in February from a year ago, reflecting the recovery in hog supplies after outbreaks of African swine fever in recent years.That trend could reverse with the re-emergence of the disease in parts of the country. However, the statistics bureau reduced pork’s weighting in the CPI basket last month, and with consumer spending still a weak point in an otherwise strong economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, consumer inflation will likely remain below Beijing’s target of a 3% increase this year.Excluding the volatile energy and food costs, consumer prices were unchanged from a year earlier.“The weak CPI shows that there’s no obvious inflation pressure, unlike in the U.S., where CPI expectations have been revised up,” said Hao Zhou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.Subdued inflation reduces pressure on the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, to tighten monetary policy, said Peiqian Liu, a China economist at Natwest Markets in Singapore. However, the PBOC has warned about financial risks, such as asset bubbles, suggesting a policy of gradual tightening.“We think the PBOC may continue to normalize monetary policy to neutral as credit growth slows gradually in coming months,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-producer-prices-jump-adding-to-global-inflation-risks-101615352779562.html

Germany and the United States have also ramped up efforts to resolve the shortage.South Korea's leading automaker Hyundai Motor has so far kept factories running, but a Hyundai union official told Reuters on Tuesday that overtime production of less-popular models had stopped and production schedules were changing from week to week.Although the domestic auto industry's situation was good compared to international rivals, "concerns about future production disruptions have increased", the government said in a statement.Chip production capacity could not be increased quickly, with 98% of auto chips used by South Korean automakers coming from abroad, it added.To help deal with the shortage, Koreans and foreigners involved in auto chip imports or production would no longer have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the country from abroad, starting April.Covid-19 vaccinations would be available for people departing for essential purposes such as purchasing and procuring auto chips.The government also said it would speed up performance evaluations of auto chip components and modules developed by domestic companies.(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-exempt-auto-chip-buyers-from-covid-19-quarantine-101615355261689.html

Former US President Donald Trump questioned the extent of US funding of the defence of allies and had demanded that South Korea pay as much as $5 billion a year."The agreement resolved a vacuum that had lasted about a year and three months," the foreign ministry said in a statement."It provided a chance to reaffirm the importance of the alliance and the need for stable stationing of US Forces Korea."The six-year Special Measures Agreement with the United States, which came after drawn-out negotiations and will boost South Korea's annual contribution to the bill for 2022 to 2025 in line with its annual defence budget increase, which was 5.4% this year, the foreign ministry said.The pact replaces an arrangement that expired at the end of 2019, under which South Korea paid about $920 million a year. Both sides agreed to freeze South Korea's contribution for 2020, the ministry said.In the last big annual increase, in 2003, South Korea paid 17% more than the previous year, according to data from a defence ministry white paper.On the new link between the contribution to the cost of maintaining US forces and the defence budget, the ministry said the increase in the defence budget was a "reasonable, clearly verifiable standard" that reflected financial and security capabilities.The ministry said it would take swift administrative steps and send the agreement to parliament for approval.About 28,500 US troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend it against North Korea. The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-agrees-to-13-9-increase-in-its-share-of-cost-for-hosting-us-troops-101615361115971.html
10-03-2021||World||Russia restricts use of Twitter, cites 'failure to remove banned content'||Russia's communications watchdog said on Wednesday it had restricted the use of Twitter in the country by moving to slow down the speed of the service after it was accused of failing to remove banned content from its website.Roskomnadzor, the watchdog, said in a statement on its website that it could block the resource entirely if Twitter failed to remove banned content.Authorities will slow access to Twitter on all mobile devices and on half of desktop computers because the company failed to remove content related to teenage suicide attempts, pornography and drug use, internet watchdog Roskomnadzor said in a statement Wednesday. It said access could be blocked altogether if Twitter doesn’t remove the banned content.The move came a day after the regulator announced lawsuits against Twitter and four other social-media companies for not deleting posts about last month’s nationwide protests over the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.President Vladimir Putin slammed U.S. social media giants during his speech at the World Economic Forum in January, calling them monopolies and questioning whether they act in the public interest.“This is so far the softest measure they could have taken to limit access to western social media,” Ilya Klishin, a founder of media consultant KFConsulting. “The target audience is old guys in power, who aren’t Twitter users anyways. I don’t think this will change young people’s habits, and there are serious questions if they have the technical capacity to completely block access to Twitter.”More RestrictionsTwitter couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Twitter has come under increasing pressure from regulators in some countries. Banned in China, the network was among several fined in Turkey late last year in a move activists called an attempt to stifle dissent.Russia’s regulator said other services could also be targeted for throttling if they continue to defy local laws, Interfax reported. Legislators in parliament Wednesday said Facebook Inc. could be restricted next.“This isn’t an empty threat. Twitter and the other social networks that don’t fulfill the requirements of the law should get ready for serious consequences, including closure,” said Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov, according to RIA Novosti.Tuesday, regulators filed court cases against Twitter, Google, Facebook, TikTok and Telegram for allegedly failing to delete posts that urged minors to attend the January protests, according to Interfax.Russia sought to block Telegram several years ago over failure to share encryption information but was unable to make the ban work technically and ultimately backed down. But under a 2019 law, authorities have since upgraded systems they say would allow Russia to completely cut itself off from the internet if needed.Twitter service in Moscow didn’t immediately appear to have been disrupted Wednesday, although state-run RIA Novosti said its staff experienced some slowness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-restricts-use-of-twitter-cites-failure-to-remove-banned-content-101615361135829.html

If approved by both parties, the contract will be in effect through June 30, 2021", the joint statement added.California's governor said earlier this month that he and Democratic lawmakers had reached a deal to fund the reopening of schools for students up to second grade, as the numbers of new Covid-19 cases in the state and country had dropped.California's $6.6 billion budget package marked an effort to get school children back in class after having been confined to home learning in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-schools-teachers-union-reach-tentative-deal-to-reopen-schools-101615357210709.html
10-03-2021||World||Hawaii declares state of emergency after rains cause floods||Hawaii Governor David Ige declared an emergency in the US state after heavy rains brought floods, landslides and fear of dam failures, prompting evacuations in at least two counties, while flood advisories stayed in effect for a second day.The move came after a dam overflowed on the island of Maui, forcing evacuations and destroying homes, with the dam's "unsatisfactory" condition leading to it being scheduled for removal this year, the land department has said."The emergency proclamation makes state general funds available that can be used quickly and efficiently to help those impacted by the severe weather," Ige said on Tuesday.Poor weather was expected to run until Friday, he added.There were no immediate reports of deaths or casualties.The emergency declaration covers the counties of Hawai'i, Maui, Kalawao, O'ahu and Kaua'i, the governor's office said in a statement, while the disaster relief period runs until May 8.In Maui, heavy rains damaged roads, leaving them impassable, with one bridge completely washed out and another displaced, the governor's office said, as higher water levels boosted the risk of erosion and seepage.State emergency management officials had said the rains led to the cresting of the Kaupakalua dam in the northern region of Haiku, prompting authorities to open evacuation shelters and urge people not to return home.Six homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, said Maui mayor Michael Victorino.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hawaii-declares-state-of-emergency-after-rains-cause-floods-101615360004828.html
10-03-2021||World||Defence Sec Lloyd Austin extends National Guard deployment at US Capitol||Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has formally approved an extension of the National Guard deployment at the US Capitol for about two more months as possible threats of violence remain, the Pentagon said Tuesday.According to a statement issued by the department, close to 2,300 Guard troops will continue to provide security in Washington until May 23, at the request of the Capitol Police. Officials have been scrambling in recent days to determine if and how to fill the request, as the original March 12 deadline for them to leave Washington loomed.There are currently about 5,100 Guard troops in Washington, and they were scheduled to leave this weekend. It was unclear if any of those forces will have to stay an extra day or two while any new troops arrive and get trained and settled in. The Pentagon said defence officials will work with the Capitol Police to incrementally reduce the number of Guard needed in the city as time goes on.The decision to keep Guard members in the city underscores concerns about security at the Capitol, two months after rioters breached the building in an attack that left five people dead. Law enforcement has remained in a heightened security posture in response to intelligence suggesting possible threats to the Capitol by militia groups.Also read: Hire more police officers, improve intelligence capability: Capitol riot reviewThe request to extend the deployment met resistance last week, as some governors expressed reluctance or flatly refused to commit their troops to more time in the city. There now appear to be enough states willing to provide Guard troops for the mission, said defence officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Earlier Tuesday, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the decision on maintaining a Guard presence would be based on local law enforcement concerns along with the needs of the Capitol Police.“It's not just about a threat assessment, it's about assisting and supporting capabilities that the Capitol Police may now lack and may need to look at improving,” Kirby said, adding that the extension request was based largely on using the Guard to make up for gaps in the capabilities of the Capitol Police.Army leaders had also initially questioned whether the Capitol Police had exhausted all other options to fill the need, such as asking other federal law enforcement agencies to provide security. But officials said military leaders thought it was important to find ways to work out the details.The threat was tied to the far-right conspiracy theory promoted by QAnon supporters that former President Donald Trump would rise again to power on March 4, the original presidential inauguration day. That day passed with no problems, but law enforcement has said threats to buildings and personnel remain.The Guard's deployment to the Capitol has been troubled. Early on, Guard members were briefly forced to take rest breaks and meals in a nearby cold garage, sparking outrage within the Biden administration. Officials quickly found new spaces within congressional buildings for the on-duty breaks.In addition, Guard members complained of bad food, and some said they became sick. On Monday, Kirby said about 50 Guard troops had been treated for gastrointestinal issues, out of the 26,000 that deployed to Washington. He said six sought outpatient medical treatment, while the rest were treated at aid stations set up for the Capitol Hill mission.Kirby said Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has been visiting the troops several times a week and eating with them to ensure that they were getting good food.Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman made the request to have the Guard members stay on, setting off a series of discussions with the Pentagon and National Guard leaders.In a statement late Tuesday, the Capitol Police force said it is “extremely grateful for the Department of Defence's continued commitment to support our critical mission to protect Congress.”US military officials have said the cost of deploying about 26,000 Guard troops to the US Capitol from shortly after the January 6 riot to this Friday is close to USD 500 million. No cost estimate for the next two months has been released. The costs include housing, transportation, salaries, benefits and other essentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defence-sec-lloyd-austin-extends-national-guard-deployment-at-us-capitol-101615350594409.html

10-03-2021||World||End in sight for Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' amid rising inflation in Pakistan||With political turmoil in Pakistan worsening with every passing day, the end seems to be in sight for Prime Minister Imran Khan's 'Naya Pakistan' courtesy rising inflation in the country.According to Imad Zafar, a political commentator for various media outlets and think tanks, the Prime Minister is finding it tough to steer the country out of its political and economic crisis.Khan won a vote of confidence from the National Assembly (NA). Khan needed that vote to confirm his majority in the lower house of parliament after his party suffered an embarrassing defeat in the Senate at the hands of the Pakistan Democratic Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties.Zafar pointed out that not only did the PDM manage to get ex-prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani elected to the Senate, defeating the incumbent finance minister Hafeez Shaikh, but it also managed to secure a majority in the upper house."Though Khan somehow managed to thwart the crisis for the time being by getting a vote of confidence from the NA, for sure the storm is not over for him. The rising inflation and increasing poverty in the country are only making his Naya Pakistan (New Pakistan) project a nightmare for the masses," Zafar wrote for The Asia Times.He added, "Such is the state of affairs that even the military establishment is unable to run the country from behind the scenes."Also read: Imran Khan survives, but with a taintThe frustration of the elite, he said, was evident on the day of the vote of confidence, when parliamentarians of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) were attacked by a mob of supporters of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)."Imran Khan is trying everything possible to stay in power. The question remains, however, how he will survive the onslaught of the opposition at a point when the establishment is about to ditch him and is looking for a new puppet to rule the country on its behalf," the commentator wrote for the Asia Times.He added, "For Khan the game is almost over, as perhaps a few generals will still support him, but he does not enjoy the unconditional support from the establishment that he had after his relaunch in politics in 2011. So probably he knows this is his first and last time to enjoy power, so he is trying everything to stay in charge."The question is how long a few generals will be able to save him from the inevitable, as the growing anger in the masses about inflation, unemployment, and economic turmoil is growing with the passage of time, Zafar said further.He pointed out that this is "perhaps the first time" that the doctrine of the military establishment to rule the country indirectly has backfired, and it has happened in only two and a half years."Though the majority of the mainstream media was behind the hybrid regime, still the opposition managed to produce counter-narratives through international media and digital news platforms, and the inability of Khan and his backers to manage the economy and governance doomed the Naya Pakistan project," he said.Zafar added, "The endgame has started, and the interesting thing is that Khan cannot even get rid of the government until both Sharif and Zardari agree to topple him."This comes as Pakistan's financial debt continues to mount because the Imran Khan government received USD 6.7 billion in gross foreign loans in the first seven months of the current fiscal year, including a new commercial loan of USD 500 million from China last month.According to The Expresss Tribune, Ministry of Economic Affairs reported that during the July-January period of fiscal year 2020-21, the government obtained USD 6.7 billion in external loans from multiple financing sources. The gross loans were higher by 6 per cent or USD 380 million over the same period of the last fiscal year.Pakistan's foreign debt and liabilities have mounted by USD 3 billion or 2.6 per cent during the six months period ended in December last year, the central bank's data reported in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-in-sight-for-imran-khan-s-naya-pakistan-amid-rising-inflation-in-pakistan-101615341506313.html

House and Senate Republicans have unanimously opposed the package as bloated, crammed with liberal policies and heedless of signs the dual crises are easing.“It's a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday.For Biden and Democrats, the bill is essentially a canvas on which they've painted their core beliefs — that government programs can be a benefit, not a bane, to millions of people and that spending huge sums on such efforts can be a cure, not a curse. The measure so closely tracks Democrats' priorities that several rank it with the top achievements of their careers, and despite their slender congressional majorities there was never real suspense over its fate.They were also empowered by three dynamics: their unfettered control of the White House and Congress, polls showing robust support for Biden's approach, and a moment when most voters care little that the national debt is soaring toward a stratospheric $22 trillion. Neither party seems much troubled by surging red ink, either, except when the other is using it to finance its priorities, be they Democratic spending or GOP tax cuts.A dominant feature of the bill is initiatives making it one of the biggest federal thrusts in years to assist lower- and middle-income families. Included are expanded tax credits over the next year for children, child care and family leave plus spending for renters, feeding programs and people's utility bills.The measure provides up to $1,400 direct payments to most Americans, extended emergency unemployment benefits and hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, state and local governments and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color and pension systems, and subsidies for consumers buying health insurance and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners.Its very expansiveness is a chief GOP talking point.“It's not focused on COVID relief. It's focused on pushing more of the far-left agenda," said No. 2 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Biden’s response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans.Yet the bill's pathway has underscored Democrats' challenges as they seek to build a legislative record to persuade voters to keep them running Congress in next year's elections.Democrats control the Senate, split 50-50, only because Vice President Kamala Harris gives them the winning vote in tied roll calls. They have just a 10-vote advantage in the House.That's almost no wiggle room for a party that ranges from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin on the conservative side to progressives like Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Progressives had to swallow big concessions in the bill to solidify moderate support. The most painful was dropping the House-approved federal minimum-wage increase to $15 hourly by 2025.Moderates forced tightened eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus checks, now phased out completely for individuals earning $80,000 and couples making $160,000. The House's initial extension of the soon-to-end $400 weekly emergency jobless payments, paid on top of state benefits, was trimmed by the Senate to $300 and will now halt in early September.Manchin was a leading holdout and in the middle of talks that resulted in curbing all of those initiatives. The Senate approved the bill on a party-line 50-49 vote on Saturday.Dropping the minimum-wage boost was “infuriating,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the roughly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus. But she called the overall bill “incredibly bold,” adding, "It hits all of our progressive priorities — putting money in people’s pockets, shots in arms, unemployment insurance, child care, schools.”The independent Tax Policy Center said that the Senate-passed bill would give almost 70% of this year's tax breaks to households earning $91,000 or less. In contrast, the Trump-era GOP tax bill gave nearly half its 2018 reductions to the top 5% of households earning around $308,000, said the research center, which is run by the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.Yet keeping Democrats united won't get easier as the party tries advancing the rest of its agenda. There are fault lines within the party over priorities like immigration, health care and taxes.At some point it seems likely that progressives will draw their own lines in the sand. They are already demanding that the party revisit the minimum-wage boost, and amid all this Republicans are already demonstrating they are ready to pounce.The American Action Network, tied to House GOP leaders, said it's launched digital ads in mostly moderate districts calling the relief bill “a freight train of frivolous spending to bankroll their liberal cronies.”The bill passed the Senate under budget rules that prevented Republicans from launching filibusters, which require 60 votes for most measures. That process won't be available for much legislation moving forward, but either way any Democratic Senate defections will make most bills there non-starters.Even with their procedural advantage, Democrats' avenue to victory in the Senate was pockmarked with delays. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced clerks to spend nearly 11 hours reading the entire 628-page bill; negotiations with Manchin over jobless benefits lasted around nine hours; and votes on three dozen amendments, virtually all fated in advance to lose, took about 12 hours more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-set-to-vote-on-covid-19-relief-biden-on-cusp-of-triumph-101615354292565.html
10-03-2021||World||Air travellers gaining confidence, time to plan for restart: IATA||The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced results from its latest poll of recent travellers, showing growing confidence in a return to air travel, frustration with current travel restrictions and acceptance of a travel app to manage health credentials for travel.While 88 per cent believe that when opening borders, the right balance must be struck between managing Covid-19 risks and getting the economy going again, 85 per cent believe that governments should set Covid-19 targets (like testing capacity or vaccine distribution) to re-open borders.About 84 per cent believe that Covid-19 will not disappear and there is need to manage its risks while living and travelling normally, 68 per cent agreed that their quality of life has suffered with travel restrictions.Nearly 49 per cent believe that air travel restrictions have gone too far.A total of 4,700 interviews were conducted online in 11 markets between February 15 and 23. The sample size was 500 in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, India and Australia. In Chile, Japan, UAE and Singapore the sample size was 300.The poll showed while there is public support for travel restrictions, it is becoming clear that people are feeling more comfortable with managing the risks of Covid-19.People are also feeling frustrated with the loss of freedom to travel with 68 per cent of respondents indicating their quality of life is suffering as a result. Travel restrictions come with health, social and economic consequences.Nearly 40 per cent of respondents reported mental stress and missing an important human moment as a result of travel restrictions. And over a third have said that restrictions prevent them from doing business normally."The top priority of everybody at the moment is staying safe amid the Covid-19 crisis. But it is important that we map a way to being able to re-open borders, manage risks and enable people to get on with their lives," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO."That includes the freedom to travel. It is becoming clear that we will need to learn to live and travel in a world that has Covid-19. Given the health, social and economic costs of travel restrictions, airlines should be ready to re-connect the world as soon as governments are able to re-open borders."The poll showed that 57 per cent expect to be travelling within two months of the pandemic being contained (improved from 49 per cent in September 2020). About 72 per cent want to travel to see family and friends as soon as possible (improved from 63 per cent in September 2020).Nearly 81 per cent believe that they will be more likely to travel once they are vaccinated and 84 per cent said they will not travel if there is a chance of quarantine at destination (largely unchanged from 83 per cent in September 2020).About 56 per cent believe that they will postpone travel until the economy stabilises (improved from 65 per cent in September 2020).There are some headwinds in travel trends. About 84 per cent of travellers will not travel if it involves quarantine at destination. And there are still indications that the pick-up in business travel will take time with 62 per cent of respondents saying they are likely to travel less for business even after the virus is contained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-travellers-gaining-confidence-time-to-plan-for-restart-iata-101615354256560.html

10-03-2021||World||Biden's first 50 days: Where he stands on key promises||President Joe Biden laid out an ambitious agenda for his first 100 days in office, promising swift action on everything from climate change to immigration reform to the coronavirus pandemic.He hits his 50th day in office on Wednesday as his administration eyes a major milestone: final congressional passage of his massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package. The bill includes direct payments to millions of Americans and money to help the White House deliver on a number of Biden's biggest campaign promises, like reopening schools and getting more Americans vaccinated.Fifty days in, Biden has made major strides on a number of key campaign pledges for his earliest days in office, while others are still awaiting action. Where he stands on some of his major promises:COMPLETED GOALSBiden prioritized addressing the coronavirus pandemic during his first weeks in office, and the focus has paid off. He’s on pace to hit his goal of 100 million vaccine doses administered in his first 100 days as soon as the end of next week. The daily rate of vaccinations now averages more than 2 million shots, and more than 75 million doses have been administered since Biden was sworn in.Read more: 'Indian-Americans taking over US,' says President Joe Biden in NASA meetBiden also took took several early actions that fulfilled pledges on climate policy. He signed an executive order on Inauguration Day that revoked the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halted development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ordered the review of Trump-era rules on the environment, public health and science. A Jan. 27 executive order halted new oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters.Biden also easily delivered on top campaign pledges that involved rolling back Trump administration moves on everything from climate change to immigration. Early on, the Biden administration rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord, halted construction of the border wall, ended travel restrictions on people from a variety of Muslim-majority countries and created a task force to reunite families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border.Read more: In message to China, Joe Biden to meet Australia, India, Japan PMsOn immigration, Biden pledged to deliver a comprehensive reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days, and it was unveiled last month, although Biden already has signaled an openness to a piece-by-piece approach if necessary. Biden also issued an executive order directing the Homeland Security secretary to “preserve and fortify” protections for young immigrants brought to the U.S. by their parents.Biden also made some early moves to deliver on a pledge to tighten ethical standards in his administration, including a Jan. 20 executive order imposing an ethics pledge on appointees governing activities such as lobbying and taking gifts, which included prohibiting political interference in the Justice Department.IN PROGRESSStill other Biden promises remain a work in progress.Biden’s national COVID-19 strategy pledged to establish 100 new, federally supported vaccination centers across the nation by the end of February. So far, the administration is at about 20 mass vaccination sites run end-to-end by the federal government and staffed by active-duty troops deployed by the Pentagon. Overall, the administration says, at least 441 vaccination sites are now federally supported. Many of those were not new sites, but nearly all have expanded capacity with the additional federal resources.On immigration, Biden pledged to reverse the “public charge” rule put in place by the Trump administration to discourage immigrants from using public benefits, to streamline the naturalization process and to reform the U.S. asylum system within his first 100 days. An executive order he signed in early February directs the relevant agencies to review those policies and recommend changes within 60 days.The administration has made some moves to reform the asylum system, including a move by the Department of Homeland Security on Biden’s first day in office to suspend a Trump-era program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were under review. But Biden has yet to articulate a plan to manage asylum flows beyond proposing that billions of dollars be spent to address root causes in Central America.The president has also kept in place pandemic-related powers that allow his administration to immediately expel people at the border without an opportunity to seek asylum. Biden aides have said they have no immediate plans to end the authority, which Trump introduced a year ago using an obscure 1944 public health law.Biden also promised to end the long-term detention of migrant families. Immigration and Customs Enforcement signaled last week it plans to discontinue the use of one such facility, but ICE will continue to hold families for three days or less at two other facilities in Texas. And the Biden administration is expanding capacity at a number of long-term facilities that hold immigrant children, to address an ongoing surge of unaccompanied minors at the border.On climate change, Biden pledged to establish enforceable commitments from other nations to reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation and to convene a climate world summit to discuss new and more ambitious pledges to address climate change, within his first 100 days. The U.S. will hold such a summit on April 22, Earth Day.Reopening America’s schools is one of Biden’s major campaign promises that’s proven tougher to execute, in part because the decision on whether to return to in-person learning is left up to local officials and teachers’ unions. After some back-and-forth over the details of his goal, Biden said last month that his 100-day mission was to have most elementary schools open five days a week for in-person learning.This month he directed states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and announced he was directing federal resources toward vaccinating teachers in March. The Biden administration hopes that with the passage of the coronavirus relief bill and distribution of millions in aid for schools to improve safety measures, teachers will feel more comfortable returning to in-person learning.According to Burbio, which tracks school reopening plans, about 47% of kindergarten through 12th grade students have access to in-person school every weekday.AWAITING ACTIONThe Biden administration has yet to take significant action on criminal justice reform, aside from an executive order terminating private prison contracts. Biden pledged to set up a police oversight board within his first 100 days, but there's been no clear movement in that direction so far.Other 100-day pledges also awaiting movement: creating a Cabinet-level working group focused on promoting union participation, and ordering an FBI review of issues with gun purchase background checks.Read more: EU to go ahead with tech tax with or without Joe BidenSome of Biden’s 100-day pledges will require congressional action, like his promise to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase taxes on corporations. Biden also promised to make passage of the Equality Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, a priority in his first 100 days. That bill has passed the House but not the Senate.And some of his promises are waiting on Biden’s Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate. On gun control, Biden has said he would direct his attorney general to deliver recommendations to restructure key Justice Department agencies to more effectively enforce the nation’s gun laws. He also pledged to have his secretary of Housing and Urban Development lead a task force to create recommendations for making housing a right for all Americans.Both his attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, and his nominee to lead the Housing Department, Rep. Marcia Fudge, are expected to win confirmation this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-first-50-days-where-he-stands-on-key-promises-101615353312656.html
10-03-2021||World||US rebuff to China over Dalai Lama signals Biden won’t take eyes off Tibet||The Joe Biden administration’s statement that the Chinese government should have no role in the succession of the Dalai Lama on the day Tibetans in 1959 rose against Beijing’s rule makes it evident that Washington will continue to press the Xi Jinping regime on Lhasa. The 14th Dalai Lama escaped from Lhasa on May 17, 1959, and reached Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by March-end. The refuge given to the 14th Dalai Lama by India was one of the principal triggers of the 1962 border skirmish."We believe that the Chinese government should have no role in the succession process of the Dalai Lama," State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Tuesday. Price recalled Beijing’s interference in the succession of the Panchen Lama more than 25 years ago and called the Chinese effort to impose its successor “an outrageous abuse of religious freedom.”ALSO WATCH | ‘China should have no role in Dalai Lama succession process’: Biden official﻿In December, former US President Donald Trump signed into law a bill to establish a US consulate in Tibet and called for an international coalition to ensure that the next Dalai Lama is solely appointed by the Tibetan Buddhist community without Chinese interference.Irrespective of the statements from Washington, analysts said the Xi Jinping regime will interfere in the Dalai Lama succession and anoint a Chinese Dalai Lama as opposed to one that may be appointed by the 14th Dalai Lama during his lifetime or beyond. It is not very difficult to figure that by having two Dalai Lamas and two Panchen Lama, the Chinese will seek to engineer chaos in the international Buddhist community, particularly in the Gelugpa sect, the most dominant school of Tibetan Buddhism.Given the Chinese political and economic clout, the international community will be only reduced to making noises as in the case of Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan. The Chinese economic clout is such that the Sunni Muslim nations are willing to look the other way to state abuses against the Uighur community in Xinjiang but are prepared to red flag India on Kashmir at the first given opportunity.While India is watching the 14th Dalai Lama succession plan very closely, the Modi government has gone beyond the thinking of past governments who thought, as one former top foreign ministry official put it at a high-level meeting, that this issue was akin to flogging a dead horse.Even though New Delhi has no intentions of deliberately needling China on the Dalai Lama issue despite Beijing’s routine pinpricks on Kashmir, it is unfazed by the routine threats issued by the Xi Jinping regime to anyone raising the so-called core issue of the middle kingdom. Such is the Chinese antipathy towards exiled Tibetan community that the issue of deploying Special Frontier Forces (SFF), made up entirely of Tibetan exiles, in East Ladakh and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was seriously raised by the Peoples’ Liberation Army commanders during the military dialogue with Indian commanders. The SFF was part of the Indian Army mission to occupy the Rezang La -Rechin La heights on the south banks of Pangong Tso last August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rebuff-to-china-over-dalai-lama-signals-biden-won-t-take-eyes-off-tibet-101615352260487.html

10-03-2021||World||China appears to censor ‘stock market’ from social media search as stocks fall||China’s stock rout turned so extreme that state-backed funds intervened to calm the market on Tuesday, but finding any news about what happened proved somewhat difficult on the mainland.On Weibo, the Twitter-like platform with about half a billion active users, a search for Chinese equivalent of “stock market” generated no posts on Wednesday, suggesting the phrase had been censored. Users could still post using the term, and searches for words that mean “plunge,” “A-shares” and “stocks” were successful as of 11 a.m. local time.An article in the Shanghai Securities News, one of China’s most widely circulated financial dailies, said large insurers bought stocks on Tuesday. The report also denied recent “rumors” that insurers had made large-scale redemptions of stock funds, citing investment managers at companies in the sector.Still, mentions of the stock plunge were notably absent from the front pages of China’s major financial newspapers on Wednesday, which instead focused on President Xi Jinping’s comments about national defense during the annual session of the National People’s Congress.The bearish mood in China’s stock market has been a challenge even for state-backed funds, casting a cloud over the Communist Party’s biggest political event of the year. In just 14 trading days the benchmark CSI 300 Index plummeted 14% from a 13-year high, wiping out more than $1.3 trillion of value and hammering the holdings of retail investors who piled in at the peak.Chinese media outlets often influence the market by downplaying recent turbulence or discouraging excess. In 2019, when stocks sank following threats from Donald Trump to impose more tariffs on Chinese exports, one article argued the bull market would resume. Posts about Trump’s comments were removed from social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-appears-to-censor-stock-market-from-social-media-search-as-stocks-fall-101615351165495.html

10-03-2021||World||US envoy urges Sudan to build inclusive govt, ensure peace, support minorities||The United States called on Sudan Tuesday to build an inclusive and representative government that ensures peace, supports people on the margins and helps “those who have suffered achieve justice.”US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield also called for implementation of the historic Juba Peace Agreement signed six months ago by the civilian-led transitional government and rebel groups, saying so far “the Sudanese people have not seen the commitment and engagement by signatory parties necessary for progress.”She told the UN Security Council that Sudan should also complete the formation of an inclusive Transitional Legislative Council, where women comprise at least 40 percent of the representatives.Sudan, which has been on a fragile path to democracy since the military ousted autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019 following mass pro-democracy protests, is ruled by a transitional military-civilian government. On Feb. 10, a new Cabinet was sworn in that includes rebel ministers as part of the power-sharing deal the transitional authorities struck in Juba with a rebel alliance.Sudan’s largest single rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-North led by Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu, has been in talks with the transitional government but has yet to reach a deal with the government. Another major rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Army in the restive Darfur region, which is led by Abdel-Wahid Nour, rejects the transitional government and has not taken part in the talks.Thomas-Greenfield said a “shocking attack” in West Darfur in January, which reportedly killed 163 people and displaced some 50,000, was “a tragic reminder of the ongoing threats that civilians face in Sudan.”She called on the government to establish security forces, rule of law and justice institutions in Darfur including the Special Court for Darfur Crimes.Sudan’s transitional government faces towering challenges, including a huge budget deficit and widespread shortages of essential goods and soaring prices of bread and other staples. The country is $70 billion in debt and the rapidly deteriorating economic conditions triggered protests earlier this year in Khartoum and other cities across the country.On Feb. 21, Sudan began a managed flotation of its currency, an unprecedented but expected step to meet a major demand by international financial institutions to help transitional authorities overhaul the battered economy.The Security Council meeting also focused on the end of the joint UN-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur known as UNAMID on Dec. 31 and its replacement with a much smaller and solely political mission, known as United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan, or UNITAMS.The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled, accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination. The government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations — a charge it denies. UNAMID was established in 2007.Volker Perthes, the new UN special envoy for Sudan and head of UNITAMS, said in his first briefing to the Security Council that “Sudan is making significant advances in its transition. However, the remaining challenges are staggering.”On the plus side, he pointed to the new Cabinet including signatories of the Juba agreement, and the government's agreement on national priorities. These include addressing the dire socioeconomics conditions, fully implementing the Juba agreement and resuming negotiations with the two rebel groups that didn’t sign it, reforming the security sector, protecting civilians, promoting international relations, and advancing Sudan’s democratic transition.On the minus side, Perthes said a diverse Legislative Council needs to be formed swiftly and “is critical to broaden the support for the political transition.” He cited fears that gains for women’s rights in the constitutional document won’t be realized, and he also pointed to “frustration” by Sudanese young people over their lack of participation in transitional institutions.Perthes also warned that “economic hardships are posing a risk to Sudan’s stability.”“Inflation stood at 304% in January,” he said, adding that the country suffers from high rates of unemployment and poverty, with 13.4 million people — a quarter of the population — projected to need humanitarian assistance.Both Perthes and Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy, expressed concern at rising tensions along the Sudan-Ethiopia border.The UN envoy said 70,000 people recently arrived in Sudan, having fled the conflict between Ethiopian and allied forces and those supporting the now-fugitive leaders in embattled Tigray province who once dominated Ethiopia’s government.Thomas-Greenfield pointed to “the recent bellicose rhetoric and the positioning of additional forces around the el-Fashaga area” and warned that “the risk of miscalculation is high.”“So, we call on both sides to expand direct communications to prevent any further military escalation and commit to discussions -- without preconditions,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-urges-sudan-to-build-inclusive-govt-ensure-peace-support-minorities-101615341496341.html

10-03-2021||World||In message to China, Joe Biden to meet Australia, India, Japan PMs||US President Joe Biden will hold first-ever joint talks Friday with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan, boosting an emerging four-way alliance often cast as a bulwark against China.It will be one of the first summits, albeit in virtual format, for Biden, who has vowed to revive US alliances in the wake of the disarray of Donald Trump's administration."That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks to the importance that we place on close cooperation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific," White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday.The meeting of the so-called "Quad" comes amid rising tensions with China, which is seen as flexing its muscle both in trade and security realms.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that Biden was "taking this to another level.""It will be an historic moment in our region and it sends a strong message to the region about our support for a sovereign, independent Indo-Pacific," Morrison told reporters.Both Psaki and India, which earlier announced the participation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that the talks would take up climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic -- two key priorities for Biden."The leaders will discuss regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region," the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.The talks, also involving Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, will touch as well on promoting maritime security and "ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines" to fight Covid-19 in Asia, the Indian statement said.China's growing assertiveness Japan said that Suga spoke separately Thursday to Modi and voiced alarm about China's "unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and China Sea" as well as the status of rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that the Quad was well-equipped to deal with the world's "urgent challenges" but, asked about China, said, the format is "not about any single competitor."The summit follows talks on February 18 among the foreign ministers of the Quad when they pressed jointly for a restoration of democracy in Myanmar after the military ousted democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi on February 1.US officials cast the meeting as a key way of exerting pressure as India and Japan enjoy closer relationships with Myanmar's military -- which has historically counted on China as its main source of support.The Quad foreign ministers, however, were careful not to make an explicit mention of China, which has voiced alarm at what it sees as an effort to gang up on its interests in Asia.After Biden's election, Chinese state media had printed articles calling on India to end the Quad, seeing New Delhi as the most likely opponent.But views have hardened in India after a pitched battle in the Himalayas last year killed at least 20 Indian troops. China has named four dead in confirmation that took half a year.Australia has also shown growing willingness to participate in the Quad as relations deteriorate with Beijing, last year joining naval exercises with the three other nations off India's shores.The Quad was launched in 2007 by Japan's then prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was alarmed at China's growing assertiveness around Asia.Biden has pledged in general terms to continue his predecessor's hawkish line on China, including by pressing on human rights and territorial disputes.But the Biden administration has promised what it considers a more productive approach that includes boosting ties with allies and finding limited areas for cooperation with Beijing such as climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-message-to-china-joe-biden-to-meet-australia-india-japan-pms-101615340342034.html
10-03-2021||World||Arkansas governor signs near-total abortion ban into law||Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday signed into law legislation banning nearly all abortions in the state, a sweeping measure that supporters hope will force the US Supreme Court to revisit its landmark Roe v. Wade decision but opponents vow to block before it takes effect later this year.The Republican governor had expressed reservations about the bill, which only allows the procedure to save the life of the mother and does not provide exceptions for those impregnated in an act of rape or incest. Arkansas is one of at least 14 states where legislators have proposed outright abortion bans this year.Hutchinson said he was signing the bill because of its “overwhelming legislative support and my sincere and long-held pro-life convictions."The bans were pushed by Republicans who want to force the US Supreme Court to revisit its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Conservatives believe the court is more open to striking down the decision following former President Donald Trump's three appointments to the court.“We must abolish abortion in this nation just as we abolished slavery in the 19th century – all lives matter," Republican Sen. Jason Rapert, the bill's sponsor said in a statement.Hutchinson has signed several major abortion restrictions into law since taking office in 2015, but he had voiced concerns that this bill directly challenges Roe and about the lack of rape and incest exceptions. He repeated those concerns as he announced his decision.“(The ban) is in contradiction of binding precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, but it is the intent of the legislation to set the stage for the Supreme Court overturning current case law," he said in a statement released by his office. “I would have preferred the legislation to include the exceptions for rape and incest, which has been my consistent view, and such exceptions would increase the chances for a review by the US Supreme Court.”As the Legislature considered the measure, Hutchinson shared with lawmakers a letter written by an attorney for abortion opponents National Right to Life that said the chances of the bill leading to Roe being overturned were “very small and remote.” National Right to Life didn't take a position on the bill, though its Arkansas affiliate supported the ban.The legislation won't take effect until 90 days after the majority-Republican Legislature adjourns this year's session. That means it can't be enforced until this summer at the earliest. Abortion rights supporters said they plan to challenge the ban in court before then.The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called the ban “cruel and unconstitutional."“Governor Hutchinson: we’ll see you in court," ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Dickson said.“This is politics at its very worst," Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. “At a time when people need economic relief and basic safety precautions, dismantling abortion access is cruel, dangerous, and blatantly unjust."Hutchinson had until Wednesday afternoon to take action on the bill before it would have become law without his signature, a move past governors have taken to express displeasure with a bill without risking an override fight with the Legislature. It takes a simple majority for the Legislature to override a governor's veto in Arkansas.Arkansas has some of the strictest abortion measures in the country and two years ago Hutchinson signed into law a measure that would ban the procedure if the Roe decision was overturned. Another measure Hutchinson signed in 2019 banning abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy is on hold due to a legal challenge.Several other restrictions are still being considered in the Legislature, including one approved by the Senate a day earlier that would require a woman having an abortion to first be shown an ultrasound.Another sweeping abortion ban was signed into law by South Carolina’s governor last month but was quickly blocked by a federal judge due to a legal challenge by Planned Parenthood. Alabama enacted a near-total ban on abortions in 2019 that has been blocked because of court challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arkansas-governor-signs-near-total-abortion-ban-into-law-101615338739073.html
10-03-2021||World||‘He grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me’: Iowa journalist recounts arrest||An Iowa journalist recounted getting pepper-sprayed and arrested while covering a protest for racial justice last year, testifying in her own defense Tuesday at her trial on charges stemming from the incident.Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri told jurors she was running away from a scene where riot police had shot tear gas and were advancing to disperse protesters outside a mall in Des Moines, Iowa. She said that after she rounded the corner of a Verizon store, she saw an officer charging at her and put her hands up.“I wasn't doing anything wrong,” Sahouri said. “I said, ‘I’m press, I'm press, I'm press.' He grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me and as he was doing so said, ‘That's not what I asked'."Sahouri said the pepper spray was “extremely painful” and made her think she was going to go blind.Sahouri’s testimony came on the second day of a trial in which Sahouri and her former boyfriend, Spenser Robnett, are charged with failure to disperse and interference with official acts. The case has drawn widespread criticism from media and human rights advocates, who call the charges an attack on press freedom. The pair face fines and potentially jail time if convicted of the misdemeanors.Judge Lawrence McLellan on Tuesday reserved a ruling on the defense's motion for an acquittal, and could issue one from the bench Wednesday. A six-member jury is expected to begin deliberations Wednesday morning.Body camera video played for jurors before Sahouri's testimony backed up her account, showing that she was temporarily blinded and hurting from pepper spray and repeatedly told police she was a reporter.“This is my job,” Sahouri tells an officer. “I’m just doing my job. I’m a journalist.”The Freedom of the Press Foundation called the video powerful evidence that Sahouri was “arrested while doing her job reporting on historic protests” and should have never faced prosecution.Robnett, who accompanied Sahouri to the protest for safety reasons, also took the stand Tuesday. He said he saw Officer Luke Wilson spray Sahouri from close range, and that he stepped forward to say that Sahouri was a Register reporter. The officer then shot pepper spray at him, knocking him to the ground, before he was handcuffed and jailed, Robnett said.Robnett and Sahouri testified that they did not hear any earlier police orders to leave the scene, and that they did not interfere with the officers who arrested them.The newspaper assigned Sahouri to cover the protest at Merle Hay mall days after the death of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who was declared dead after a white officer put his knee on his neck for about nine minutes.Des Moines Register executive editor Carol Hunter testified that Sahouri did her job “very well” that night, reporting observations and images of the event live on Twitter. She noted the protests were the largest in the city in decades.A second Register reporter who was with Sahouri, Katie Akin, testified that she was surprised to see Sahouri get arrested because “I didn't understand us to be breaking any laws." Akin yelled that they were journalists and showed a press badge, before Akin was told to leave without arrest.Wilson, an 18-year Des Moines Police Department veteran, said he responded to the protest and found a “riotous mob” breaking store windows and throwing rocks and water bottles at officers. He said his unit was told to clear a parking lot, and he used a device known as a fogger to blanket the area with clouds of pepper spray.He said he decided Sahouri needed to be arrested when she did not leave and that he was unaware she was a journalist when he grabbed her. He said that Robnett tried to pull Sahouri out of his grasp, and he deployed more pepper spray that “incapacitated” Robnett.Sahouri had her hands cuffed in zip ties and was taken to jail in a police van.Under cross-examination by defense attorney Nicholas Klinefeldt, Wilson said that he charged Sahouri with interference because she briefly pulled her left arm away while he was arresting her. He acknowledged that he didn't mention that claim in his police report.Wilson said he failed to activate his body camera before arresting Sahouri, saying he mistakenly believed it was recording.The cameras are always capturing video when on and can retrieve video of incidents that were not recorded in some circumstances. Officers who fail to record significant incidents are required by department policy to notify supervisors, who can then try to recover video. Wilson said he didn't do that.Prosecutors say Sahouri and Robnett ignored police orders to leave the area that were broadcast over a public address system about 90 minutes before their arrests.The defense argued those orders intended only to clear an intersection where protesters were surrounding a squad car. Body camera video played for jurors showed officers yelling at protesters to get out of the intersection and be peaceful. Separate orders to disperse could be heard faintly in the background — so quiet that an officer testifying for the prosecution struggled to make them out.Sahouri testified she didn't hear any dispersal orders and continued reporting on what she called a historical moment.“It's important for journalists to be on the scene and document what's happening,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-grabbed-me-pepper-sprayed-me-iowa-journalist-recounts-arrest-101615337984122.html
10-03-2021||World||New owner Buzzfeed lays off 45 from HuffPost newsroom||Buzzfeed announced Tuesday that it has laid off 45 reporters, editors and producers from the newly acquired HuffPost.HuffPost Executive Editor Hillary Frey, the website’s executive editor, and Executive Editor Louise Roug also resigned over the layoffs, Buzzfeed said.The dismissals come just three weeks after Buzzfeed acquired HuffPost, the media outlet founded in 2005 as The Huffington Post, from Verizon Media.“We never got a fair shot to prove our worth,” the HuffPost union said in a statement.According to excerpts released by the company, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti told employees at a meeting that “we will begin to restructure HuffPost today to fast-track its path to profitability. Unfortunately that includes staff reductions, and a number of talented colleagues will be laid off over the next few days.”Peretti said “losses last year exceeded $20M, and would be similar this year without intervention. Though BuzzFeed is a profitable company, we don’t have the resources to support another two years of losses."HuffPost Canada will be shut down under the restructuring.The union said the layoffs included nearly 30 percent of its membership.“We are devastated and infuriated, particularly after an exhausting year of covering a pandemic and working from home," the union's statement said.Many of the laid off employees were lamenting losing their jobs on social media after stints of many years, and objected to the way they were told, saying the password for entering the remote meeting was a variation of “spring is here,” making them blindsided by what would come later.Reporter Rowaida Abdelaziz called it “an absolute cruel and brutal day at HuffPost. I am speechless.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-owner-buzzfeed-lays-off-45-from-huffpost-newsroom-101615337723031.html
10-03-2021||World||Volunteers are key at Covid-19 vaccine sites. It pays off with a shot||When Seattle's largest health care system got a mandate from Washington state to create a mass Covid-19 vaccination site, organizers knew that gathering enough volunteers would be almost as crucial as the vaccine itself.“We could not do this without volunteers,” said Renee Rassilyer-Bomers, chief quality officer for Swedish Health Services and head of its vaccination site at Seattle University. “The sheer volume and number of folks that we wanted to be able to serve and bring in requires … 320 individuals each day."As states ramp up vaccination distribution in the fight against the coronavirus, volunteers are needed to do everything from direct traffic to check people in so vaccination sites run smoothly. In return for their work, they're often given a shot. Many people who don't yet qualify for a vaccine — including those who are young and healthy — have been volunteering in hopes of getting a dose they otherwise may not receive for months. Large vaccination clinics across the country have seen thousands trying to nab limited numbers of volunteer shifts.It's raised questions at a time when supplies are limited and some Americans have struggled to get vaccinated even if they are eligible. But medical ethicists say volunteers are key to the public health effort and there's nothing wrong with them wanting protection from the virus.Ben Dudden, 35, of Roanoke, Virginia, volunteered at a mass vaccination clinic in the nearby city of Salem on a day off from his part-time job at the Roanoke Pinball Museum. His wife, a nurse practitioner who was administering doses, encouraged him to volunteer in case he could get vaccinated.He spent that January day helping people fill out questionnaires, not knowing if he might get the coveted dose.“It wasn’t an official thing like, ‘Everybody who needs a vaccine come this way.’ I kind of had to ask,” Dudden said. “At end of day, I found whoever was in charge of that.”He got what he was hoping for and still wants to volunteer again.“It was a little bit of a selfish thing — ‘I’m gonna get the vaccine if I do this’ — but for me, it wasn’t the only factor,” Dudden said.At the Seattle vaccination clinic, Swedish Health Services considers volunteers part of the state's Phase 1 vaccination group. About 5,000 have been inoculated, and about 1,000 of them have come back to work again, Rassilyer-Bomer said.During their shifts, volunteers are handed colored vests matched to their skill level and experience. The majority wear orange for general tasks, which includes sanitizing clipboards, asking people to fill out forms, taking temperatures and monitoring the newly vaccinated to ensure no dangerous side effects.Some may question whether it’s fair for volunteers to get to the front of the line for what’s often clerical work.Nancy Berlinger, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center, a research institute in Garrison, New York, said the bottom line is that volunteers are interacting with the public and there’s nothing wrong with them wanting protection.They also go through training and other obligations.“There would be easier ways to game the system,” Berlinger said. “If that was really your goal, this could take more work I think than some other routes I can think of.”While many volunteer shifts are several hours on weekdays, Berlinger said that doesn’t necessarily mean only people of a certain class or demographic can sacrifice that much time.“That could apply to students, it could apply to people who are unemployed, people who are retired. It could be people who are family caregivers,” Berlinger said.On a chilly January night in suburban Phoenix, Lou Ann Lovell, a 67-year-old retiree, got the Pfizer vaccine after volunteering from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. at a state-run site at State Farm Stadium, where the Arizona Cardinals play. Her daughter persuaded her and other relatives to volunteer.Lovell committed before realizing those 65 and older would be eligible for vaccines days later. Still, she’s glad she did.“For the first time, I felt I was part of something that was really important and big,” said Lovell, who has since volunteered a second time and hopes to do it a third. “You stand there and see all these headlights and people are just continually pouring in there.”The stadium and another state-run site in metro Phoenix require a combined 3,900 volunteers a week. HandsOn Greater Phoenix, a nonprofit handling online volunteer recruitment, opens 1,400 to 2,000 spots a few times a week, and interest hasn't waned, CEO Rhonda Oliver said. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people try to sign up every time new spots open, she said.Volunteers who have nabbed shifts say they shouldn’t be lumped in with those who believe they’re entitled to a vaccine.In the Seattle area, three King County hospitals came under fire last month after revelations that donors, board members and some hospital volunteers used their connections to get shots. The King County Council approved a measure calling on state lawmakers and Gov. Jay Inslee to make it illegal to grant special access to the vaccine.Berlinger said there’s a clear delineation between a connected official and a volunteer at a vaccine clinic getting a shot.“The volunteers we’re talking about at registration centers are people who are part of the public health effort. They are performing a crucial role,” Berlinger said. “It’s easier to help people who already have privilege. The thing about COVID is we have to push away from that and we have to say, ‘No, we must allocate vaccine and vaccination.'”Lovell, the retired volunteer in Arizona, said critics should target the healthy 20-somethings she saw trying to get the vaccine the night she volunteered.“If you want to volunteer, volunteer and work," she said. "If you say, ‘I don’t want to do that,’ then wait until your number comes up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteers-are-key-at-covid-19-vaccine-sites-it-pays-off-with-a-shot-101615337094232.html

This is where the Earth Fund will be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-plans-to-spend-10-billion-on-climate-change-by-2030-101615336759531.html
10-03-2021||World||Dallas cop charged in alleged murder was under investigation in 2017: Report||A Dallas police officer charged in an alleged murder-for-hire scheme was being investigated for longer than authorities have previously acknowledged, sharpening questions about why he continued to patrol the city while under investigation for the 2017 killings.After Bryan Riser was arrested, former Dallas police Chief U. Reneé Hall said he was “first identified as a person-of-interest in 2019” and was kept on the job to avoid tipping him off to the investigation. But in 2017, a Dallas police detective testified in court that Riser was the “subject” of an investigation into the killing of 31-year-old Liza Saenz, according to a transcript of the proceeding.Riser was charged last week with two counts of capital murder in the killings of Saenz and 61-year-old Albert Douglas. He is being held on a $5 million bond and his attorney, Toby Shook, said the 36-year-old officer is innocent.During the September 2017 court hearing, the detective also said Saenz lived with Riser’s father and that before her death she had been a witness in another murder case. The testimony, which was first reported by the Dallas Morning News, came during a detention hearing in a federal drug case against Riser’s dad, Byron Riser.Shook previously said Saenz lived with the elder Riser at one point, but that his client “didn’t have a relationship with” her.Byron Riser pleaded guilty in 2018 to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance and was sentenced to five years in prison. He’s currently at a residential re-entry center in Texas on community supervision, Shook said.Bryan Riser's arrest was announced Thursday by police Chief Eddie Garcia, who took over the department last month after Hall resigned at the end of 2020. During a news conference, Garcia said Riser became a “suspect” in the case in 2019 and sought to distinguish that from being “a person of interest.”“I think the community should know that this police department wants to be as thorough as possible because we certainly don't want someone slipping through the cracks that has no business wearing this uniform,” Garcia said. He added that the department was reviewing Riser's arrests.Garcia fired Riser for “adverse conduct” on Tuesday, according to a statement from the department. A police spokeswoman, Cpl. Melinda Gutierrez, declined to comment on emailed questions about the 2017 testimony.Authorities have alleged that Riser offered to pay three men to kidnap and kill Douglas and Saenz. The men were later charged with capital murder and one of them came forward and implicated Riser in 2019, according to an affidavit for the officer's arrest.During his 2017 testimony, Detective Kevin Whitworth said he began investigating the officer after the father of Saenz’s child was convicted in a separate murder case.Saenz was supposed to convince witnesses not to testify, Whitworth said, and after the father of her child was found guilty someone was heard in the courtroom blaming her. The detective said Saenz’s body was pulled from a river in southwest Dallas not long after that.He said Riser came under scrutiny because of phone calls around that time between him, his father and “the main suspect” in Saenz’s killing.Shook said Riser knew one of the men charged in Saenz’s killing, Emmanuel Kilpatrick, from high school and that they reconnected in 2017 after a chance encounter. Kilpatrick, 34, is now serving life in prison for the killings of a father and son.The defense lawyer said that case against Riser has “several red flags,” including being based on the word of someone who has “all the reason in the world to lie and try to gain an advantage by trying to implicate a police officer."On Monday, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson formed a City Council committee to investigate why Riser continued to serve while under investigation. The seven-member committee is empowered to subpoena witnesses and compel city employees to turn over records.“This is an awful situation, and the public deserves answers regarding who knew what, when they knew it, and why the officer remained on active duty,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dallas-cop-charged-in-alleged-murder-was-under-investigation-in-2017-report-101615336387529.html
10-03-2021||World||Hackers access 150,000 security cams' live feed, expose Tesla, jails, hospitals||A group of hackers say they breached a massive trove of security-camera data collected by Silicon Valley startup Verkada Inc., gaining access to live feeds of 150,000 surveillance cameras inside hospitals, companies, police departments, prisons and schools.Companies whose footage was exposed include carmaker Tesla Inc. and software provider Cloudflare Inc. In addition, hackers were able to view video from inside women’s health clinics, psychiatric hospitals and the offices of Verkada itself. Some of the cameras, including in hospitals, use facial-recognition technology to identify and categorize people captured on the footage. The hackers say they also have access to the full video archive of all Verkada customers.In a video seen by Bloomberg, a Verkada camera inside Florida hospital Halifax Health showed what appeared to be eight hospital staffers tackling a man and pinning him to a bed. Halifax Health is featured on Verkada’s public-facing website in a case study entitled: “How a Florida Healthcare Provider Easily Updated and Deployed a Scalable HIPAA Compliant Security System.”Another video, shot inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai, shows workers on an assembly line. The hackers said they obtained access to 222 cameras in Tesla factories and warehouses.The data breach was carried out by an international hacker collective and intended to show the pervasiveness of video surveillance and the ease with which systems could be broken into, said Tillie Kottmann, one of the hackers who claimed credit for breaching San Mateo, California-based Verkada. Kottmann, who uses they/them pronouns, previously claimed credit for hacking chipmaker Intel Corp. and carmaker Nissan Motor Co. Kottmann said their reasons for hacking are “lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism -- and it’s also just too much fun not to do it.”“We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorized access,” a Verkada spokesperson said in a statement. “Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement.”A person with knowledge of the matter said Verkada’s chief information security officer, an internal team and an external security firm are investigating the incident. The company is working to notify customers and set up a support line to address questions, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.Representatives of Tesla, Cloudflare and other companies identified in this story didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives of the jails, hospitals and schools named in this article either declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.A video seen by Bloomberg shows officers in a police station in Stoughton, Massachusetts, questioning a man in handcuffs. The hackers say they also gained access to the security cameras of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed more than 20 people in 2012.Also available to the hackers were 330 security cameras inside the Madison County Jail in Huntsville, Alabama. Verkada offers a feature called “People Analytics,” which lets a customer “search and filter based on many different attributes, including gender traits, clothing color, and even a person’s face,” according to a Verkada blog post. Images seen by Bloomberg show that the cameras inside the jail, some of which are hidden inside vents, thermostats and defibrillators, track inmates and correctional staff using the facial-recognition technology. The hackers say they were able to access live feeds and archived video, in some cases including audio, of interviews between police officers and criminal suspects, all in the high-definition resolution known as 4K.Kottmann said their group was able to obtain “root” access on the cameras, meaning they could use the cameras to execute their own code. That access could, in some instances, allow them to pivot and obtain access to the broader corporate network of Verkada’s customers, or hijack the cameras and use them as a platform to launch future hacks. Obtaining this degree of access to the camera didn’t require any additional hacking, as it was a built-in feature, Kottmann said.The hackers’ methods were unsophisticated: they gained access to Verkada through a “Super Admin” account, allowing them to peer into the cameras of all of its customers. Kottmann says they found a user name and password for an administrator account publicly exposed on the internet. After Bloomberg contacted Verkada, the hackers lost access to the video feeds and archives, Kottmann said.The hackers say they were able to peer into multiple locations of the luxury gym chain Equinox. At Wadley Regional Medical Center, a hospital in Texarkana, Texas, hackers say they looked through Verkada cameras pointed at nine ICU beds. Hackers also say they watched cameras at Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital, in Arizona, and were also able to see a detailed record of who used Verkada access control cards to open certain doors, and when they did so. A representative of Wadley declined to comment.The hack “exposes just how broadly we’re being surveilled, and how little care is put into at least securing the platforms used to do so, pursuing nothing but profit,” Kottmann said. “It’s just wild how I can just see the things we always knew are happening, but we never got to see.” Kottman said they gained access to Verkada’s system on Monday morning.Verkada, founded in 2016, sells security cameras that customers can access and manage through the web. In January 2020, it raised $80 million in venture capital funding, valuing the company at $1.6 billion. Among the investors was Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley’s oldest firms.Kottmann calls the hacking collective “Advanced Persistent Threat 69420,” a light-hearted reference to the designations cybersecurity firms give to state sponsored hacking groups and criminal cybergangs.In October 2020, Verkada fired three employees after reports surfaced that workers had used its cameras to take pictures of female colleagues inside the Verkada office and make sexually explicit jokes about them. Verkada CEO Filip Kaliszan said in a statement to Vice at the time that the company “terminated the three individuals who instigated this incident, engaged in egregious behavior targeting coworkers, or neglected to report the behavior despite their obligations as managers.”Kottmann said they were able to download the entire list of thousands of Verkada customers, as well as the company’s balance sheet, which lists assets and liabilities. As a closely held company, Verkada does not publish its financial statements. Kottman said hackers watched through the camera of a Verkada employee who had set one of the cameras up inside his home. One of the saved clips from the camera shows the employee completing a puzzle with his family.“If you are a company who has purchased this network of cameras and you are putting them in sensitive places, you may not have the expectation that in addition to being watched by your security team that there is some admin at the camera company who is also watching,” said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who was briefed on the breach by Bloomberg.Inside Arizona’s Graham County detention facility, which has 17 cameras, videos are given titles by the center’s staff and saved to a Verkada account. One video, filmed in the “Commons Area,” is titled “ROUNDHOUSE KICK OOPSIE.” A video filed inside the “Rear Cell Block” is called “SELLERS SNIFFING/KISSING WILLARD???” Another video, filmed inside “Drunk Tank Exterior” is titled “AUTUMN BUMPS HIS OWN HEAD.” Two videos filmed from “Back Cell” are titled “STARE OFF - DONT BLINK!” and “LANCASTER LOSES BLANKET.”The hackers also obtained access to Verkada cameras in Cloudflare offices in San Francisco, Austin, London and New York. The cameras at Cloudflare’s headquarters rely on facial recognition, according to images seen by Bloomberg.Security cameras and facial-recognition technology are often used inside corporate offices and factories to protect proprietary information and guard against an insider threat, said the EFF’s Galperin.“There are many legitimate reasons to have surveillance inside of a company,” Galperin added. “The most important part is to have the informed consent of your employees. Usually this is done inside the employee handbook, which no one reads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-access-150-000-security-cams-live-feed-expose-tesla-jails-hospitals-101615335334179.html

Not all of the ratings are in, and CBS licensed the interview to air in more than 80 territories, the network said.In the United States, the interview was seen by 17.8 million people on CBS, the Nielsen company said. It aired a night later in Britain, where ITV said it had 13.3 million viewers, a huge number for a smaller country.CBS said the interview will be shown again Friday, from 8 to 10 pm.Also Read: Queen Elizabeth responds to Harry and Meghan's racism accusationsIt was still a topic of conversation on Tuesday. In Britain, former CNN personality Piers Morgan quit the “Good Morning, Britain” program following a furor over comments he made criticizing the Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.

10-03-2021||World||China launches Covid travel pass||China has launched a digital Covid-19 vaccination certificate for its citizens planning cross-border travels, joining other countries issuing similar documents as they seek ways to reopen their economies.As vaccines are globally being rolled out, a few countries including Bahrain have already introduced certificates identifying vaccinated people, and the EU agreed to develop vaccine passports under pressure from tourism-dependent southern countries.The certificate issued by China will have details about the holder’s Covid-19 vaccination information and coronavirus test results, the department of consular affairs under China’s foreign ministry said.Pfizer shot neutralises Brazilian strain in labThe Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech showed a high ability to neutralise coronavirus strains first detected in Brazil, the UK and South Africa, according to a new study.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn lab experiments, the shot demonstrated “roughly equivalent” levels of neutralising activity against the Brazil and UK strains compared with a version of the virus from early last year. It also showed “robust but lower” activity against the South Africa variant, according to a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.The research was supported by Pfizer and BioNTech and performed by scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas.More than 700,000 lives have been lost to Covid-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean since the pandemic began, according to an AFP tally on Monday evening from official sources. The region, which encompasses 34 countries and territories in South and Central America and the Caribbean plus Mexico, recorded 700,022 deaths - the second-highest number of virus fatalities after Europe. Brazil and Mexico account for two-thirds of the region’s coronavirus deaths.For the first time in nearly three and a half months, the United States recorded fewer than 1,000 deaths in a day from Covid-19 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University. In 24 hours, 749 people died from the coronavirus, far below the peak of 4,473 deaths recorded on January 12.Disinfectant spray for journalistsPoliticians are often accused of sanitising the news.

10-03-2021||World||10 years after Fukushima, Japan remembers ‘man-made’ disaster||When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11, 2011, devastating towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, a stunned world watched the chaotic struggle to contain the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.An onslaught of waves sparked by the 9.0-magnitude quake crashed into the northeastern coast, killing nearly 20,000 people and crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. More than 160,000 residents fled as radiation spewed into the air.At the time, some – including Prime Minister Naoto Kan – feared Tokyo would need to be evacuated, or worse.“Fukushima is stamped for the rest of the history of nuclear energy,” said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, head of an investigation that concluded the disaster was “profoundly man-made”.The government has spent about $300 billion to rebuild the tsunami-devastated Tohoku region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere.Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.Energy policy was left in limbo after Shinzo Abe led his pro-nuclear energy Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) back to power the year after the disaster, ousting the novice Democratic Party of Japan, whose image was tainted by its handling of Fukushima.‘Result of collusion’Kurokawa’s commission, appointed by parliament, concluded in 2012 that the Fukushima accident was “the result of collusion between the government, regulators and Tokyo Electric Power Co” and a lack of governance. Abe resigned last year, citing poor health, and his successor, Yoshihide Suga, has announced a goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.Proponents say nuclear power is vital to decarbonisation. Critics say cost, safety and the challenge of storing nuclear waste are all reasons to avoid it.“Those talking about atomic power are people in the ‘nuclear village’, who want to protect their vested interests,” former PM Kan said last week.The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers. A February Asahi newspaper survey found that nationwide, 53% are opposed to restarting reactors, compared with 32% in favour.“Ten years have passed and some people have forgotten. The zeal is gone,” said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo political science professor. “Restarts are not happening, so people think if they just wait, nuclear power will disappear.”Nuclear future bleak?Only nine of Japan’s 33 remaining reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.Nuclear power supplied just 6% of Japan’s energy needs in the first half of 2020 compared with 23.1% for renewable sources – far behind Germany’s 46.3% – and nearly 70% for fossil fuels.Extending the lifespan of Japan’s 33 existing commercial reactors to 60 years, there would be only 18 in 2050 and none by 2069, said Takeo Kikkawa, an adviser to the government on energy policy.“Japan is a resource-poor country so we should not casually abandon the nuclear option,” Kikkawa said. “But in reality, the future of nuclear power is bleak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-years-after-fukushima-japan-remembers-man-made-disaster-101615321493301.html

This will be the first batch of Covishield, the vaccine developed by the Serum Institute Of India (SII), to reach India's neighbouring country.  The doses will be received under an agreement with Gavi, the vaccine alliance, the report said, adding that additional 16 million doses will be received by June this year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA total of 27.5m people, including frontline workers and senior citizens, have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in Pakistan, Federal secretary of the Ministry of national health services regulations and coordination Aamir Ashraf Khawaja said in a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The meeting was headed by PAC chairperson Rana Tanveer Hussain.The government has decided to prioritise health workers and people over the age of 65 for vaccination, Khawaja said. Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries, had signed an agreement with Pakistan to provide Covid-19 vaccine in September 2020, the report said. According to the health secretary, it was expected earlier that the vaccine doses would arrive under the agreement in the first week of March but the dispatch got delayed.China-made vaccine CanSino, which would cost USD 13 or around Pakistani Rs2,000 per person, had completed its phase-three trials in Pakistan with 75 per cent efficacy and a total of 18,000 people were inoculated using the vaccine, news agency ANI said, quoting a report from The Express Tribune.According to the health authorities, no serious buyers from the private sector had come forward as the applications received so far were incomplete. The applicants, authorities said, had not even stated which vaccine and how many doses they wanted to import, and where they planned to administer them, the news agency further reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-get-45-million-doses-of-indian-made-vaccine-via-gavi-report-101615316097270.html
10-03-2021||World||China hasn’t withdrawn from several LAC positions, says top US commander||China still hasn’t withdrawn from “several forward positions” it seized during clashes with Indian forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), a top US military commander told lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Tuesday.Admiral Philip S. Davidson, who commands the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command, also told lawmakers that the US had helped India over its border conflict by providing information, cold-weather clothing and other equipment.“The PLA has not yet withdrawn from several forward positions it seized following the initial clash, and the consequent escalation of tensions between the PRC and India has resulted in casualties on both sides,” Davidson said in prepared remarks at a Senate hearing on the US Indo-Pacific Command.The Chinese and Indian armed forces completed the withdrawal of their respective troops from parts of the disputed border in Ladakh - around Pangong Tso - in late February after protracted negotiations.The US commander described Chinese aggression on the LAC as a manifestation of Beijing’s “expansionary territorial ambitions”.He added that the “large-scale mobilisation - which is particularly notable considering the elevation, terrain, and distance involved - has stoked regional concerns that the PRC will increasingly use force to achieve desired outcomes”.Davidson held China responsible for starting the border clashes. “The standoff was predicated by clashes over construction activities near the disputed border. PLA ground manoeuvre and support elements subsequently forward-deployed roughly 50,000 soldiers along the LAC, leading to a counter-deployment by the Indian Army,” he said.Davidson went on to say that the border conflict with China has “opened their (India’s) eyes to what cooperative effort with others might mean for their own defensive needs”.“I think you’ll see India in the very near term, you know, remain committed to their nonaligned approach, but I think they will deepen their engagement with the Quad, and I think that’s a key strategic opportunity for us, Australia and Japan,” the US admiral added.Davidson spoke at length about US military ties with India. The current relationship “presents a historic opportunity to deepen ties and solidify what I consider the ‘defining partnership of the 21st century’,” he said, using a phrase popularised by former US president Barack Obama for the bilateral relationship.He went on to recount the three foundational agreements signed by the two countries in recent years: increasing military cooperation; growing defence purchases by India from the US; and joint exercises.He concluded that the US “defines the security relationship with India as a strategic imperative”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hasn-t-withdrawn-from-several-lac-positions-says-top-us-commander-101615314444113.html
10-03-2021||India||Isaac, 4 big Kerala names not fielded||Thiruvananthapuram: The Communist Party of India (Marxist), the dominant party in the incumbent Left Democratic Front government in Karala, has denied tickets to five ministers, including finance minister Thomas Isaac citing the party’s two-term criteria. It has also dropped 33 legislators and picked new faces in a bid to reach out to the women and younger voters in the state which goes to polls on April 6. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and seven other cabinet ministers are among the 83 candidates announced by acting party secretary A Vijayaraghavan on Wednesday. The party is contesting 85 seats in the 140-member assembly, with its allies contesting the rest. The result of the elections will be announced on May 2.“The party will declare candidates for Mancheswaram in north Kerala and Devikulam in Idukki later,” Vijayaraghavan said.While Vijayan is seeking re-election from Dharmadom in north Kerala’s Kannur district, party heavyweights Isaac, PWD minister G Sudhakaran, law minister AK Balam, education minister C Raveendranath, industry minister E P Jayarajan and speaker P Sivaramakrishnan were denied tickets. According to people familiar with the matter, Isaac is likely to be sent to the Rajya Sabha. Reacting to his name being dropped from the list, Isaac said, “It is a natural process in the party, fresh faces will have to come up. Continuation of power is certain.” He was a law-maker from Alapuzha since 2001 and under the party’s convention that legislators who have won twice in a row will not be fielded, will sit this election out. Several posters surfaced in Alappuzha over the last two days targeting the party for denying a ticket to Isaac. The finance minister represents the Alappuzha assembly constituency. Distancing himself from the posters, Isaac said those behind them are “not real party lovers or workers ”. He added that party will initiate an inquiry into the matter. While the list included party secretary Vijayaraghavan’s wife R Bindu, who will contest from Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district, law minister AK Balan’s wife PK Jameela was not selected to contest from Tarur. “She [Jameela] was not in the reckoning. Her candidature was speculation,” Balan said after the list was announced. In north Kerala’s Kutiyadi, angry party workers took out a procession on Wednesday urging the leadership to not give the seat to Kerala Congress (Mani), a new entrant in the LDF. Seeking to underplay the displeasure over the list, the party secretary said the candidates were selected keeping in mind the aim of coming back to power to “strengthen the fight for secular causes at the national level”. The party was forced to forego some of the seats to accommodate new allies, he said. “In coalition politics we have to make certain sacrifices. Last time we contested in 92 seats. Now the list is out, victory is our only aim,” Vijayaraghavan said. Ministers MM Mani and J Mercikutty Amma, were exempted from the party’s two-term criteria. This, the party secretary said, was done after weighing the winnability of the leaders. “The party is trying to give chances to new persons who are equally talented, but there is a conscious campaign from certain quarters that it (the tw-term criteria) was to exclude some persons,” Vijayaraghavan said.Noting that the party has picked qualified persons for the elections, Vijayaraghavan said 42 of them are graduates, 24, post-graduates, two, Phd holders, and that the list includes an architect and two practicing doctors. As many as 12 women and four people below the age of 30 years are among the candidates.CPI, an ally in the ruling Left Democratic Front, announced on Tuesday that it will contest 25 seats and declared candidates for 21 seats. In the 2016 polls, the LDF won 91 seats in the 140-member assembly. “The list reflects qualification of many candidates is proximity to the CM. Local leaders were given prominence and it seems to be a calculated move. Dissent reported from many areas show cadres are not happy,” said political theorist and writer J Reghu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isaac-4-big-kerala-names-not-fielded-101615400849422.html

The 27-year-old refused again, and then resigned from the force.On March 1, he said he left his home and family behind in Khampat and travelled for three days, mostly at night to avoid detection, before crossing into India’s northeastern state Mizoram.“I had no choice,” Tha Peng told Reuters on Tuesday, speaking via a translator. He gave only part of his name to protect his identity. Reuters saw his police and national ID cards, which confirmed the name.Tha Peng said he and six colleagues all disobeyed the February 27 order from a superior officer, whom he did not name. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.The description of events was similar to that given to police in Mizoram on March 1 by another Myanmar police lance corporal and three constables who crossed into India, according to a classified internal police document. The document was written by Mizoram police officials and gives biographical details of the four individuals and their account of why they fled.“As the Civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum and protest(s) held by anti-coup protesters at different places we are instructed to shoot at the protesters,” they said in a joint statement to Mizoram police. “In such a scenario, we don’t have the guts to shoot at our own people who are peaceful demonstrators,” they said.Myanmar’s military, which staged a coup on February 1 and deposed the country’s civilian government, did not respond to a request for comment.Around 100 people from Myanmar have crossed over a porous border into India since the protests began, according to a senior Indian official. Several have taken shelter in Mizoram’s Champhai district.Ngun Hlei, who said he was posted as a police constable in Mandalay, said he had also received orders to shoot. Ngun Hlei said he was reprimanded for disobeying orders and transferred.He sought help from activists online and found his way by road to Mizoram’s Vaphai village on March 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/refused-to-shoot-myanmar-constable-who-fled-from-a-coup-101615400579994.html
10-03-2021||India||Vaccination centre for MPs gets lukewarm response||New Delhi: A dedicated vaccination centre for MPs inside the Parliament complex has seen a lukewarm response so far, with just 46 lawmakers having been inoculated till Wednesday afternoon, according to officials aware of the matter. The centre started functioning on March 9 and will continue for the rest of the session, which is likely to end on March 25.To be sure, this is not the only facility for MPs to get vaccinated as they can also avail designated Covid vaccination centres in their own constituencies or home states. “The special centre has been created as all MPs would be in Parliament for the session and they can easily get the Covid jabs in the Parliament complex itself,” said a senior official. Several senior ministers, including defence minister Rajnath Singh and home minister Amit Shah, have already been administered the first dose before the vaccination centre was set up. Apart from the 46 sitting MPs, spouses of 7 lawmakers and one former MPs took the vaccine at the centre managed by government medical workers, officials said. Nearly half the MPs are eligible to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the second phase of vaccination that got underway. Out of the 777 sitting members, 366 are above the age of 60 and meet the criteria for vaccination in the current phase. MPs who are above 45 but suffer from senior comorbidities are also eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, though it was not specified how many would qualify in this category.On the first two days of the centre being opened, 28 Lok Sabha MPs and 18 Rajya Sabha MPs took the vaccine -- 36 on the March 9 and just two on March 10. This included two ministers, Ratanlal Kataria and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, and some senior parliamentarians such as Radha Mohan Singh, Virendra Kumar, Om Prakash Mathur, Vijay Baghel and ET Mohammed Basheer. “The aim is to ensure all MPs get vaccinated. Even if they go and take it elsewhere too, the larger objective is served,” said a third official.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first to take a shot -- the indigenously developed Covaxin -- at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on March 1, the day vaccination started for eligible members of the general public after being restricted to health care and frontline workers since the drive began on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-centre-for-mps-gets-lukewarm-response-101615400729472.html
10-03-2021||India||RSS worker to CM: Tracing Tirath Singh Rawat’s political journey||Dehradun: The new chief minister of Uttarakhand, Tirath Singh Rawat, was born in Seeron village in the state’s Pauri Garhwal district in 1964, and has worked his way up after spending a lifetime in public life, starting when he was still a teenager. Rawat’s first foray into public life was with the RSS as its pracharak from 1983 to 1988. Rawat, a postgraduate in sociology from Birla Campus Srinagar and a diploma-holder in journalism, entered student politics and became the organisational secretary of ABVP Uttarakhand unit, and the national secretary of ABVP in early 1990s. He was also the president of the student union at Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in 1992. He became the state vice president of Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in 1996. Rawat, an MP from Garhwal and former state BJP president and state education minister, was named CM in the legislature party meeting held here on Wednesday morning and took oath at 4.05 in the afternoon. Rawat participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation for the construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya -- the foundation ceremony was held last year, after a favourable court ruling in 2019 -- and spent two months in jail.By 1997, he was an up-and-coming politician and was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council, but he was keen on statehood for Uttarakhand, then part of UP and actively participated in the campaign for this, BJP leaders who have known him for years said. When Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, he became the state’s first education minister and remained so till 2002. In 2007, he was elected as the state general secretary of Uttarakhand BJP. In 2012, Rawat was elected as MLA from Chaubattakhal assembly seat from his native Pauri Garhwal district, and the following year (February 2013) he was appointed as the president of Uttarakhand BJP . He remained state president of the party till December 2015. In 2017, he was not given the ticket from Chaubattakhal seat, which was was given to Satpal Maharaj, who left the Congress and joined the BJP, but he was named a national secretary of the party. In May 2019, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Pauri Lok Sabha Seat, after defeating his rival Manish Khanduri, his political guru BC Khanduri’s son, by over 3.5 lakh votes. In the same year, he was also made in-charge of the elections in Himachal Pradesh Rawat expressed his gratitude to the Central leadership including PM Narendra Modi, recalled his RSS days, and spoke of how a meeting with former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee influenced his politics. “I will continue to work on the development programmes introduced by (outgoing CM) Trivendra Singh Rawat so as to ensure the victory in next assembly elections”, he said .The state goes to polls in a year. Rashami Rawat, wife of Tirath Singh Rawat, said that on Tuesday night, when several other names were doing the rounds as possible contenders for the top spot, she received calls asking why Rawat was not among them. “ I told them to wait. Because I knew that party would give him the responsibility. He has struggled a lot and never cared about money. Because of his work in RSS, he was sent to ABVP and later to BJP”. Rawat ‘s local roots and long years in public life should help him, analysts said. Raj Kumar, a resident of Pauri Garhwal said he has known and admired Rawat for his simplicity and maturity. “We are very happy that a leader from our district and that too such a humble one, has been given the reins of the state.” Dinesh Arya, BJP leader and Rawat’s friend in Kumaon said that between 2007 to 2010, the new CM was district in-charge of Nainital “Then I was the district president of Nainital. I saw up close how good he was at managing the cadre and organisational issues very efficiently and democratically. He is down-to-earth and listens to the party cadre. When he became the state BJP president, he used to listen to every worker .” (with inputs from Vipin Negi and Ankur Sharma)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-worker-to-cm-tracing-tirath-singh-rawat-s-political-journey-101615399229343.html

The Indian side has expressed concern about a vacuum being created by any sudden drawdown of US forces in the face of a resurgence by the Taliban.India will be the last leg of Austin’s three-nation tour that will also take him to Japan and South Korea as the US seeks to restore defence ties with key players around the world after the uncertainty of the Trump administration. Austin will begin the visit by travelling on Saturday to the US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii, where he will highlight his vision for the Indo-Pacific “as a priority theatre” for the defence department, a statement from the Pentagon said.“I’ll meet with my counterparts and other officials to discuss the importance of our alliances and partnerships, and together we'll reinforce the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” Austin tweeted.Austin will be joined in Japan by US secretary of state Antony Blinken for a 2+2 meeting of the defence and foreign ministers that will emphasise that the US-Japan alliance remains “the cornerstone of peace and security in a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of long-term competition with China”, the Pentagon said.Blinken and Austin will also join a 2+2 meeting of defence and foreign ministers in South Korea to “reaffirm the United States’ ironclad commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea”, the Pentagon said.The Indian defence ministry said Austin’s visit to New Delhi as “part of his first overseas travel emphasises the strength of India-US strategic partnership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-to-visit-india-soon-indo-pacific-on-agenda-101615394645190.html
10-03-2021||India||Centre agrees to set up more courts to clear backlog of cheque bounce cases||To expedite trial in cheque bounce cases, the Centre has agreed “in principle” to the suggestion by the Supreme Court to set up additional courts.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta conveyed this decision to a five-judge bench hearing a suo moto petition on measures to expedite trial in cheque bounce offences under the Negotiable Instruments Act. Earlier this month, the Court had termed the pendency of cheque bounce cases at all levels in the judiciary to be “grotesque” and urged the Centre to use its power under Article 247 of the Constitution to create additional courts for better administration of the Act.Mehta informed the Court that in principle, the Centre had no difficulty in setting up additional courts for trial of cheque bounce cases. Presently, these cases constitute 30 per cent of the criminal cases in trial courts and much more in the High Courts. The law officer informed the Court that modalities in this regard were still to be worked out.The five-judge bench also considered setting up a Committee headed by retired Bombay High Court judge, Justice RC Chavan to deliberate and work out steps needed in the court processes to facilitate early disposal of cases. Justice Chavan is currently the Vice-Chairman of the e-committee of the Supreme Court.The Justice Chavan Committee would further comprise of an officer not below Additional Secretary rank drawn from the Department of Financial Services, Department of Expenditure, Department of Justice, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Corporate Affairs and a representative from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In addition to this, the Court proposed having a nominee of the Indian Banks Association (IBA) in the Committee. As the names of the officers to be nominated to the Committee were not readily available, the bench posted the matter for Friday.The five-judge bench comprised of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices L Nageswara Rao, BR Gavai, AS Bopanna, and S Ravindra Bhat. To arrive at solutions to remedy the ill of grave pendency caused by the Negotiable Instruments Act, the CJI-headed bench had nominated senior advocate Sidharth Luthra and advocate K Parameshwar as amici curiae to examine the flaws existing in the system and propose remedial measures.The Committee submitted its preliminary report in October 2020 and later backed it with supplementary notes proposing a slew of measures for reforming the system. Setting up additional courts was one of the steps they had proposed. In addition, they demanded summary trial of cases, mediation and attachment of property to the extent of the cheque amount as steps to expedite trial in cheque bounce cases.The Court directed all suggestions and submissions made by the amici curiae, RBI and IBA to be forwarded to the Justice Chavan Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-agrees-to-set-up-more-courts-to-clear-backlog-of-cheque-bounce-cases-101615393485604.html
10-03-2021||India||Shortfall in revenue recorded over past three years: Railways||There has been a shortfall in revenue for the Railways in the last three years, the ministry of railways informed Parliament on Monday attributing the reason to drop in originating passengers, less loading of freight, very low growth in other coaching revenue and the Coronavirus pandemic during the current fiscal.Responding to a query in Lok Sabha, Union railway minister PiyushGoyal said that in 2020-21, to end of January 2021, total traffic revenue declined by ₹36,918.86 crore compared to the corresponding period of last year due to the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, consequential lockdown and partial operation of passenger services.For the year 2019-20 and 2020-21, Goyal attributed the shortfall in revenue to the adverse impact of Covid 19 pandemic and consequent lockdown on railway operations.He also said that the refund adjustment of over ₹2,000 crore in sundry revenue to RLDA and the complete shutdown of operations had hit revenue.He pointed out that remittance of dividend receipts from Railway PSUs to General Revenues which hitherto used to be part of Railways’ sundry revenue and lesser mobilisation under land monetisation also contributed to the shortfall.Listing the year-wise reasons for the shortfall in revenue, he said that in 2017-18 and 2018-2019 it was the drop in originating passengers – in non-suburban segment and drop in average sub-urban lead in actuals vis-a-vis the revised estimates, less loading in actuals vis-a-vis revised estimates (RE) and very low growth in other coaching revenue which resulted in the shortfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shortfall-in-revenue-recorded-over-past-three-years-railways-101615388195795.html
10-03-2021||India||Covaxin may be administered without consent form, expert panel recommends||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin can now be taken off the clinical trial mode, an expert panel of India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO) recommended on Wednesday, after Bharat Biotech submitted the initial results of the phase 3 trials of Covaxin which has been found to have around 81% efficacy against Covid-19.The clinical trial mode in which Covaxin was being administered since January 16 stoked a lot of controversies as beneficiaries had to sign a consent form for taking the vaccine shot. The consent form was mandated as Covaxin got the emergency use approval based on the results of phase 2 as the results of phase 3 trial were awaited."The SEC reviewed the interim phase-three trial data of Covaxin on Wednesday after which it recommended emergency use authorisation to the vaccine while removing the condition of it being required to be administered under the clinical trial mode," PTI quoted a source as saying.The recommendations have been sent to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) who will take the final decision. Once it is taken off the clinical trial mode, beneficiaries won't have to sign the consent form."In case of any serious adverse events, vaccine recipients will be provided medically recognized standard of care in the government designated and authorized centers/hospitals. The compensation for the serious adverse event will be paid by sponsor (BBIL) if the SAE is proven to be causally related to the vaccine. The compensation will be determined by the ICMR Central Ethics Committee, as appropriate," the consent form said.Reservations against Covaxin continued as Chhattisgarh health minister wrote to union health minister Harsh Vardhan requesting him to halt the supplies of the indigenous vaccine saying that there was no expiry date mentioned on the vial.In the first phase of vaccination which started on January 16, Covaxin doses remained unter-utilised. But as the second phase commenced with PM Modi taking the shot of Covaxin and several ministers following the suit, vaccination picked up the pace.Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech also published the preliminary results of phase 3 clinical trials. “Today is an important milestone in vaccine discovery, for science and our fight against coronavirus disease. With today’s results from our phase 3 clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from phase 1, 2, and 3 trials involving around 27,000 participants. Covaxin demonstrates a high clinical efficacy trend against Covid-19 but also significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants,” Krishna Ella, Bharat Biotech’s chairman and managing director, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-can-be-taken-off-clinical-trial-mode-says-expert-panel-101615392696180.html

The decision was made in a two-day Gond Mahasammelan which was held in Kabirdham district between March 6-7.The Gond leaders also passed a proposal which banned the consumption of alcohol in social gathering and marriage ceremonies. The Mahasammelan decided that a fine will be imposed if the rules are violated.A ‘constitution’ was prepared by the Gond community that also included a ban on dowry.“The Gond tribals worship ‘Prakriti’ ( Nature) hence we always try to save nature. Trees are cut and are being used for making pyres which is unnecessary and misuse of wood. Actually, Gonds started cremating bodies in the last few years but Mitti-Sanskaar (burying) was our tradition hence the community decided to include burying in our constitution,” said BPS Netam, president of Sarv Adivasi Samaj Chhattisgarh.Netam further claimed that Gonds of Bastar are still burying the body but in plain of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh some people, under the influence of other communities, have started cremating.As per the experts in many places of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, the Gonds bury the dead and erect a stone memorial, which describes the good deeds of the deceased.“These stones are still found in the villages of Bastar and some parts of Chhattisgarh. The decision to bury instead of cremating the deceased was taken earlier also in meetings and we are looking forward that the community will follow it,” Netam added.Hundreds of Gonds representatives from across the state and bordering Madhya Pradesh attended the Mahasammelan.According to 2011, the total tribal population in the state is 78,22,902, which is around 30.60 of the state’s population. Gonds are among the most populated tribals in Chhattisgarh in plains and Maoist-hit Bastar region.Naval Singh Mandavi, President of Gondwana Gond Mahasabha, who attended the Mahasammelan claimed that the aim is to return back to rituals.“As far dowry is concerned, in our community there is no such concept… We have to pay “Vadhu Mulya” , in which the groom’s family has to contribute for the expenses of the bride family. But some people started taking it hence Mahasabha has decided to ban the dowry,” said Mandavi.Explaining the ban on liquor consumption in marriage ceremonies and social gatherings of the Gond community, Mandavi said: “Though, ‘Mahua sharaab’ is in our tradition but the youth have started consuming excessive liquor... We have decided that only five people who will perform the rituals will consume liquor,” said Mandavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarhs-gond-tribe-decides-to-bury-dead-to-save-trees-101615391110524.html

10-03-2021||India||Election Commission seeks report on attack on Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram||The Election Commission on Wednesday sought a report from West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was attacked by four or five people. The EC has also sought a report from Vivek Dubey, special police observer and Ajay Nayak, special general observer, West Bengal.On Wednesday, Mamata filed her nomination from the Nandigram seat where she will be contesting against her former confidante Suvendu Adhikari. The 'clash of the titans' has made Nandigram the most-watched seat ahead of the election, but Wednesday's incident took the political tempers of the seat a notch higher.The incident took place at around 6.15pm when Mamata was about to leave Birulia after she offered her prayers at a temple. "I was standing outside my car with the door open. I was praying from there on seeing a temple. Few people came around my car and pushed the door. The door hit my leg," she said.She said the push was deliberate and there were no policemen around. As she complained of leg pain, her Nandigram stay was curtailed and she was brought to Kolkata for treatment at SSKM Hospital. A green corridor was created between Kolkata and Purba Medinipur to facilitate the unhindered return of her convoy.Banerjee said she was deliberately pushed by a group of youth, after which she complained of chest pain. There were no policemen around, the CM claimed.After being attacked, she was carried by her security personnel to the backseat of her SUV from the front seat. A white cloth was also wrapped around her injured leg.Mamata Banerjee is protected with Z-plus security and the attack seems "unbelievable" to many BJP leaders. "I think I will refrain from commenting. All of you are intelligent and have covered (reported on) such things all your life. Our didi is perturbed. These are signs of a defeated party and a defeated candidate. She will lose from Nandigram and there will be change in Bengal," Union minister Piyush Goyal said.BJP leader Arjun Singh said it was a drama for sympathy. “Is it Taliban that her convoy was attacked? A huge police force accompanies her. Who can get near her? Four IPS officers are her security in-charge and must be suspended. Attackers don’t appear out of no where, they have to be nabbed. She did drama for sympathy,” Singh said.Nandigram will go to the elections on April 1, in the second phase of the eight-phase elections. The first phase will be held on March 27. The results for the 294 assembly seats will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-seeks-report-on-attack-on-mamata-banerjee-in-nandigram-101615388926285.html
10-03-2021||India||Govt disregarding parliamentary convention by not letting Opposition raise issues: Congress||The Congress on Wednesday accused the government of disregarding parliamentary convention by not allowing the opposition to raise issues and said violation of the practice is striking at the root of democracy.It alleged that the opposition's voice was being "throttled" in Parliament and the government was not cooperating but instead throwing the constitutional rules and procedures in "tatters".Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, who is also the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of indulging in "self promotion" and said "there was a limit to getting oneself photographed"."We are told to abide by the Constitution but they are throwing the Constitution to the tatters. We are following constitutional means to seek discussions but they are not allowing us to discuss," he told a press conference.Alleging that their voice was being "throttled", he said, the Congress members tried to speak in Parliament for two days, but the government did not cooperate.His colleague and deputy leader of the Congress in Rajya Sabha, Anand Sharma, said the government has a "duty to answer and we have a right to ask questions".He said they were not allowed to raise issues concerning the public in the first half of the budget session."Parliamentary convention is being disregarded and we are not being allowed to raise even one issue of public importance," he alleged."The government is guilty of monumental mismanagement of the economy. It is not allowing normal functioning of Parliament. The Opposition is being denied the right to raise issues concerning the people of India," he further alleged.Sharma said be it Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha, the opposition must be given space and voice."Violation of this practice is striking at the root of democracy which will be opposed by us," he said."Some days are left for the budget session. The government must change its attitude and the country must hear their elected representatives and allow opposition parties to raise issues so that people can be reassured that their issues are being raised at the right forum," he said.Attacking the prime minister, Kharge said Modi thinks what he speaks is the truth, but the fact is whatever he did has undermined the financial state of the country, whether by fuel price hikes, whether demonetisation or the lockdown."Modi ji has a style. When the LPG cylinder scheme came, photos were around everywhere. The vaccine certificate also has his photo."There is a limit to everything, where to get pictured and when. But all the time if people indulge in self promotion, will democracy stay alive in India," he asked.Congress leader Deepender Hooda said matters of urgent national importance are taken up under Rule 267."Government has not said one word of sympathy for the protesting farmers who died during the agitation. No condolence should be shown to them," he said referring to around 300 farmers who died.Hooda alleged that the government first dubbed farmers as terrorists, then no condolences were given, their demands were trashed and today even the demand for a discussion was not taken up.Kharge alleged that the prime minister has pushed the poor to further poverty, while the rich are becoming richer and corporates are happy because government policies are helping them.He said the prices of petrol and diesel are rising constantly and the centre is not making any attempts to reduce the costs, but is imposing Excise duties on them."We have never had such high costs of petrol and diesel. Even kerosene costs are sky high. Our fight in Parliament was about this. We tried our very best to use rule 267 to discuss the matter in detail but the government was not ready," he said.Accusing the government of earning ₹21 lakh crore in the last six years, he said, "We wanted to ask where this money has been used and towards which welfare ends."Sharma said Parliament runs on rules and the country on the Constitution, and discussions were sought under rules on "profiteering by government" and rising prices of petrol and diesel.He said the farmers issue is also a burning issue as hundreds of farmers have died, even as he recalled how the opposition was not allowed division of votes when the bills were passed last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-disregarding-parliamentary-convention-by-not-letting-opposition-raise-issues-congress-101615387779247.html

Because of this, AOR is required for the foreign passengers, pilots and crew members coming to Pune by non-scheduled flights, said Prakash Kumar Singh, Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII), in the letter."According to current policy, certain rules related to AOR issuance cause huge inconvenience to these foreign passengers, pilots and crew members coming to Pune from any nation and even from any of our country's airport," he said.Suggesting a few amendments, Singh said there is no Naval Operations Routine (NOR) requirement for operations at Goa Airport for foreign passengers/crew members which is also a defence airfield and operates under the Indian Navy."In the same way, this policy needs to be adopted for operations at Pune airport also which is a defence airfield, so that there is no requirement of AOR for foreign passengers/crew members at the airport," he said.Singh further stated that AOR issuance services should be available round-the-clock online, even on weekends and public holidays."Foreign national passengers on VT registered aircraft are already in possession of valid travel documents (Visa, OCI Card) and thus an additional check is deemed unnecessary. We propose AOR should be issued to them instantaneously and be valid for a year," the letter stated.Singh further suggested that "AOR must be issued to foreign operating crew within a specified time frame any day of the week (we propose two hours) and should be valid for a year".He said foreign operating crew on foreign-registered aircraft have valid licenses from their competent issuing authority and the verification of the same is mere paperwork."In view of these facts and genuine difficulties, as a last resort, I humbly request for your kind intervention for the above amendments in AOR Policy in line with our prime minister's vision of 'ease of doing business in India' and to further encourage his dream project 'Making in India' for which we will be highly obliged," Singh stated in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-seeks-amit-shah-s-help-for-smooth-operations-of-non-scheduled-planes-in-pune-101615386472655.html

This freedom is not applicable to the common man. They have to protect themselves and their families," it said.It is good that the Centre is concerned about the rising COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, but what is it doing to help the state? the Sena asked."Due to the pandemic, the state has suffered revenue loss of more than ₹one lakh crore, per capita income has reduced, there is employment crisis," the Marathi daily said.Quoting the Union health ministry, the Sena said Maharashtra accounts for 56 per cent of the rise in COVID-19 cases in the country."Maharashtra doesn't hide the COVID-19 numbers," it added.The Sena also said poll-bound Tamil Nadu and Kerala are among the states where there has been a rise in COVID-19 numbers."The Union health ministry says there is no rise in COVID-19 cases in West Bengal.

We have invited the farmers’ leaders to Visakhapatnam on March 28 for a meeting with steel plant workers on how to go about with future course of action,” the trade union leader said.A decision to go on an indefinite strike effect was taken at the meeting of the Vizag Steel Plant Parirakshana Samithi, a joint action committee of the trade unions late on Tuesday night.Read more: Vizag steel privatisation plan snowballs into political issue in Andhra Pradesh“We shall serve the strike notice on the RINL management on Thursday. All the workers will go on indefinite strike on a date which will be decided later. We have also decided to constitute struggle committees with employees working in various departments of the steel plant and launch a campaign till March 19, preparing the workers for a long-drawn agitation,” J Ayodhya Ramu, president of Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the recognised trade union of the RINL, said.The meeting decided to hold a dharna in front of the steel plant on March 15. “On March 16 and 17, representatives of the trade unions will go to Delhi to represent our issue with floor leaders of all political parties and request them to take up our case in Parliament,” Ramu said.The JAC also decided to conduct a big rally in the name of “Karmika Garjana” (roar of the workers) at Trishna Grounds near the Steel City in Visakhapatnam on March 20. It would be attended by prominent national trade union leaders including G Sanjeeva Reddy of INTUC, Tapan Kumar Sen of CITU, Amarjeet Kaur of AITUC and Surendranath Pandey of BMS.The steel plant workers have intensified their agitation following a statement made by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman in the Lok Sabha on Monday, asserting that the Centre would go in for 100% disinvestment of Government of India’s shares in the RINL having a production capacity of 6.3 million tonnes per annum, products of which are used in the construction sector.The RINL has over 17,000 permanent employees and another 14,000 contract employees.The main reason for the disinvestment, according to the RINL management, was that the steel plant had been consistently making losses over a period of time. In 2017-18, it suffered a loss of ₹1,369 crore. Though it could recover briefly by making a net profit of ₹97 crore in 2018-19, it plunged into huge losses to the extent of ₹3,910 crore in 2019-20.The trade unions, however, say the losses were just an excuse to hand over the project to a private company. “The losses are mainly due to operational expenses, besides general slum in the steel market. The steel plant doesn’t have captive iron ore mines and it is forced to buy the iron ore at a higher cost, compared to the private steel plants which have their own captive mines,” the CITU leader said.While the cost of iron ore for private steel plants is around ₹1,500 per tonne, the RINL is buying the ore at not less than ₹5,000 per tonne. “We need 10 million tonnes of ore every year; which means the RINL is spending ₹3,500 crore in excess only on ore, compared to the private plants,” Ramu said.He said this financial year (2020-21) ending March 31, the losses of the steel plant are going to come down to ₹1,500 crore. “The fact that the company is wiping out the losses to the tune of ₹2,400 crore shows the company is functioning efficiently. Where is the need to privatise it?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-steel-plant-workers-to-go-on-strike-to-learn-from-farmers-agitation-101615382701490.html

BMC has requested the Centre to make necessary changes to its vaccination registration website Co-Win to facilitate 24x7 registration. The Centre, a few days ago, allowed 24 hours vaccination across the country. With this, 1 lakh people will be vaccinated every day in the BMC area, as with the current timing of 8-12 hours, around 35,000-40,000 people are getting vaccinated.As fresh Covid-19 infections are on the rise in Mumbai, the civic body is tightening its surveillance. Around 90 per cent of the new cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai in the last two months were recorded in housing societies, it said adding that strict action will be sanctioned against the residents of such societies who violate Covid-19 norms.BMC also said that residential buildings with more than five coronavirus patients will be sealed to bar any movement and buildings with less than five patients will not be sealed entirely but the floors on which the patients reside will be sealed. As of March 9, a total of 2,762 floors have been sealed in buildings to bar movement of 4,183 coronavirus patients.Maharashtra reported 9,927 fresh cases on Tuesday, taking the tally of infected people to 2,238,398. The capital city of Mumbai reported 1,012 new cases on Tuesday, continuing its week-long trend of reporting more than 1,000 cases a day.The BMC has been trying to enforce Covid-19 preventative behaviour to curb the number of cases. In a twitter post on March 9, the civic body had jokingly threatened to “gatecrash" weddings that flout pronounced norms for the “safety of Mumbai”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-covid-19-with-24x7-operation-bmc-aims-for-1lakh-vaccine-shots-daily-101615382541829.html
10-03-2021||India||Only half of urban slum households in 6 states use LPG exclusively: CEEW||About 50 per cent of urban slum households in six Indian states - including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar - use liquefied petroleum as (LPG) exclusively, according to a survey.The other four states surveyed are Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, CEEW's Cooking Energy Access Survey 2020 released on Wednesday said.The survey was conducted in urban slums across the six states. It covered 656 households across 83 notified and non-notified urban slums in 58 districts."Only half of the urban slum households in six Indian states use LPG exclusively. This is in spite of 86 per cent of urban slum households in these states having an LPG connection," according to the survey conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The six states account for nearly a quarter of India's urban slum population.Further, 16 per cent of the households are still using traditional fuels such as firewood, dung cakes, agriculture residue, charcoal, and kerosene as their primary fuel and over a third are stacking LPG with these polluting fuels. This increases exposure to indoor air pollution for such households."As part of the next phase of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the government must target poor households without an LPG connection in urban slums. Policymakers must also nudge oil marketing companies and distributors to improve home delivery of LPG refills in slum areas to increase exclusive use of LPG."Also, as the LPG refill prices rise, the government must target vulnerable households - beyond PMUY beneficiaries - with differential subsidy support for using LPG in a sustained manner," CEEW CEO Arunabha Ghosh said.A significant share of the urban slum population is struggling to afford using LPG for all their cooking, especially due to the rising fuel prices and the economic impact of the pandemic, Shaily Jha, Research Analyst at CEEW and lead author of the study, said."Given that the number of Ujjwala beneficiaries living in urban slums is low, the majority of slum households remain ineligible for relief support in the form of free cylinders under the PM-Garib Kalyan Yojana."We suggest that the major government programmes, such as the National Urban Livelihoods Mission and social service allocations for housing, should use existing targeting approaches to include access to clean cooking energy within their ambit of services for the poor," Jha said.The study also revealed that only about 45 per cent of households use LPG as their primary fuel in winter. Further, three-fourths of households using polluting fuels cook inside the main house and two-thirds do not have a chimney for ventilation.This indicates high exposure to household air pollution, primarily for women and children. Long-term exposure to emissions from biomass burning also makes the population more vulnerable to the severe risks of Covid-19 infection, the findings said.It further highlighted that 37 per cent of LPG-using slum households do not receive doorstep delivery of cylinders.The study has recommended leveraging platforms like LPG Panchayats to increase awareness regarding the process of subsidy calculation and disbursement for households.The intra-household decision making regarding refill purchase remains dominated by male members, increased awareness about actual expense on the refills may lead to improving women's bargaining power within the household.The Council on Energy, Environment and Water is one of Asia's leading not-for-profit policy research institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-half-of-urban-slum-households-in-6-states-use-lpg-exclusively-ceew-101615369994204.html

That's what happens in all political parties, Sharma said. The resignation comes at a time when there is a demand for an overhaul in the party. Chacko too pointed at the absence of democracy in the party as the reason behind his decision."Those who have to leave will leave, it happens in political parties. But the Congress party will show how it can unitedly fight in this elections. That will be the endeavour of the Congress," Sharma said.Congress Kerala MP Hibi Eden said Chacko was given ample opportunities by the Central leadership. "He(PC Chacko) is a very senior Congress leader who has been given ample opportunities by Central leadership. He's a valuable asset for INC. I don't think it was a wise decision at this crucial juncture where Congress is going into an important election," he said.As he resigned, PC Chako said the national leadership of the party has not been active for the last two years. He also levelled serious allegations of groupism in the party — one group headed by former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy and the other by senior party leader Ramesh Chennithala.He alleged that only these two people were aware of the candidates to be fielded in the polls on April 6. The list was not even discussed with the state Congress committee."This groupism is the biggest bane of the Congress party in Kerala. Kerala is facing a very crucial election and in this election, the people want the Congress to come back. But, the stumbling block is the groups which is practiced by top leaders of the Congress party", said Chacko.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-reaction-to-pc-chacko-s-exit-those-who-have-to-leave-will-leave-101615377143688.html

It didn’t mention for how long the taxes will apply.India first proposed taxes on solar power equipment imports in the middle of last year following virus-related supply chain disruptions and deadly border skirmishes with China, which supplies nearly 80% of India’s modules.Also read: India most favourable market for solar energy: ISA reportAs part of its strategy to transition to cleaner energy sources, India is planning to expand its renewable power capacity fivefold to 450 gigawatts by 2030. Some 280 gigawatts of that will come from solar, according to the ministry. The government sees the domestic solar manufacturing industry as vital to reaching that target, while the tax plan is also part of a broader push to help create jobs and revive an economy battered by the pandemic.India currently levies a 14.5% safeguard tax on imports of solar cells and modules from most countries, including China, which is set to expire in July. Companies bidding in project auctions should take into account the government’s new tax plans, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-tax-solar-module-imports-cut-dependence-on-foreign-supplies-101615367945723.html

Vice chairpersons will get ₹25,000 including ₹1,500 travel allowance and ₹500 telephone charges and members will get ₹15,000 including ₹1,500 travel allowance and ₹500 telephone charges."We have received a message from the Lt Governor, who is presently out of the station, and is coming back on March 12 for a meeting to address our genuine demands," DDC chairperson and senior BJP leader Bharat Bushan told reporters at Exhibition Ground here.Bushan was flanked by other DDC members affiliated with different parties including the Congress, National Conference, PDP, CPI(M) and independents who had assembled at the place to resume the protest this morning.Bushan said they are calling off the protest on the assurance of L-G Sinha that "injustice will be undone".Blaming bureaucrats for the protocol and power related fiasco, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and even the Lt Governor had in the past talked about strengthening of the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the Union Territory and ensured a three-tier system for the betterment of the people.Also read: J-K Lt Governor launches super-75 scholarship scheme for meritorious girls"We have formed a committee, composed mostly of DDC chairpersons from across the Union Territory, and they will hold the meeting with the Lt Governor.

10-03-2021||India||Pfizer wants to make Covid-19 vaccine in India if faster clearance, export freedom assured: Report||Pfizer Inc has told the Indian government it wants to produce its coronavirus vaccine locally if assured of faster regulatory clearance and freedom on pricing and exports, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The US company pulled an application last month seeking emergency approval for its product in India after the drug regulator declined its request to skip a small local safety trial. That has kept its vaccine, developed with Germany's BioNTech SE, out of one of the world's biggest drug markets.Pfizer was the first company to apply for emergency use authorisation in India, proposing to import doses from its US and European facilities instead of producing locally."US companies want to produce vaccines in India under joint ventures," said one of the sources, citing Pfizer and fellow US drugmaker Moderna Inc."They want faster approvals for clinical trials and emergency authorisation use. They fear the government will introduce price control policies."Another source confirmed Pfizer was interested in manufacturing in India but Reuters could not find a second confirmation on Moderna.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India's health ministry directed Reuters to the foreign ministry, which did not immediately respond to emailed queries.While withdrawing its application in early February, Pfizer said it would again seek emergency use approval to launch its Covid-19 vaccine in India, potentially a market of 1.35 billion people, and would provide more data as it becomes available.On the government's demand to manufacture in India, the company earlier told Reuters: "Once the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will evaluate all additional opportunities available."A Indian official told Reuters in January the government had held discussions with Pfizer and Moderna - both of which have reported more than 90% efficacy for their vaccines - to make the shots in India given its large pharmaceuticals capacity.The Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, is already bulk-manufacturing the Oxford University/AstraZeneca product and plans to start producing the Novavax Inc shot from next month.India's government has not allowed it to sell on the higher-priced private market, however, and is also controlling exports. Pfizer and Moderna, whose shots are more expensive than the AstraZeneca one being used in India's immunisation campaign, are not comfortable with strict price and export restrictions, one of the sources said.This week, Reuters reported that leaders of the Quad alliance - Australia, Japan, India and the United States - plan to announce financing agreements to increase India's vaccine manufacturing capacity at their first meeting on Friday.The initiative will mainly involve production of the Novavax and Johnson & Johnson shots for supplying to regions including Southeast Asia, where their common rival China is making gains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-wants-to-make-vaccine-in-india-if-faster-clearance-freedom-on-exports-101615377389352.html

He was also the president of the student union at Hemwati Nandan Garhwal University in 1992. Subsequently, he became the state vice president of Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.An MP from Pauri Garhwal and former state BJP president, Rawat was selected as party’s chief minister in the legislature party meeting held in Dehradun on Wednesday morning.Watch | Tirath Singh Rawat sworn-in as Uttarakhand CM: All you need to knowRawat participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation and spent two months in jail. He also actively participated in the agitation for statehood of Uttarakhand.He was elected as a member of Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council in 1997 and remained so till 2002.After Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, he became the first education minister of the newly formed state. In 2007, he was elected as the state general secretary of Uttarakhand BJP.In 2012, Rawat was elected as MLA from Chaubattakhal assembly seat from his native Pauri Garhwal district, and the following year (February 2013) he was appointed as the president of Uttarakhand BJP. He remained state president of the party till December 2015.In 2017, the party appointed him as the BJP national secretary.In May 2019, he was elected as member of parliament from the Pauri Lok Sabha seat, after defeating his rival Manish Khanduri, his political guru BC Khanduri’s son, by over 3.5 lakh votes. In the same year, he was also in-charge of the elections in Himachal Pradesh.“As names were doing the rounds in the media on Tuesday, I got many phone calls whether my husband is also being considered as there was no talk about it. I told them to wait. Because I knew that party would give him the responsibility. He has struggled a lot and never cared about money. Because of his work in RSS, he was sent to ABVP and later to BJP,” Rashami Rawat, wife of Tirath Singh Rawat, told local media on Tuesday night.“We are very happy that a leader from our district and that too such a humble one, has been given the reins of the state,” said Raj Kumar, a resident of Pauri Garhwal.Recalling the organisational abilities of Rawat, his friend Dinesh Arya said: “I saw up close how Rawat was good at managing cadre and organisational issues very efficiently and democratically. He is down-to-earth and listens to the party cadre.”"His best quality is that he is able to reach out to people, MLAs, party officials, workers and public and work in the best interests of the party. I am sure under his leadership, the state will do good, and the party base will be strengthened further, " said Ramesh Bahuguna, BJP state working committee member and former district president of Almora.Many Congress leaders also admit that Rawat is a humble and low-profile person.“Rawat is a soft-spoken, humble, low profile and down-to-earth man. This makes him popular among his party circles who see him as somebody who wouldn’t damage them politically. His godfather in politics was BC Khanduri, who promoted him a lot. But as Khanduri’s position weakened in the party, Rawat was not given a ticket in 2017, which upset him. But then he was made national secretary. Let us now see what he can do in the rest of ten months”, said a Congress leader not wishing to be named.(With inputs from Vipin Negi and Ankur Sharma)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirath-singh-rawat-from-rss-pracharak-to-uttarakhand-chief-minister-101615377274271.html

As many as 55 MLAs voted against the motion while 32 MLAs voted in favour of it."No-Confidence is Congress' culture. When the party loses polls, there is no-confidence on EVMs, for surgical strikes, it asked for evidence. Discussion for the sake of discussion should not take place. If Congress is in power, all is well, but if it's BJP, then not," Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said in the assembly.Speaking on the motion, Khattar said he was grateful to the Congress for giving him an opportunity to tell everyone about his government.Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who had accepted the motion by the Opposition Congress on March 5, had fixed March 10 for discussions on the motion.In place of secret voting, the members were asked to stand— first those in favour of the motion and later those who were against the motion.The 55 members who opposed the motion included 39 from the BJP, 10 from ally Jannayak Janta Party, five Independents and one from Haryana Lokhit Party.BJP has 40 members in the Assembly including the Speaker.30 members of Congress and two Independents, who had earlier withdrawn support, backed the motion.Haryana Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda had moved a no-confidence motion in the state Assembly against chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter-led government.In the assembly, Hooda commented on the ongoing farmers' protests and said, "More than 250 farmers died on the border."Responding to Hooda, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said, "The leader of the opposition, BS Hooda agreed that they introduced contract farming in 2014 which exhibits their double standards and we will respond to that in the Assembly."Hooda had said that his party "also plans to bring many adjournment and calling attention motions to draw the attention of the government to the multitude of problems faced by the people of the state.""The Congress is going to bring no-confidence motion, Minimum Support Price (MSP) guarantee bill, many adjournments and calling attention motion against the government. We will seek answers on issues such as farmers' neglect, rising unemployment, changes in domicile regulations, rising crime, paper leaks, liquor and registry scams," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-confidence-motion-against-haryana-government-defeated-in-assembly-101615376453463.html
10-03-2021||India||INS Karanj, third indigenous submarine, commissioned into Indian navy||A third Scorpene class submarine INS Karanj of Project-75 was on Wednesday commissioned into the Indian navy, after two years of rigorous sea trials.The submarine was launched in January 2018 for sea trials and will increase the strength and capability of the Indian navy, said chief of naval staff (CNS) admiral Karambir Singh.Singh and retired admiral VS Shekhawat were present during the occasion. Shekhawat, who was part of the commissioning crew of the old Karanj and was also its commanding officer during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, was the chief guest.Shekhawat, the 14th CNS who served as navy chief from September 30, 1993 to September 30, 1996, said, “We live in India and launch numerous satellites, building nuclear submarines, manufacturing vaccines for the world. The new Karanj is another example of Make in India”. Also Read | SC notice to Centre, NDA on denying women entry into defence, naval academiesHe said between the first world war and second world war submarines were hardly evolved, but after the second world war when electronic revolution began, development and engineering took place and the nature of the submarine substantially changed. “There is huge difference between the old Karanj and the new one, but one thing will never change, that is the sea and the danger from the sea,” he added.Shekhawat quoted a British navy officer who insisted that “the hazard of the sea must always be given priority over the violence of the enemy, the enemy you might have to get away from, but from sea you can never escape if there is a dangerous situation.”“This Project-75 submarine is motivation to indigenisation, and Aatmanirbhar Bharat is a fundamental tenet of Indian navy’s growth story and future operational capabilities,” Singh said while speaking at the occasion.The trials of the Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system, recently developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation, have been just completed. “The system will be ready in 2023 and after that when the first submarine will go for refit, the AIP will be installed in her. AIP plug will increase the capability of submarines to remain underwater for longer,” added Singh.INS Karanj, India’s third of six Scorpene class submarines, has superior stealth and several major combat capabilities. It is a diesel-electric attack submarine built under the Project-75 programme at Mazagon Docks Limited in Mumbai in collaboration with Naval Group (formerly DCNS), the French submarine builder. India’s first indigenous submarine INS Kalvari was launched in October 2015 and was commissioned in December 2017, five years behind schedule. The second one, INS Khanderi was launched in January 2017 for sea trials and commissioned in September 2019. INS Karanj is the third. The fourth submarine INS Vela was launched in May, 2019 and is undergoing sea trials, and the fifth submarine INS Vagir was launched in November 2020 and is also undergoing sea trials. The sixth submarine INS Vagsheer is in various stages of outfitting.Scorpene submarines can undertake multifarious types of missions; they are designed to operate in all theatres, with means to ensure interoperability with other components of a Naval Task Force. It is a strong platform, marking a generational shift in submarine operations.The state-of-the-art technology utilised for construction of the Scorpene class submarines has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic silencing techniques, low radiated noise levels, hydrodynamically optimised shape and the ability to attack the enemy using precision guided weapons. The attack can be launched with both torpedoes and tube launched anti-ship missiles, at the same time as underwater or on surface. The stealth of this strong platform is enhanced by the special attention given to various signatures. These stealth features make them invulnerable, unmatched by most submarines. The old INS Karanj was commissioned on September 4, 1969 at Riga in the erstwhile USSR, (United States of Soviet Russian) also took active part in the conflict under the Command of then commander VS Shekhawat and was decommissioned in 2003.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ins-karanj-third-indigenous-submarine-commissioned-into-indian-navy-101615376908866.html

Mufti had moved court seeking to quash summons issued to her by the agency in a money laundering case, asking her to appear before it on March 15.Advocate Amit Mahajan, central government standing counsel, appearing for the ED, sought time from the bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani, which posted the matter for March 19.The Peoples Democratic Party leader, through her counsel Prasanna S, has also challenged the validity of Section 50 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) under which she was summoned.

This year, two incidents of IEDs [blasts] have happened and we have also busted two IED modules. This shows that their target would be to conduct small IED blasts. It is a concern for us and with that has emerged a new dimension of sticky bombs…,”Kumar said he went to the Srinagar airport to show photographs of sticky bombs to Central Industrial Security Force guarding it. “...[I] told them what kind of bombs these are and what adverse effects they can have. We have alerted all,” said Kumar. “We are all alert and also appeal the people to inform police if you find any such thing.”Kumar said they have arrested seven people for their alleged involvement in two IED-making modules before a vehicle-based attack could have been carried out. He added they had motivated a college student through telegram and other apps. “He was tasked to arrange a second-hand car and the explosive was to come from north Kashmir. He was tracked and arrested.” Kumar added his three associates were also arrested and the car has been recovered.Also Read | Al-Badr commander Abdul Gani Khawaja’s killing a big success, says J&K PoliceHe said they have arrested three more people for allegedly planning an attack on a building at Pampore and recovered a 25 kg container with explosive ammonium powder sourced from north Kashmir. “Both the modules were motivated online through apps.”Kumar said 39 people involved in stone-throwing in Srinagar on Friday last have been arrested and 12 of them have been booked under the Public Safety Act, which allows detention without trial for up to two years. “...we are not going to tolerate stone pelting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sticky-bombs-recovered-in-jammu-security-forces-on-alert-in-valley-101615375648882.html

10-03-2021||India||Trivendra Singh Rawat’s exit from Uttarakhand a throwback to 2012||Tirath Singh Rawat’s replacement of Trivendra Singh Rawat as the Uttarakhand chief minister is a throwback to 2012 when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chose BC Khanduri to replace Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank for the state’s top post six months before the assembly elections. Khanduri lost the election as the BJP got a seat less than the Congress, which formed the government in the state with the help of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Independent lawmakers.The BJP hopes Tirath Singh Rawat, a Parliament member from Garhwal, will be able to recover the lost political ground before elections are due in Uttarakhand (a year from now). Khanduri had just about six months, which experts say was not enough to undo the damage.Gangotri Dham priests celebrated Trivendra Singh Rawat’s exit by bursting crackers and terming it as “Vijay Diwas [victory day]”, signalling the mood on the ground that prompted the BJP to replace him. Priests have been unhappy with him for bringing prominent religious places under government-run Uttarkhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. This was among the outgoing chief minister’s decisions that angered Hindu priests, who are considered the BJP’s core vote bank. His decision to cut short the Mahakhumb from three months to one was also opposed.Also Read | Focus on tourism, health, education to win 2022 polls: Tirath Singh RawatPolitical experts say if the new chief minister does well in the next few months on the governance front and keeps the party cadre and lawmakers happy, he could help the BJP regain the lost ground, or else it could be a cakewalk for the Congress.MM Semwal, a Garhwal university professor, said the leadership change has increased the political instability and equations between the state’s two regions—Kumaon and Garhwal—and Thakur and Brahmin communities that would have to be reset. “This change shows that all was not well within the party [BJP]. Congress and the AAP [Aam Aadmi Party] will use this to further attack the government on issues such as unemployment, corruption... the shortening of Mahakumbh... simmering anger among Char Dham priests who have been opposing the takeover of the temples by the state government.”Semwal said there is a strong possibility that Harish Rawat will try to emerge as the main Congress leader and push himself as the chief ministerial face. He added if Harish Rawat emerges as the Congress candidate for the top post, the BJP can lessen the damage by highlighting the alleged irregularities and corruption issues during his tenure as the chief minister.A Congress leader said Harish Rawat could be relieved of his responsibility as Punjab in-charge of the party and be given the full-time responsibility of ensuring victory in Uttarakhand. There is, however, resistance to his projection as the chief ministerial face.“He may be popular, but people still remember him for wrongs during his three-year tenure as chief minister. He faced allegations of promoting the mafia and corruption. If he is the party’s face, Congress will lose the advantage of Trivendra Singh Rawat’s removal,” said a second Congress leader, requesting anonymity.Legislators loyal to Harish Rawat have called upon Congress leadership to declare him the party’s face. “That is unlikely to happen,” said the second leader.Congress leader Indira Hridayesh said the BJP’s leadership change has made Congress’s job easier. “They wasted four years and betrayed people. People are not foolish. They know why this change happened. ...even MLAs [members of legislative assembly] were not happy... what can they [people] hope and expect? This change is symbolic that soon this BJP government will go, and Congress will come to power.”BJP leaders are optimistic that Tirath Singh Rawat would ensure the party’s victory. “The Congress has no mass leader [with]...appeal like that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said BJP leader Dushyant Gautam.Assembly elections are due in the state in March-April next year. The BJP has 56 members in the 70-member House, while the Congress has 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trivendra-singh-rawat-s-exit-from-uttarakhand-a-throwback-to-2012-101615371928693.html

The death due to the virus was confirmed two days later on March 12, creating shock and panic. The town was the first to adjust to the new normal in the face of Covid-19 outbreak and embrace measures such as hand hygiene, physical distancing, hand sanitisers, facemasks, and containment zones.As on Tuesday, the district has witnessed a total of 22,208 cases, 21,665 discharges, 213 active cases and 330 deaths. "We can say coronavirus in Kalaburagi is under control though there is some rise in cases. A fortnight ago one death had taken place where an old man had died but since then there is no Covid-related fatality here," District health officer Dr Rajashekhar Mali told PTI.The DHO said this increase could be linked to Maharashtra where the Covid-19 cases are on rise. "However, we don't have any containment zones because the situation is well under control," Dr Mali added.According to him, people don't take Covid-19 as a stigma anymore as the deaths are almost nil barring the one a fortnight ago and infected people are recovering fast. "Our recovery rate is also very good and the number of active cases are quite less," the DHO added. He added that there was a good response to the vaccination drive though there was a need to spread more awareness and encourage elderly people to come forward to receive the shot.Meanwhile, the 76-year-old man's son reportedly claimed that his family has not yet received his father's Covid-19 positive report despite running from pillar to post in the last one year.A year after the first death, the coronavirus is well under check all over Karnataka with many districts reporting zero fatality for the past several weeks. However, Bengaluru Urban district has hardly witnessed zero deaths or infections below hundred on a daily basis since the time the infections touched the peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kalaburagi-comes-to-terms-with-covid-19-a-year-after-first-death-in-country-101615369597842.html

Will continue to work on the development programmes introduced by Trivendra Singh Rawat so as to ensure the party’s victory in next assembly elections," he said.Rawat, who started his public life with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) during his student life and worked as Kshetriya Pracharak for several years before joining the BJP said, "Earlier, I didn't know what BJP was.""When I used to work as the RSS member, I got the opportunity to meet late former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1985 in Srinagar town of Pauri Garhwal. Seeing his down-to-earth attitude, I was later inspired to come into the BJP to serve the people. And now, when I have been given this opportunity, I am extremely thankful to the party organisation," said Rawat.Earlier during the event, party central observer Raman Singh said, "Rawat's name was approved by the party central leadership.""We had apprised the central leadership of the happenings last night and today morning also.

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde issued a notice to the Ministry of Defence, NDA and Department of Defence on a petition filed by advocate Kush Kalra. The petition questioned the categorical exclusion of eligible female candidates from entering the NDA and Naval Academy via the examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.The court allowed a woman aspirant Anita (known by her first name only) to join the proceedings as she told the court that her dream to serve as an officer in the Army was cut short due to the discriminatory rule that does not allow eligible women who have completed Class 12 or a similar qualifying exam to apply for admission at the prestigious NDA.

We are happy that the government is strengthening the COTPA provisions to make hospitality sector completely smoke free," said Mohammad Imran from Hotel Awadh International.In 2020, the government started the COTPA Amendment process by introducing a bill. India has the second largest number of tobacco users (268 million or 28.6 per cent of all adults in the country) in the world.Nearly 27 per cent of all cancers in India are due to tobacco usage. The total direct and indirect cost of diseases attributable to tobacco use was a staggering ₹182,000 crore, which is nearly 1.8 per cent of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), he said.Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is associated with severe Covid-19 casualties as per advisories issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-restaurateurs-urge-centre-to-remove-smoking-zones-from-public-places-101615363806127.html

The list includes Vijayaraghavan’s wife Prof R Bindu, who is seeking election from Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district.

Rawat alone was sworn-in on Wednesday, which means the members of his Cabinet will be sworn-in later.In the early days of his political career, Rawat was part of the Uttar Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the BJP's youth wing, where he served as the state vice-president for some time before being elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council in 1997.When the state of Uttarakhand was formed in 2000, Tirath Singh Rawat became its first education minister.The following part of Rawat's political career saw him working extensively for the BJP, first as its Uttarakhand general secretary in 2007 and later as the party’s state unit chief in 2013.He was elected in 2012 as an MLA from the Chaubatakhal assembly constituency in his birthplace of Pauri Garhwal. He continued to serve as the Chaubatakhal MLA till 2017.In 2019, Tirath Singh Rawat became an MP by defeating his rival Manish Khanduri by over 3.50 lakh votes from the Garhwal Lok Sabha seat.The mild-mannered, 56-year-old politician is now the ninth chief minister of Uttarakhand. His predecessor to the post, Trivendra Singh Rawat's resignation came after BJP general secretary in-charge of Uttarakhand Dushyant Kumar Gautam and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Dr Raman Singh, submitted a report to the BJP's central leadership detailing the rebellion in the state unit of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-is-tirath-singh-rawat-a-political-profile-of-uttarakhand-s-cmdesignate-101615358616150.html

Being a purely religious body, by getting involved into the farmers' agitation, which comprises farmers from all religions and castes, the SGPC is going completely against the mandate given to it under 'The Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925' and 'Punjab Act 8 of 1925'. Not only the SGPC is going beyond its brief by doing all this but is also giving the farmers agitation a religious colour, which is extremely unfortunate and uncalled for."Pointing out that Punjab has always been a volatile state, Grewal said, "From a responsible person like you, who is holding an important chair of SGPC president, any such highly controversial statement can have serious repercussions, which could be extremely detrimental for the peace of Punjab.""History will not forgive you for giving a religious colour to this agitation", said Grewal, a former national secretary of the BJP, as he appealed to Kaur that SGPC should strictly desist from any such activity that brings disgrace to a religious institution and should completely stay away from the farmers' agitation.On March 4, Kaur had also stated that the ongoing langar and moveable toilet facilities will continue to operate besides announcing that each family of the deceased farmers would be given ₹1 lakh each as a mark of tribute towards their contribution in the struggle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sgpc-giving-religious-colour-to-farmers-protest-bjp-s-harjit-singh-grewal-101615360965784.html

A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R Subhash Reddy refused to show any leniency to the man even as his lawyer said the convict was only 20 when the crime was committed.“What about the victim? You should be thankful that you have been spared the noose and were not given the death penalty. You must bear the consequences of your act,” the bench told the lawyer, Minakshi Vij, on Tuesday.Vij, who appeared as a legal aid counsel for Naresh Shah, pointed out that the convict had been in prison for over a decade and that some order could be passed to enable him to come out by reducing the quantum of punishment.“Remember, this society cannot be turned into some kind of a jungle. We cannot allow that. A court does not have to necessarily find a way to either lessen the punishment. There is also a victim on the other side and a court does remember that too. When there is discretion, it has to be exercised in the facts of every case,” the court said. It rejected Vij’s plea to let Shah come out on parole.Shah was sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in Ambala which held him guilty of rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Harayan’s Naraingarh. The state government filed an appeal in the Punjab and Haryana high court in 2009, seeking the death penalty for Shah. The high court declined to enhance the punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/society-can-t-become-a-jungle-sc-rejects-appeal-by-man-guilty-of-minor-s-rape-101615360828246.html
10-03-2021||India||With Kharge’s appointment, Rahul’s control over Cong’s parliamentary wings is complete||Former Union minister Mallikarjun Kharge’s appointment as the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha will deepen Rahul Gandhi’s influence over his party’s parliamentary wings, Congress leaders said.Kharge is known to enjoy Gandhi’s trust. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress Lok Sabha floor leader, is considered as one of Gandhi’s “trusted lieutenants” in the party’s inner circle.A proposal to appoint former Union minister Manish Tewari as the Congress floor leader in the lower House received a lukewarm response from the top leadership and instead Chowdhury was appointed as the leader in 2019. “Rahul Gandhi’s equation with Manish Tewari had soured in the last few years after the latter did not fight the Lok Sabha polls in 2014,” said a Congress leader considered close to Gandhi, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Help raise voice of the weak: Rahul to cadresPersonal equations have played a role, but Kharge and Chowdhury are also seen to be more aggressive, party leaders said.Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings have been disrupted this week over spiralling fuel prices. On Wednesday, the Rajya Sabha failed to transact business due to Congress-led protests in the Upper House over fuel prices and farm laws.Congress leaders said protests and disruptions will be more frequent as Kharge-led party in the House was unlikely to take a softer line and take the BJP head-on in sync with Gandhi’s approach.The Congress has rejected the presiding officer’s suggestion to discuss the oil price issue during the debates on demand for grants and finance bill.In the first part of the ongoing budget session, when Ghulam Nabi Azad led the Congress in Rajya Sabha, the party agreed to join the discussions after a few days of protests even as its Lok Sabha wing continued its protests over the farm laws.Gandhi is believed to have been miffed with the party’s approach in Rajya Sabha and praised the Lok Sabha unit for its continued protests.Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted this division to attack the party and said, in his reply to the President’s debate, that a “confused and divided” Congress cannot be any good to the nation. Later, in an interview with HT, Azad rejected Modi comments. “It was a decision by all Opposition parties to stop protests and join the discussions,” Azad said.A Congress strategist said with Kharge in charge and deputy leader Anand Sharma almost sidelined in the party’s strategy making, such division for the Congress is unlikely to happen anymore. “Kharge and Chowdhury—both Gandhi loyalists—in charge of the party will adopt a more coordinated approach in sync with Congress high command’s directions,” the strategist said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-kharge-rahul-s-control-over-cong-s-parliamentary-wings-is-complete-101615360468383.html

Here are other transfers the EC has recently ordered:In Tamil Nadu, which is also going to the polls next month, the EC has ordered income tax official KG Arunraj’s transfer out of Tamil Nadu to the Central Board of Direct Taxes headquarters.In poll-bound Assam, the Commission last month kept in abeyance the transfer of 18 police officers ordered by the state government. The EC ordered the transfer and postings of the officials involved in the elections should not be carried out until further orders.Also Read | Sexual harassment case: EC directs suspension of Tamil Nadu SPIn 2019, the poll watchdog removed additional director general of West Bengal Rajeev Kumar from his post ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and attached him to the Union home ministry. The transfer prompted the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress to accuse the EC of acting at the Bharatiya Janata Party’s behest.The Commission had also ordered that the principal secretary, home and hill affairs, in West Bengal be removed from his state for “interfering in the process of conducting the election”.The EC in 2019 also ordered the transfer of Andhra Pradesh’s state intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao. The then Chandrababu Naidu-led Andhra Pradesh complied with the order only to reverse it the next day saying Rao was not involved in any election-related activities. Naidu questioned EC’s conduct and said the move was aimed at benefitting his political rivals under the Centre’s influence. The decision was challenged in the high court, which ruled in favour of the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-removes-bengal-dgp-a-look-at-recent-instances-of-poll-body-s-intervention-101615352427963.html

10-03-2021||India||Eye on China, India’s plan for 6 nuclear-powered attack submarines back on track||On March 8, the Defence Research Development Organization (DRDO) successfully carried out the final test of the land based prototype of the Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) system in Mumbai. The AIP system, retrofitted by expanding the hull area, ensures that diesel attack submarines can remain under surface for a longer period and become more silent than a nuclear-powered submarine. The AIP system will be retrofitted into Kalvari class submarines, the third of which (INS Karanj) will be commissioned on Wednesday March 10.But analysts say that rather than being seen in isolation, Monday’s significant test should be seen as part of the navy’s overall capability-building plans, ranging from the ongoing plan to build six nuclear-powered attack submarines or SSNs – the project is back on track and was discussed at the Combined Commanders’ Conference in Kevadia, Gujarat -- to the commissioning of its second aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, later this year.Also Read: DRDO develops AIP technology, Indian subs to be more silent and lethalOverall, they add, the plans should also be seen as a concerted bid by the Indian Navy to counter the rise of China’s navy – now larger than the US navy in terms of number of ships, although the US is still ahead in terms of tonnage and capability. In submarines for instance, India currently has only one Akula class SSN on lease from Russia; one more is expected to come on lease before 2025.The analysts said the Indian Navy is all set to acquire big teeth and long legs this year. While South Block remains tight-lipped about the country’s increasing naval capabilities, HT learns that the Chinese interlocutors during WMCC (working mechanism for consultation and coordination) meetings on disengagement in East Ladakh complained about Indian Navy warships being aggressive against the PLA Navy in the Indian Ocean. Thanks to Indian Navy full deployment in Indian Ocean and real time intelligence from the QUAD allies and France, the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s (PLAN) warships are only deployed around the Gulf of Aden as of now with no presence anywhere else in Indian Ocean.India’s national security planners are worried about the expanding PLAN and expect Chinese carrier strike force deployment in Indian Ocean by 2023 with Beijing expected to commission a third aircraft carrier this year. That’s one reason the Indian Navy has embarked on its own capability-building drive. India will commission its second aircraft carrier INS Vikrant and second nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arighat this year. While INS Vikramaditya, the other carrier, will be home-based on the western seaboard of India, INS Vikrant will be on the eastern seaboard. Each will have one SSBN and SSN as part of its strike force.Also Read | Manpower grossly insufficient for committed R&D projects: Parliamentary panel on DRDOAlthough the Indian Navy wants a third aircraft carrier with more tonnage than the two existing ones, the strategic planners of the Modi government are still to be convinced of the idea given the massive expenditure involved. The Vikramaditya’s tonnage is 45,000 and the Vikrant’s 37,500. There’s long been talk of a third carrier, INS Vishal, with a tonnage of 65,000, but this could set India back by at least $15 billion.Adding teeth to the Indian Navy are also its two leased Predator drones, which provide maritime domain awareness from Gulf of Aden to Sunda Straits with the unmanned aerial platform having endurance upwards of 30 hours and acquiring attitude of over 30,000 feet. Once the Indian military is trained to handle the Predator drones, currently based in the Arakkonam base in Tamil Nadu, the plan is to buy 10 armed Predator drones for each of the three services.Vice Admiral (Retd) Madanjit Singh, former Western Naval Command Chief, said that New Delhi should be cured of its sea-blindness as this is the war theatre of future. “The Modi government must expand to blue water navy status if PLAN’s expansion is to be checked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-china-india-s-plan-for-6-nuclear-powered-attack-submarines-back-on-track-101615327826084.html

The three were booked for sedition, promoting hatred among groups and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted a ‘toolkit’.Delhi Police’s special cell, while opposing Muluk’s anticipatory bail plea, alleged before Additonal Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana that he participated in a conspiracy that “stretched across continents and covered people of multiple nationalities”.The judge said no coercive action will be taken till March 15 against Muluk and co-accused Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob, whose pre-arrest bail plea, was also heard simultaneously.In a reply filed in the court on Tuesday, the police have claimed that Muluk is receiving routine foreign remittances from a person named Christopher Mills, a resident of UK, while working as a volunteer for a company named Climate 2025, of which very limited information is available on the internet.The police said Muluk has “failed to satisfactorily explain the actions and activities that he undertook in lieu of the funds received on a monthly basis”.Muluk’s lawyer Sarim Naved refused to comment on the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikita-shantanu-get-protection-from-arrest-till-march-15-101615321057677.html

Parliament resumed its usual schedule starting from 11am on Tuesday, after nearly a year of staggered timings and segregated seating necessitated by the Covid pandemic.In both the Houses, while the government and the Chair suggested that the issues related to fuel prices could be addressed during the debate on demand for grants and the finance bill, opposition parties pressed for an immediate and exclusive discussion on the matter. Also Read: Rising fuel prices rock ParliamentIn the Lok Sabha, several Congress members were in the Well, demanding a rollback of the fuel price hikes. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam members were seen standing at their seats as other opposition leaders joined the protest.Earlier in the day, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue of what he called the “digital divide” between members of the House, at which Speaker Om Birla asked whether he wanted to show chaos to the country. “(But) there is digital discrimination. Whatever the government says and does comes on television. Whatever the opposition says does not ... The blackout should stop...” Chowdhury said. To this, Birla said, “Does the honourable leader of the Congress in the House want to show chaos to the country?”Meanwhile, in the Rajya Sabha, leader of the opposition Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a debate on the fuel price issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-keeps-up-heat-in-houses-on-fuel-prices-101615320530692.html
10-03-2021||India||Uttarakhand upheaval: What went wrong with Trivendra Singh Rawat?||The Bhartiya Janata Party's decision to remove Trivendra Singh Rawat as Uttarakhand's chief minister a year before the assembly polls appears to be a move to quell inner-party angst and rebellion against him.According to several persons that the Hindustan Times spoke to at various levels of the party, a considerable number of members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) were upset that the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) pracharak-turned-CM kept many of his cabinet member colleagues out of the decision-making process. While unhappiness had been brewing since 2018, a year after he took over, things gathered momentum last month.The immediate trigger is said to be a meeting between a group of Uttarakhand legislators and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari. While Koshiyari tweeted a picture with the CM, it was his meeting with some BJP MLAs that started the process of his eventual exit just a year before the Uttarakhand polls.Also read: Replacing Rawat - 3 frontrunners, parliamentarians in race for U'khand's top postAccording to a person aware of the details, the BJP MLAs took the opportunity to pour their heart out to Koshiyari who was the chief minister of Uttarkhand from 2001-2002, and had incidentally, also been placed as the CM by the party bosses just a year before the 2002 elections.The MLAs told the Governor how Rawat didn't meet his cabinet colleagues, or party MLAs or even the state's MPs,'' said the person. That message and its severity, coming so close to state elections, was conveyed immediately to the party bosses in Delhi. The Governor's office confirmed that he was in Dehradun last month but said that they didn't have any information about this meeting."It's absolutely untrue to think that the party removed the chief minister for any such reason,'' said MLA and party spokesperson Munna Chauhan."Even the opposition will not accuse him of corruption. I think the party wants to use his expertise at a larger, national level and so they have moved him,'' he added. That's the view the central BJP is also putting on record. "We felt that he should be moved to the national level,'' said Dushyant Kumar Gautam who is in charge of the state and was sent to sort out the rebellion.However, off the record, BJP leaders tell a different story. The story of how the 60-year-old was seen as honest but also headstrong, refusing to listen to his party men and favouring the bureaucrats over the politicians. "He would not allow any political interference in transfers,'' said a top state official, asking not to be named. "If any minister or MLA recommended someone for a post, he would never listen to them. He was very strict,'' he added.While the hard task-master was a good role model, political workers of the state point out that Rawat refused to share power and kept all the important portfolios for himself. The government website shows that he had 60 odd portfolios assigned to the Chief Minister's Office and the cabinet expansion that was expected never took place."What's most important is that while he sided with the bureaucrats, his team of bureaucrats didn't create the right kind of impression for the government,'' said the official quoted above."The biggest problem was that he never consulted anyone about the decisions he took,'' said a party worker. "For instance, he announced Gairsain as a new region other than Kumaon and Garhwal in the budget a few days ago without speaking to anyone or informing anyone. This is a politically sensitive decision and so everyone got very upset,'' he added. When the local MLAs confronted him, the CM is reported to have dismissed their concerns."We had a decisive majority in 2017 but despite that, the party felt that many of those put in charge were those that had run the Congress system,'' said the BJP worker.Uttarakhand was formed in the year 2000 and has never had a full-term chief minister other than Congress' ND Tiwari who was in power from 2002-2007. The BJP had high hopes from the low profile Rawat but they're hoping to cut their losses with a new face this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-upheaval-what-went-wrong-with-trivendra-singh-rawat-101615318763096.html
10-03-2021||India||ED probes Punjab MLA, son-in-law for alleged links to international drugs racket||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday carried out raids at the residence of Punjab lawmaker, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, and his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal among seven others for allegedly being part of an international drugs smuggling syndicate having links in Pakistan and the United Kingdom as well as a human trafficking racket, popularly called ‘kabootarbaazi’ in Punjab, people familiar with the development said.The central agency has registered two cases a few weeks back to investigate money laundering - first based on a trans-border drugs smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab in 2015, in which 1,800 grams of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by Jalalabad police (Punjab).The second case pertains to a fake passport racket being run in Delhi.Nine smugglers were sentenced in the Fazilka drugs smuggling case in October 2017, including Gurdev Singh, Manjit Singh, Harbans Singh and Subhash Chander who were raided by the ED on Tuesday morning.In fact, Khaira’s name had cropped up in the case in 2017. Although not named in the Punjab police charge sheet, a Fazilka court had issued summons to Khaira on November 30, 2017. He was Punjab’s Leader of Opposition and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA at that time. However, the Supreme Court granted him relief by quashing proceedings against him.Khaira, an MLA from Bhulath in Kapurthala district, was elected to the state assembly in 2017 on an AAP ticket. Two years ago, he quit the party and formed Punjab Ekta Party (PEP).An ED official, requesting anonymity, said on Tuesday, “Sukhpal Singh Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime”.Khaira, the officer added, was particularly very close to Gurdev Singh, the leader of Fazilka drugs smuggling racket and used to shelter him often. “We suspect Khaira was involved with the drug syndicate for the past several years. We have information that he enjoyed financial benefits for helping the smugglers,” the officer added.The lawmaker is likely to be called for questioning very soon at the agency’s Delhi office. The ED didn’t find any record of Khaira’s questioning by the Punjab Police ever.In all, the ED raided 12 places on Tuesday, including Khaira’s residence in Punjab and eight others, two premises in Delhi and one location in Chandigarh.Apart from Khaira, his son-in-law and four drugs convicts, three others were raided on Tuesday. They include Harminder Kaur, Rajwinder Kaur, and Bikker Singh who had been caught in the human trafficking (kabootarbaazi) case. The fake passport racket is called Kabootarbaazi among cops in Delhi and Punjab. Uneducated persons are illegally sent abroad by travel agents in this racket.All seven who were raided by the ED on Tuesday are currently out on parole, said a second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-probes-punjab-mla-son-in-law-for-alleged-links-to-international-drugs-racket-101615318235709.html
10-03-2021||India||India most favourable market for solar energy: ISA report||A new report by the International Solar Alliance has said India is among four achiever countries among 80 ISA member countries with most favourable technical and commercial conditions to facilitate solar energy projects and perceived as the most attractive for investments in solar energy.The assessment has considered various parameters including policy support for investment in solar, technological feasibility, market maturity, financing etc. The three other achiever countries include Brazil, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.The Asia & Pacific region has three achiever countries and several ‘progressive’ and ‘potential’ countries which can become achievers in future according to the Ease of Doing Solar 2020 report discussed in a webinar by ISA on Tuesday. Along with high levels of solar irradiation, enabling macroeconomic and financing aspects are driving the growth of solar adoption in the Asia Pacific region.India has set an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 with 175 GW deployment by 2022. This is the world’s largest expansion policy according to the report. The National Tariff Policy was amended in 2011 to prescribe solar specific Renewable Purchase Obligations. These obligations have increased from 0.25% in 2012 to 3% in 2022.RPO is the obligation mandated by the state governments to purchase a minimum level of renewable energy out of the total consumption. Up to 100% FDI is allowed for renewable energy generation and distribution projects. Apart from these supporting policies, India has nearly 372.69 GW of installed capacity of which 47% is owned by the private sector; there are 42 solar parks with aggregate capacity of 23,499 MW up to March 2019; around 60 solar cities have been approved with USD 1.3 billion for setting up 50 solar parks of 40 GW by 2020. There has been growing lender interest in renewable energy, 60 RE projects grew in financing of over 2.5 billion dollars in 2017, nearly 60% of which came from non-banking financial institutions.In Brazil, owing to relatively high levels of average solar irradiation (GHI) of 5.28 kWh/m2/day and specific yield of 4.27 kWh/kWp/day, strong technical feasibility is envisaged for solar projects. In Saudi Arabia, owing to average of 8.9 hr/day of sunshine, high average solar irradiation levels of 6.21 kWh/m2/day and specific yield of 5.17 kWh/kWp. In comparison, India’s solar irradiation is 5.098 kwh/m2/day and has a yield of 4.322 kwh.ISA Director General Upendra Tripathy said, “Solar power is the cheapest in India with the tariff going as low as ₹1.30 per kwh for solar rooftop in the past.” He added that cost of solar power is falling in most other parts of the world.BloombergNEF Head of Solar Analysis Jenny Chase said “Member countries need to provide a stable framework to solar investors. Governments should avoid renegotiating bids and ensure effective grid operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-most-favourable-market-for-solar-energy-isa-report-101615314392302.html
10-03-2021||India||The significance of Trichy for the DMK in TN polls||Chennai The road to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s mega party conference along the Trichy highway on Sunday was dotted with party flags and larger-than-life cut-outs of Dravidian movement leaders E V Ramasamy, popularly known as Periyar, C N Annadurai, M Karunanidhi and current party chief M K Stalin. Besides them was a cut-out of youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin, the son of M K Stalin, a reflection of the rise of the party’s third generation, particularly in Trichy -- interesting, because, in some ways, this is the first state election the party is fighting under Stalin’s leadership. Elections in Tamil Nadu will happen in one phase across all 234 constituencies on April 6. This district holds a nostalgic value for the DMK . Sunday’s meeting was the first presided by Stalin since his father Karunanidhi’s demise in August 2018. At the conference, the DMK chief recalled that the party held its first meeting in Trichy in 1956 under Annadurai, and decided to take the plunge into electoral politics. The party formed the government in 1967, winning 179 of the 230 seats on offer then. The state was called Madras, and one of the first moves of the new legislature was to pass a law changing it to Tamil Nadu. Annadurai died in 1969 and Karunanidhi succeeded him as chief minister. “Trichy showed us the way,” Stalin said at the grand venue set up across 35 acres. The DMK has been known to save important announcements for this venue, one of its favourites. Stalin chose the district to unveil his 10-year-old vision for Tamil Nadu. He promised that if elected, his government would give ₹1,000 to women heads of each household every month, provide a million jobs a year, and boost broadband connectivity across villages.A DMK leader present at the venue who asked not to be named said Trichy serves as a bridge between north and south Tamil Nadu, and therefore, all major announcements are made here to mobilize cadre and send the party’s message across the state. On Sunday, Stalin made party workers take a vow that the DMK would run a corruption-free government for all. “Nobody can defeat the DMK if this reaches the people. Take my vision to the millions of people of Tamil Nadu before April 6 (polling date in the state),” he said.Trichy is a study in contrasts -- a business hub with several small industries running along the Cauvery delta where farming is a primary occupation, and is home to several premier educational institutions. For the March 7 conference, Stalin was accommodated in a guest house by Dhanalakshmi College on the Trichy highway.In the 1960s, many from the Congress switched over to the DMK which had started gaining strength and popularity in the state. “DMK has good support in the district in the upcoming elections, but the challenge is how Stalin will manage the friction within his party leaders,” Ramu Manivannan, head of political science department in the University of Madras, said.The party’s principal secretary and Tiruchirappalli West constituency MLA K N Nehru organized the mega conference, along with district secretaries. Poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s Indian Political Action Committee (I-Pac) was tasked with roping in vendors and micromanaging the event. As principal secretary, Nehru is number four in the pecking order in the DMK’s organization but his status as party strongman, arising from his position as Tiruchirappalli district secretary, a post he has held for three decades, is now being challenged within his party by younger leaders such as Udhayanidhi Stalin and his close aide Thiruverumbur MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi.Mahesh’s grandfather Anbil Dharmalingam played an important role in the party’s growth in Trichy and was a close associate of Karunanidhi. Following Nehru’s elevation to the party headquarters in Chennai in 2018, the party trifurcated Trichy and Mahesh was appointed one of the three district secretaries. Both Nehru and Mahesh received high praise from Stalin at the event, a move to ensure both the old guard and the new generation remain motivated.The DMK chief claimed that Sunday’s meeting, which attracted an audience five times larger than the party’s previous conferences. The venue was set up like a concert with three stages and surrounded by 500-feet long LED screens. There were fireworks and a DJ blaring the party’s campaign song. Stalin waved at the crowd as he walked down a kilometre-long ramp designed like the party’s rising son symbol. He was followed by Nehru. The loudest cheer from the cadre, however, was reserved for Udhayanidhi. The speakers at the conference were constantly interrupted by the noise from his supporters, forcing the managers of the event to urge Udhayanidhi to control them.A few supporters from the youth wing also tried to climb the stage where Udhayanidhi was seated along with MP Kanimozhi and other legislators. “Udhayanidhi and Mahesh are very close and the young people consider them as ‘mass’,” a DMK worker from Trichy G Arumugam said. In the local lingo, “mass” is a status attributed to actors and politicians who have a huge fan following. Udhayanidhi entered Tamil cinema as a producer and distributor for Red Giant Movies and played the lead role in several films before joining politics. He is one of the star campaigners of the DMK camp.Trichy has nine assembly constituencies – Tiruchirappalli East, Tiruchirappalli West, Thiruverumbur and Srirangam, Manapparai, Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Musiri and Thuraiyur (reserved) – of which the DMK has four sitting MLAs (the AIADMK won five in 2016). Late AIADMK chief minister J Jayalalithaa was elected from Srirangam constituency in 2011 and claimed her ancestors used to live there. According to local DMK workers, the party does well in the region usually, although they point out that in 2011, when some DMK leaders were involved in the 2G spectrum case, the AIADMK did very well. Nehru, who was also the former transport minister and elected from Lalgudi in 1989, lost Trichy West in 2011 to the AIADMK’s Mariam Pitchai.The AIADMK won the assembly elections in both 2011 and 2016. In 2016, Nehru regained the seat. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, senior leader S Thirunavukuarasar won the Tiruchirappalli parliamentary seat for the Congress.“After 10 years, it will be good to have a change of leadership in the state. Maybe they (DMK) will support us in our angst against rising prices of fuel and vegetables,” S Selvakumar, who works as a waiter in the Trichy tollgate area, said.Last month, Nehru, Mahesh and other local leaders spearheaded a protest against the fuel price hike and alleged that the AIADMK’s education- and farm-loan waivers were inspired by the DMK.It’s industries make Trichy attractive to migrants. Several young people from other districts have moved to Trichy for better job opportunities. “I belong to Tirunelveli where my family traditionally votes for the AIADMK and I’ll do the same,” K Harish, who helps his brother run a small artifacts shop, said.Supporters of Nehru’s son, Arun Nehru, have filed an application for him to contest from Lalgudi constituency. Meanwhile Udhayanidhi is seeking to make his political debut from Chennai’s Chepauk , his late grandfather Karunanidhi’s borough.On Saturday, he was interviewed by a panel that included his father and other senior leaders on his candidature.

10-03-2021||India||'Satisfaction in giving nod': Justice Chandrachud on permanent commission||It is “tremendously satisfying” to be a judge when you can deliver a judgment making women equal contributors to growth and safety of the nation, said Supreme Court judge Dhananjay Y Chandrachud on Tuesday, citing his February 2020 verdict that gave permanent commission to women in the armed forces.“I can very well remember authoring this judgment and delivering it just before the lockdown. When I can see 365 women officers granted permanent commission and there are more officers who are going to get it exactly after a year of this judgment, there is a great sense of satisfaction for a judge,” said justice Chandrachud.Constituting the bench along with justice MR Shah, justice Chandrachud added: “There is tremendous amount of satisfaction of being a judge. With the assistance and the vision of lawyers, we could deliver a judgment which led to opening up of more public spaces for women, making them equal contributors to growth and safety of the nation.”The judge further said: “Yes, you do a lot of routine work every day; you do exactly the same kind of work almost every day; your routine from morning to evening is almost the same, but I have no second thought about why I chose to be a judge. I guess judgeship is something that grows on you”.Justice Shah agreed: “I also have great satisfaction that you have done something for the society as a judge. As a lawyer, you have to mostly worry about the interest of your clients. I can remember when an order of mine in the Gujarat high court helped 23,500 retired primary teachers get the benefit of revised pension. Days later, I got a letter addressed to me from a remote village with only one sentence written: Justice is still alive.”The justice Chandrachud-led bench was hearing a clutch of petitions by around 60 women army officers who have complained against fixing of allegedly arbitrary criteria to deny them permanent commission when the judges and the lawyers had a brief exchange about “role reversal”.Following arguments spanning three hours, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and senior counsel R Balasubramaniam, who represented the ministry of defence (MoD) in the matter, took a brief break from the submission and asked the judges if they missed being lawyers.Justice Chandrachud replied saying although lawyers had greater freedom than judges did, he would not have second thoughts about being a judge.With senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for one of the women officers, the judge also recalled an episode from 1997 when he went to meet Huzefa’s father, former Chief Justice of India AM Ahmadi at his hotel room in Mumbai after an arbitration case.“I was around 38 then. I went to see justice Ahmadi in his suite and asked him what his thoughts were about judgeship since he was a judge since 1964. I asked him if he thought judgeship was worth it. And justice Ahmadi said: ‘Absolutely! Every minute of it!’ I was appointed judge around two and half years later when I was 40. And now, I feel the same way,” said justice Chandrachud.He shared another incident when he went to meet another retired Supreme Court judge with a colleague, SA Bobde – the present CJI. Both justice Chandrachud and justice Bobde practised as lawyers in the Bombay high court in 1997. They were both designated as senior advocates in 1998 and were also elevated as judges in the Bombay high court at the same time in 2000.“I and justice Bobde had gone to meet justice AP Sen when he was in Nagpur. He also told us it is a matter of immense satisfaction being a judge and that lawyers help a judge leave his footprints on the sands of time,” said justice Chandrachud.Referring to his conversations with some young lawyers, justice Chandrachud said that a lot of young counsel were worried about the constant grind of being a judge. “They say we cannot do this day in and day out. I believe it is a matter of temperament after all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremendous-satisfaction-in-giving-nod-justice-chandrachud-on-permanent-commission-for-women-officers-101615314263416.html
10-03-2021||India||Maharashtra guv’s meeting may have led to Trivendra Rawat’s exit in Uttarakhand||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) decision to remove Trivendra Singh Rawat a year before the polls appears to be a move to quell intraparty resentment against the chief minister, people aware of the developments said on Tuesday.A considerable number of MLAs were upset that the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) pracharak-turned-CM kept many of his Cabinet colleagues out of the decision-making process, according to several people Hindustan Times spoke to at various levels of the party. While unhappiness had been brewing since 2018 — a year after Rawat took over — things gathered momentum last month.The immediate trigger is said to be a meeting between a group of Uttarakhand legislators and Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. While Koshyari tweeted a picture with the CM, it was his meeting with some BJP MLAs that started the process of his eventual exit just a year before Uttarakhand polls, party insiders said.According to a person aware of the details, the BJP MLAs took the opportunity to pour their heart out to Koshyari who was chief minister of Uttarakhand from 2001-2002 and had, incidentally, also been replaced by the party brass just before the 2002 elections.“The MLAs told the governor how Rawat didn’t meet his Cabinet colleagues, or party MLAs or even the state’s MPs,’’ said the person cited above. That message and its severity, coming so close to the state elections, was conveyed immediately to the party bosses in Delhi. The governor’s office confirmed that he was in Dehradun last month but said that it didn’t have any information about this meeting.“It’s absolutely untrue to think that the party removed the chief minister for any such reason,’’ said MLA and party spokesperson Munna Chauhan.“Even the Opposition will not accuse him of corruption. I think the party wants to use his expertise at a larger, national level and so they have moved him.’’That’s the view the central BJP is also putting out on the record. “We felt that he should be moved to the national level,’’ said Dushyant Kumar Gautam, the state in-charge who was sent to address the rebellion.However, off the record, BJP leaders tell a different story. The story of how the 60-year-old was seen as honest but also headstrong, refusing to listen to his party men and favouring bureaucrats over the politicians.“He would not allow any political interference in transfers,’’ said a top official of the state, asking not to be named. “If any minister or MLA recommended someone for a post, he would never listen to them. He was very strict.’’While the hard taskmaster was a good role model, political workers of the state point out that he refused to share power and kept all the important portfolios for himself. The government website shows that he had 60-odd portfolios assigned to the chief minister’s office and the Cabinet expansion that was expected never took place.“What’s most important is that while he sided with the bureaucrats, his team of bureaucrats didn’t create the right kind of impression for the government,’’ said the official quoted above.“The biggest problem was that he never consulted anyone about the decisions he took,’’ said a party worker. “For instance, he announced Gairsain as a new administrative division, other than Kumaon and Garhwal, in the budget a few days ago without speaking to anyone or informing anyone. This is a politically sensitive decision and so everyone got very upset.’’ When the local MLAs confronted him, the chief minister is said to have dismissed their concerns.Former CM and central observer Raman Singh acknowledged there were several factors behind Rawat’s removal. “It’s a decision that was taken after consultations at various levels of the party,’’ he said. Singh will oversee an MLAs’ meeting on Wednesday after which a new CM will emerge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discontent-among-mlas-may-have-triggered-rawat-s-ouster-101615313963481.html
10-03-2021||India||Govt considers privatisation of 90 railway stations, mulls airport-like security infra||The Indian Railways is considering having private companies operate 90 train stations and is exploring several options – including looking at the arrangements at India’s privately run airports – to determine how best to set up the security infrastructure at these.Railways, which runs the fourth-largest such network in the world, set the ball rolling in 2019 on letting private companies run and operate certain stations in a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The move, steered by the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) is expected to help significantly modernise parts of a decades-old system.The Railway Board, in a letter reviewed by HT, sought the opinion from all principal chief security commissioners of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and all zonal railways on how the security infrastructure for the 90 stations should be set up.One of the options, it noted in the letter, would be to replicate the airports’ model where the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) – a government paramilitary unit – is contracted by the operator, which pays their salaries.“The airport operators not only provide and maintain the security infrastructure and equipment at the airports, but also pay for the salary and wages of the CISF personnel deployed there. Therefore, the complete cost of providing security at the airport is borne by the airport operators Therefore, Security Directorate has to take a view on how the security infrastructure, equipment, etc will be provided and maintained at a station under SFM. We may also examine if the airport model may be replicated or otherwise,” it added.According to the letter, a committee examining these details has suggested that security and access control services (barring maintenance of assets that enable them), should be kept out of the agreement with the private companies. SFM refers to the Station Facility Management that will come up following the agreement.The letter enumerated two more options that may be considered by the Security Directorate: In one of them, the SFM bears “the responsibility of provision and maintenance of security infrastructure and equipment along with the cost of manpower including (RPF 50% Government Railway Police)”.In the other option, it noted that this responsibility may be borne by the Railways instead.The railway board has sought these inputs by March 15.In October 2019, the government decided to set up a committee to draft a blueprint for transferring the operations of 150 trains and 50 railway stations to private firms. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant in a letter to then railway board chairman VK Yadav stated that an empowered group be formed to “drive the process” in a time-bound manner.“Approaches to provision of security services in infrastructure has always been a contentious issue. Initially under the airport model (Delhi and Mumbai Operation, Management and Development Agreements) the provision of security services was retained with the state, however later models provide for security infrastructure to be maintained by private parties as well,” said Deepto Roy, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.“The key principle of PPP is that the party most suited to take a risk and perform an activity should be entrusted the responsibility for that activity - this is in line with the Kelkar committee recommendations as well... given the complexities of railway security, the responsibility should be retained ideally by the government — with costs met from the revenue share. If this is not possible - significant oversight of SFM security services should be put in place,” he added.In September, the ministry said it opened the Request for Qualification process of the bidding for eight railway stations: Nagpur, Gwalior, Amritsar, Sabarmati, Nellore, Puducherry, Dehradun and Tirupati. “Private developers have shown interest and accordingly, RFQ applications for all 8 stations have been received,” the ministry said at the time.Work has also begun on the redevelopment at Gandhinagar and Habibganj and awarded contracts for redevelopment of Anand Vihar (Northern Railway), Bijwasan (Northern Railway) and Chandigarh (Northern Railway) railway stations.Railways also decided to start levying an additional fee on train fares across its redeveloped stations. The user development fee is similar to what airports charge and will be used by the national transporter for the first time.Indian Railways also plans to introduce private trains on its network in phases, with the first dozen due to start running in the 2023-24 financial year and all 151 by 2027.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-explores-privatisation-of-90-rly-stations-101615313903438.html
10-03-2021||India||Lancet publishes phase 2 trial data in boost for Covaxin’s safety credentials||Covaxin, the coronavirus vaccine made by Bharat Biotech, works better when given four weeks apart instead of two and a higher dosing – which was eventually selected for phase 3 trials and the concurrent roll-out – elicits a better immune memory, according to interim phase 2 clinical trial data published in the medical journal Lancet Infectious Diseases on Tuesday.The results were previously announced on December 23, but have now been peer-reviewed and published. Phase 2 data doesn’t help determine efficacy although it is used to confirm that the vaccine is safe and that it produces an immune reaction.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe results draw a comparison between phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials – volunteers were given doses at two weeks in the first phase, but the interval was widened in the later phase. The study also reported findings from a long-term follow-up of phase 1 participants, which showed antibodies to persist for at least three months.“After either dose, the combined incidence of local and systemic adverse events in this study is lower than that of other Sars-CoV-2 vaccine platform candidates, and similar to that of other inactivated Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidates,” the study says, while cautioning that a like-for-like comparison may be difficult since “other vaccine studies have enrolled different populations and have employed varying approaches to measure adverse events”.The vaccine, also known by its codename BBV152, uses an inactivated coronavirus and includes an adjuvant to train the immune system into recognising the Sars-Cov-2. On March 3, Bharat Biotech said interim phase 3 data showed the vaccine was 81% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19. The data is yet to be released.The latest study suggests Covaxin shows a similar safety and immunogenicity profile as other inactivated virus vaccines. “BBV152 induced antibody binding (to spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein epitopes) and neutralising antibody responses that were similar to those induced by other Sars-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine candidates,” the report said.Also Read | Covid shock: Tax revenue estimate slashed by 33.5%On side effects, the report added: “The most common adverse event in the phase 2 trial was pain at the injection site, followed by headache, fatigue, and fever. No severe or life-threatening (ie, grade 4 and 5) solicited adverse events were reported”.For phase 2 clinical trials, two intramuscular doses were administered four-weeks apart in a total of 380 participants across nine hospitals in nine states in a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Covaxin.“In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial,” the paper said.Bharat Biotech has developed the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBV152) in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It is the first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine.The virus strain (NIV-2020-770) containing the Asp614Gly mutation, isolated from a COVID-19 patient who came in from Wuhan (China), and sequenced at ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, was provided to Bharat Biotech in May last year.“The phase 3 interim results showing efficacy of almost 81% will help build confidence in the vaccine. It is natural to see the amount of interest in taking the shot that is being currently seen, especially in upper and middle class,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, senior public health expert, and founder, Public Health Foundation of India.The Covaxin was approved for use in India by the national drugs regulator on January 3 based on its safety and immunogenicity results, and also efficacy it showed in animal studies.For the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, the company recruited 25,800 Indian participants from across the country.Apart from Covaxin, Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India as Covishield is currently approved for use in India.At least 23 million doses have been administered of the two vaccines during the national immunisation drive that started on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-publishes-phase-2-trial-data-in-boost-for-covaxin-s-safety-and-efficacy-credentials-101615313904005.html

The country is approaching 2.5 crore total vaccination coverage, powered by the fastest recent growth in vaccination globally,” the government said in a statement.“States were asked to prepare a detailed roadmap for the next three months for achieving the same,” the statement issued by the press and information bureau added. The focus, particularly, should be on involving private sector in a big way, the states were advised.“… leverage the private sector to the maximum to enhance coverage, taking advantage of the liberal enabling guidelines issued by the Centre; registering and activating as many private facilities as possible; providing sufficient stock of vaccines necessary for these centres to work at their optimum and providing any other facilitation required,” the states were told.India aims to deliver 300 million doses to the most at-risk due to their jobs or health factors.During the meeting, held over a video conference, a variety of topics were discussed, including how states can expand capacity; on-board and operationalise as many health facilities as possible as vaccination centres, widen access across states, districts, towns and villages, and especially identify existing geographical dark-zones through geo-spatial analysis.States should also and maximise efficiency by keeping as many vaccination centres operational daily as possible, it was suggested.Also Read: Lancet publishes phase 2 trial data in boost for Covaxin’s safety and efficacy credentialsAnother important advice was to enable smooth and safe service delivery by ensuring convenient registration for citizens, maximising available slots on Co-WIN with all vaccination centres publishing sessions for up to 4 weeks in advance.States are being asked to encourage registration and prior appointments instead of walk-ins to avoid crowding at centres. This will help make it more convenient for citizen as well as giving authorities a forward view of expected demand to plan accordingly.The overall progress must be reviewed on a real-time, disaggregated basis down to the district and block level, leveraging the end-to-end data integration of the Co-WIN platform, for continuous and customized management.The stakeholders, who attended the meeting, included state chief secretaries, officers, secretaries of pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health research, member (health), Niti Aayog and chief executive officer of the National Health Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-million-vaccine-doses-delivered-in-a-day-govt-101615313783412.html
10-03-2021||India||Ambani security threat: Political slugfest over death of car owner||Mumbai Maharashtra leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday demanded the arrest of a senior police officer in connection with the death of auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, linked to the vehicle found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter.Fadnavis accused the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of shielding assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and called for his arrest under section 201 of Indian Penal Code, which pertains to causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information. He referred to a statement by Hiran’s wife, Vimla, 43, to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) on March 7.Also Read: NIA to probe recovery of explosive-laden vehicle outside Ambani residence“In her statement, Mansukh Hiran’s wife has said that the car found outside Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s South Mumbai residence, was in possession of Sachin Vaze from November 20 last year. The car was given to him for use as Hiren knew Vaze who was the former’s customer. The vehicle was with Vaze before it was returned to Hiren after four months,” Fadnavis said on Tuesday.Vaze, who heads the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai police crime branch, did not respond to several calls and messages.An SUV with explosives was found near Ambani’s house on February 25. Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane resident, claimed it was stolen from his possession a week earlier.He was found dead in creek in Thane on March 5 and police found handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth. Vimla said her husband was a good swimmer and could not have died by drowning. “Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered…I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder,” read her statement.Fadnavis’s comments in the assembly caused an uproar among legislators, who traded accusations and brought up other unrelated cases, including the death by suicide of Dadra Nagar Haveli parliamentarian Mohan Delkar in Mumbai last month. Later, state home minister Anil Deshmukh announced a special investigation team (SIT) will be formed to probe Delkar’s death by suicide. In his note, Delkar had mentioned an administrator of the Union Territory who was a previous minister in Gujarat.Vimla’s statement, reviewed by HT, said the SUV belonged to a certain Peter Newton who was known to Hiran. Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop on February 5.On February 17, the statement said Hiran took the vehicle towards south Mumbai but poor steering prompted Hiran to park the car on the side of the road. He came back next day with a mechanic but found the car stolen and lodged a police complaint.On February 25, he identified the SUV as the same one found outside the Ambani residence. For the next three days, he was questioned and told his wife that Vaze was with him, said her statement. On March 2, Hiran wrote a letter to various authorities complaining of harassment by police and media. Vimla said she asked him if he was tortured, which Hiran denied.The following day, Hiran told her that Vaze had advised him to get arrested and he would be out on bail within a few days, according to Vimla’s statement. On March 4, Vimala said her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer.Vimla told police that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. The next day, Hiran’s body was found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambani-security-threat-political-slugfest-over-death-of-car-owner-101615313663373.html
10-03-2021||Today's||Embracing techno-alliances of the future||If tariffs were Donald Trump’s weapon of choice against China, technology is going to be Joe Biden’s. Even as the Quad leaders prepare for their first-ever summit meeting on Friday, Washington has begun piecing together a set of coalitions designed to counter China’s dominance in key technologies. Some of these alliances may be centred around the Quad. India should watch this space carefully. If these “techno-alliances” start to come together, they could be a major economic and geopolitical opportunity for India. But New Delhi must be prepared to dilute some of the economic fixations it has developed.In its recent Interim National Security Strategy, the Biden administration says the United States (US) will seek to shape “emerging technology standards to boost our security, economic competitiveness, and values…We will join with like-minded democracies to develop and defend trusted critical supply chains and technology infrastructure”. The Biden administration’s plan is more than just about reducing dependency on China for various technological inputs. It is also about ring-fencing know-how against Beijing’s penchant for large-scale intellectual property pilfering. It is also about re-establishing the US and its partners as world leaders in innovation and production efficiency.Early reports on these techno-alliance plans say semiconductors are first on the list. Semiconductors are in the news thanks to a global shortage, itself partly because of Chinese hoarding. It is also an industry dominated by a handful of countries, most of whom are US allies. China would not be denied these chips, but the alliance would seek to ensure that the technology’s future trajectory is not decided by Beijing.Each techno-alliance would be sui generis, built around a set of countries competitive in a certain technology. The Trump administration had urged India to join a nascent US-Japan 5G coalition and the new US president will probably do the same. Plans are on for coalitions regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing, biotechnology, surveillance technology and more. Most of these will begin by simply setting common rules, standards and practices. Over time, they could become more complicated with member-states offering each other market access, sharing technology and perhaps subsidies to boost alternatives to Made in China goods and services.Some of these coalitions will coalesce around existing multilateral groupings. The most obvious one would be the Group of Seven. Another could be the Quad. While most reports say India is a target country, US officials say Washington internally wonders how far New Delhi is prepared to join such arrangements given its autarkic tendencies. India is also not a major research and development (R&D) centre for most such technologies and a niche player in terms of advanced manufacturing.India’s contribution, and benefit, would be in being able to provide a competitive and alternative site if sensitive manufacturing has to be moved out of China. It would be an obvious player where software is concerned, for example in 5G. However, India would have to accept being part of an export control regime to ensure against the leakage of technology to China. This would be needed for even associate club membership.In the Biden administration’s view, the real brake on a Quad-based tech arrangement is India’s reluctance to sign up with anything that is explicitly anti-Chinese. The US hopes that India will be less risk averse following the Galwan Valley clashes. The other Quad members have taken heart at the alacrity with which India accepted President Biden’s proposal for a Quad summit. There is also a smaller debate in Washington as to whether India has become too authoritarian to be included in surveillance and AI technology groupings.The real obstacle to India becoming genuinely aligned with any techno-alliances will be its own domestic economic policies. When it comes to 5G, for example, New Delhi is insisting on a set of India-specific standards seen as obsolete by most telecom equipment makers — and out of sync with global coalition-making. India has also dragged its heels about a Japanese-proposed Supply Chain Resilience Initiative, a sort of techno-alliance lite. Tokyo wants to bring in key Southeast Asian countries essential to electronics and industrial components. The Indian commerce ministry has stalled proceedings, arguing unrealistically that all these supply chain segments should be shifted to India. The line ministries and regulators concerned are blind to the geopolitical imperatives involved.Over the next few months, the US will stitch together these coalitions one by one. India will be invited to the inaugural ceremony, but is likely to dither about going any further if it hasn’t given the concept serious thought. The Narendra Modi government should set up an inter-ministerial task force to begin weighing the implications of the coming Silicon War and how India should respond. If it plays its cards correctly, India could become a major hub for these techno-alliances with benefits in terms of domestic manufacturing, experts as well as cutting-edge research. If it attempts to adhere to either Atmanirbhar Bharat or Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam in their purest form, however, it may find itself once again on the margins of the international economic system. Tech-alignment may define geopolitics this century. India should prepare accordingly.pramitpc@yahoo.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/embracing-techno-alliances-of-the-future-101615382128995.html
10-03-2021||Today's||The significance of the LoC ceasefire for bordering communities||A rare joint statement by the Indian and Pakistani directors general of military operations, on February 25, announcing that the two countries have agreed to strictly observe the ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) triggered much speculation over what brought about the turnaround. Moeed Yusuf, special assistant on national security to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, called the announcement a “victory of diplomacy” and added that “more avenues” will open in the future, amid reports that back-channel meetings at neutral locations led to the pact.Analysts linked the reiteration of the observance of the truce along the de facto border to the protracted stand-off between the Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh and New Delhi’s attempts to avoid a two-front conflict with two allied adversaries. Many wondered whether the new Joe Biden administration had nudged the two countries to normalise ties. The Pulwama attack, the subsequent Balakot strike, and India’s move to change the constitutional status of J&K escalated tensions between the two countries in 2019. The following year, the highest ceasefire violations — about 5,000 —were reported along the de facto border.But while the roots of the current thaw can be debated, the only question that matters for the residents in the constant line of fire along the 740-km border is whether the ceasefire will sustain long enough for them to live to fight another day, or whether their lives and livelihood will again be sacrificed at the altar of narrow political ends. The breakthrough means they can tend to their fields, and educate their children without worrying whether they would be able to return home alive.Cross-border shelling over the years has destroyed livelihoods, left crops unharvested, and forced even well-off people to opt for small-time jobs in faraway towns to sustain their families. Most of the border areas are inaccessible and remote, and were even denied mobile phone connectivity for years due to their proximity to Pakistan.Border residents can now hope to live their lives with dignity without having to often rush to cramped bunkers to save their lives. Cross-border shelling has not just left hundreds dead but has taken an emotional toll on survivors. Many border areas such as Karnah are so remote that people have to stock up supplies for the winter months before snow cuts it off from the outside world. The cross-LoC shelling would even hamper the stocking and evacuation of wounded residents.In Kashmir’s hillside Churnada village of 1,600 people, which lost two residents in 2020 to cross-border shelling, residents gathered at the shrine of a Muslim saint to celebrate the new agreement. They heaved a sigh of relief that they could now finally till their land, graze their cattle and send their children to school without fear. As many as 70 civilians and 72 soldiers have died in cross-border firing since 2018. According to Reuters, nearly 300 civilians have been killed since 2014 in ceasefire violations on the Pakistani side. It reported that in the picturesque Neelum valley on the other side, hundreds of hotels and guesthouses came up when the ceasefire held as tourists visited around the year. Reuters said tourism went into a tailspin and guesthouse operators were forced to dig into their savings as skirmishes and firing increased.The divided border residents on both sides can only hope the ceasefire is not derailed like it was in the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The 2003-2008 era of peace brought rich dividends for border communities and led to the start of cross-LoC bus services. This would have been unthinkable a decade earlier, as it was akin to Pakistan’s acknowledgment of the Indian sovereignty over J&K.The reiteration of the commitment to the truce has raised hopes for a dialogue process effectively stalled since 2008. That top national security officials are believed to have been involved in the back-channel talks ahead of the turnaround should hold out hope.A similar engagement led to the ceasefire agreement first in 2003 that translated into over a half-decade calm in Kashmir and a degree of healing. Build on the current moment.sameer.arshadkhatlani@htlive.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-significance-of-the-loc-ceasefire-for-bordering-communities-101615296625388.html
10-03-2021||Today's||Defence: The disjunct between words and action||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi addressed the Combined Commanders Conference (CCC) at Kevadia, Gujarat, on March 6, and in his characteristic manner, departed from tradition by directing that personnel below officer rank (PBOR) would also be part of the deliberations.This the first time that the annual conference, where the PM meets the combined top brass of the Indian military, included Junior Commissioned Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers (JCOs-NCOs). It is a radical departure in form but vintage Modi. Whether this kind of inclusiveness will have meaningful long-term benefits to the national security agenda of the CCC remains moot and can be gauged only much later.It may be recalled that in his first term, PM Modi recast the CCC template with a flourish when he moved the venue from the staid confines of Delhi to distant Kochi. The commanders met on board the aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, in December 2015 and the PM gave a clear-and-strong signal to the commanders about his national security priorities. In the 2014 election campaign, Modi, the candidate, berated the United Progressive Alliance government for its somnolence at the wheel in relation to the defence sector and resolved that if elected, he would make amends — swiftly.Thus, the December 2015 CCC was rich in detail about what Modi, now the PM, would focus on with characteristic resolve. The excerpts from the PM’s address, released by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), at the time constituted a comprehensive document of about 2,350 words.In what could be yet another departure, the gist of the PM’s address to the CCC this year was communicated in a short 350-word PIB release. This was disappointing, for with the Galwan face-off of mid-2020 and the uneasy disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops still a work-in-progress, the nation would have benefited from a 2015 kind of elucidation by the PM about the challenges to India’s national security and the blueprint that the higher defence apex would be reviewing. This would also have been valuable, given the fiscal constraints that the pandemic has imposed on the national exchequer and its attendant implications for the material state of the Indian fauj.At Kevadia, the PM “stressed on the importance of enhancing indigenisation in the national security system”. Furthermore, dwelling on the rapidly changing technological landscape, he “highlighted the need to develop the Indian military into a future force”. The need for India to enhance indigenous efforts at providing major military inventory and capabilities has been an abiding theme from the era of PM Indira Gandhi to that of Manmohan Singh, but the results have been well below the median.While there have been some islands of success — for instance, missile and space capability, as also in the nuclear domain (including submarine propulsion) — the stark reality is that India is yet to design and manufacture even a personal weapon (rifle) that would be of international standards.Having inherited a deeply inefficient public sector defence research and development (R&D) and manufacturing ecosystem, PM Modi, in his first term, made indigenisation a priority, along with an overhaul of defence procurement that moves at a glacial pace.In 2015, Modi asserted, “We will soon reform our procurement policies and process. And, our offsets policy will become a strategic tool for improving our capabilities in defence technologies.” Six years later, the results apropos indigenisation have been modest, though many projects are in the pipeline and expected to reach fruition — hopefully soon.The intractable nature of the Indian defence bureaucracy and its tenacious reluctance to adapt to change has often frustrated the PM and he has urged the system to review its own track record and improve itself. This exhortation was evident in Kevadia 2021 where the PM “called for a holistic approach, focused on breaking down civil-military silos and on expediting the speed of decision making”.To his credit, Modi took the long-delayed political decision to revamp India’s higher defence organisation and move towards synergising army-air force-navy capabilities by creating the post of a Chief of Defence Staff and theatre commands. But this is still a work-in-progress and some changes that have been mooted will have to be reviewed and calibrated astutely.The PM’s emphasis on the Indian military as a “future force”, predicated on the changing technological landscape, is timely and welcome. The current profile of the Indian military with its large manpower content (this is particularly true of the army) will have to be transmuted in a manner whereby the resultant force is threat-relevant, effective and affordable. Technology is the key and translating the PM’s vision will be a complex human resource and fiscal challenge.On current evidence, the bench strength of team Modi in the defence sector is wafer-thin and having four defence ministers in the first term is case in point.But it is the fiscal constraint that remains daunting. On March 8, Parliament was informed that in FY 2021-22, the capital budget for defence had been slashed by a whopping ₹76,553 crore.The Indian fauj remains caught between a rock and a hard place, and the PM will have to do more to translate his words into action.C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy StudiesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/defence-the-disjunct-between-words-and-action-101615296622922.html
10-03-2021||Today's||How Covid-19 can transform health care||The pandemic disrupted life, livelihoods, education and health like little else in recent history. The world found innovations and adaptations to minimise some of the disruptions for some people, but not all. Health care disruptions, less amenable to home-based solutions, ranged across a very broad continuum — a shift in health-seeking behaviour, limitations in health infrastructure, difficulties in outreach to community members, lack of availability of human resources and interruptions in supply chains. Not all of these were limited to the context of the pandemic — some have pre-existed but got magnified in the context of the pandemic.Covid-19 saw health care workers diverted to the much-needed task of preventing and dealing with infections, taking them away from their regular tasks, and thus, further reducing the availability of health care workers. Health care facilities were deployed for testing and treating patients, but this made them unavailable for regular services. Supply chains were disrupted due to lockdowns. When health facilities were functioning, citizens were either fearful or unable to travel to them or were unaware that facilities were functioning. All this led to significant disruption in the provision of essential health services such as routine immunisation, testing and treating tuberculosis (TB) patients, maternal and child health care and nutrition-related interventions.But India is no stranger to innovation. A few months into the pandemic, there were a variety of interventions, which sought to address some of these barriers related to health human resources, demand for and access to services, and provision to the last mile. Innovations were found in at least four categories — leveraging technology, leveraging community platforms, strengthening frontline workers and augmenting supply chains.Extensive interventions leveraged the digital platform such as remote counselling and consultation in several states; a child growth-monitoring app for remote monitoring of severely acute malnourished children in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh; an Interactive Voice Response System-based solution in Uttar Pradesh for reminder calls to the community about immunisation sessions; digital surveillance applications for front-line workers for TB and Covid-vulnerability assessment in states such as Gujarat, Kerala and Punjab for simultaneous TB and Covid assessment; an artificial intelligence-based diagnostics solution to scan chest X-rays and detect abnormalities.Various organisations leveraged digital platforms to conduct training and information sessions for frontline workers. The range of such services and their providers is vast including e-Sanjeevani, Swasth, Practo, Portea, TeCHO, Anmol, to name just a few.The involvement of community-based organisations in the form of self-help groups (SHGs) and village organisations reinforced their potential for last-mile services. Active TB case finding by community health volunteers through outreach and awareness; demand generation for services and provision of timely information to pregnant women by volunteer groups through helpline numbers; support for essential health service delivery through panchayati raj institutions contributed to strengthening health services.The Indian postal department was leveraged for its extensive postal network as an alternative logistics chain for delivery of family planning commodities. Social franchising model for TB diagnosis and drug dispensation via e-pharmacies to the doorsteps of patients was also utilised.India saw many innovations rolled out, although not necessarily at scale and most not evaluated for impact. Based on rigorous impact evaluations, there is potential for scale and convergence. It is not that this potential is not recognised by the government. The introduction of telemedicine guidelines and the launch of the National Digital Health Mission provide a foundation for greater leverage of the digital platform. Admittedly, limited internet penetration in rural India, gender disparity in internet usage, data privacy and data-sharing ethics concerns limit the impact of digital platforms, but an increasing focus on health technology platforms can address, to some extent, the needs of information, triaging, counselling, consultation, scheduling visits, home delivery of drugs, and remote follow-up reducing some of the demand- and supply-side challenges.Similarly, a stronger policy environment can enable the 70 million SHG women members to play an institutionalised role in health service functions, such as behaviour change interventions, demand for essential services, community-led accountability of health systems and services.The pandemic saw multiple innovations surface, some deployed in small geographies, some by private organisations and others by the government, most not evaluated for impact. These innovations merit policy attention — in assessing their impact, in their geographic scale, in convergence of currently fragmented services, and in developing meaningful partnerships with private innovators for public adoption.Scaling innovations requires attention to at least three aspects. One, assessment of innovation impact and certification, which, in turn, will require institutional mechanisms that can enable this. Second, a policy environment that encourages and facilitates public contracting of innovations, in a context where the benefits of purchasing existing, tried-and-tested products/services in the public system are large. Third, grant-and-loan mechanisms that enable innovators to address the needs of the health care system. The platforms on which these innovations are deployed are under-leveraged, with the pandemic demonstrating the opportunity to build on these innovations, leading to a stronger health systems response.Sandhya Venkateswaran is fellow, Lancet Citizen’s Commission on Reimagining India’s Health SystemThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-covid-19-can-transform-health-care-101615296083608.html
10-03-2021||Editorials||A crisis for the British monarchy | HT Editorial||The British monarchy has gone through its share of crises — from more personal controversies around Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage to political challenges, including a republican strain which sees the institution as antiquated and out of line with the democratic spirit of modern times. But few episodes will do as much damage to the credibility of the monarchy as an institution as the interview of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Megan Markle, who have walked away from the royal family to begin life anew in the United States (US).In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple made a series of charges against the royal family — the most damaging of which was Ms Markle’s disclosure that when they were about to have a child, members of the royal family had conversations about “how dark the skin might be when he is born”. Harry confirmed the conversation, expressing his shock — but made it clear subsequently that it was neither Queen Elizabeth nor Prince Philip who made the remark. Ms Markle also spoke about how there were times when she did not want to live anymore, and painted a picture of an apathetic and insensitive royal establishment.While the entire episode may be seen as yet another internal dispute of the elite, it has created a crisis of credibility for the royal family — for charges of racism from within are hard to counter. It has led to a divide between allies on either side of the Atlantic, with the popular mood in the US firmly with the young couple while the mood in the United Kingdom remains more ambivalent. But at the core, the issue is about how the monarchy as an institution is increasingly losing its traditional, political, and now popular legitimacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-crisis-for-the-british-monarchy-hteditorial-101615296624022.html
10-03-2021||Editorials||Make water a core issue | HT Editorial||A draft of China’s new Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) has cleared the building of dams on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river, as the Brahmaputra is known in Tibet, before it flows into India, according to a news report in The Hindu. The draft is set to be formally approved on March 11. The issue of building dams on the Yarlung Zangbo, which China views as necessary for generating clean electricity and meeting its climate goals, has, for long, evoked two kinds of responses in India. According to one set of experts, dams on the Brahmaputra will affect the flow of water into India. But some other experts say that this is an unwarranted concern because the Brahmaputra’s volume is determined not so much by the water flowing into India from Tibet as it is by monsoon-fed tributaries of the river that originate in Arunachal Pradesh.To devise a plan to engage China on the issue of the Brahmaputra dams, it is important to understand two fundamental issues. One, China’s geographical position (an upper riparian State) cannot be altered. Two, the Indian and Chinese approach towards water-related issues with the neighbours have followed different trajectories. While India, as an upper riparian neighbour, has always opted for a treaty-based approach with Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh, China’s approach with 11 of its neighbours with whom it shares rivers, has been more unilateral. Beijing uses water and dams as instruments of hard politics. Unlike India, Beijing has little respect for legal conventions — the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention is an example. India does not have a water treaty with China.In this backdrop, India needs to refine its approach. While pushing China for seamless data-sharing on Brahmaputra-related aspects such as rainfall and water flow (irrespective of the politics of the day), New Delhi must strive to make water a core issue for bilateral dialogue along with the boundary matter. At the same time, India must focus on building water storage capacities in the Northeast so that its needs are not compromised in case of a natural or man-made crisis; draw benefits from its own rivers; and focus on building a lower riparian coalition of Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar to lobby international support for recognising Tibet’s water as a common resource.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/make-water-a-core-issue-hteditorial-101615295842581.html
