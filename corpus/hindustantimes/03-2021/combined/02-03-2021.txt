Parallelly, we also got to know that some people are roaming around with the question paper. So, we set a trap and arrested some more people. We have found the paper from the phone of one arrested person around 10 am and that is why exam scheduled for 11 am was cancelled,” said Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta. A response was sought by HT from the appropriate authorities of the Indian Army and was awaited until the report going to press. The police are now investigating the source of the leak.

The three arrested in the case registered at Wanowrie police station have been remanded to police custody until March 6 by a local court. “We arrested three people on Sunday based on the information we received and found question papers on their phones. We also confirmed that the paper we had found was the right one. The exam was to be held at around 40 centres all over the country for 30,000 aspirants.

The wind speed on Tuesday was high and gusty, varying between 12 to 22 knots which is around 24 to 40km per hour,” said an official at IMD. On Tuesday, the minimum and maximum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 17.1°C and 27.6°C, respectively, while the same a day earlier was 15.6°C and 27.6°C. “The winds in the region are north westerly, but they are comparatively warmer. There is a feeble western disturbance arriving from Jammu and Kashmir, that prior to causing rains are slightly warmer. The mercury may rise further, but due to constant and gusty wind in the region, the heat would be bearable,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecaster.Meanwhile, air quality of Noida on Tuesday further improved due to better ventilation. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Tuesday improved to 153 against 169 a day earlier.However, AQI of Greater Noida on Tuesday deteriorated slightly to 218 against 215 a day earlier, Ghaziabad’s AQI was 218 against 208 on Monday.An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to oscillate between ‘satisfactory’ and lower end of ‘poor’.“Surface winds are high and forecasted to stay high for the next 24 hours; the improved ventilation is influencing AQI positively. The winter fury appears to be over but now Delhi air will start getting influenced by mineral dust. AQI is forecasted to marginally improve and stay within the high end of the satisfactory to moderate category for tomorrow. A marginal deterioration and moderate AQI is forecasted on March 4 and 5,” said a statement released by SAFAR on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-soars-in-noida-gusty-winds-improve-air-quality-101614708448842.html
02-03-2021||Noida||Delhi Police shuts one lane of Delhi-Meerut Expressway after opening for a few hours||The Delhi Police on Tuesday opened up one lane of the heavily barricaded Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) on the Delhi-Ghaziabad side, only to shut it once again within a couple of hours. All the 14 lanes of the DME have been blocked by Delhi Police ever since January 26, when violence broke out between protesting farmers and police personnel. Thousands of commuters travelling from Delhi to Ghaziabad are required to follow diversions or take up alternate routes. Even the side road from Ghazipur to Vaishali in Ghaziabad is heavily barricaded by the police. “My friends and I were overjoyed when we heard that Delhi-Ghaziabad lane was opened up. Couple of hours later, we heard that it was blocked again. Thousands of commuters from Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and nearby areas are facing a tough time during peak hours as they are forced to follow alternate routes. This is nothing short of harassment for the common man,” said Kuldeep Saxena, resident of Indirapuram, who travels daily to his office at Katwariya Sarai in South Delhi. “If commuters use alternate routes via Kaushambi, they get stuck in long traffic jams. Many are now following the canal road which leads them to Ghazipur. However, commuters are required to travel through areas near the filthy Ghazipur landfill site,” Saxena added. Many commuters are braving odds and using unpaved dusty road through a forest to travel to Vaishali and nearby localities as the main road from Ghazipur to Vaishali is barricaded. “These routes must be opened immediately. Even if one has to go to Connaught Place in Delhi, it takes about one to one-and-a-half hours as opposed to 20-25 minutes via the expressway,” said BK Pandey, a resident of Sector 5, Vaishali. The Ghaziabad police officials said that they have no role in closing down the expressway as the barricading was put up by the Delhi police. “They opened one of the lanes on late Monday night and commuters used it on Tuesday morning to travel to Ghaziabad. However, they closed the lane again on Tuesday afternoon,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (City 2). Senior Delhi Police officers who did not want to be named said that no official order was issued to open up the border. The opening up of the border on Tuesday was only a temporary arrangement to facilitate the movement of emergency vehicles. “We had been facilitating the movement of ambulances earlier as well. The movement of vehicles was restored for a few hours in the morning as some emergency vehicles were stuck in the jam. The route has been closed again because there is no official order to open up the border,” said a Delhi Police officer, requesting anonymity. The protesting farmers, on the other hand, said that they have no issues if the Delhi Police decides to remove the barricades. “Our protest is being carried out only on one lane of the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway while the rest of the expressway is not occupied. If they want, they can open up the lanes. We also demand that the unoccupied lanes should be opened up for commuters who are facing issues,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. The National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) officials said that due to closure of the border and expressway lanes, their pending works for the DME have been held up or delayed, despite the completion date of March 31 approaching fast. “Many works are getting delayed, such as installation of cameras, marking of directions, installation of signage, etc. Once the protest site gets cleared, we will make the assessment of damage caused to the new expressway. As a result of the protest, we are also not able to take up periodic assessments of the flyover as well,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.

02-03-2021||Gurugram||Employees of auto parts firm strike seeking pay hike||Employees of an auto parts company based in Manesar in Haryana protested against the firm’s alleged failure to revise their wages and keep other promises, pending for over two years. The protesters staged a demonstration outside the premises of the firm and said they would not leave the place till their demands are met.The Gurugram police deployed around 500 personnel in Manesar on Tuesday, following the protest.The employees of Satyam Auto Parts Component Limited said the wage revision has been pending since March 2019, and despite repeated promises and meetings, the company management has failed to keep its words.The employees, who had been boycotting lunch in the company premises since February 22 went on strike on March 1 after the company management forcibly asked them to partake the lunch, said Ravi Kumar, an employee of the company and leader of the labour union.“During the Covid-19 pandemic, the management asked the employees to co-operate and increase the production and we did. We also accepted wage cuts, however, despite the improving situation, the manager has refused to revise the wage. We were forced to resume the strike as our demands were not met,” said Kumar. A spokesperson for Satyam Auto said, “We are making efforts to resolve this issue in next couple of days.”Jaspal Rana, a trade union leader, said workers have been demanding wage revision for the last two years but there has been no response from the management and only vague assurances. The Gurugram labour department said efforts are being made to resolve the differences between the workers and the management over various issues.“A number of meetings have been held with both the sides and our efforts are to ensure that a fair deal can be struck for the benefit of all. The negotiations are on and both the sides will be asked to be flexible so that they could resolve the matter. Adequate measures have been taken to ensure there is no untoward incident and we are certain that this matter will be resolved soon,” said Manish Sharma, additional labour commissioner, NCR.Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, said two police units were deployed on Monday. “We deployed police teams to ensure peace in the area. This is a sensitive issue, and at times it may take an ugly turn. Te situation is under control, but until the issue is resolved police teams will remain deployed here’s,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/employees-of-auto-parts-firm-strike-seeking-pay-hike-101614708091649.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination registry can be done online: Health dept||Fixing appointments for Covid-19 vaccine shots will now be possible on Co-Win portal as the service has been made functional once again on Tuesday evening, facilitating citizens to schedule a time slot 24 hours before they plan to take the vaccine jab, said a senior district health department official, adding that there will be no vaccination on Wednesday. “Advance self-registration process has not been functional for the last two days as schedules were not uploaded. Therefore, the Co-Win portal showed ‘no slots available’ and people could not book appointments. Now the service is available once again, with every vaccination centre in both public and private hospitals having access to generate schedules on the platform. On Tuesday evening, the service has once again been made operational, enabling people to fix appointments before 12 noon tomorrow (Wednesday) for receiving the Covid jab on March 4,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. In the last two days, since the Covid-19 vaccination was opened for senior citizens above 60 years and those between 45 and 59 years with existing illnesses, people have been finding it troublesome to fix appointments for vaccination. According to the union ministry of health and family welfare, there are two ways to get the vaccine jab. In advance self-registration process, people can fix the date and time based on the available schedules. They can choose the centre of their choice. Second one is on-site registration for people who cannot register in advance. They can directly walk up to the nearest centre, get themselves registered and vaccinated. In Gurugram, people were able to register themselves on the Co-Win portal but could not fix the appointment for vaccination. Over 2,400 people reached almost 23 sites in the last two days and took the walk-in registration. “Once a person is registered on the portal, it becomes easy to trace them on the portal at our end . Once the registered beneficiary is identified, we take their ID proofs for verification. But in the last two days, many people had to be registered on the spot itself,” said a government medical officer, who preferred anonymity. With the appointment service being operational again, Yadav said that every vaccination centre will also have the authority to decide upon the number of people who will be inoculated through advance self-registration or walk-ins. “Every vaccination centre will get a minimum 100 vaccine doses. It is up to the centre concerned to decide as to how many doses have to be reserved for walk-ins and advance self-registration respectively. Online time slots will be fixed based on the hospitals’ decision,” said Yadav. To strengthen the co-ordination between private hospitals and the health department, a meeting will be held on Wednesday. Officials of the health department also said that staff from private hospitals will be trained to operate the Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-registry-can-be-done-online-health-dept-101614708091123.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||DTCP seals, razes illegal structures in DLF Phase-3||The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) on Tuesday sealed 150 commercial establishments that were being operated on plots meant for the economically weaker sections in U-Block of DLF Phase-3 licensed colony amid resistance from residents, said officials familiar with the matter.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that the sealing drive that is aimed at curbing illegal use of residential plots started around 1pm. Four teams, comprising 20 DTCP officials and around 100 personnel of the Gurugram Police, were deployed for the purpose.“Repeated warnings were given to the owners of these plots but they continued to violate the rule. We have sealed around 150 shops that included salons, restaurants, grocery shops, property dealer offices and other businesses,” said Bhath. Officials said that a number of complaints were lodged by residents of the area about rampant commercial activities in the area. DTCP officials said that buildings have been constructed in violation of rules on plots meant for EWS housing and commercial activities were being run from the ground floor of most of them. The department officials said that since a majority of these floors were occupied, it was not possible to evict the residents, but they decided to seal the commercial activities being carried out to curb land use violations. DTCP officials said that the sealing drive took place in the U1 and U16 lanes of the licensed colony, amid resistance from property owners. “This is one of the largest sealing drives carried out in the city and action will continue against violators,” said Bhath.The enforcement team also cleared the right of way in these two lanes by removing illegal vends, small kiosks and other encroachments by residents. “There was also resistance from locals but our team managed to convince the residents that the violations will not be allowed. Action was also taken against owners of two under-construction houses in the area, where violations were noticed,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement. Sharma also said that one of the houses — the owner of which had covered the setback — was cleared of the violation, while the other one was sealed for violations of rules. To get the properties unsealed, the department said that the violators will have to pay the penalty as per norms and submit an affidavit stating they would not carry out such violations in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-seals-razes-illegal-structures-in-dlf-phase3-101614708090569.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Turnout for second phase of vaccination remains high on Day 2||Turnout for the second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive remained high on Tuesday, with at least 1,471 people above the age of 60 years and 170 between 45 and 59 years having co-morbidities taking the jab at 23 vaccination centres across the city. The footfall increased by almost 48% compared to Monday’s count of 852, as many people directly reached private hospitals and waited in lines for long hours to take the vaccine shot. “The turnout will continue to increase as we have seen no hesitancy among people to take the shot. There have been some technical hiccups but they are getting resolved to fix the registration process. Considering the heavy footfall at some big private hospitals, vaccination has exceeded 100 a day. In the next few days, the number of vaccination sites will be increased to make the process easier,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. With the launch of vaccination for the prioritised population on March 1, the elderly population of the city has come forward in large numbers to take the vaccine shot, especially at private hospitals. On Tuesday, the health department had allocated 1,200 vaccine doses for senior citizens and people aged 45-59 years having co-morbidities. As only 250 of 1,500 targeted healthcare workers and front-line workers turned up to take their shots, the additional doses were used for the general public.However, the pace of the vaccination remained slow during the early hours.Even as residents queued up from 11am at private hospitals to take the vaccine shot, many faced delays as the Co-Win platform remained slow for over an hour during the first half of the day. In a few hospitals, the walk-in process remained chaotic. At a private hospital in Sector 24, the elderly complained that there was no one to guide them through the walk-in registration process. “We were told to come on Tuesday. Today, we have waited for almost two hours but there is no clarity when the process will begin. There is no clarity on how to get the vaccine,” said 75-year-old Reema Bhadwani, who left the vaccination centre after the staff refused to issue registration forms. Aditya Arya, another resident, who is also the founder of the city’s Camera Museum, complained of a similar issue at the hospital. A hospital staff present at the site, requesting anonymity, said, “Since the Co-Win platform was not operational for a few hours, people could not be vaccinated. Many people have reached the spot but we can only cater to people based on the allocated vaccine doses. Until the portal gets operational, even the vaccination fee cannot be charged.” To avoid delays caused by issues with the Co-Win platform, officials at Artemis Hospital asked the visitors to register themselves with the hospital’s mobile application. “People who have approached us through helpline numbers were told to register on the Artemis PHR mobile application. After the registration, they receive a message confirming the walk-in. Thereafter, at the spot, they are verified on the Co-Win and are vaccinated. The process helps in creating the payment log,” said Reena Tiwari, head administrator, Artemis Hospital. Tiwari said that those who have been walking in without appointments are also being catered to. Indu Mittal, a resident of Sector 45, who reached the hospital at 1pm, could not get vaccinated till 3.30pm. “For almost an hour, no vaccination took place. We were told the vaccine stock got over. The process has started now, but it has been very slow.” At a few government session sites, people returned after long waits. At the Nathupur urban primary health centre (UPHC), almost 15 people left after waiting till 1.30pm. “Once the portal gets functional, we will contact people and ask them to come,” said a staffer at the UPHC. The process remained slow at the Wazirabad UPHC too, with only two people being vaccinated till noon. In addition to the vaccine cost of ₹250, a few private hospitals have been charging fees for preparing the medical certificate required by people aged 45 to 59 having co-morbidities. “People have to show their previous prescriptions and case history before we sign the medical certificate at the spot. It is required as the certificate helps in addressing the hitch among people who have some sort of illness. They need to be under medical supervision before taking the shot,” said Dr Ashish Kalla, general physician, Kalyani Hospital. The hospital charges ₹400 for the additional service being provided by them, according to Kusum Narang, the marketing manager of the hospital. “Once signed, the certificate is uploaded just like any verification ID used in registration,” said Narang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/turnout-for-second-phase-of-vaccination-remains-high-on-day-2-101614708089424.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Gadkari to take stock of Dwarka Expressway progress||The union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari will visit the Dwarka Expressway on Thursday to assess the status of the project and suggest measures to ensure that work is expedited on this project, which has been in the works since 2008. A senior official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), meanwhile, said that work on phases 3 and 4 of the project, which are located in Gurugram, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that they would be completed by August 2021. “The work on these two phases is going on at a fast pace. The work on phases 1 and 2 in Delhi has started only recently and we are working hard to ensure that this project is completed by the end of 2022,” he said, adding that a delay in the transfer of a small plot near Kherki Daula remains the only stumbling block. Work on the Dwarka Expressway project, conceived by the Haryana government, was originally expected to be completed in 2014. However, due to delays in land acquisition and legal obstacles, the project was transferred by the state government to NHAI in 2016, which expanded the scope of this project and decided to create an access-controlled expressway with a toll plaza, at a cost of ₹7,000 crore. The 29-km expressway, with 10 kilometres in Delhi and the rest in the city, will connect Kherki Daula on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway with Shiv Murti near Mahipalpur. Gadkari’s visit comes on the heels of a meeting with Gurgaon member of Parliament Rao Inderjit Singh about the slow pace of the project and a review of other NHAI road works in Gurugram.Singh said on Tuesday, “The visit of the transport minister will start from Kherki Daula toll plaza on Thursday. He will inspect the entire highway under construction in four phases and interact with officials and the project contractors.”According to Singh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed concern about the delay in completing Dwarka Expressway during a Pragati meeting chaired by him on December 30, 2020. “The pace of work has slowed due to technical reasons, particularly on the Delhi side. The visit by transport minister will help in resolving the issues as decisions on these are taken at the highest level and issues resolved with his intervention on the spot,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gadkari-to-take-stock-of-dwarka-expressway-progress-101614708090004.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Pedestrian refuge island to come up at Sector 70/75 intersection||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will develop a pedestrian refuge island at the Sector 70/75 intersection, a key crossing on the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) that connects motorists to Sohna Road and National Highway 48, officials said on Tuesday.“Acknowledging the importance of the Sector 70/75 intersection, especially as development in new sector areas increases, we are redesigning the entire junction for catering to future needs. We expect this crossing to have a large volume of pedestrians and cyclists and have, accordingly, made adequate travel arrangements for each of them (modes). Keeping this in mind, a pedestrian refuge island is being constructed here on priority,” said Jitender Mittal, chief engineer, GMDA.The city’s first pedestrian refuge island was constructed last week at the Sector 44 intersection, near Huda City Centre. A pedestrian refuge island is a wide and elevated median that allows pedestrians and cyclists to safely wait on the structures and continue to navigate intersections according to the signal changes.GMDA officials said they have shortlisted the intersection as the city’s second spot for a pedestrian refuge island as they are also developing a cycle track and footpath at the crossing, and that the three features together will now be constructed mandatorily at all intersections in Gurugram.Mittal said that the three features will, together, be classified as a model intersection, where the allocation for all road users has been provided equally.GMDA officials said they expect the redesign to be completed by April.Mittal said that the GMDA has selected Ambedkar Chowk as the next location for constructing a pedestrian island, after the Sector 70/75 crossing.“The pedestrian refuge island, along with other features such as footpaths and cycle tracks, will not only make the Sector 70/75 intersection safer, but also provide a traffic management solution. The GMDA is redesigning the intersection, keeping both these aspects in mind. Without pedestrian or cyclist amenities, there will be continuous snarls at the crossing as people will use the main carriageway to reach the other side by coming in the path of moving vehicles,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, road safety expert, Nagarro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pedestrian-refuge-island-to-come-up-at-sector-70-75-intersection-101614708088794.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Loud music from ahatas leave residents sleepless||Residents of societies located close to liquor vends and ahatas in sectors 56, 57, 61, 62, South City 1 and 2, Golf Course Extension Road and Palam Vihar have complained of loud music being played at these establishments during late hours and accused the police of inaction. Ahatas, authorised open spaces for liquor consumption near vends, were allowed to open last month after being shut last year due to Covid-19 restrictions. Digvijay Jain, a resident of Pioneer Araya in Sector 62, said that numerous calls to police control room number —100 — gives temporary relief, but the problem resumes after a day. “We have been writing to the authorities to look into the issue but no one is paying heed to our serious problem. Children need to study as exams are ongoing and people have late-night work shifts. We are finding it difficult to handle the situation and have been suffering for the past two months,” he said. The police assured of strict action against those violating norms and disturbing residents.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “We will write to the excise department to take action against these offenders and will book anyone found operating these establishments beyond midnight,” he said. The ahatas, 72 in number, are allowed to operate till midnight and are allowed to play music at45 decibels till 10pm during the night, as per the high court ruling in 2019. Even if pubs and restaurants have special licence to serve liquor till 3am, they cannot violate the sound level norms, said police.Suneel Rao, owner of an ahata, said that their customers insist on music, failing which people stop patronising their establishments. “People come to enjoy and dance. We have suffered huge losses due to Covid-19 and we are trying to revive (our business), but if issues like this start emerging, we will have to shut down. People will stop visiting if there is no music,” he said.Police commissioner Rao said that a team has been formed to keep a check on ahatas in Sushant Lok-1, South City 1 and 2, sector 56, 57, Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, sectors 40, 31 and Palam Vihar. He said a weekly review will be done to analyse the violations by these establishments. Residents of Pioneer Park, Pioneer Presidia and Pioneer Araya on Golf Course Extension Road said they are the worst affected, as the ahatas in their vicinity have installed outdoor sound amplifiers and blare out loud music during the night, in violation of the high court order passed in 2019 for not using loudspeakers and loud music. Bhawna Chauhan, vice-president of the Pioneer Park residents’ welfare association in Sector 61, said, “We have tried reaching out to the ahata owners and they promised to reduce the volume, but it was temporary. We have approached the police and have suggested a measure to the police. If the owner can cover the open area located in the rear portion, which is adjacent to the societies, the issue can be resolved,” she said. Residents have also taken to social media platforms to create pressure on authorities. Vishal Gupta, a resident of South City-1 that is located near Sector 29, a hub for pubs and bars, said that residents have been facing this problem for the last four years and that the police have failed to resolve the issue. “The hotels play loud music on their rooftop restaurants and two ahatas have no time restrictions. They are operational till 3am, causing sleepless nights for residents,” he said, adding that calls to the police control room only resolved the issue temporarily. Shruti Gilhotra, an office bearer of the Pioneer Araya RWA, said that residents of the society have been facing the issue for the last few months. “This noise pollution commences around 7.30pm and goes on till past midnight on most days of the week, causing severe disturbance to residents. Ever since we shifted to this society, our kids have been suffering due to this late-night loud music. This severely impacts their health and disturbed sleep makes them unable to focus on studies. This issue is causing us a lot of stress, both physical and mental,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/loud-music-from-ahatas-leave-residents-sleepless-101614708088255.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Contact us for issues related to stray dogs: MCG||A day after a family allegedly prevented from entering their condominium by other residents of the society in Sector 83 over disagreements in feeding stray dogs, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) officials on Tuesday said that residents and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) may approach them for assistance on matters related to stray dogs.MCG joint commissioner Hariom Attri said that residents or RWAs can call their helpline, 18001801817, for assistance on matters pertaining to strays. “If a stray dog is suspected to be ill or found attacking residents in an area, people can reach out to us at our helpline number. Subsequently, officials from our concessionaire would be sent to the spot to attend to the animal. They will sterilise and vaccinate it and keep it at their treatment centres for examination and release them back in their natural habitat after two days,” said Attri.MCG officials said that as per a November 2015 Supreme Court (SC) order, any animal taken for sterilisation or vaccination has to be returned to their original habitats, i.e., the same location they were taken from and cannot be relocated to a new place.“All animal birth control matters come under the purview of the SC. The orders clearly state that no matter how much the situation of stray dog-related issues get out of control, only a scientific approach can be used for dealing with the matter. No authority can use innovative or subterfuge methods to deal with the matter,” said Chetna Devendra Joshi, Animal Welfare Board of India representative for Gurugram and member, People for Animals (PFA).The MCG has currently engaged two NGOs for dealing with such matters. In January, the MCG had terminated the contract with a Jhajjar-based concessionaire for sterilising stray dogs over allegations of animal cruelty, non-performance and misbehaviour with residents.Attri said that the concessionaire has received a stay on the termination order from the Punjab and Haryana high court and the MCG has been barred from floating tenders to hire a new contractor on a full-time basis until the case is settled. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 12.“In the interim, we have come to an agreement with two NGOs for vaccinating and sterilising stray dogs. They treat dogs at their respective centres in Basai and Farrukhnagar, and receive around ₹600 per dog from the MCG,” said Attri.Attri also said that the MCG is planning to set up Haryana’s first dog birth control centre at Begumpur Khatola, which will have an operation theatre, vaccination area, separate dog sheds and a ground for dogs to play. He said that an estimate for the project is being prepared at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/contact-us-for-issues-related-to-stray-dogs-mcg-101614708028816.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Family of three held hostage in car for feeding stray dogs||Residents of Vatika G21 Apartments in Sector 83 on Monday evening disallowed a family of three that stays there from entering the complex for feeding stray dogs in the area, said police, adding that a case has been registered against unidentified persons under sections of molestation and rioting, based a complaint from the family.While residents of the condominium alleged that stray dogs had attacked over 20 people over the last three months, the police said that the family, of a couple and their three-year-old daughter, was held hostage in their car for nearly five hours. The family recorded a video of the incident and posted it on social media platforms, where it was widely shared. The woman’s husband said he had also started a live session from inside the car to seek police intervention and show their plight. Members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA) said that they had asked the family not to feed the strays, but despite repeated requests, they did not pay heed. “Stray dogs are attacking residents. Even a day before (the incident), one of the residents was bitten,” an RWA member said, requesting anonymity. Praveen Kumar, another resident of the society, said that he had also filed a police complaint against the couple. “The couple lives in another block and I had already warned them several times not to do any activity outside my apartment. If they want to feed the stray dogs, why should they target another block?” he said. Incidents pertaining to stray dogs continue to create friction among residents of societies. A man was arrested in 2019 for allegedly hiring people to beat stray dogs, after several residents complained that the dogs were missing from the area.The woman from the family of three that was denied entry said that they were intercepted by a mob of residents and prevented from getting to their residence. “They started getting violent and abusive, and women attacked us with an intention to cause physical harm and to kill my husband and daughter. A dog I was feeding and I tried to break through. When we tried to escape, they deflated our car tyres. Some of them tried to snatch my daughter also. All the men and women held us hostage and in captivity in our car while they continued to push our car, bang on the windows and doors, attempting to break in and kill us,” the woman, the complainant in the case, said. The family alleged that the police failed to ensure their safety, sided with the mob and asked them to seek their forgiveness. The complainant said they sought help from the assistant commissioner of police following which a woman constable arranged for a water bottle for the child. “The police kept pressing us to step out, but I did not allow my husband to do that fearing for his and the rest of our lives,” she said. She also alleged that someone in the crowd threatened to rape her and murder her family to ensure that they stopped feeding the dogs.“Around 11pm, the police were finally able to escort us home. The situation was so bad that police staff had to form a cordon around us while the crowd chanted and jeered,” she said. A case under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (wrongful restraint), 354 (molestation) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Kherki Daula police station on Tuesday. Police officials refuted the family’s allegations and had called the ACP due to the severity of the situation. Krishan Kant, station house officer of Kherki Daula police station, said that they had tried to resolve the issue on Monday night and had dropped the family at their apartment. “We registered a case on Tuesday after we received a complaint,” he said. Chetna Devendra Joshi, associate campaign manager, People For Animals, public policy foundation, and a representative of Animal Welfare Board of India in Gurugram, said that the conflict over street dogs is covered in entirety by the various orders of the Supreme Court of India vide SLP (C) 691/2009 and central acts such as PCA Act 1960. She said that Animal Birth Control Rules, 2001, promulgated under Section 38 of PCA Act, 1960, crystallises that the street dogs cannot be relocated, except for sterilisation. “A lot of these incidents where societies and residents resort to acts of mobocracy against compassionate citizens — who take to looking after the street dogs around their residence, help with the implementation of animal birth control and also for rabies control via the yearly anti-rabies vaccine drives — stem largely out of intolerance and unawareness about the laws in place concerning the subject matter,” she said. Dr Vivek Yadav, a veterinary surgeon from Badshahpur, said that dogs tend to aggressive behaviour and bite when they perceive a threat. “If the dog bites, first take medical aid and try to get in touch with the animal welfare body or the authorities so that they can check the reason for the attack and to ensure that the incident is not repeated in the future. The best practice is to avoid their territory if one is not pet friendly and one should not suddenly approach a stray,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/family-of-three-held-hostage-in-car-for-feeding-stray-dogs-101614708028186.html
02-03-2021||Pune||Tunnel testing of challenging stretch from Swargate to Civil court complete, TBM machine to begin work||The most challenging underground tunnel work from the heart of the city areas which are congested and packed with old structures-is set to start soon. The testing of the underground tunnel work has almost been completed from Swargate as well as on the side of the Civil court. In an effort to avoid any calamity in the old city area, Pune Metro has completed building condition survey and clicked photographs of more than 1,000 structures including old wadas and buildings in this stretch. Currently, there are two tunnel boring machines (TBM) that are presently working at Agriculture college ground, while two more machines will start digging the tunnel from Swargate. There are four tunnel boring machines used to dig the 10-km underground tunnel from Agriculture college depot to Swargate underground station. The maximum tunnel depth is 30 metres which will be at the civil court station. It will take around 10 days to start the actual tunnel boring machine work. According to Pune Metro officials, there was a challenge to make the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) towards Mandai from Swargate area. It is a sequential excavation method or sprayed concrete lining method and the TBM setup is challenging due to the congestion and insufficient space at the site. This is when the NATM is preferred for tunnelling. Three months to reach Mandai Atul Gadgil, director, Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MahaMetro) said, “There was a challenge to construct 150 metres of NATM work. After that, it was possible to start the TBM work. It was completed and was fully manual work. Now, we can start TBM work soon, It is mechanical and it is not challenging as compared to NATM.” “The TBM work will start from both sides, Civil court and Swargate and it will meet at Mandai. From the Swargate site, it will take around three months to reach Mandai,” he added. He further said, “We have completed our scientific study. There is nothing to worry about old structures or wadas on the ground of this underground stretch. We have an influence zone of 50 metres on either side of the tunnel. More than 1,000 structures fall in the influence zone.” Metro photographs over 1,000 structures Hemant Sonawane, general manager, public relations, Pune metro said, “We have conducted a building condition survey of Swargate to Civil court stretch. We have clicked pictures of the current condition of structures that are falling within the influence zone. It has been submitted to the concern building owners to keep a record of the structure before and after work.” “It is a working procedure of underground work to check any damage or cracks after or during work. There is a possibility that people may register complaints of crack or damages of structure to Metro and claim compensation. At that time, we should have some record to verify the claim of people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/tunnel-testing-of-challenging-stretch-from-swargate-to-civil-court-complete-tbm-machine-to-begin-work-101614705208016.html

Until patients are admitted to these facilities, the district administration has devised a plan to use the infrastructure for inoculation. According to Saurabh Rao, Pune divisional commissioner, the Jumbo Covid facilities will be ready with basic preparations in a week, and as per requirement the capacity of these facilities will be increased. Following a steering committee meeting held on Tuesday, Saurabh Rao said that the Jumbo hospitals in PMC and PCMC will be made ready with oxygen beds. “Considering the present Covid situation it is essential to keep Jumbo facilities ready for the next three months as part of health infrastructure preparedness,” said Rao.Pune district had two Jumbo Covid facilities, one at the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) and another at Annasaheb Magar Stadium in Bhosari. The COEP facility was made operational during the last week of August with a capacity of 800 beds. The Annasaheb Magar facility was operational in September with an 800-bed capacity. As the Covid tally came down drastically by December, the administration decided to shut down both facilities and distribute the health equipment such as beds, ventilators, and oxygen cylinders, to other government-run medical facilities. In next three days a structural and electrical audit of both the Jumbo facilities in PMC and PCMC will be done by the College of Engineering, Pune. Rao said that once the audit is completed, basic preparations will be carried out within a week. Corporations will float tenders for new operators. After reopening, the Jumbo hospitals will only have oxygen beds and patients needing ICUs will be transferred to Sassoon hospital. “We have decided that we will not keep a high dependency unit (HDU) at a Jumbo facility. We only use oxygenated beds in the facility and a new operator will be appointed for this. We are tying up a Jumbo facility with Sassoon. Sassoon hospital’s dean has agreed to admit the ICU patients on priority. Of course we will have to increase the infrastructure and human resources at Sassoon. In Friday’s meeting we will put this before the guardian minister and take further decisions as per his instructions,” said Rao. The district administration has decided to use the jumbo facilities as a vaccination centre until patients are admitted. “We have made detailed plans for the actual preparations at the vaccination centre when people come to get the vaccines. There is ample space there and people can sit properly. So as per need we are gradually increasing the infrastructure,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jumbo-covid-care-centres-prepped-to-reopen-if-case-spike-continues-rao-101614704188084.html

02-03-2021||Delhi||IndiGo flight to Lucknow makes emergency landing at Karachi airport as flyer takes ill||An IndiGo flight from UAE’s Sharjah to Lucknow had to make an emergency landing at the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan, early Tuesday due to a medical emergency on-board the aircraft. A 67-year-old flyer, whose health had deteriorated during the flight, was de-boarded in Karachi and was pronounced dead by a medical team at the airport. The landing was made on humanitarian grounds, airline officials said, despite flight operations remaining suspended between the two countries.Flight operations between India and Pakistan were suspended since February 2019 in the wake of the Balakot air strike by Indian forces. It was only in July 2019 that Pakistan had reopened its airspace for international air traffic after around five months of restrictions, though flights between the two countries are suspended.However, as per the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) convention, any aircraft can land in any country in life-threatening situations, such as a medical emergency or serious technical faults. The passenger who died on board the Sharjah-Lucknow flight was identified as Habib ur Rehman, an Indian citizen. According to the officials aware of the development, the flight 6E 1412, an Airbus 320 aircraft with a seating capacity of 182 passengers, departed from Sharjah International Airport at 1.59am on Tuesday for Lucknow. The flight had two pilots and four crew members on board.“But after two hours of remaining air-bound, around 4am, when the aircraft had just entered the Pakistani air space via Iran, one of the passengers started feeling unwell. The crew then alerted the captain who decided to land under medical emergency and contacted the nearest air traffic control (ATC), which was the Karachi airport. Permission was sought on humanitarian grounds to land the aircraft,” said an official, who wished not to be named.ATC Karachi provided 6E 1412 a clear route to land and the flight touched down at Jinnah International Airport at 4.59am.“The passenger was taken out of the aircraft and was attended to by a team of medical experts from the Karachi airport, who pronounced him dead. The man’s family members and authorities in India were informed of his demise,” the official said.After due formalities, the aircraft took off at 8.18am, but it was made to land in Ahmedabad at 10.02am, due to the Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL). A second official said the crew on board had completed their flying time limit and had to stand down. Hence, the aircraft had to be landed in Ahmedabad and the crew changed. The flight finally left Ahmedabad at 12.08pm and landed in Lucknow at 1.47pm. The usual four-hour flight from Sharjah to Lucknow took close to 12 hours,” the second officer said, requesting anonymity.IndiGo on Tuesday said, “We are deeply saddened with the news and our prayers and wishes are with his family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/indigo-flight-to-lucknow-makes-emergency-landing-at-karachi-airport-as-flyer-takes-ill-101614698487696.html

As Tuesday was Angarkhi Chaturthi, the temple administraion decided to close the temple against the backdrop of the increasing number of Covid cases in the city. Still, thousands of faithful were present seeking blessings of the temple’s Ganesh statue, from the roadside. Public transport buses and other vehicles were diverted by the Pune traffic police, as there was huge crowd present throughout the day. “We were fully prepared and extra bandobast was given to clear the expected crowd. Though the temple was closed for darshan, devotees were coming right from early morning and till late at night. Accordingly, our police bandobast was deployed outside the temple area and on road to clear the rush and monitor the traffic. Public transport buses were diverted to another route,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Vijay Chaudhary. The traffic jams began from the Shaniwarwada chowk till the Dagadusheth temple. Vehicles were moving slowly on the Shivaji road throughout the day, if at all. Mahesh Suryavanshi, treasurer, Dagdusheth Ganpati Mandal trust, said, “We have taken all the necessary safety precautions at the temple and today it was closed for public darshan. Online darshan was going throughout the day on our mobile application and website for devotees across the world. Still we need to respect the faith of people who came to take darshan from outside, and good traffic management was done by Pune traffic poilce.” Sagar Abnawe, a Ganpati devotee said, “On every Chaturthi day I come to Dagadusheth Ganpati temple to take darshan and today, being one of the most important Chaturthi’s in the year, I had to come here. I was bit disappointed when I got to know that temple was closed, but then I took the darshan from outside and it took me an hour to walk to the temple and take darshan as a massive crowd was there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dagaduseth-halwai-temple-closed-thousands-of-devotees-on-road-cause-mega-traffic-jam-101614697947808.html

Along with the regular Covid-19 safety precautionary measures, traders and shop owners in Tulshibaug have decided to make the Covid norms stricter and safer for customers and themselves.“The number of Covid cases is on the rise in the city. Since the market started we have been taking all the necessary safety precautions like sanitisation of shops, using hand sanitiser, social distancing and face masks.

02-03-2021||Delhi||Results of keenly contested Delhi MCD by-poll tomorrow||Results for the by-polls in five wards of Delhi’s civic body, two of which fall under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and three under East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), will be announced on Wednesday. Polling was held in five wards on Sunday - Ward No 32N, (Rohini-C); Ward No 62N, (Shalimar Bagh North) in north Delhi and Ward No 02-E (Trilokpuri); Ward No 08-E (Kalyanpuri) and Ward No 41-E (Chauhan Bangar) in east Delhi.Around 50.86% voters turned out to vote in the MCD by-polls with the highest voting percentage recorded in Kalyanpuri and the lowest in Shalimar Bagh North. The elections are being seen as a test for Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, as they are a precursor to the 2022 Delhi civic body polls.In the 2017 MCD elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won four of these five wards but all the three civic bodies were retained by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the city. The BJP has ruled all three MCDs in Delhi for nearly 15 years now. The Congress was pushed to a distant third in the 2017 MCD elections.The AAP, which has fielded two former MLAs in these by-polls, saw its party chief campaign for all the five candidates, as did other cabinet ministers, including deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. The AAP’s Delhi unit convener Gopal Rai called the by-polls a “semi-final” to end the BJP’s 15-year control of the civic bodies.“The BJP spread politics of hate during the Delhi assembly elections, but people again voted for an AAP government under chief minister Kejriwal. The AAP will defeat BJP in the MCD by-election just the way it did in the assembly elections,” Rai said.The BJP also held many roadshows and meetings at the booth level and tasked each party worker with getting support from at least 21 houses, as part of their campaign. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said his party will win all five wards, claiming that the people of Delhi believe in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of “sabka saath, sabka vikas aur sabka vishwas”.Congress in its poll campaign accused both the BJP and the AAP of not doing anything other than “bickering”. Shaktisinh Gohil, Delhi Congress in-charge, said people are tired of the misrule and shadow boxing of the BJP and the AAP governments. “Governments of both the parties at the Centre and in Delhi have been self-obsessed without doing any work. In the past few years, they only made charges and counter-charges against each other, about fund misuse, stalled developments and corruption,” said Gohil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/results-of-keenly-contested-delhi-mcd-by-poll-tomorrow-101614692209910.html

The new rates have come into effect from Tuesday morning. In Delhi, the price of CNG has now gone up to ₹43.40 per kg. At the same time, CNG will be available at the rate of 49.08 per kg in Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad.The increase in the CNG and PNG prices in Delhi-NCR has put the auto and taxi drivers in trouble due to a continuous hike in the prices. They say their survival is getting tougher amidst such inflation.Noida-based auto driver Manoj Ojha, speaking to ANI, said, "Prices of everything are going up. Whether it is petrol, diesel, LPG, or PNG. The price of CNG has been increasing continuously since the COVID-19 lockdown. It is getting very difficult for us to survive."Atul Kumar, another auto driver from Noida, said there is no work, people are paying less fare too. The problem of unemployment is worsening. The way prices are increasing, it is becoming very difficult for us to bear the cost of a CNG auto."Increasing the rate of CNG will cause several difficulties for us. It is getting tougher for us to bear the auto's expenses. Where the CNG tank used to get filled in ₹100 is now taking ₹120. Also, because of the farmers who are sitting on the border right now, we have to cover several kilometres for a ₹10 ride," said Sameer, a Ghazipur auto driver.A Delhi-based cab driver Atul Kumar, who drives his cab in Delhi-NCR, said, "The expenses have exceeded the earnings. Only we know how we are managing. The inflation is increasing. What can we do?"Meanwhile, Youth Congress workers staged a protest outside the petroleum ministry over rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas.Hundreds of Indian Youth Congress activists assembled outside the petroleum ministry office with placards in their hands and raised slogans against the central government. The police, meanwhile, arrested a few of the protesters to control the situation.The prices of petrol and diesel have increased sharply over the past few days, with that of petrol touching the 100-rupee mark in some of the cities. Opposition parties have held protests in different parts of the country over the rising prices of fuel. On February 25, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that she will not be able to answer when the prices of petrol and diesel will be reduced.However, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Dharmendra Pradhan has said that price of fuel will decrease once the winter season ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-cng-prices-rise-in-delhi-ncr-auto-drivers-bear-brunt-101614691110977.html

02-03-2021||Bhopal||MP CM says Budget will make state 'aatmanirbhar', Kamal Nath hits back||Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday described the state's budget for 2021-22 as one aiming at making Madhya Pradesh "Atmanirbhar".Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Kamal Nath, on the other hand, said it provided no relief from high fuel prices, nor did it make any concrete provisions for industry reeling under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Finance Minister Jagdish Devda presented a budget of ₹2.41 lakh crore for 2021-22 in the Assembly with no additional tax burden earlier in the day.Before finalizing the budget document, the government had invited suggestions from experts by organizing a webinar "to prepare a roadmap for making the state Atmanirbhar (self- reliant)," Chouhan told reporters."It is based on four pillars -- development of physical infrastructure, health and education, economy and employment and good governance," he said.These four "missions" will be implemented on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to make the country self-reliant, he said.For infrastructure the budget has made a provision of ₹44,152 crore, ₹40,958 crore has been allocated for providing quality education at government schools and nine new government medical colleges will also be set up, he said."The nal-jal (tap water) scheme (for which funds have been allocated) is historic and will be a major boon for women," the chief minister said.Chouhan also noted that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, GDP of the state fell by only 2.12 per cent, much less than the expected 7-8 per cent decrease."We have managed to restrict it (the fall) and compared to last year, we have enhanced budgetary provisions by 22 per cent," he said.Amid the pandemic, his government provided adequate assistance to farmers and those schemes will continue, the chief minister said.State Congress chief Kamal Nath termed the budget as "a bundle of lies". It was directionless and did not provide any relief from the skyrocketing fuel prices by reducing VAT and did not extend the agriculture loan waiver scheme, he said."No relaxation has been given in the registration fee and there is no solid action-plan for generating employment," Nath said.There were no concrete provisions for health and education sectors, not was there any budgetary provision for measures to curb crime against women, he claimed.There was nothing for reviving the economy by providing relief to the industries and businesses, the Congress leader claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-cm-says-budget-will-make-state-aatmanirbhar-kamal-nath-hits-back-101614688416525.html
02-03-2021||Noida||Covid-19: Ghaziabad achieves 100% target on soft launch of vaccination for senior citizens||Ghaziabad: During the soft launch of the vaccination drive against Covid-19 for the third category of beneficiaries on Monday, the Ghaziabad district achieved 100% of its target. District health department officials said that over 60% beneficiaries were walk-ins while the rest had registered themselves earlier on the Co-WIN website.Officials said that of the overall target of 300, 135 were administered their first shot at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, while 78 and 87 beneficiaries were vaccinated at the District Women’s Hospital (DWH) and Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi, respectively.“Overall, the three hospitals combined vaccinated a total of 300 beneficiaries and nearly 60-62% of these were walk-ins. Some beneficiaries said they were not comfortable using the portal, which is why they simply came by and got themselves registered at the session centre itself,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.He said that all three hospitals had been given a target of 100 beneficiaries each. The DWH and Yashoda hospitals were given doses of Covishield while the Sanjay Nagar District Hospital was given stock of Covaxin, as per government directions, he added.While Yashoda Hospital offered the vaccine at a payment of ₹250, the two government hospitals provided the jab free-of-cost, as per government directions.“We will have a video-conference with state health officials on Tuesday when further course of action for the category three of vaccination will be decided on a large scale,” Dr Gupta added. The beneficiaries under category three consist of citizens who are aged or will attain the age of 60 years or more as on January 1, 2022. The other group consists of citizens who are aged or will attain the age of 45 to 59 years as on January 1, 2022 and have any specific co-morbidities. “I chose to walk-in and took the vaccine. I faced no issues after. During the earlier phases of vaccination held for healthcare workers, I had sent all details but my name did not figure in the list. So I waited and walked-in at Sanjay Nagar Hospital on Monday as a beneficiary under category 3,” said Dr Satya Prakash, a resident of Kavi Nagar, aged 92 years.He said his wife, aged 90 years, passed away due to Covid-19 on November 25 last year.“We vaccinated 87 beneficiaries and there was an issue with the self-registration module on the portal when entries were held up for about an hour. Of those who came, about 50 had registered themselves prior to coming. To reduce wastage, we ensured that a vial of vaccine will be opened only when 10 beneficiaries are present at a site. So, we had no wastage Monday,” said a spokesperson from the Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi. Dr Sangita Goel, the chief medical superintendent of DWH, said all recipients were walk-ins. “They came and completed the on-spot registration. About 50 beneficiaries at our hospital were senior citizens,” she added. Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the government hospital at Sanjay Nagar said that the hospital surpassed the target of 100 beneficiaries. “We had an additional stock of vaccines (150 doses) so we vaccinated people who walked-in instead of asking them to return. The response was encouraging and only 10-11 beneficiaries were those who had pre-registered while the rest had walked-in. We used the Covaxin vaccine,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday took his first vaccine dose at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. He shared his picture on social media.Senior citizens like Dr OP Agarwal, aged 76, who came with his wife as a walk-in entry, said they were motivated by the PM.“It was very encouraging and I along with my wife came even though we had not done pre-registration. People should not worry and must come forward to get vaccinated,” he added. Regarding the Cowin 2.0 app, the ministry of health and family welfare on Monday had clarified that, “Registration and booking for appointment for Covid-19 vaccination is to be done through the CoWIN portal: http://cowin.gov.in. There is no Co-WIN app for beneficiary registration. The App on Play Store is for administrators only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-ghaziabad-achieves-100-target-on-soft-launch-of-vaccination-for-senior-citizens-101614688287265.html
02-03-2021||Other||Plague, H1N1 & Covid-19: 103-year-old Naidu Hospital is Pune’s first line of defence in battle against contagious diseases||When the bubonic plague was wreaking havoc in Mumbai in the late 19th century, neighbouring Pune also suffered. Years, later, the British realised the need for a medical facility dedicated to combat contagious diseases, and in 1918, built a smaller ward, known today as the Dr Naidu Hospital.The Naidu hospital has been at the forefront, in terms of treatment, in Pune’s war against Covid-19.Even as the city has seen multiple super-specialty hospitals come up over the years, the Naidu hospital is first in line, and has been used as the primary healthcare centre to treat infectious diseases, from plague a century ago to H1N1 (Swine flu) and now Covid-19. When Covid cases first surfaced in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) chose to admit most patients to the Naidu hospital, where the staff is used to dealing with epidemics. So much so, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke on the phone to Chhaya Jagtap, a nurse at the hospital and applauded the role the hospital and its staff played during the early days of pandemic last year. “Like you, there are lakhs of nurses, paramedical staff, doctors, who like true “tapasvis”, are serving patients in various hospitals in the country right now. I would like to congratulate you. I am happy to have heard your experiences,” PM Modi had said then, during the conversation with Jagtap. It was in 1918, that the British regime built the two wards at the Raja Bahadur mill road near Sangamwadi. The location chosen for the wards was deliberately kept outside the city, to keep patients suffering from contagious disease in isolation. As Pune grew over the years, the hospital is now in the heart of city, in a manner of speaking. Started as an epidemic hospital to address the plague, the facility was later renamed after Dr Naidu, about who the civic body does not have any concrete information. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer, PMC and in charge of the infectious disease cell, said, “We don’t have an idea about Dr Naidu and his background, but it is said that he played an important role in fighting the plague in the British era. Considering his contribution, his name was given to this hospital.” Dr Naidu, according to some, was said to be the head of the “Plague Prevention Committee” of the then Pune Sub-Municipal Council. Dr Subhash Konkane, 70, who is an honorary consultant for Naidu hospital said, “ Naidu hospital is the key hospital in the city. For any infectious disease, the first important thing is to get admission for patients and keep them in isolation. All airborne diseases are dangerous and spread fast. For that we need to keep them in isolation. Naidu’s location is important.” Konkane has been working with Naidu hospital since 1980 and regularly used to visit the hospital till the age of 65. “We saw very critical epidemics. Not a single hospital gives admission to patients when there is outbreak of infectious disease. Though my age is 70 years, considering shortage of medical manpower, I treated Covid -19 patients in Naidu hospital for almost four months,” said Kokane. The hospital played an important role during the 2010 swine flu outbreak too. All the first cases in all epidemics are admitted to Naidu hospital. In every such epidemic, Naidu’s hospital’s service has been appreciated by citizens. Sanjay Pardeshi who used to wash clothes at Naidu hospital said, “Traditionally our three generations are associated with this hospital. My grandfather, father and now our generation are carrying out laundry work in this hospital. Earlier, there was only a ground floor and a few quarters. We have played games on the premises from childhood. As we saw the various epidemics from childhood, we did not have any fear about it. This hospital is like a family member for us.” While it had only two wards initially, Dr Naidu hospital’s capacity gradually increased with every pandemic. Earlier, there were barracks on the ground floor. The bed capacity was 50 patients, but during every epidemic, the bed capacity increased. Later, PMC converted this hospital into a multi-storey building in 2014. There are various departments in Naidu hospital Shripad Deshpande who is 69-years-old and worked as part of the nursing staff in the hospital said, “I worked with the Naidu hospital for 11 years as a nursing assistant. We treated many patients. At that time there were no gloves or masks. I really enjoyed the service at Naidu hospital. It’s the need of the hour to have such hospitals in the city. It is true that we don’t know much history, but it was established by Britishers for the treatment of plague patients.” In 2020, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) decided to build a medical college to be named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the premises of the Naidu hospital. “It is good that we are erecting a medical college, but while doing it, we must ensure that there will be infectious disease hospitals and wards on the premises,” said local corporator Arvind Shinde. In May 2020, the PMC staff stumbled upon 200 new beds lying unused inside a godown at the hospital. The beds are now being used by the hospital. “I spent my whole childhood in Pune station and the Naidu hospital area. We have seen that snake bite, dog bite and AIDS patients visit this hospital. Sometimes there were no vacancies and patients used to take treatment under the tree in this hospital. Even the government-run Sassoon Hospital used to refer their patients to this hospital,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plague-h1n1-covid-19-103-year-old-naidu-hospital-is-pune-s-first-line-of-defence-in-battle-against-contagious-diseases-101614686547143.html

Twelve people have been identified and they will be probed, not Sachin Tendulkar or Lata Mangeshkar.”Fadnavis had said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) wanted to investigate people speaking in the interests of the nation. “The MVA government wants to investigate and question people who tweeted in national interest,” Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Deshmukh on February 8 ordered a probe to check if Indian celebrities were forced to tweet by the BJP to counter the tweets posted by international celebrities who tweeted criticising the government’s handling of the farm laws.Several Indian celebrities mostly from India’s film industry as well as the cricket industry had tweeted using the hashtags #IndiaAgainstPropaganda and #IndiaTogether on February 3 and expressed their support towards the government. This came after pop star and singer Rihanna and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg had extended their support to the farmers who have been protesting for the last 96 days at Delhi’s borders.Maharashtra Congress had then alleged that the tweets must have been shared due to pressure from the Centre. “There is a similar pattern in these tweets by celebrities, including Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty, and sportspersons Sachin Tendulkar and Saina Nehwal. There needs to be an investigation to check if these national heroes were pressured by the BJP for such advocacy on social media,” Maharashtra Congress leader Sachin Sawant had said.Sawant had also said that these celebrities need to be given more protection and suspected that there was communication between these celebrities and the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/probe-not-against-tendulkar-or-lata-mangeshkar-but-against-bjp-it-cell-deshmukh-101614684031270.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Ghazipur border opened briefly, shut again||Vehicular movement to Ghaziabad from Delhi through the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border was partially restored for nearly six hours till Tuesday noon, providing some relief to commuters who have been facing traffic snarls due to the closure of the border, where farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have been protesting against the three farm laws for over three months.However, the route was closed again noon onwards and traffic was diverted to the other border points. Senior police officers who did not want to be named said that no official order had been issued to open the border. They said it was a temporary arrangement to facilitate movement of emergency vehicles.“We had been facilitating the movement of ambulances earlier as well. The movement of vehicles was restored for a few hours in the morning as some emergency vehicles were stuck in the jam. The route has been closed again because there is no official order to open the border or the roads,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Delhi’s Ghazipur border partially reopensAll the six carriageways of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-9 and NH-24 have been completely blocked with multi-layered barricading and deployment of police personnel following the violence that erupted during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 (Republic Day). Movement of vehicles via the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border has remained affected since November 25-26, when thousands of farmers who arrived from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand occupied the roads after they were stopped from entering Delhi.On Tuesday, one carriageway of NH-9 was opened around 6am for traffic going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi, even as the Delhi Police said that the barricades had been removed post midnight; movement of vehicles on the road was allowed from around 6am.Around noon, the carriageway was again barricaded at the entry of the Ghazipur flyover near the Ghazipur flower market. Police personnel were also deployed to regulate the traffic and guide motorists towards alternative routes for travelling towards Ghaziabad. The sudden closure led to confusion and chaos among motorists and many of them tried to argue with the police personnel about the closure.“Many vehicles passed before the police closed the road again. When we asked why they opened it in the morning and closed it again, the policemen said they received orders from their higher-ups. People are facing traffic jams and inconvenience because of the blockade, but nobody is bothered about it,” said Sanjeev Kumar, a resident of Kaushambi, who was returning home after dropping his friend at Sarai Kale Khan bus terminal.The Ghazipur border is among the three main borders where farmers have been protesting against the three contentious farm laws for the past 97 days. Initially, only the carriageways going towards Delhi from Ghaziabad were closed because of the farmers’ sit-in protest. But after the January 26 violence, all the carriageways have been closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-ghazipur-border-opened-briefly-shut-again-101614683007784.html

02-03-2021||Lucknow||UP Assembly ruckus: Ruling and opposition benches trade charges||The Uttar Pradesh Assembly Tuesday witnessed a slanging match between the ruling and opposition benches over withdrawal of criminal cases by the BJP government in the state.Ruling party members alleged that cases against terrorists were withdrawn during the previous regime, while the opposition benches trashed the claim and said cases against "rioters" were withdrawn by the BJP government.Replying to a question by BSP member Shyam Sundar Sharma, Law Minister Brijesh Pathak said that from April, 2017 to July, 2020, as many as 670 cases were withdrawn by the government in 'janhit' (public interest) and "the cases pertain to political leaders and workers".He said that after the government formation, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced the decision to withdraw "political cases" to lessen the burden on judiciary.In his supplementary query during the Question House, the member asked about the political cases and sought a list of all people with their party affiliation whose cases were withdrawn.To this, the minister said that political cases are not defined but those with less serious charges were withdrawn."After an application is made for withdrawal of cases, a 13-point report is sought from the District Magistrate concerned and then Principal Secretaries of Home and Law departments go through it before final decision," he said, adding that as law doesn't permit discrimination on basis of parties, it would not be appropriate to take names."If Speaker permits, I can make the list of the persons whose cases were withdrawn public," the minister said.In his reply without taking name of the Samajwadi Party, the minister said that the previous government withdrew cases against terrorists who had charges under the Explosives Act and even POTA.His reaction led to a sharp attack from Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chowdhary who alleged that the government had taken back cases of their own men."Even Chief Minister has withdrawn his own criminal cases. The cases against rioters were withdrawn. Those who orchestrate riots are terrorists," Chowdhary said, alleging that the minister had not responded to the main question.The SP members also trooped into the well of the House raising slogans against the government.Pathak said while the first cabinet meeting of the Yogi Adityanath government decided on loan waiver of farmers, the first cabinet in 2012 had decided on withdrawal of cases against terrorists.Chowdhary taking exception to the comment said, "The minister should show the file in which terrorist word is mentioned."Replying to him, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said that on March 15, 2012 a circular was issued by the then chief secretary seeking details of such cases terming those lodged in jails as innocent.Law Minister Pathak said that he had the list of all the persons against whom cases were withdrawn and added that if the Speaker permits he could make it public.Speaker Hriday Narain Dixit, however, said that "there is not need of this." Pathak said that his government will continue to withdraw "political cases" in future also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-assembly-ruckus-ruling-and-opposition-benches-trade-charges-101614674673253.html

His brother, Jai Singh, said Yadav was framed for speaking up for the poor and questioning the working of the police and the District Bar Association. “He lodged a complaint against three magistrates including the madam, who lodged a complaint against him... He also sent a notice to the police superintendent of police... As my brother served the people free of cost and fought against injustice, the association debarred him.

This reduces our productivity. You all need to start doing self-analysis. You need to analyse --what you are giving to the party, how much contribution are you making to the party, at what level are you accepted in the party," he said."The formation of our booth committees should be completed by 25th September i.e. Deendayal Upadhyay ji's birth anniversary. There should not be any booth where our booth committee is not formed and every booth should have women, youth, Dalit brothers, people from backward caste in our committees," he added.Nadda asked the party officials to ensure BJP's victory in Rajasthan in the next Assembly polls."Ashok Gehlot government's priority is to not have a well-governed state. Seeing this, it is our responsibility, to say 'namaskar to this sarkar' and make sure that the lotus blooms here," he said.Commenting upon the goal of the party in 2021, Nadda said, "We have a good image in public, but we are a cadre-based party. Therefore, it is our responsibility to strengthen the cadre. Strong mandals, active booths and active panna pramkukhs, these are the three goals we have to complete in 2021."Lauding the Prime Minister's role in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, the BJP chief said, "Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the second phase of Covid-19 vaccination has begun. We have sent the Made-in-India vaccines to over 20 countries.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi by taking the Covid-19 vaccine yesterday has given a clear message that we must take the vaccination drive ahead," he added.Nadda also slammed Opposition parties over the protest against the three farm laws saying that farmers are our 'annadata' and "we need to bring them in the mainstream. But, many parties are exploiting the protest for their own gain."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-nadda-asks-bjp-officials-to-strengthen-cadre-do-selfanalysis-101614678913983.html

02-03-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka man found alive just before autopsy, is responding to treatment||A 27-year-old man declared brain dead after an accident in Karnataka was responding to treatment and his vitals were normal on Tuesday a day after he was rushed to another hospital when a doctor deputed to conduct his postmortem noticed goosebumps and movement of his hands when he touched him.A private hospital in Belagavi declared Shankar Gombi brain dead after keeping him under two-day observation and asked his family to take his body after he met with an accident in Mahalingapur on February 27. The body was sent to the Mahalingapur government hospital in Bagalkote on Monday for post-mortem as the family prepared for Gombi’s funeral on Monday.SS Galgali, the doctor assigned to perform the post-mortem, said as he was driving towards the hospital, there were cut-outs and banners across the town announcing Gombi’s death. “I knew the face on my surgery table, but I did not expect he would be alive,” Galgali said. Galgali found Gombi was still on a ventilator. Gombi’s family told Galgali that the doctors at the private hospital told them he will stop breathing once the ventilator support was removed.Also Read | Farmer arrested for shooting neighbour dead over common water stream“The family had been told that once the ventilator is removed, he will be officially dead. So, they had started preparing for the funeral also. His friends had posted the news of the death on social media and as I reached the hospital, at least 1,000 people had gathered there,” said Galgali. He added as he started the autopsy, he saw goosebumps on Gombi’s body when he touched it. “...[It] meant there were sensations in the body. I checked with a pulse oximeter and I checked his heartbeat. There was a pulse. Then I removed him from the ventilator and waited for a bit. To my surprise, he moved his hands. I immediately called the family and shifted him to another private hospital.”Galgali said he was told on Tuesday that Gombi was showing some improvement and his vitals are normal. “I am told there is a chance of his survival and he responding to treatment,” he said. “I have done more than 400 post-mortems in my 18-year-old career but never seen a case like that.”A Bagalkote police officer, who did not want to be named, said no case has been registered yet as they were yet to receive a complaint. “For the case of medical negligence, the district health department will have to take a call,” he said.Authorities at the private hospital, where Gombi was first admitted, were immediately unavailable for comments. The story will be updated as and when the hospital responds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/man-found-alive-before-his-autopsy-in-karnataka-responding-to-treatment-101614677907535.html

02-03-2021||Delhi||Focus on vertical growth, Delhi needs to protect modern heritage buildings||What do the Ashok Hotel, Vikas Minar, one of the tallest buildings in Delhi, Dak Tar Bhawan, and Akbar Bhawan have in common? These are some of the buildings that dominated the Capital’s skyline in the mid-50s and 60s and represented the evolution of post-colonial architecture. But with the focus on vertical growth for optimal land utilisation set to alter Delhi’s skyline, experts have called for protecting these post-Independence buildings that are an essential part of the city’s modern architectural heritage.The buildings figured on the 2013 Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH)-Delhi’s list of 62 modern heritage structures submitted to the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), an urban development regulatory body.The list also included the iconic Hall of Nations, which was razed in 2017 to make way for the Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, Baha’i Temple, Vigyan Bhawan, Asiad Games Village, Nehru Memorial Library, Supreme Court, Garden of Five Senses, India Habitat Centre, National Science Centre, among others. From design and use of technology in their construction, these buildings are symbolic of the city’s growth since Independence.Also Read | Vista avenue project given heritage panel nod: CentreSwapna Liddle, the convenor of the INTACH-Delhi, said that they are now working on detailed criteria to identify such modern heritage buildings and also grade them based on a thematic framework. There are rules to protect over 100-year-old structures of historical importance but none to recognise the city’s modern heritage and protect it. The absence of any guidelines defining post-Independence heritage value led to the demolition of the Hall of Nations. The Delhi High Court decided against intervening as only buildings older than 60 years were considered for heritage status.Constructed in 1972, the Hall of Nations commemorated 25 years of India’s Independence. It symbolically and technologically reflected India’s important place in the modern industrialising community of nations, according to INTACH. The World Health Organisation’s headquarters, another piece of Delhi modern heritage, constructed in 1962 was also demolished in 2019 for redevelopment.Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad’s decision to demolish 14 of its dormitories designed by architect Louis Kahn in the 1960s was rolled back following widespread opposition. The move revived the debate about the need to protect modern heritage buildings.“These modern heritage buildings are game-changers, and heralded new trends in architecture post-Independence. For instance, Louis Kahn’s IIM Ahmedabad buildings marked a shift in design for educational institutions,” said KT Ravindran, a former DUAC chairperson.As the Centre plans to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence, heritage experts say it is about time to put in place a policy to give official recognition to buildings that represented post-Independence, neo-Indian architecture and nation-building efforts.Annabel Lopez, project consultant, INTACH-Delhi, said they prepared their list of heritage buildings based on six broad themes: architecture, structural ingenuity, typology or function, context, socio-cultural developments and historical events.“The grading was also undertaken based on the value or significance assigned to the structures, which is a reflection of the number of criteria it satisfies and not the age of the building. These landmarks of the post-Independence period [should] also receive some protection.”Delhi’s skyline is set to transform dramatically as newer development projects focus on vertical growth. Old residential areas such as Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Kidwai Nagar have given way to new high-rise developments to cater to the growing housing requirement. The new Transit Oriented Development policy, which will be notified by the Centre, allows for skyscrapers with mixed development along with the mass transit hubs.Experts believe that multi-storey flats in RK Puram have an important place in the city’s architectural history. The eight-storey Y or T shaped buildings, with lifts in the central core, were among the early attempts to provide multi-storey housing in the capital.Similarly, built in 1988, the Jeevan Bharti building in Connaught Place represents the high-rise development around the British-era market in the 80s and 90s. “Some of the buildings such as the Hall of Nations were recognised for their architectural significance worldwide. But being not protected under the law, it was demolished to make way for new development. Given the current pace of development or redevelopment in the city, soon we may not have any buildings built in the 60s or 70s left,” said Liddle.Also Read | Pollution control measures key in big development projects: ExpertsINTACH’S list also includes Vigyan Bhawan, which was constructed in 1955 and is among the buildings that fall in the area surrounding Central Vista that is under redeployment. “It is a modern building with reinterpreted elements from historic architecture such as jaalis and the chaitya window opening,” said Liddle.The Centre is redeveloping the Central Vista to construct a new common central secretariat, the new Parliament House, Central Conference Centre, residences of the vice-president and the Prime Minister. While the new Parliament is likely to be ready by next year, the rest of the project will be completed by 2024.There are 1,208 protected monuments in the city wherein any change in structure or renovation has to be approved by the Heritage Conservation Committee. Experts have called for similar regulations for modern heritage buildings. “There is an urgent need to have norms to identify and protect modern heritage,” said AGK Menon, an urban designer who was involved in preparing the INTACH’s list. “Several buildings constructed post-1947 are of great significance. Udyog Bhawan...for example, represents what we were capable of building immediately after Independence.”Urban designer Abhimanyu Dalal, who also a DUAC member, says efforts have been made globally to protect modern heritage. “These buildings are cultural markers in time, and there is a need to have regulatory mechanisms to protect them. Cities such as Paris, New York, and Chicago have rules to protect modern heritage. Any redevelopment or change in these buildings should be as per some rules.”With several set to be razed as part of the Central Vista project, Ravindran called for the need to protect buildings such as Krishi Bhawan and Udyog Bhawan. “They might not be architectural masterpieces, but certainly have heritage value, representing... adaptation of Indo-Saracenic style.”Raj Rewal, the architect of the Hall of Nations, called for an independent committee comprising eminent architects, conservationists, architectural historians, art and architecture critics to protect the post-Independence heritage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/focus-on-vertical-growth-delhi-needs-to-protect-modern-heritage-buildings-101614676773544.html

The accused, Ashish Pande, cited his parents’ opposition to their relationship and refused to marry the woman. The refusal prompted the woman to lodge a rape complaint against him in Maharashtra’s Latur.The woman said they met while working together in Kolkata in 2012. In February 2013, he proposed to her, and the next month they went to Shimla, where she initially refused to have physical relations with him since they were yet to get married. Pande allegedly took her to a temple and applied kumkum to her forehead, a marriage ritual. The relationship continued until Pande refused to marry her in January 2019 after his family allegedly humiliated and threw the woman out of their house. The woman filed the case against Pande two months later.Also Read | ‘Are you willing to marry her?’ Supreme Court to rape accusedPande moved the court to have the case quashed, saying the relationship was consensual. The court dismissed his petition. “If the accused had made known to the informant that his parents would not consent for their marriage, the informant would not have submitted herself to his desire to have physical relations with her,” said the bench. “This clearly indicates that he concealed this fact from the informant and obtained her consent projecting as if the parents would not go against his wish. He did not let her know that her low caste would also be an obstacle for their marriage.” The bench added the woman’s consent was obtained by “misconception of facts and it was not a case wherein the accused could not fulfill his promise because of some unforeseen circumstances”. “It cannot be believed that the accused was not aware that his parents would oppose his marriage with the informant, on the ground of her low caste.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-relief-to-rape-accused-he-got-consent-by-concealing-facts-bombay-hc-101614674847176.html

02-03-2021||Delhi||DDA to change land use of 31 acres for redevelopment project||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has initiated the process to change the land use of three plots, spread over 31 acres, including 19 acres of green space, in the heart of the city. It is learnt that this is being done for the Centre’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project, but there isn’t an official word on the same.The land use of 101.1 acres was changed in 2019 for the approximately ₹14,000 crore project.The land-owning agency invited the public’s comment on the proposed change.As per the public notice put out by the DDA, land use of two land parcels of 9.5 acres each, earmarked as district park, is being changed to government office. To compensate for the green space, where a government office complex is proposed, land use of 12.58 acres earmarked for government office will be developed as a district park.“The land use change is related to the redevelopment project. DDA is only responsible for changing the land use,” said a senior DDA official.As part of the Central Vista redevelopment, the Centre plans to construct a new Parliament House building (construction work has already started), a common central secretariat and redevelopment of Central Vista precinct (work for which has also started). The entire project is slated for 2024 completion.The land parcels where government offices will come up are located close to where the Prime Minister’s new residence is proposed as per the redevelopment plan. Spread over 15 acres, the PM’s residence is proposed on Dalhousie Road.A senior DDA official said, “The land use of a 12.58 acre land parcel will be changed from government to district park. There are no major offices located on this land parcel.”Also Read |  ₹5,000-crore plan to deal with traffic around redeveloped govt coloniesApart from central Delhi, the DDA has also proposed land use change of two land parcels measuring 4 acres and 2.54 acres from residential to recreational in Civil Lines.“People will have to send their suggestions or objections within the next 30 days. There will be a board of inquiry if we get objections from the public regarding the change of land use.

The inappropriateness of this process has been also clearly recorded in the dissenting judgment of the Supreme Court. This fresh notice for land use change once again brings to light that earmarked public, green and recreational spaces are being converted to high security, gated infrastructure only for government use. The proposal includes conversion of government and residential land into recreational use, but the implications of that need to be understood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-to-change-land-use-of-31-acres-for-redevelopment-project-101614672027609.html

Now, they are facing the power supply disconnection crisis," the BJP leader said.Without naming state Energy Minister and Congress leader Nitin Raut, Fadnavis said the former had talked about giving relief to lockdown-hit consumers, but instead power tariff was increased."Small shopkeepers could not do business during the lockdown. Now you are asking them to pay bills. From where are they going to pay it? So, there is a big problem," the former chief minister said.Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole pitched for stopping the on-going drive of disconnecting power supply.Also read: Farmers’ protest: Delhi’s Ghazipur border partially reopensAlso read: Punjab governor says farm laws don't address farmers' stagnating income problemPatole also said the tradition of issuing average electricity bills to consumers has to be stopped.He demanded that the electricity department take actual power meter reading before issuing bills to consumers.Responding to this, Pawar said,"I would like to tell on behalf of the state government that the drive of disconnecting electricity supply of farmers or other domestic consumers will be stopped immediately until the issue raised by Devendra Fadnavis saheb is discussed."He said other decisions with regard to the issue will be taken after members of the House are satisfied with the discussion.Fadnavis thanked the government for taking the decision, but demanded restoration of power supply to consumers who faced disconnection earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-suffered-losses-during-lockdown-now-facing-power-supply-cut-fadnavis-101614669397776.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Amid govt-guv tussle, dev boards, MLC appointments in a limbo||Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said in the state assembly that they wanted the governor to clear 12 appointments recommended by the state Cabinet as members of the legislative council, indicating that the tussle between governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government could continue. Pawar also said they will constitute the development boards of Vidarbha and Marathwada regions as soon as the governor clears the appointments.The governor, in April last year, had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to extend the term of these boards for another five years. But Thackeray took no cognizance of his letter and is yet to form the development boards.To remove development backlogs in irrigation and other sectors, three statutory development boards—one each for Vidarbha, Marathwada and rest of Maharashtra—was set up in 1994 under Article 371 of the Constitution. The five-year term of the boards expired in April last year.Also Read | MVA may ignore Governor Koshyari’s order, delay Speaker’s election“The development boards will be formed and there is no doubt about it. While presenting the budget I will ensure appropriate provisions of funds are made for Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. We are also looking to constitute the boards as early as possible. But the state Cabinet has proposed 12 names to be appointed as members of the legislative council and has sent them to the governor. The day the governor makes the appointments, we will constitute the development boards the same day or the very next day,” Pawar said in the Lower House.He was responding to the demand of Opposition leaders to constitute the development boards, which, according to them, are necessary for the balanced development of all the regions in the state.“I request you to take necessary action for securing extension to the term of the development boards by five years urgently as the present term expires on April 30, 2020,” states the letter written by Koshyari to the chief minister on April 24 last year.“The development board structure was put in place to ensure that attempts towards balanced regional development are well-implemented and that all the regions are provided equitable development. Considering the progress in ensuring equitable regional development since the boards are working and need to work further in view of the existing regional inequalities, I feel that there is a necessity to continue this structure for a further period,” it added.The governor exercises direct control on these development boards following the provisions under Article 371 (2) of the Constitution. He is also authorised to give specific directions on the allotment of funds to remove development backlogs of regions, which are binding on the government.The MVA government is locked in a bitter tussle with the governor over various issues. It has been almost four months since the government, on November 6, 2020, recommended 12 names to Koshyari for nomination to the legislative council from governor quota . MVA leaders have been expressing unhappiness as Koshyari is yet to accept the government’s recommendation.Last month, Thackeray did not permit Koshyari to use the state’s aeroplane to travel to Dehradun in Uttarakhand. This has led to a controversy and blame game between the Raj Bhavan secretariat and the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-amid-govt-guv-tussle-dev-boards-mlc-appointments-in-a-limbo-101614670953164.html
02-03-2021||Other||Civic Sanskriti: The new ABCs of plantations and maintaining green areas||Two recent news items related to plantations caught my attention. The first concerned a study by Delhi-based organisation LIFE (Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment) that shows several cities have not done urban plantations in accordance with air quality plans. The second news was of forest fires in and around Pune, worsening air quality. These reminded me of discussions initiated a couple of years ago among researchers, NGOs, and the PMC for biodiversity conservation, especially in the Biodiversity Park. The question of whether to plan for forests or grasslands on Pune’s hilltops and slopes had come up. The importance of these sites for water recharge was also noted. A mosaic of grasslands on the hilltops and slopes, and shrubs and trees along nallah courses had been broadly agreed as appropriate for biodiversity conservation and water recharge. What to do with the existing exotic species plantations on hills that suppress local species, had remained an unresolved important question.What species to plant and where, and whether to plant trees at all in some localities? Answers to these questions relate to Air Quality, Biodiversity, Climate Change, and a few more words beginning with other letters of the alphabet, such as Ecosystems, Equity, Forest fires, Livelihoods and Water. The National Clean Air Programme recommends plantations around hot spots of pollution. The Central Pollution Control Board guidelines for green belts consider the nature of pollutants from industrial areas, roads and transport. It lists pollution-tolerant tree species and those that help remove pollutants from ambient air.Pune’s Bicycle Plan includes roadside vegetation guidelines. It recommends trees species for shade, as well as grasses, herbs and shrubs that help reduce road-side dust, often neglected in urban plantation plans. It also lists characteristics to watch out for and avoid, such as tree species with weak branches that may fall on road users or those with allergenic pollen.The issue of forest fires (uncontrolled), and controlled annual burning of grasslands is more complex. Urban dwellers concerned about tree plantations for air quality, biodiversity (of tree species) and climate change (to sequester carbon), might overlook the needs of community groups directly dependent on a different biodiversity mix. Dr Nitya Ghotge, veterinarian and director of Anthra, an organisation promoting sustainable farming and livestock rearing, reminds us that hill slopes in and around Pune were once village commons where livestock grazed. Both fire and grazing, criticised from a certain environmental perspective, are actually sound grassland management techniques when used carefully. They support and maintain grassland landscapes and the biodiversity these landscapes harbor.Dr Erach Bharucha, surgeon and founder of the Institute of Environment Education & Research at Bharati Vidyapeeth, says that while vegetation burning has health impacts, only considering air quality perspective misses aspects like the basic survival of communities who depend directly on grassland ecosystems.As summer approaches, fodder for cattle, sheep and goats is hard to find especially in the western deciduous regions of Western Ghats. Crop residue is all but over and natural vegetation has dried out. When dry vegetation is burnt, it quickly produces a flush of grass that provides some food for livestock. Dr Bharucha adds that tribal farmers say that vegetation burning releases nutrients by soil heating and kills soil pests. Soil scientists should study such traditional knowledge, he suggests. There is scientific evidence that Pune region had savannah grasslands with sparse trees especially fire-resistant species like Khair, Hivar, Babhul, Tendu, Ain and Charoli. Grazing and naturally occurring fires are two phenomena maintaining grassland landscapes as evident from a part of Vetal hill. We also need studies and documentation of current landscape changes. For example, we don’t know if fires around Pune have increased or decreased over the last decade with increased urbanisation. Dr Shamita Kumar, principal, BVIEER, suggests that GIS and time-series studies would be useful to track such changes, and be useful in planning plantations, and forest and grassland conservation. It’s also important to draw out the learnings from restoration projects in the Sahyadris by the Ecological Society as well as by community groups.Satish Awate, programme director, Biodiversity Programmes at Centre for Environment Education says that plantations by municipal authorities and Forest department should consider science and community practices. Satish recommends localised planning of plantation activities, in consultation with citizen’s groups, communities and scientists. It’s time to work out the new ABC of plantations and maintaining green areas, to be more inclusive and better-informed, with ecology and equity in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-sanskriti-the-new-abcs-of-plantations-and-maintaining-green-areas-101614670406343.html

If any issues arise, we will close the route again,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.

Initially, only the carriageways going towards Delhi from Ghaziabad were closed because of the farmers’ sit-in protest. On January 26, clashes broke out between farmers and security personnel as the protesting groups allegedly defied their agreement with the Delhi Police by not following the routes given to them for their tractor rally and instead broke barricades and entered restricted routes. Following the violence, the police blocked the entire Ghazipur border, placed multiple layers of barricades, and installed iron nails on the road to ensure the farmers do not attempt to enter the city again. Traffic was diverted to alternative routes, causing traffic jams and inconvenience to motorists travelling between Delhi and Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-s-ghazipur-border-partially-reopens-101614668307251.html

Sanjiv was shot dead in his house at Parsathua on Saturday evening by armed assailants who later fled riding bikes.Hundreds of angry locals gathered after the murder demanded action against the local station house officer (SHO) alleging large scale illegal liquor business was running at Salathuan under police protection, attracting criminals and anti social elements.A murder case against Sarvottam Kumar Ray alias Chunnu Ray and Niranjan Ray of adjacent Salathuan village and five unidentified criminals had been registered with Parsathua police station.Following three previous incidents of daylight murders in the family and an apparent threat perception, police security was given to the deceased’s brother Manjiv Mishra. But the cover was withdrawn in December last year. Manjiv is secretary of Pt Girish Narayan Mishra College at Parsathua.Manjiv wrote to the authorities and personally met IG special security Bacchu Singh Menna and director general of police (DGP) SK Singhal in the first week of January, informing them of the threat perception and requesting for the resumption of security cover, which did not materialise, Manjiv said.My brother would not have been killed if the security cover was not withdrawn. It gave courage and safe passage to the killers, said Manjiv, who was at home when the killers struck.Five to seven criminals riding on bikes killed Sanjiv at his house and fled through the market firing rounds in the air. They were reported to have reached Salathuan village and engaged in further celebratory firing claiming their “revenge” was complete.Later that day, deceased’s wife and a candidate for panchayat polls, Rinki Mishra received a threatening call saying all family members will be killed as Sanjiv’s murder was just a “trailer,” Manjiv said.Also Read: Bihar politician kidnapped in Patna, rescued from Sasaram a day laterMLA Santosh Mishra said as a “responsible citizen” he cooperated with police and the administration after the murder, pacified the angry local crowd and allowed the body to be sent for post-mortem examination.“I have given the police 48 hours for action. After that the matter will be raised from roads to assembly to get justice for the family,” the MLA said.Superintendent of police, Ashish Bharti said he met the bereaved family and posted security guards at their house. Two DSP rank officers were camping at the place with sniffer dogs. Meanwhile, raids were being carried out to arrest the absconding accused and to identify all the criminals through scientific method, Bharti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cong-mla-gives-48-hr-time-to-catch-nephew-s-killers-kin-blame-security-removal-101614667088824.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP scam: Bombay high court grants bail to former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta||The Bombay high court on Tuesday, granted bail to former Broadcasting Audience Research Council (BARC) CEO Partho Dasgupta who has been booked in the TRP manipulation case by Mumbai police. The bail was granted on furnishing a personal bond of ₹2 lakh and two solvent sureties. Thereafter, on the request of Dasgupta’s lawyers, the court allowed his immediate release. The bail conditions stipulate that Dasgupta has to visit the crime branch on every first Saturday of the month for six months. A single bench comprising justice PD Naik had heard arguments in the bail application and reserved its order on February 16. Dasgupta had approached the high court after the sessions court had rejected his application in January. Dasgupta was shifted to Taloja Jail on January 22. Also Read | TRP case: WhatsApp chats contain proof of my innocence, says Partho DasguptaThe bench, while hearing the arguments on behalf of Dasgupta, had been informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocates Shardul Singh and Arjun Thakur that of the 16 accused in the TRP manipulation case only Dasgupta was still in jail while others were out on bail or anticipatory bail. Ponda had submitted that just because Dasgupta had exchanged texts with Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami on WhatsApp, he could not be held solely responsible for the alleged offences. They also submitted that as the charge sheet had already been filed and as Dasgupta suffered from health issues, he should be granted bail. Ponda had also argued that as the COO of BARC Romil Ramgarhia had been granted bail, though he had a much larger role to play in the alleged fraud, Dasgupta should also be granted bail. He had also argued that the alleged kickbacks received by Dasgupta in the form of watches and silver jewellery from Goswami had been purchased much before they were in touch with each other. He also argued that the allegations made by an employee of BARC regarding Dasgupta not taking action when alerted about the sudden spike in TRP ratings of a channel would not amount to criminal action and was just dereliction of duty. However, special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray had opposed the application on the grounds that Dasgupta was the kingpin in the fraud and could tamper with evidence and influence witnesses if he was granted bail and hence the application should be rejected. Hiray had submitted that as BARC was the only agency in India to be assigned the duty of monitoring TRPs across all channels and the post that Dasgupta held was a responsible post, his chats with channel heads and journalists showed that he had compromised his duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-scam-bombay-high-court-grants-bail-to-former-barc-ceo-partho-dasgupta-101614667107035.html

The deceased had filed a case against Gaurav Sharma in July 2018 for allegedly molesting his daughter at a village in the Sasni police station area on Monday, Uttar Pradesh police said."Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directs officials to take strict action in the matter.

02-03-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka Congress chief sets ball rolling on ‘padayatra’ plan||Congress president of Karnataka unit D K Shivakumar on Monday set in motion his plans to undertake a ‘padayatra’ or march to at least 100 assembly constituencies across the state starting Wednesday.Over the next 10 months, the Congress leader aims to visit these constituencies where the party lost in the 2018 elections, to identify its area of weakness and subsequently better its chances in the 2023 assembly polls.However, the war within the party’s top brass — mainly between Shivakumar and leader of opposition Siddaramaiah — in the state has dented its prospects and plans to corner the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state.Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah has refused to cede control over the party and continues to remain a challenge to Shivakumar who looks to mobilize support, end growing factionalism and pursue a cadre-based approach ahead of the next elections.People familiar with the development said that Siddaramaiah’s significant control over party affairs and its legislators has left Shivakumar slightly distraught and seemingly isolated.“There are no groups. All of us belong to the Congress. All of us are working to bring the party to power in the state,” Shivakumar told reporters in Kolar district on Monday, refusing to acknowledge the simmering trouble within the party.The state Congress chief is slated to begin his ‘padayatra’ on Wednesday from Devanahalli, just outside Bengaluru, where he will hold meetings with workers before proceeding further.The growing differences between the two top Congress leaders was reignited in the recently-held Mysuru mayor elections where the party lost the top chair to its ally Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S).It was two years ago that the Congress and JD(S) came together to keep the BJP at bay in the Mysuru corporation. The JD(S) retained the mayor’s post despite an agreement to handover the same to the Congress this year.“The message was passed on to the JD(S) and our party corporators in Mysuru but they did not go according to the plan,” a Congress leader said on condition of anonymity.However, Congress corporators chose to back the Janata Dal (Secular) despite orders from its top leadership as they feared losing power in the corporation, the leader added. The grand old party feared that the Janata Dal (Secular) would join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party incase the former withdrew their support.Siddaramaiah chided Shivakumar and two others — Congress legislator Tanveer Sait and former MP from Chamrajanagar R Dhruvanarayana – after he lost control of the council in his home district of Mysuru, people familiar with the matter said.Both Sait and Dhruvanarayana were directed to oversee the mayoral polls and have now been summoned to Bengaluru on February 24 to explain their version of events.Earlier, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar had locked horns over the youth Congress elections where the former had backed Raksha Ramaiah and the latter supported Mohammed Nalapad as contenders for the polls.Nalapad was disqualified even though he won the highest number of votes, leading to more friction between the two main factions.While the BS Yediyurappa-led government in the state has been forced to go on the backfoot due to dissent within his ministers, shortage of funds and his inability to get the Centre release more funds for the state, the Congress has remained toothless so far in its attack on the government. The infighting within the Congress had rendered them ineffective against the Yediyurappa government.Siddaramaiah has also met senior party leaders in Delhi to discuss the ongoing tension within the party, people familiar with the matter said. The two leaders aspire to become the next chief ministerial candidate, a Congress leader said on condition of anonymity.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s presence at Shivakumar’s daughter’s wedding on February 17 is being construed as the high command’s support for the Vokkaliga leader, the Congress leader added.Rahul is expected to take part in Shivakumar’s padyatra sometime later this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-congress-chief-sets-ball-rolling-on-padayatra-plan-101614662346043.html
02-03-2021||Bangalore||Only 22% Covid-19 vaccination amid glitches on Day 1 in Bengaluru||A 102-year-old and a 97-year-old were among the recipients of the Covid vaccine, as the third phase of distribution began in Bengaluru and across Karnataka on Monday. The list of recipients also included the co-founder of Infosys, NR Narayana Murthy, and philanthropist Sudha Murthy.However, the first of the day of the vaccination drive, aimed at senior citizens and comorbid patients, resulted in confusion due to glitches in the CoWIN portal.According to data released by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), 938 senior citizens and comorbid patients were administered the vaccine on Monday whereas the target was 4,200 shots, thus limiting the drive to 22%, an official said.According to data, out of the 22 vaccination centres, four centres — Victoria Hospital, CV Raman Nagar General Hospital and Columbia Asia Hospital in Whitefield and Sarjapura - did not provide a single shot of the vaccine. This was attributed to the glitch in the CoWIN portal and app, wherein officials couldn’t access data. “Details of those who registered for an appointment did not reflect on the portal,” said the official.BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, said that the app and portal were unable to handle the traffic and the glitches needed to be fixed at the earliest. “The vaccination drive was scheduled to be held between noon and 5pm but the portal showed it as 9am and 6pm. This ended up in people lining up for hours before scheduled time,” he said.In some cases, officials were unable to log into the system for hours, resulting in the vaccination starting late. “Another problem we faced was regarding the OTP. People were not getting OTPs even after being registered. This delayed the process,” said an official at a hospital in east Bengaluru, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, the emergence of multiple Covid-19 clusters in Bengaluru and the government’s decision to impose travel restrictions on those coming from Kerala and Maharashtra, have led to one big question among citizens — will there be another wave of the virus in the city?While the Centre has sent a team to assess the situation and suggest steps to curb the spread of the virus, data and experts tell a different story.A comparison of the number of Covid cases reported in Bengaluru shows that the average number in the last three months has come down. In January, the average number of cases reported in Bengaluru was 601. This came down to 338 in January and the average further dropped to 241 in February.“The numbers at this point are not alarming. Nonetheless, we are stepping up our surveillance and other precautionary measures. More than the numbers in Karnataka, these steps are in place because of the caseloads in Kerala and Maharashtra,” Trilok Chandra, commissioner, health and family welfare department, said.While the numbers of cases have dropped, there are questions raised about testing. In December, the state conducted 1,02,195 test per day on average. In January, this dropped to 85,294 and it dropped further in February to 62,105 tests per day. Health department officials said that a target of 75,000 tests has given to the officials.Prasad defended the drop in the number of tests saying the reduction in cases led to fewer tests. “If someone tests positive, we test primary and secondary contacts. We are doing it and because the number of cases is less, the number of contacts are fewer,” he said.A member of Karnataka’s Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) said that talks of the second wave in Karnataka, especially in Bengaluru, is mere speculation.“The numbers have come down. We are now deploying marshal at weddings and other large events to ensure social distancing and other precautions are followed,” he said.However, restaurants, pubs and cafes remain occupied in Bengaluru, despite the government asking citizens to take precautions. “Malls are witnessing high footfalls and the number of people travelling to tourist destinations has increased over the last few months. There has been a record attendance of people participating in political events and marriages with no masks or compliance with any safety measures,” said a health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/only-22-covid-19-vaccination-amid-glitches-on-day-1-in-karnataka-101614661403461.html
02-03-2021||Other||This Telangana village celebrates birth of girl child with festive fervour||From musical processions to distributing sweets and rewarding parents with cash incentives— this is how a village in Telangana’s Sangareddy district celebrates the birth of a girl child.Welcome to Haridaspur, a small village in Kondapur block, about 70 km from Hyderabad, where every girl childbirth is an occasion for celebration. The village panchayat, supported by youths and students, takes out procession beating drums and distributes sweets to all residents. At night, the panchayat building is illuminated with colourful lights and the parents of the newborn are given a small cash incentive.“We celebrate the births of girl children, who bring good omen for all of us. It is our way to ensure every girl child feels empowered and respected,” Haridaspur village panchayat secretary Rohit Kulkarni said.The panchayat also opens a bank account under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) scheme in the name of every girl child with an initial deposit of ₹1,000.SSY is a scheme launched in 2015 as part of the central government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao initiative. The scheme enables guardians to open a savings account for their girl child, below 10 years of age, with an authorised commercial bank or a post office branch and the amount deposited fetches an interest of 8.4 per cent, which is exempted from tax.With just around 300 families and a population of 1,100, Haridaspur shot to the limelight when authorities of Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple at Chilkur on the outskirts of Hyderabad, visited the village on February 21 to perform “Kanyavandanam” (worshipping girl children). The head priest of the temple, C S Rangarajan, performed the rituals by applying turmeric and vermillion on the feet of girl children, something that is routine during the worship of goddess Maha Lakshmi.On how the girl childbirth celebrations started, Kulkarni shared the story of one Nagesh’s family. Kulkarni said Nagesh’s wife Satyavathi had given birth to a gild child for the third time. “They were hoping for a boy. It was then, we decided to start a campaign to celebrate girl children,” he said.Later, the gram panchayat passed a resolution stating that the village would celebrate the birth of all girl children. “In the last one year, eight girls have been born in the village and we celebrated each one of them with participation from the entire village,” he said.The panchayat decided to open bank accounts in the name of all newborn girls and also those below 10 years, under Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana.“The panchayat has paid an initial deposit of ₹1,000 in the name of each child. Initially, we pooled money from our pockets, but later, we have received donations from several individuals. One Samaritan donated ₹50,000 and we instantly opened 50 accounts,” the panchayat secretary said.On the day of “Kanyavandanam” programme, an activist from the Brahmin Welfare Trust, donated ₹5,000. “Now, all the 60-odd girls in Haridaspur have bank accounts in their names,” Kulkarni said.“We were worried how to bring up the third girl child, as we are very poor. But the sarpanch and secretary gave us a lot of moral support. They also got our daughters enrolled in SSY scheme,” Satyavathi said.The story of Haridaspur inspired the neighbouring Eddu Mailaram village to adopt the same resolution. “We will also celebrate girl child birth in our village,” Eddu Mailaram sarpanch Malla Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-telangana-village-celebrates-birth-of-girl-child-with-festive-fervour-101614656457819.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra cyber police suspects cyber attack behind Mumbai power outage||The Maharashtra government on Monday said that a preliminary report of the cyber cell of the Maharashtra police also suspected cyber-attack as a reason behind power outage in Mumbai in October last year. State home minister Anil Deshmukh said the findings of the report indicated cyber sabotage by some foreign countries. However, more details will come only after further investigation.Some 14 trojan horses (a virus often disguised as a legitimate software) may have been introduced in the server of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), data of around 8GB may have transferred from unaccounted foreign servers, similarly, login may have been made by blacklisted IP (internet protocol) addresses in the MSEB server, says the findings of cyber police, following the analysis of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks,” Deshmukh told reporters at Sahyadri guest house on Monday. SCADA is a common framework of control systems used in industrial operations.“This is a preliminary report and we don’t know which of the countries are involved in it. More details will come following further investigation,” he added.Deshmukh shared the findings following the findings of a report conducted by a US- based firm Recorded Future that has indicated a Chinese cyber-attack behind power outage in Mumbai, according to news reports published by the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.Also Watch: After Chinese hand claim by US firm, govt reveals prelim report on Mumbai blackoutThe home minister also submitted the report of the cyber cell to the state energy minister Nitin Raut. Raut said he had then suspected the possibility of a sabotage. “Following the outage, I had suspected sabotage then. I have also received probe reports of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) and the Centre on the matter but cannot share the details as the budget session of the state legislature is going on,” he said.A grid failure resulted in massive power outages in Mumbai and its suburban areas on October 12, stopping trains on tracks, hampering those working from home and hitting the stuttering economic activity hard. It took two hours for the power supply to resume for essential services; other pockets started getting power in a phase-wise manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cyber-police-suspects-cyber-attack-behind-mumbai-power-outage-101614654439868.html
02-03-2021||Lucknow||Woman accused of killing husband, can't be given child's custody: HC||The Allahabad high court has held that a woman accused of killing her husband cannot be given the custody of her minor daughter considering the welfare of the child, unless she is acquitted in the case.Justice JJ Munir, while dismissing the petition, observed that if the mother is acquitted in the murder case by the concerned court, she would have the right to move court for her daughter’s custody, which would then be decided in accordance with law. The court passed this order on February 26 in a habeas corpus writ petition filed by a woman in 2019.In the plea, the woman residing in Mumbai had alleged that on May 11, 2018 her husband went to his native place at Jhansi while she stayed back. On May 13, 2018, she received a call from her husband’s maternal uncle claiming some unknown person had killed her husband. However, when she reached Jhansi with her daughter, she was falsely implicated in her husband's murder case and was arrested while her daughter was taken away by her husband's maternal uncle. Since then the child was in his custody.The court observed, "This court assumes that the possibility of conviction may be remote or not so remote, but the possibility is there. The existence of this possibility and the adverse impact of the event, if it were to come to pass, would far outweigh the transitory benefit the minor would derive from her mother's care and company."Also Read: Reservation list for UP panchayat election to be released today"This facet of the matter apart, the possibility that the mother might truly be a conspirator in her husband's murder, predicates a personality which would not be beneficial for the minor in grooming her about her moral values - a very important aspect of a child’s welfare. On the other hand, if the mother is innocent and is acquitted, the loss, the minor would suffer on account of deprivation of her mother's care and custody, cannot be re-compensated, but nevertheless, it is a reverse that must be accepted for the minor’s surer welfare, in preference to a contingent better, fraught with risk," further observed the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/woman-accused-of-killing-husband-can-t-be-given-child-s-custody-hc-101614653156677.html

02-03-2021||City||Punjab govt to amend excise act to add death penalty||The Punjab government on Monday decided to amend its excise act, introducing the death penalty for the guilty in cases where people die after consuming spurious liquor.The decision was taken by the Punjab Cabinet on Monday in the wake of a hooch tragedy in Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran, where several died due to the consumption of spurious liquor in July last year.The Bill in this regard will be introduced in the ongoing budget session of the state legislative assembly, a government release said, adding that the aim was to instil fear of law among the offenders.A new Section 61-A will be inserted in the Punjab Excise Act, 1914, according to which in case of death, the guilty shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine up to ₹20 lakh.In case of disability, the guilty will be jailed for at least six years extendable up to life imprisonment with up to Rs10 lakh fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-to-amend-excise-act-to-add-death-penalty-101614649269834.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||New normal: Intimate weddings, virtual events||The Covid-19 pandemic turned the Capital’s big fat weddings into a low-key affair with restrictions on gatherings, and sanitisers, social distancing and masks becoming the new normal. But, for many, it was also a moment of truth about their closeness to a certain family or friend as hosts began to mercilessly downsize their guest lists.Deepshikha, an IT professional who goes by her first name, was invited to attend her college friend’s wedding in December last year. But, a week before the wedding, she got a message from the bride, saying, “Due to the latest Covid restrictions, we will be limiting our guest list to an intimate number. Please accept my apology for not having you with us on the special day...”Deepshikha, who had already purchased a dress for the wedding, said she was looking forward to the event. “When the wedding pictures came up on her Insta profile, I found out that another girl from our group back in college was invited. It’s just an awkward feeling where you realise that you were not as close to a person as you thought. It’s funny how the pandemic has brought out such aspects and emotions of people,” she said with a nervous laugh.On October 31, 2020, the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) lifted the restriction of allowing only 50 people in weddings. In banquet halls and closed spaces, the DDMA allowed up to 200 people, while the decision on the number of guests in open spaces was left on the district administration.But, after Delhi was hit by the third and the most severe Covid wave on November 16, the DDMA reduced the number of guests to 50 on November 18.The norms were again relaxed on January 31, allowing a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity, with a ceiling of 200 people. In open spaces or grounds, the number of permissible people now depends on the area of the venue.Tara Khosla, a wedding planner in South Delhi, said weddings now have become more intimate and requests from the hosts have also changed drastically. “The packages post Covid also include costs for virtual weddings where the entire ceremony is live streamed to those who could not be invited. The welcome hampers now mostly include designer masks and well scented sanitisers, among other things,” she said.People are no longer spending a lot on physical cards, she added. “It has mostly gone all digital with some even demanding websites with details about the couple, how they met, apart from the events, dress code and the venue. The idea of a small, intimate and well decorated wedding has trickled down really well and is in huge demand among the young working class where the bride and the groom take the onus of their own weddings,” she said.Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association, Delhi, said banquet halls and farmhouses have still not recovered from the losses incurred during the pandemic.“The business is picking up slowly, but the demand is still not the same as pre-Covid times. Even as weddings were allowed with up to 50 persons, people hardly booked a large hall and rather shifted all events to their homes. So, you can say that our properties were out of business for at least 10 months. During this time many of our banquet halls were also taken over by the government to convert them in Covid car centres, most of which were hardly used as hardly any patient came,” he said.But not just weddings, even business or corporate events, which were an annual affair for many companies, have shifted to digital modes. “We are losing out on corporate events big time. In pre-Covid times, there used to be conclaves, summits, off-site team building meets and what not. All of that has now shifted online. The worst part is, very few companies are going back to physical participation. Most of them have decided to continue with the webinars or digital conclaves as it saves money,” said Rakshit Singh, a corporate event handler in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-normal-intimate-weddings-virtual-events-101614645314023.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi's year of isolation||Cities shuttered, streets emptied, trains halted, and our days wrecked by fear — for our loved ones, our jobs, our everyday functioning. A great many books will be written, and movies made, on this first year of the pandemic. Here’s a snapshot of how Delhi coped with the once-in-a-lifetime occurrenceLaila’s stay-at-home consolationsDressed in a many-hued hand-woven Murshidabad silk sari, craft activist Laila Tyabji, 73, is sitting in her book-lined drawing room in south Delhi’s Shantiniketan. Behind her sofa is a huge glass window through which all you see are sky, clouds and trees. As she chats, the birds fly past the window—like fish swimming in the aquarium. During the lockdown last year, “my drawing room window reminded me that looking out is as important as looking in,” she said. “Things have their own beauty, but also the beauty of memory and the people with whom you associate them.” She tells us about five cherished objects that were a source of comfort during the homebound isolation we all underwent in the early months of the pandemic.The bottlebrush trees outside, brilliant with colour, planted by my parents in 1971 when they built the original house, now tall enough to reach my 2nd floor window.The South Indian elephant lamp, bought by them in Mysore on a car trip through South India circa 1954. I’ve always had a thing for elephants and, aged 5, swore I would marry a man like one – big, wise and with a twinkle in his eye. Alas I never found the right one!A brass Buddha head bought by me to replace a family one that fell to my brother’s share and whose serene beauty I’d loved all my life.Chiks on either side, made by Ram Singh, who arrived early morning to hang them the day (god-daughter) Urvashi and I moved into the reconstructed new flat in 2001. The only supplier (from fancy air-conditioning companies and master masons to Italian kitchen manufacturers) who met his deadline absolutely on time and accompanied it with a blessing, mithai, and an Om on my door.Rows of books, almost concealed behind the sofa but an essential magic entry into other worlds and minds.Claiming the new normalThe auditorium at Ghalib Academy in central Delhi can accommodate 200 people. These days it has set its maximum limit to 50 in accordance with social distancing. One afternoon last week, the auditorium was empty with chairs marked with posters saying “Please do not sit here.” The institute has resumed its popular literary meet held every second Saturday of the month. Its first pandemic-era gathering took place in December to mark poet Mirza Ghalib’s birth anniversary.Prachi’s fresh start, A young woman emerges from a disrupted yearThis is Tagore. This is Yeats. And this is Vikram Seth—says Prachi Sharma, pointing out cuttings of poems stuck on her closet. She wants to be a writer, and has chosen this tiny fourth floor room in cramped Delhi locality of Saidulajab as the setting to realise the dream. It is the first home of her own. “Pandemic or not, this house is a beginning for me,” she says. “It feels like a return to normalcy.”Ms Sharma, 21, moved here a month ago from her parents’ house in nearby Faridabad in Haryana. “Though they wanted me to stay with them.”But staying in Faridabad was never in her original plan. The pandemic had forced her to do so. Last year, she spent the successive lockdowns alone in her PG (paying guest) accommodation in north Delhi’s Roop Nagar — she was then a literature student in Delhi University’s Kirori Mal College. Ms Sharma’s only roommate had left for her parents’ just before the lockdown started, and so had the other 40 students living in the building. She had stayed back “because I liked being alone in a quiet unmoving time.” Eventually she was obliged to give it up in June “when my contract to stay ended, and because nothing else had fallen into place. I had to return to Faridabad.”Some months after getting a job as a content writer in a Gurugram firm, Ms Sharma decided to “take the leap” and move to Saidulajab.“The locality is good... full of young people still in college or with their first jobs... they look like people who live my kind of life.”The great part of her optimism comes from her apartment. “No matter where I am during the day, the thought that I will be returning to this place is comforting.”At night, the young woman sees the moon through her curtain-less window. In the morning, “the sunlight wakes me up.” There’s no bed but a mattress on the floor.“I like listening to my thoughts in this room,” she says, turning on a Jagjit Singh song on her mobile phone. It’s lying atop a bed table, along with a Murakami novel, a pair of jhumka and a facemask with a Madhubani design—the only thing in the room hinting that we are still in the midst of a pandemic. Does she feel its oppression?She says—“In my room, I do not feel the pandemic. Because only one breath, and only one touch live here - mine.”Shakespeare as Dilli’s migrant workerHow would Shakespeare cope with this year of pandemic in Delhi? Jonathan Gil Harris, former president of Shakespeare Society of India and professor of literature in Ashoka University, gives us his take.“Shakespeare was no stranger to pandemic. It shaped his thinking, his language and his career in ways that might seem uncannily familiar to us here in India. Picture this: an epidemic is ravaging the capital. Healthy people fall ill with fever, aches, and dry coughs; many die within a matter of days. A migrant worker, one of many in a city swollen by people desperate for economic opportunity, faces a difficult decision. His livelihood has disappeared overnight: the place where he has worked, has shut down, and his company has disbanded. He has to find another source of income. And that means walking back to his village, about sixty kilometres from the city – or finding employment elsewhere in the countryside.A Dilli worker from UP? A Mumbai labourer from Bihar? No. This migrant worker was Shakespeare, who arrived in London from his native Stratford just two or three years before the devastating plague of 1592-3, which killed maybe as many as 10% of London’s population.Shakespeare survived, obviously. His forced relocation led him to find new employment as a poet for hire. Under the patronage of the Earl of Southampton, he wrote and published his first works: two poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. These helped gain him money and some reputation. But all his subsequent work bears the silent imprint of the trauma wrought by the pandemic. Many of his plays – Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest – speak of the horrors of sudden, enforced exile; others – Merchant of Venice, Timon of Athens – address the trauma of the sudden loss of income. Shakespeare prospered. But the pandemic left him with a lasting sense of the fragility of life, livelihood, and home.”We, the isolationistsDuring the lockdown, we asked Delhiites what they see when they close their eyes in self-isolation. Faiza Hashmi , video producer, 25, who spent the lockdown with parents in Hardoi, said, “I close my eyes in self-isolation from corona… and I see my home. Rays of sunset are dazzling upon my mother’s shoulder as she picks bougainvillea flowers from the scaffold of the gate. My father is done doing wazoo in the courtyard and calls my brothers emphatically to ensure they don’t miss maghrib namaz. And there I was standing at a distant balcony looking at them and thinking what if I had made it to home on time? May be that smile that was missing on their faces would have made a comeback.”Abhishek Chaswal, ad writer, 45, who spent the lockdown with his wife, son and a dog in Saket, said, “I close my eyes in self-isolation from corona… and I see myself watching my facial hair grow like the plants in my balcony. Everything has slowed down so much I can almost feel them growing in slow motion. Don’t want to start hating the indoors too much because eventually an urbanite’s life is all about moving from one box to another. Reading quite a bit about the Hikikomoris of Japan as dystopian fiction unfolds the day in front of my eyes. What else can a man do but hope to grow as wise as one’s beard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-year-of-isolation-101614645559004.html
02-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram techie jailed for 13 months develops software to make prisons high-tech||Once a techie, always a techie. And so, when software engineer Amit Mishra was jailed in Haryana’s Gurugram for 13 months in connection with his wife’s suicide he got busy developing a software to make Indian jails hi-tech.A year on, when Mishra walked out of Bhondsi jail after proving his innocence, he found himself much in demand by jail authorities across Haryana after the success of his software, Phoenix — a prison management system software.On Monday, the Supreme Court acknowledged the efficacy of Mishra’s software, seeking his assistance in ensuring that life convicts could exercise their legal right of early release after serving 14 years in jail.An SC bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta noted that the feasibility of Mishra’s software should be explored by states so as to have a uniform platform where statistics relating to the inmates can be stored digitally for suitable actions.“One of the detenus/convicts in Haryana, Shri Amit Mishra, prepared a software which the State of Haryana itself thought is worth implementing and is supposed to be quite comprehensive. The feasibility of adopting that on a country-wide basis with modifications, if any, can also be explored,” stated the court order.The idea to seek Mishra’s assistance was put forth by amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal, who was assisting the court in framing guidelines on a way to ensure that the convicts entitled to a remission could move their requests immediately after completing 14 years, with authorities then deciding on the request in a time-bound manner too.According to the law, people sentenced to life imprisonment are jailed for the rest of their lives. However, the law allows the state government and jail authorities to consider the release of convicts, based on their behaviour, after a minimum jail-term of 14 years.Agrawal told the bench about Mishra and his software Phoenix. “All the records of the prisoners, including their addresses, period of sentence served and remaining, are available to the jail authorities on a real time basis. I suggest such a software should be installed in all jails,” he submitted.Agrawal added that he met Mishra a few years ago and was impressed by the improvement in the management and administration of the jail after use of this software. At this, the bench told Agrawal to seek Mishra’s help to come up with a system where prisoners’ pleas for early release can be filed without inordinate delays. The court will hear the case next on April 19.Mishra said: “It will be a privilege to assist the court. The software I developed is presently used by 19 jails in Haryana, 38 jails in Rajasthan, 31 jails in UP and 13 jails in Himachal Pradesh. Use of this software will definitely serve the ends of justice for the inmates, apart from streamlining the administration of jails.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-techie-jailed-for-13-months-develops-software-to-make-prisons-hightech-101614638740662.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi police to quiz jailed man as part of probe into plot to kill Sushil Pandit||Days after nabbing two men for allegedly plotting to kill human rights activist Sushil Pandit, senior officers of the Delhi Police special cell said they will seek the custody of one Prince Kumar, a criminal currently under trial in Faridkot who the agency claimed had hired the two arrested men to carry out the murder.According to the police, the two alleged contract killers, Sukhvinder Singh (25) and Lakhan (21) revealed during interrogations that they were hired by Kumar, who is also known as Tuti, to kill Pandit. They were promised ₹10 lakh each for killing Pandit, deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh had said on Saturday, after their arrest.The police have also initiated a threat assessment procedure to decide on giving a security cover to Pandit, who said he has written to the city police chief, seeking suggestions on the precautionary measures he should take. He has also asked if he will be given police protection.“I have been contacted by some police officers who asked if I suspected anyone who could have plotted my murder, plot or if I thought any particular incident may have led to such planning. Some senior police officers I have spoken to told me that the threat perception process for my security is underway,” Pandit said on Monday.Pandit, who hails from Kashmir, is an activist advocating the rights of Kashmiri Pandits. He was also very vocal about his support for the revocation of Article 370 in August 2019.The two men were arrested Friday from RK Puram with four firearms, four cartridges, and a cellphone that contained a photograph of Pandit, which Kumar had allegedly sent them. “It’s important to question Tuti to verify the disclosures made by the duo regarding him. Since he is lodged in a Faridkot jail, we will be seeking his custody. We will confront the two in front of Tuti,” said a police officer associated with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-to-quiz-jailed-man-as-part-of-probe-into-plot-to-kill-sushil-pandit-101614637846552.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Lost time, regained||So sad, and so beautiful—these are the thoughts that pop up simultaneously on seeing this sight.Can there be a more haunting lane anywhere in the Delhi region than this alley of the Millennium City of Gurugram? One side of the lane is completely unremarkable, lined with conventional everyday shops. The facing side has the same sort of shops too, but they lie under a most extraordinarily beautiful but severely derelict mansion, the kind of old haveli that you might not even see in Old Delhi. The wooden edifice runs across the length of the short street. Its long balcony rests on a series of sculpted brackets. The balusters under the handrail have been substituted by a metal netting, whose design is as ‘maheen’, or delicate, as an elaborately crafted hand-woven sari border. The series of doors, presumably leading to the rooms inside, are gigantic—the door head of each a fine geometrical piece of glass, arrayed with narrow metal slabs arranged like the rays of a rising sun. The windows have their panes broken in places. Plants are growing out in certain places, suggesting that domesticity, if it ever existed within these walls, has given way to wilderness.Nobody in the street can tell much about the antecedents of the great house. “It’s very, very old,” says a footpath hawker. “It was built long ago by a lawyer,” says a shopkeeper. “There were many such houses earlier, but they all have been replaced by new buildings,” volunteers yet another trader. “Nobody lives upstairs,” says one more shopkeeper.One of the establishments under this building houses the workshop-cum-shop of an elderly shoemaker. The place used to be dream-like, with wooden walls looking so smeared with the patina of several years that they seemed as soft as churned butter. During the lockdown last year, the shoemaker’s son gifted him a revamped interior (which appeared on these pages). All that wood was removed, and the shop is now gleaming and new with white painted walls and straight-lined shelves in place of spacious taaks, or niches. These modern-day alterations, however, lend greater dignity to the structure above, that has remained unaltered. The fact that hardly anybody in the area cares to look up at the picturesque mansion makes the place even more poignant.While the building’s ground level portions stay hidden behind a series of shops, these small businesses do give a charming contemporary flavour to this architectural souvenir, reflecting the area’s eclectic chaos. Mehta Gift Gallery gives “fancy dress on rent,” for instance. While a pavement tailor is busy over a kurta, his woman customer standing beside him, her eyes nervously following his hand as the scissors make a cutting through the precious fabric.One end of the building has its lower portion bare of any shop. It is covered with old-style bricks. A huge door fitted into the wall has its entire surface arrayed into a series of 20 panels—a thing rarely seen these days.Just across the street stands a new building, of grey and glass, that speaks most forcefully for the more widespread aesthetics of today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-lost-time-regained-101614637176915.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Vasant Kunj RWA asks L-G to step in, put stop to ‘illegal’ construction work||The residents’ welfare association of Green Avenue in Vasant Kunj has written to Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal seeking his help to stop alleged illegal commercial construction at a building in the neighbourhood. The RWA has alleged that the building owner was going ahead with the work despite South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) sealing the premises twice.According to a senior SDMC official who is aware of the development, the corporation sealed the building in January over allegations of illegal construction. After the latest charges that work was still going on at the building, civic officials inspected the premises in February and found that the seal had been broken.“We sealed the property again. We also demolished the illegal structures. We also initiated the process to file an FIR against the owner. The property owner is a repeat offender. We filed an FIR against the owner in the past as well,” said a senior SDMC official.Located in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj, Green Avenue has farmhouses measuring an acre to 2.5 acres.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said they have received a complaint and, accordingly a first information report (FIR) has been registered under appropriate sections. “The matter is being looked into,” Singh said.Satyavir Singh, vice-president of Green Avenue RWA, said, “This is a residential area but the owner is constructing a commercial property. Despite action by the South corporation, they are brazenly violating the norms and carrying on with construction.” In its letter to the L-G, the RWA alleged that the demolition carried out by the civic body was “perfunctory, and the crew clearly were instructed not to do any structural damage”.The owner of the property did not respond to calls and text messages. He was not named in the RWA letter.The letter has also been marked to SDMC commissioner, director (vigilance) SDMC, DDA vice-chairman, deputy commissioner South zone of SDMC and SHO of Vasant Kunj police station.Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said that he has directed the officials concerned to check if illegal construction was still going on at the building.“The property’s owner was illegally constructing a school in violation of prescribed norms. We have received several complaints. So, demolition was conducted on February 19 in the premises and the property was sealed,” said Chawla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vasant-kunj-rwa-asks-l-g-to-step-in-put-stop-to-illegal-construction-work-101614635835160.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||No EV policy perks for electric version of Tata Nexon SUV||The Delhi government on Monday temporarily delisted the electric variant of the Tata Nexon from subsidies it offers under the state’s electric vehicle (EV) policy, citing deficiencies in delivering the mileage promised by the automotive giant. The government also constituted a committee comprising a representative each from the transport department, Delhi Integrated Multi-modal Transit System (DIMTS), Tata Motors and an expert from the field to investigate the matter in detail.The order delisting the Tata Nexon EV variants stated that the transport department examined Tata Motors’ explanations in detail and found them to be “non-satisfactory”. It also added that the temporary suspension from subsidies and other benefits under the Delhi EV policy, 2020 was done in “public interest” as such “misplaced” claims could discourage people from buying EVs as the range of vehicles is one of the major parameters or expectations while purchasing such a vehicle.On February 8, the Delhi transport department issued a showcause notice to the auto maker after it received complaints from residents regarding the EV variant of the SUV. After this, a Tata Motors representative appeared before the city transport deputy commissioner on February 15 to explain the reason for the deficiencies, which the government has now termed unsatisfactory.When asked to comment on the matter, a Tata Motors spokesperson called the transport department’s order “unfortunate”.“We will continue to engage constructively to protect the interests of our customers. The Nexon EV is the only personal segment EV available in the market today that meets the stringent FAME norms. The range at a single full charge (312 km) for the Nexon EV is basis of the certification received from the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), which is the official body that independently tests all mass-produced vehicles under standard/defined test conditions before they can be offered to customers,” the spokesperson said.But state transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the only piece of evidence given by Tata Motors about the certification from ARAI is not sufficient to displace the basis of the complaints received by the government.“We received multiple complaints from Tata Nexon EV owners who raised the issue of mileage, which did not cross even 200km on a single charge. The Delhi government is very serious about its EV policy, and we want to ensure the effective implementation of these guidelines, which will help make Delhi the EV capital of India. People are still very sceptical about EVs, because of which sales are not so high, on top of it, such misplaced claims by OEMs will only negatively impact the public sentiment towards EVs,” he said.The minister further stated that the suspension of the subsidies on this vehicle variant in only temporary and it will be lifted only on the basis of the findings of the committee which was constituted on Monday.The Tata Motors spokesperson said with conventional vehicles (with IC engines), the actual range achieved in EVs is dependent on AC usage, individual driving style and the actual conditions in which the vehicle is driven.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-ev-policy-perks-for-electric-version-of-tata-nexon-suv-101614635240006.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Endless cycle of traffic chaos at Ashram Chowk||The traffic chaos at Ashram Chowk, instead of getting better, has only become worse.The Public Works Department (PWD) last month started work on extending the Ashram flyover on Ring Road, even as work on a 750-metre Ashram underpass is going on after missing several deadlines. These two projects running simultaneously has made one of the Capital’s most crucial intersections — one that connects south and central Delhi, and virtually serves as the connection for two NCR cities Noida and Faridabad — a nightmare for commuters.Experts feared the situation may get even more troubling, with PWD and traffic police officials saying work on the projects will overlap for at least two months, and questioned the decision to start work on a second project despite not finishing the first.According to S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), the high traffic volume on Mathura Road and Ring Road should have made the completion of the Ashram underpass project a top priority for the construction agency.“Once the situation normalised after the Covid-19 lockdown, attempts should have been made to speed up work and complete the project. Authorities should have fast-tracked the project to complete it on time so that the public did not have to go through such traffic logjams. When such important projects get delayed, it not only results in traffic snarls, but the cost of the project is also escalated,” Velmurugan said.“While undertaking construction at arterial roads such as Ashram and ITO, the focus should be to finish before time and free up the space for traffic. The authorities should have made additional arrangements such as additional manpower at least towards the end of the year to make up for the time lost due to the pandemic,” he said.Experts also pointed out that instead of “worsening the traffic mess” at intersection, PWD should first devote its resources to the completion of the underpass, and then take up the flyover extension so as to create alternative routes for better vehicular management.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said that things were bad even when the Ring Road was acting as an alternative route to Mathura Road, where digging work has been going on since January. Now, he said, the intersection will get harder to negotiate.“The Mathura Road and Ring Road cross each other on the intersection, and if simultaneous work is initiated, there will be no clear route for traffic to move,” he said. “Even if the initiation of the flyover extension has to be postponed a little, the way to go is to wrap up work on one road first and then move to the other. This will make traffic management easier for the agencies.”While underpass connects Nizamuddin rail bridge with Mathura road near CSIR Apartments,, the flyover extension aims to extend the six-lane flyover from Ashram to DND with ramps for traffic to and from the Sarai Kale Khan bus terminal. The initial deadline of the underpass was December 2020 which has been missed. It has now been extended to April 2020. The flyover extension project will take nearly 18 months to be completed from the date of start of the work which means it has to be completed by June 2022.The Delhi Traffic Police confirmed on Monday that they received fresh permission requests from PWD to begin digging work on the Ring Road for the extension of the Ashram flyover. Officers admitted it would worsen the already bad situation considerably.“We are working out a diversion plan. The challenge will be to accommodate work on both — the Ring Road and Mathura Road — because there will be no alternative route to bear the load. In fact, the traffic on the flyover will also be affected now,” said a senior traffic official who asked not to be named.The official added that they are considering a plan to “divert load” from the Ring Road much before vehicles reach the Ashram intersection. For instance, traffic going towards east Delhi and Noida will be warned of the construction work before they reach the AIIMS flyover, so that they can use Barapullah elevated corridor and avoid Ashram altogether. Similarly, diversions will also be made near the Moolchand flyover for traffic going towards central Delhi and Faridabad.“However, despite the best laid plans, we cannot deny that till the time work on both roads continues, congestion on this stretch will be a regular feature,” the traffic official said.On Monday, when HT visited the infamous intersection, traffic jams extended to the entry of the Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway.Juhi Kataria, a regular commuter on the route, said that additional barricades were placed on the Kilokri side and on the Maharani Bagh side of the Ring Road about two weeks ago. She said that this made wading through the stretch even more time-consuming.“Till a month ago, after crossing the intersection, traffic would move relatively smoother. However, now both sides of the Ring Road have barricades, eating up around a lane’s space. Once work intensifies here, traffic will be a nightmare,” she said.Subhash Chand, head of traffic engineering and safety division at the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said that traffic is in a mess at the Ashram intersection primarily because of the poor site and safety management by PWD.“A lot of the traffic jams could have been managed if the construction agencies took the required steps for site management. Since this is an important connection, with high traffic volume, there should have been signage warning commuters of ongoing construction from a few kilometres ahead. This would allow people to rationalise their route, instead of crowding at the intersection,” Chand said.A PWD official who asked not to be named admitted that things would be bad “for a while” but hoped a traffic plan would make the situation better.“To intensify flyover construction work, we will require putting barricades in the middle of the road to build foundations and erect piers to support the flyover. This can be done only when we get proper traffic diversion, which we hope to get in a fortnight’s time. We have started widening the road by removing pavements on Maharani Bagh and Kilokri so traffic can be accommodated on this additional space,” the official said.There was no response from the government and the PWD despite texts and calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/endless-cycle-of-traffic-chaos-at-ashram-chowk-101614634448442.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Test positivity rate highest in 45 days; Delhi adds 175 Covid-19 cases||The Covid-19 test positivity rate on Monday was the highest recorded in the national capital since January 15, showed state government data.Delhi added 175 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday, on the back of 39,700 tests, leading to a positivity rate of 0.44%, the highest since the Capital saw the same rate on January 15.While the positivity rate has continued to stay lower than 1% since the end of December last year, the marginal increase in the number comes amid what seem like new waves of the infection in at least five states in the country — Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh.Further, Monday’s high positivity rate — when numbers for Sunday’s cases and testing are reported – is also due to fewer tests conducted. Only 39,733 tests were conducted on the day, a sharp drop compared to an average of 61,000 tests conducted a day during the week.To be sure, the number of tests usually sees a dip on weekends. There were 42,242 tests according to last Monday’s bulletin, recording a positivity rate of 0.30%. However, the Monday before that (January 15) there were fewer – 39,065 – tests conducted and yet the positivity rate had been 0.36%.“We have to keep a close eye on the numbers. The increasing positivity rate indicates that the disease is spreading faster. However, with a seroprevalence of around 56% I am hoping that the number of infections will remain under control. The current infections might be in areas where some susceptible people remain. But, we need to keep an eye out for re-infections,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“We need to determine whether the current infections are in the susceptible population or is it because of a virus mutation,” said Dr Kishore.“There is a laxity in the Covid-19 norms in Delhi now... This needs to change,” he said.Experts have also called for faster pace of vaccination in areas witnessing an increase in the number of cases. Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences had told HT last week that people in the high-risk groups residing in regions seeing a spurt in infections should be immunised quickly “as it will help in decrease mortality and hospitalisations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/test-positivity-rate-highest-in-45-days-delhi-adds-175-covid-19-cases-101614633787059.html

The FIR was registered at the Jafrabad police station.When contacted, Rehman said, “All the allegations against me are false and baseless as I did not meet the woman (complainant) yesterday (Sunday) or even in the past. Now, that the police have registered a case, I am hopeful that they will do a fair investigation. I am ready to face the punishment if I am found guilty. Else, the person who filed the false complaint or those who are supporting her should be punished.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/firagainst-aap-mla-after-woman-accuses-him-of-molestation-101614633361758.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi school shut for 1 week after student contracts Covid-19||A city school in north Delhi on Monday postponed exams for classes 9 and 11 and closed its campus for a week after a student allegedly tested positive for Covid-19, two days after attending the school.Queen Mary’s School made the announcement after a group of parents protested outside its campus on Monday demanding that the exams -- which were supposed to begin from Tuesday -- be conducted online now.In a message sent to all parents on Monday, the school said, “The school will remain closed for students of classes 9 to 12 from March 2 to March 6, 2021. The students will have to submit their Corona negative report to their class teachers on March 8.”According to parents, a class 11 student, who had attended school on February 24, tested positive for Covid-19 two days later. They also shared a Covid-19 positive report, purportedly that of the student. In a video shared on social media by the parents, the mother of the student, who is believed to have the infection, could be heard saying, “My daughter came to school and there was no social distancing. She is now sick and she is at home….The school has put so many lives at stake. They made 300 children sit in an auditorium.”School principal Ritu P Soloman denied the allegations. “The school is taking all Covid-19 related precautions.” A senior official at the school, who wished not to be named, said, “The school has decided to postpone the exams and close the campus for a week, acting on parents’ request. However, the parents of the student concerned have not officially informed the school about the condition of their child.”“The school has asked students to submit their Covid-19 negative report because that’s the only way to verify their health status in the present scenario. We can’t again take the risk of allowing students to attend school with only an undertaking,” the official added.Parents, however, are still apprehensive about the safety of their children. The mother of a class 9 student, who wished not to be named, said, “The school should either shift the exams to the online mode or postpone them till the situation becomes normal. What difference can they make by closing the campus just for a week?”Aparajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association, said, “We have been repeatedly writing to the Delhi government requesting it to direct private schools to give students the option of giving their exams either online or offline. The government should now take the case of this school into consideration and take a decision.”A senior government official said, “We have not received any information about the Covid positive case at a private school. We will look into the matter. The directions for offline exams for classes 9 and 11 have been issued by the CBSE. Delhi government has no say in it. The Delhi government schools have already announced to conduct exams for these classes in offline mode only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-school-shut-for-1-week-after-student-contracts-covid19-101614632896071.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal distillery busted in Ajnala, 3 women among 8 held with 110 tonne lahan, 1,780 litre liquor||An illicit liquor manufacturing unit was unearthed by the state excise department at Khiala Kalan village in Amritsar district’s Ajnala sub-division in the wee hours of Monday and nearly 110 tonnes of lahan (raw material used for making liquor) and 1,780 litre liquor were recovered from the site. Eight persons, including three women, were arrested, excise department officials said. Besides lahan and liquor, six stills, 62 drums of 200 litre each, 6 LPG cylinders, 31 plastic cans of 100 litre each, 2 water tanks of 500 litre capacity, 2 plastic drums of 50 litre each, 11 plastic cans of 35 litre each and tarpaulins were seized by an excise department team with the help of the police. The incident comes nearly eight months after the state’s worst-ever hooch tragedy claimed more than 130 lives in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts last year. Those arrested were identified as Kuldeep Singh, Satnam Singh, Ravinder Singh, Dharamvir Singh, Harjindersingh, Savinder Kaur, Preeti, Simranjit Kaur, all Khiala Kalan residents. The officials said modern methods of distillation were being used by the bootleggers to produce liquor. Branded yeast, permanent pipeline plumbing systems, and RCC pools were being used for large-scale production of illicit liquor, they said. Deputy commissioner (excise) Jaspinder Singh said, “We have identified six more accused who are absconding. Raids are on to nab them. It is not clear yet as since when this illicit unit was being operated in the village. During the remand of the accused, we will find out whom they were supplying the liquor.”Another excise department official said, “Once we got a tip-off about the illicit liquor manufacturing, a joint raiding party of the excise department, excise police and the Amritsar police was formed. A recce of the area was conducted first. The village was cordoned off during the raid. At least 25 houses were searched and the recoveries were made from 7 houses.” Those involved in the illicit business were supplying the illicit liquor to various villages of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts, he claimed.Hundreds of people were arrested and huge caches of illicit liquor were recovered in the three districts in the wake of the last year’s hooch tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-distillery-busted-in-ajnala-3-women-among-8-held-with-110-tonne-lahan-1-780-litre-liquor-101614632847385.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi citizens express anger as crime spikes||Residents held a protest on Monday in Adarsh Nagar, where a 25-year-old woman was murdered by a snatcher just metres away from her house even as she held her two-year-old daughter was in her arms, complaining about rising crime in the area on a day when the Capital recorded at least four murders, one molestation case, and a shoot-out.The spurt in crimes has renewed calls by some citizens groups for enhanced police patrolling, action against organised gangs, and establishment of police posts at key locations to make the people feel safe.BS Vohra, president of the Joint Forum of East Delhi RWAs, said that law and order situation in the city has gone for a toss. “There is a surge in crimes such as chain snatching, theft, robbery in the city and the police have failed to control them. It is often seen that a police van is parked on one corner of the street while a snatching or robbery takes place on the other corner of the street. Policing should be more strict and more beat constables should be deployed to make streets safer,” Vohra said.General secretary of the Adarsh Nagar Green residents’ welfare association, SN Singhal, who led Monday’s protest, said that over 100 residents of the area gathered at Adarsh Nagar Metro station to protest against the murder of Simran Kaur, 25.Kaur was attacked on Saturday night by a man when she was returning from a local flea market carrying her two-year-old daughter and was accompanied by her mother Mamta Kaur. As the attacker tried to snatch Kaur’s chain, she resisted, during which the man stabbed her. She collapsed in front of her house and later succumbed to the injury at a hospital in Shalimar Bagh.“It could be anybody. The residents of the area are shocked at how criminals are attacking people right in front of their house. During our agitation, we demanded round-the-clock police presence and regular night police patrolling in the area,” Singhal said.DCP (northwest) Usha Rangnani said they were planning to intensify police patrolling in the area, especially at night. “We are also planning a dedicated crackdown on street crimes like snatching and robberies across northwest district. Pickets are being raised to check vehicles and keep a watch on anti-social elements. It is an unfortunate incident and efforts are being made to make police presence more visible in the area,” said the DCP, who has recently taken over the charge of northwest district.Meanwhile, a 42-year-old man was killed in outer Delhi’s Nangloi on Monday following an ongoing enmity over meat supplying business, police said. To avenge the killing, the deceased’s associates gunned down the killer’s brother-in-law who runs a meat shop in the same area. More than 10 rounds were fired, and both the men were shot at least four times, police said on Monday. Additional deputy commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama said multiple teams have been formed and efforts to arrest the remaining accused was underway.In the third murder case, a 21-year-old man died while his two friends suffered stab wounds after two men assaulted them and attacked them with a knife following an altercation near Delhi Gate in central Delhi on Sunday night, police said. Both the alleged attackers were arrested on Monday morning and the weapon used in the crime was recovered from them.The fourth murder was reported from south-west Delhi’s Pratap Garden area in Bindapur on Sunday night. Police said a 30-year-old man died and his brother sustained injuries when they were stabbed for allegedly objecting to a rash driving by a biker.The police also arrested a civil defence volunteer for allegedly molesting and threatening a woman in South Delhi’s Sangam Vihar. The man also attacked a police constable with a brick when a police team was sent to arrest him.Commenting on the spate of crimes, Delhi police spokesperson, DCP Chinmoy Biswal said in all these cases immediate police action was taken followed by arrests.“Controlling crime is Delhi Police’s priority and all efforts are being for the safety of citizens. At times, there is a sudden spurt in incidents, but we rise to the challenge and get on top of the situation. Adequate measures are being taken to curb street crime,” Biswal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-citizens-express-anger-as-crime-spikes-101614632511457.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||‘Media leaks need to be controlled to keep probe fair’: Delhi HC slams Police||The Delhi high court on Monday observed that media leaks need to be controlled to “ensure fairness to the accused, investigation agency and purity of trial” while slamming the Delhi Police for their half-baked vigilance enquiry to ascertain how the disclosure statement of Asif Iqbal Tanha, an accused in the north-east Delhi riots, was leaked to the media.Justice Mukta Gupta, while hearing a plea by Tanha seeking action against the errant police officials, said the enquiry was even worse than what was done in a petty theft case.Advocate Amit Mahajan, special public prosecutor in the north-east Delhi riots for the police, told the court that leak was “undesirable” and should not have happened. He said that whenever action is taken against any of the media houses, they start running a campaign against it.To this, the court said, “Yes it is undesirable, but this needs to be controlled to ensure fairness to the accused, investigation agency and purity of trial”.“You have to find the errant person. You cannot shrug the responsibility off your shoulders,” the court said.Justice Gupta also asked the special commissioner of police, vigilance, to be in court on March 5, the next hearing date.In his petition, Tanha said he was aggrieved by various publications reporting that he has confessed to orchestrating the Delhi riots and alleged that he was coerced to sign certain papers in the effective custody of police. Tanha said this information does not have any evidentiary value and alleged that the Delhi Police officials, with mala fide intent, leaked statements to the media to prejudice his case.During the hearing on Monday, the court said that the allegations of police leaking the information were substantiated and it has to just find out who leaked it. The court cautioned that harsher orders will be passed if the police fail to do so.“It is a case of theft of your documents. It’s a case of sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and anything that goes out of your hand illegally, you have to take action. Your document was not with anyone except for senior IAS officers. This is nothing but a half-baked vigilance enquiry without any application of mind,” Justice Gupta said.When Mahajan told the court that the document had been sent only to the home ministry and the Delhi government and even they are aggrieved with the leak, the court said, “Mind you, these are senior IAS officers. Where did you do the enquiry, who did you enquire of? Where were the files sent? Who took them to MHA and Delhi government and who brought them back from there? These are not documents lying on the road…..and amazingly, if these were lying on the road, the journalist is confident that these are those very original copies”.Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was arrested in May last year in connection to the conspiracy in the north-east Delhi riots cases. He was arrested in connection with the violence in the Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019.The police had said Tanha was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against CAA.On Monday, advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, appearing for Tanha, pointed to the police’s status report along with the vigilance enquiry report highlighting that the cause of leak or the person has not been substantiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/media-leaks-need-to-be-controlled-to-keep-probe-fair-delhi-hc-slams-police-101614632057235.html
02-03-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Over 6,100 in Delhi get jabs on 1st day of expanded drive||Enthused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking the Covid-19 vaccine shot from the All India Institute of Medical Science on Monday, nearly 6,200 persons over the age of 60 years or with co-morbidities took the jab on Day One of the inoculation drive being opened to the general population across 308 vaccination sites in the national capital.After receiving the made in India Covaxin, administered by health worker P Niveda, Modi tweeted, “Took my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against Covid-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India Covid-19 free!”Dr Jitendra Singh, minister of state for the Prime Minister’s office, was also administered the vaccine at the hospital.On the day when registrations had started on the Co-WIN 2.0 portal, 5,176 people over the age of 60 years received the vaccine. There were 1,009 people over the age of 45 with one of the 30 listed co-morbidities who also received their first dose of the vaccine on Monday.Only 4,296 front-line workers received the vaccine on Monday, bringing to a close the vaccination drive for the second priority group. A total of 1,954 health-care workers, the first priority group, also took the shot on Monday.“With the closing of the previous Co-WIN portal, the vaccination drive came to an end for health-care and front-line workers. That does not mean they will not be able to get the vaccine, but they will have to register themselves on CoWIN 2.0 and book a slot just like others from the general population,” said a senior district official.At the outset of the vaccination drive, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said, “The registration for the vaccination is simple. It can be done by self on the Co-WIN app. At the moment, we should not go towards on-site vaccination as there are too many people left to be vaccinated. So, this will make the process tough. We will do it slowly and steadily so that everyone gets a slot.”The 308 vaccination sites are located in 192 hospitals across the city – 136 private hospitals that can charge up to ₹250 for each jab and 56 government hospitals where the shot will be administered for free.At Max Super Speciality Hospital in Patparganj, 220 persons were vaccinated on Monday. According to hospital officials, the vaccination drive started late due to technical issues in the Co-WIN app. “Many people complained that they faced issues while registering on the app. The matter was resolved by noon and we managed to give jabs to over 100 persons (the daily quota) by 2:30pm itself,” the official said.Among those who got a jab at the hospital on was Archana Kaupur, 61, a resident of Kaushambi in Ghaziabad. “My husband and I were looking forward to getting vaccinated. We registered ourselves on the app early in the morning and reached here to complete the payment. We are more confident about the vaccine now that we saw Modi ji getting the jab,” she said.Many chose the online mode of payment to make the process quick at the hospital. Ayachi Gupta, a resident of Indirapuram, who took his parents for vaccination, said, “I called the customer care to check if online mode of payment was available. I received a link on my registered email ID for the purpose. This was helpful as the queue outside the payment counter was long.”Across Max hospitals, 770 people received the jab on Monday. “The enthusiasm among people for the vaccination was only too palpable. With a considerable high number of people (turning up), we are sure that overall, people are extremely positive about getting vaccinated,” said a statement from Max healthcare.An official from East district, where the hospital is located, said, “There were two takeaways from the drive today. One, people are enthusiastic. Two, the new software is much better than the previous one; it did not crash despite so many people getting registered.”At Lok Nayak hospital only 10 could get jabs on Monday.“There were some teething issues. We faced problems in the Co-WIN app — it was either not generating the OTP or was crashing too often. We expect more people to get the jabs from Tuesday as the system has been streamlined to some extent,” said a senior official of the hospital on condition of anonymity.As per the hospital records, the facility gave the first dose of the Covishield vaccine to eight senior citizens and two persons above the age of 45 years with comorbidities.(with inputs from Anonna Dutt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-over-6-100-in-delhi-get-jabs-on-1st-day-of-expanded-drive-101614631696787.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Covid vaccination for senior citizens starts on tardy note across J&K||Coronavirus vaccinations for senior citizens started on a tardy note in Jammu and Kashmir as health authorities, who were earlier supposed to start vaccinations from March 7, were caught off guard when they were asked to start the process on Monday. Senior citizens had reached Gandhi Nagar Government Hospital and Sarwal Government Hospital to get the vaccine. However, after the Centre’s directive the health authorities in Jammu and Kashmir started vaccinating senior citizens. Financial commissioner health and medical education Atal Dulloo said, “Earlier, it was decided that vaccination for the senior citizens will start from March 7 but then we received a message and mobilised our staff and started vaccination for senior citizens across the UT.” Dulloo said the process will be smoother from Tuesday. Government Hospital Sarwal medical superintendent Dr Harbaksh Singh said, “On the first day,120 persons were inoculated with Covishield vaccine, of which 80 were senior citizens. No side effects were observed.” In the second phase, senior citizens above 60 years of age and those with comorbidities between 45 to 59 years were required to get registered by producing any photo voter identity card, pan cards, driving license and Aadhaar Card. A septuagenarian Chaman Lal Raina, who received the first jab, said he was fine and had suffered no side effects. “I am fine. I had no health conditions. Somebody informed me that vaccinations were taking place and I came here to get inoculated. The hospital authorities were well prepared and were adhering to social distancing and other norms,” said Raina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccination-for-senior-citizens-starts-on-tardy-note-across-jk-101614631285913.html

The inspections for this competition are held in the month of March across the country. The third party, which has been roped in for the inspections, is expected to reach Ludhiana this week.Cities are ranked on various criteria, including segregated collection, processing and disposal of waste and sustainable sanitation (2,400 marks), garbage-free city (6,000 marks) and ODF status (1,800 marks). Similarly, 30% marks (1, 800 marks) is also reserved for citizen’s feedback, engagement, experience, swachhta app and innovation. After the dismal performance in Swachh Survekshan 2020, wherein the city was ranked at the 34th position out of 47 cities with over 10 lakh population, the civic body has been working hard to improve its ranking. However, different projects mooted to deal with legacy waste have been hanging fire for years and waste segregation has also not been achieved in many parts of the city.The MC has also failed to come up with a waste plant for treating construction and demolition waste.Adding to the woes of the civic body, A2Z company left the work in the city on February 4 after serving a self-termination notice. The MC is yet to sign a contract with a new firm and has made stop-gap arrangements by signing an agreement with a third party to whom A2Z had sublet the work of lifting garbage from the city. As A2Z company was running the refuse derived fuel (RDF) plant to dispose of the fresh garbage generated on a daily basis, the plant has come to a halt and over 100 metric tonnes of garbage is being accumulated at the site in addition to over 16 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste that has accumulated over the last decade or so. The MC is also yet to install static compactors under the smart city mission and there are over 40 open secondary dump sites in the city where the garbage is discarded by household waste collectors. The Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) had however installed compactors at Sarabha Nagar (Block J), Hambran road and Rishi Nagar among a few other areas.MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that the MC is working to rope in a new contractor for solid waste management and tenders will be floated soon. “The legacy waste will also be disposed off. Waste segregation is being at most parts of the city and MC staff, including the senior officials, are on ground to keep a check on the same. Challans are also being issued to the violators especially those polluting Buddha Nullah. All efforts are being made to improve the rankings under Swachh Survekshan 2021.”MC makes last-ditch effortsWith Swachch Survekshan inspections drawing near, the civic body is making last-ditch efforts to improve its scores. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal conducted a meeting with the officials of MC’s health branch at Zone A office on Monday and directed officials to regularly check the attendance of sweepers and sewermen. Further, it was also decided to hold ‘swachhta’ activities every Sunday and conduct competitions like ‘Main bhi hoon Swachhta Superstar’. Sanitary inspector and chief sanitary inspectors have also been deployed to ensure that only segregated waste is collected from houses and dumped at secondary dumping sites. Sabharwal said that apart from conducting competitions between the residents’ welfare associations and youth clubs, the MC will also be appointing brand ambassadors under Swachh Bharat mission. Demonstrations will also be done to promote home compositing. MC will also be issuing challans for failure to segregate waste, indulging in littering, use and sale of plastic carry bags among other violations. The amount of challan may range from ₹250 to ₹5, 000, depending on the category of property and violation done by the owner. A challan of ₹250 will be issued to residents if they fail to hand over segregated waste to the waste collector. Challans upto ₹20, 000 will be issued on sale of plastic carry bags and for burning garbage, challans upto ₹25, 000 will be imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-legacy-waste-to-affect-it-s-rankings-in-swachh-survekshan-101614631284831.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Prashant Kishor returns as Capt’s principal adviser with cabinet rank||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday appointed political strategist Prashant Kishor, or ‘PK’ as he is often called in political circles, who has scripted several successful electoral campaigns, as his principal adviser with cabinet rank. The election consultant’s appointment in the chief minister’s office (CMO) was announced by Amarinder himself on social media. “Happy to share that @PrashantKishor has joined me as my principal advisor. Look forward to working together for the betterment of people of Punjab!” he tweeted. The announcement came after months of speculation that began in the first half of 2020 when the chief minister had indicated to some party leaders and MLAs his intention to engage Kishor for the assembly elections. The state unit has already announced that Amarinder will lead the party in next year’s polls. The political strategist, who has been appointed in the rank and status of a cabinet minister, will be paid a token honorarium of ₹1 per month. However, he will be entitled to a fully-furnished government residence and camp office, executive class travel, official vehicle, medical facilities and secretarial staff as admissible to a cabinet minister, according to an official order on the terms and conditions of his appointment that was released by the state government on social media. The chief minister’s principal adviser has also been allowed expenditure up to ₹5,000 per month on hospitality. His term will be co-terminus with the tenure of the present chief minister, reads the order issued by principal secretary, general administration, Vivek Pratap Singh. Kishor will advise the chief minister on draft development policies and strategies with an eye on the state polls. The political strategist was adviser to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar with cabinet rank earlier before the two fell out in January 2020. Kishor and his agency, the Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), had worked with the Congress in Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls with Amarinder as the state unit chief. He was also the brain behind the ‘Coffee with Captain’ and ‘Punjab da Captain’ that had worked well for the party and the CM-face. Amarinder, who led the Congress to victory, had tweeted, “PK & his team and their work was absolutely critical to our victory in Punjab!” Though there is talk that I-PAC will also start working with the Punjab Congress once the assembly polls in West Bengal where Kishor is guiding chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress get over, state unit chief Sunil Jakhar said he has learnt about Kishor’s appointment just a short while ago. “There has no discussion on engaging the agency so far,” he said. Kishor and his advocacy group have also worked with the BJP, YSR Congress and the AAP in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prashant-kishor-returns-as-capt-s-principal-adviser-with-cabinet-rank-101614630624577.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Alignment on cards to bump up speed on Kalka-Shimla track||The railways is planning to realign the Shimla-Kalka narrow gauge track, a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNSECO) world heritage site, to accelerate the speed of the trains, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday. The Union minister, who is on a tour to Himachal to review ongoing and proposed railway projects in Himachal, said efforts were being made to boost the speed of trains running on this track. At present, it takes trains around five-and-a-half hours to cover a 96.6km journey between Shimla and Kalka. “Efforts are made to increase the speed from the exiting 25 kmph but it has not be achieved so far becaused of a steep gradient and sharp curves,” said the Union minister adding that the railways would soon conduct a survey to realign the track. Railway authorities have been directed to replace old coaches, which will enhance the tourist experience, he said, adding two ‘hop in-hop off’ coaches will be added on the track. Survey for rail track between Paonta Sahib-Jagadhri The railways minister said a a fresh survey will be undertaken for a proposed railway line to be laid between Poanta Sahib and Jagadhri. The survey will be conducted with a focus on freight expected from the industrial area in Paonta Sahib and a study would be conducted by RDSO to examine if the Kalka-Shimla track could be strengthened to improve the speed of trains plying on this track. This was decided in a meeting held between Union railways minister Piyush Goyal and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur. Goyal said budget on infrastructure and other railway services in Himachal had been increased from ₹108 crore in 2009- 2014 to ₹280 crore in 2014 – 2019. A provision of ₹770 crore has been made in the 2021-22 budget for different projects, a 613% increase as compared to 2014-19, he said. The chief minister said that coaches of the Kalka-Shimla Railway should be designed and manufactured to enhance the tourism experience. He also urged the minister to provide vista-dome type coaches so that the tourists can get a panoramic view of the beautiful valleys along the route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alignment-on-cards-to-bump-up-speed-on-kalka-shimla-track-101614629725394.html

02-03-2021||Other||‘Building a health care staff pool was Maharashtra’s biggest challenge’||Ajoy Mehta, Maharashtra’s principal advisor on Covid-19 from June 2020 to February 2021, speaks about how the state dealt with its greatest ever crisis MUMBAI Soon after Maharashtra’s first two Covid-19 cases were detected on March 9, 2020, the state began surpassing others in both cumulative cases and deaths. By May 2020, it became evident that it would require a gargantuan effort from the state to put the brakes on what was described as the crisis of the century. In May 2019, Ajoy Mehta, a 1984 batch IAS officer and former Mumbai municipal commissioner, was appointed the state’s chief secretary. In June 2020, Mehta was due to retire, but, by then, had earned enough trust with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to be appointed his principal advisor on all matters Covid, a post he occupied until February 10 this year. This month, Maharashtra observes its first Covid-case anniversary. Mehta candidly admits it was his toughest year as an administrator; even though, he says, the state’s bureaucratic and medical machinery looked indefatigable and was never short on motivation. In an interview, Mehta, among other key issues, speaks how Mumbai needs to learn from this experience and create better housing and public transport facilities for its residents to ensure the next medical emergency is dealt with quickly and effectively. How effectively did the state machinery handle the Covid-19 crisis? It was handled with firmness and honesty. We were not shaken or unnerved, but yes, we were not certain of the direction it was heading. The infection was new. Nobody knew how it would behave. We were quick to learn as we went along. We took some bold decisions that other Indian states quickly followed. What were those decisions? Maharashtra was the first state to admit discrepancies in reporting Covid-19 deaths. We undertook a massive reconciliation exercise. We faced flak, but we stood by our decision. In all our meetings, the chief minister repeatedly said we should report the right numbers; otherwise, we will never find solutions to the crisis. We were also the first state to take control of 80% of the beds in private hospitals, in spite of stiff opposition from the sector. We took over private premises and set up jumbo facilities. We offered a universal scheme through the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (a state-sponsored health insurance scheme). Maharashtra instituted a medical task force comprising private and government healthcare experts to create a treatment protocol. We were the first to set up a death audit committee. We decided to give personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to small clinics as many were shut causing stress to non-Covid patients. During the migrant workers crisis, we had housed more than half a million citizens in our camps where we served them three meals a day. To serve 1.5 million meals a day is no small task. What were the challenges in building healthcare facilities in Mumbai and the rest of the state? The biggest challenge was to build a pool of experienced healthcare staff. Here, the medical workforce should be given a lot of credit. They forgot their eight-hour shifts. They left their families and stayed in makeshift arrangements. They really came forward. Our next challenge was to set up physical infrastructure – beds, ventilators and oxygen facilities. We created anywhere between 100,000 and 150,000 oxygen beds in a short span. We did not have an adequate number of ambulances in Mumbai, so we converted BEST buses into ambulances. Dialysis for kidney patients had become a parallel crisis, so we set up a new protocol and opened a chain of dialysis centres. The administration had to change its way of working since physical meetings were not possible. How was that challenge met, given the scale of the crisis? Maharashtra’s bureaucracy has been responsive during disasters. Whether it be the earthquake in Latur (1993), the floods (2005 and 2019), or the drought (an ongoing crisis), we have handled it. But these were known adversities. We knew how to deal with them. This (Covid-19) was a disaster we knew nothing about, and the very people who treat others were exposed to danger. Motivation, however, was never a challenge; it was about giving direction. In fact, many IAS officers went beyond their call of duty. The CM also decided that each officer should handle a vertical – data management, camps for migrant workers, train movement, NGO assistance, stocking up on essentials, everyone was handling a key part. Since you mention IAS officers, you received flak for replacing the Mumbai municipal commissioner (Praveen Pardeshi was replaced by IS Chahal in May 2020) at a crucial juncture. You also replaced the municipal commissioners in the Mumbai metropolitan region. Your comment? No comment. Just when the state was hitting a peak in the middle of 2020, there was a point when low availability of beds and ventilators had become a major issue. How did the state tackle it?Several hospitals did not accept Covid patients, even if there were beds. Patients were moved from one hospital to another and, unfortunately, some even died in the ambulances. We came down heavily on this by passing an order stating no patient can be denied treatment if he or she arrives at a hospital. We sent auditors to every hospital to check bed availability. Owing to the caseload in Mumbai, we also asked IAS officers to handle hospitals. The jumbo facilities helped a lot in solving these issues. Cases in both Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra are increasing again. Why do you think this is happening? Do we need restrictions again? It will not be correct for me to say what the government should be doing now (Mehta is currently the chairman of Maharera, the state’s real estate regulator). However, having worked with this government, I can tell you that the decision-making is prudent and accurate. The state reports cases honestly and that should continue. What do you think is the reason for increasing number of cases? It’s not just Maharashtra. If you look globally, at some point countries such as the UK, Israel, just about everyone said it’s over. Everything opened up. However, it’s back to square one now. The very nature of the virus is that it comes in surges. The only thing I would say is please be cautious, don’t do away with your masks, continue to wash your hands frequently and maintain social distancing. You have been the municipal commissioner of Mumbai. What are the lessons to be learned from an urban planning point of view? Mumbai needs to sort its housing issue. We need good quality housing with hygienic facilities. We have to also improve our public transport. With Covid, public transport became a super-spreader. We had to shut trains and buses, which knocked off Mumbai. We need to sort this (transport). What do you think are the major vaccination challenges? Most challenges seem to have been sorted. Initially, there was vaccine hesitancy. It seems to have gone now, and the software concerns (of the Co-WIN app) have been resolved. Even the issues of cold chain facilities in rural areas seem to be have been sorted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/building-a-health-care-staff-pool-was-maharashtra-s-biggest-challenge-101614629664124.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Tales of pandemic: Each day was a blur, says matron of BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai||For 52-year-old Rucha Salgaonkar, who was assigned the post of matron at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central in March 2020, the first assignment was to prepare a Covid ward. “Our dean asked me to prepare 40 beds in a separate ward for Covid patients. Within two days the entire hospital was declared a Covid-care zone and overnight everything changed,” said Salgaonkar, who heads a team of 680 nurses at the hospital. Soon, Salgaonkar and her team were working 12-hour shifts administering continuous care for patients and staff as well; they got their first weekly off only four months later. It started with an average of two patients every day in March. By April-end, approximately 240 patients were being admitted every day, and a Super Specialty Out-patient Department (OPD) was set up in a make-shift tent. “At its peak, in the months of May and June, on an average we were admitting anywhere between 500 to 680 patients every day. “Our 1600-bed hospital was converted into a 1043-bed hospital after following social distancing norms. Each day was a blur of tending to the needs of everyone admitted,” Salgaonkar said. “We had to set up an ambulance bay and make sure beds were ready immediately so that patients could undergo a quick check-up and get admitted without any hassle. We had to ensure that we were not falling short of oxygen and other essential supplies at all times,” she said. Salgaonkar, who lives in Haji Ali, which is close to her workplace, refused to take up accommodation in the hospital’s hostel and chose to live with her family comprising her husband, a BMC employee, and two daughters. “My husband and daughters were very supportive and for months together, my older daughter would buy the groceries and cook dinner while my husband and younger daughter would keep my clothes ready so the minute I entered my home, I would bathe,” she said. Each day brought with it a new set of challenges, and Salgaonkar said with some measure of pride that the staff worked in tandem to come up with solutions. For instance, nurses had a tough time working in PPE gear during the peak summer months with little or no access to air conditioning in the municipal hospital. “We were spending hours in PPE and by the time we got out of it, we were drenched in sweat. I therefore made it a point to ensure that a nurse does not spend more than six hours in the PPE kit, and rest of the time managed with basic protective gear including gloves, masks and face gear,” Salgaonkar said. Nair Hospital continued to cater to non-Covid patients through the pandemic, and on August 15, the hospital started operations of non-Covid wards. “It took almost five months of continuous work and in mid-August we finally opened the doors for non-Covid patients. So the work doubled, but we had all hands on deck all the time,” she said. Second and third year nursing students began to undergo counseling following which they started providing counseling to Covid patients to help them alleviate their stress and anxiety. The staff members too required counseling on a regular basis, as they were witnessing the suffering and death caused by a pandemic, for the first time themselves. A special public notice system was formulated by so that relatives would get regular updates on their family members admitted in the hospital, as they were not allowed to meet in person. The hospital also managed over 830 deliveries of Covid-19 positive mothers. The incident that left a lasting impression on Salgaonkar’s mind however was when she lost a pregnant patient. “At the peak of the pandemic, we lost an eight-month pregnant mother and her baby to Covid, despite all the medical care we gave. We were as heartbroken as the family but there was no time to grieve because we had to ensure the next patient lived to see another day,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tales-of-pandemic-each-day-was-a-blur-says-matron-of-byl-nair-hospital-mumbai-101614629304669.html
02-03-2021||Other||Maharashtra did well in handling Covid-19 pandemic: Governor in address to legislature||Amid the tussle between ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and principal Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, in an address to the joint session of the state legislature on Monday, praised the Uddhav Thackeray government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and said its measures have become a model for the country and the world. Lauding the state government on its Covid-19 response, Koshyari said, “My government took several measures for the control and management of the Covid-19 pandemic which have become a model for the rest of the states and even other countries. Maharashtra has most effectively managed the epidemic by bringing down the number of active cases and successfully dealing with difficult settlements such as Dharavi.” The Governor also said that the state is yet to get goods and services tax (GST) dues worth ₹29,290 crore from the Centre. He pointed out that despite a significant drop in the revenue and delay in getting GST compensation dues, the state government has provided “priority funding” to health, medical education, relief and rehabilitation, food and civil supplies, and home departments during the pandemic. Out of the ₹46,950 -crore worth of dues to the state government as GST compensation, the Centre has paid only ₹6,140 crore, while ₹11,520 crore has been given as loan for GST compensation. Koshyari’s speech, which reflects state government’s plan for the year, set the tone for the 10-day budget session that is expected to witness a face-off between MVA and BJP, which also sparred over the Vidarbha and Marathwada statutory development boards and the approval of the 12 upper house members to be appointed by the Governor. The tenure of the development boards, which were created by a Presidential Order in 1994 to help remove regional imbalance, had ended last April, and the state has not formed the board since then. These boards are responsible not to the legislature, but to the Governor, who exercises direct control over them. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said that the boards will be formed immediately after the names of 12 Members of Legislative Council (MLCs) to be appointed from Governor’s quota are approved. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis condemned Pawar’s comments and accused MVA government of holding Vidarbha and Marathwada to ransom over the appointment of 12 MLCs, whose names were sent to Koshyari in November last year. Fadnavis asked what have the people of the two regions got to do if the names are not being cleared. “It’s between you and the Governor, who is not of any party but an authority... I thank Pawar for saying what he had in his mind. You have held Vidarbha and Marathwada to ransom for 12 MLCs. How much politics are you going to play?” said Fadnavis. During his address, Koshyari also said that the Maharashtra government will continue its strong stance on the border dispute with Karnataka. “My government has strongly presented Maharashtra’s case in the original suit filed in the Supreme Court on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute and henceforth, will continue to present the same. My government expresses its commitment to the Marathi -speaking people of the border areas and is committed to get them justice,” Governor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-did-well-in-handling-covid-19-pandemic-governor-in-address-to-legislature-101614629125870.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Tales of pandemic: Worked 5 days in a row, says 108 ambulance driver||Atik Khan, 43, an ambulance driver with 108 ambulance service operated by the Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services (MEMS), was on a night shift when the national lockdown was declared on March 24, 2020. His partner who was supposed to relieve him from duty the next day couldn’t, as all modes of transportation had come to a standstill. For the next five days, Khan worked 24x7 ferrying suspected and confirmed Covid-19 infected patients to hospitals. With shops and restaurants closed, he recalled knocking on strangers’ doors requesting for food and water. Khan, together with 200 other 108 service ambulance drivers, were put on Covid duty.“I was stationed at Churchgate station. When the lockdown was declared, all roadside food stalls where we would have our meals closed down overnight. We were struggling to find even a glass of water. All the while, I kept responding to emergency calls, even from Borivli which is 40 kilometres away,” he said. “Due to the rush, we had to ask patients to wait sometimes for up to an hour.” The lockdown had brought the city to a grinding halt, and private vehicles were not allowed to move. So ambulance staffers also had to carry bodies to cremation grounds. “This doubled our work pressure,” he said. One evening, a hungry and exhausted Khan knocked on the doors of a few Cuffe Parade residents seeking food. One family offered him and other fellow ambulance staffers food. “We asked them to give us food in plastic bags as it would have been risky to enter anyone’s house then. I will always remain thankful to the family for feeding us,” he said. On March 30, when he finally returned to his flat in Govandi, he was worried that he may infect his wife and three children. “I was directly handling the infected patients while ferrying them. Though I always wore personal protective equipment (PPE), I was still scared of infecting my family. So, even before entering the house, I took a bath with hot water on the road outside our house,” he said. Eventually, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and other non-government organizations began to organise food for frontline workers like ambulance workers. A year later, Khan waits outside the Lokmanya Tilak General also known (Sion hospital) where his 11-year-old son is undergoing treatment after meeting with an accident. Khan hasn’t been able to go on duty for over a month. “I have worked tirelessly in the pandemic. But no one from my office has come to meet my son in the hospital, nor have I received my salary for February,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tales-of-pandemic-worked-5-days-in-a-row-says-108-ambulance-driver-101614629124610.html

It had sought ₹29,084 crore and ₹21,992 crore as supplementary demand during last year’s monsoon and winter session, respectively. With the fresh supplementary demands of ₹21,076 crore, the sum of additional expenses over and above budgetary provision will go up to ₹72,152 crore. Maharashtra was reeling under acute financial crisis owing to the months-long lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus last year. “It has been decided to provide an additional fund of ₹16,200 crore to repay the advances taken under the special drawing facility. Hence, a supplementary appropriation of ₹16,200 crore is proposed,” states supplementary statement of expenditure 2020-21 tabled by the deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar in the state assembly on Monday. “The state had taken a loan of around ₹76,000 crore last year.

The state has also sought ₹561.13 crore for subsidies given to farmers in power bills for agricultural pumps. “It has been decided to provide an additional fund of ₹1,866 crore for the expenditure incurred on concessions given in electricity tariff for agricultural pumps consumers of the state, which is to be adjusted against electricity duty and tax on sale of electricity to be received from the MSEDCL. An expenditure of ₹1,304 crore can be accommodated within the sanctioned grants for the current financial year. Therefore, a supplementary demand of ₹561.13 crore is presented,” states the finance department document. Further, the state has allocated ₹400 crore for various irrigation development corporations for completing various irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and Baliraja Sanjeevani Yojana and ₹242.25 crore for providing relief to those affected due to Cyclone Nisarga hit Konkan region last June.

02-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees slight dip in Covid cases with 6,000 new ones||While battling glitches on the CoWIN app, 4,723 members of the general public received the first shot of the vaccine on Monday. The state also saw the number of new cases of Covid-19 fall to the 6,000 range after hovering above 8,000 for the past five days. Of the total 27,115 people who were inoculated on Monday, 3,777 were citizens above the age of 60 while 946 were between 45 to 60 years with comorbidities. The remaining beneficiaries were healthcare (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs). The total number of beneficiaries who have received vaccines till now stands at 1,228,211 of which 218,170 are from Mumbai.Citizens said the process of registering on Co-Win was fraught with difficulty. “I started early morning and registration itself was an issue as it was showing there was a problem on the server. After 30 minutes, I was able to register, but they did not allow me to schedule an appointment,” said Parel resident Srikrishna Joshi, who is 64 years old. Officials admitted to technical glitches and said the app was expected to function properly in coming days. Maharashtra recorded 6,397 new cases of Covid-19 and 30 deaths, marking a fall from Sunday’s tally of 8,293 new cases and 62 deaths. Mumbai also saw fewer cases with 855 new cases on Monday compared to 1,051 on Sunday. In the last 24 hours, 61,746 tests have conducted compared to 84,794 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours. State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate said, “Since it was Sunday, when less tests are conducted, we had fewer patients. However, the number has stabilised in the last five days.” After 6,218 new cases last Tuesday, Maharashtra had seen a significant rise in numbers with daily tallies increasing last week on Wednesday (8,807), Thursday (8,702), Friday (8,333) and Saturday (8,623).

02-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC vacates stay on GR restraining hike in school fees amid pandemic||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday vacated the stay on the government resolution (GR) that restrained schools from hiking fees for the academic year of 2020-21 in view of the pandemic. However, the court has said the state may initiate action against a school in case of complaints from parents or even take suo motu action in case of alleged exploitation by a school. The hearing in the case has gone on for almost four months. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing petitions filed by various private unaided schools which challenged the GR of May 8, 2020. According to the GR, schools were not allowed to raise their fees in light of the pandemic and schools were to refrain from taking coercive action (like expulsion or not being allowed to attend classes) against students whose parents were unable to pay the fees. Senior counsels and advocates representing the schools argued the GR was unconstitutional and that the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) (MEIR) Act had enough provisions to restrain schools from hiking fees. Representing the state, senior counsel Anil Anturkar justified the GR, pointing to the extraordinary circumstances and disaster management Acts being invoked across the country as parents had lost their jobs. On Monday, the bench declared the GR was “only prospective in nature and cannot apply to schools which have already fixed/ declared their fee for Academic Year 2020-21 and/or where such fees are duly accepted in terms of the MEIR Act as amended and/or has been acted upon before the Resolution dated 8th May 2020.” The court did not pass orders on the question of the constitutional validity of the GR and reiterated that parents had to pay the fees. The bench also directed the state to address complaints of parents or take suo moto action against schools that violated the MEIR Act. It also restrained schools from taking coercive action against students whose parents had lodged complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-vacates-stay-on-gr-restraining-hike-in-school-fees-amid-pandemic-101614628164891.html
02-03-2021||Other||South Mumbai murder: Domestic help, his friend held||Worli police have claimed to solve the case of murder of a 77-year-old resident within 48 hours of the crime and have arrested the victim’s domestic help and his friend, who were missing since the incident. The police have also recovered valuables, allegedly robbed by the accused. The accused – Amarjeet Nishad and Abhijeet Zoriya – both aged 22, hail from Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur, police officers said. Nishad had been employed at the two-storey bungalow Prasana Kutir at Worli sea face at the home of the victim Vishni Dolwani. On Thursday late night, Dolwani was watching television on the ground floor, while her husband was sleeping in the first-floor room. Her son and his family were on the second floor. The two accused had tied the Dolwani’s hands and legs and also gagged her with a piece of cloth, and tightly covered her face with a dupatta to rob valuables from the house. While they had fled with her gold bangles and a watch, collectively worth around ₹4 lakh, the 77-year-old died of suffocation. Around 12.30am, Dolwani’s son Pankaj realised what had happened and informed the police. “Nishad was the prime suspect from day one, as he was absconding after the incident. Multiple police teams put in co-ordinated efforts and Nishad and Zoriya, who worked as a domestic help for a Malabar Hill family, were arrested on Monday,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone 3) Paramjit Singh Dahiya. The police have refused to disclose the location from where the accused were arrested. After committing the crime, the accused had decided to move to Kolkata and settle there with the help of the looted booty, said a police officer. The two accused had also robbed diamond jewellery from the safe vault on the first floor. “The exact value of the recovered jewellery is being evaluated,” said Dahiya. During interrogation, the duo told the police that they had no intention to kill Dolwani. They gagged her mouth and covered her face to ensure that she did not scream for help. The police, however, said they do not buy the claims made by the duo and are likely to charge them for murder and robbery. Nishad and Zoriya will be produced in court on Tuesday, said Dahiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-mumbai-murder-domestic-help-his-friend-held-101614628163839.html

The monastery, which was exile home to spiritual leader 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje before he shifted to US two years ago, has been declared a containment zone since February 25, when the first infections were reported. All the infected monks have been home isolated The monastery is home to 350 monks and staff. Meanwhile in the wake of the spike, the health department has put district authorities and medical colleges on the alert. Officials have been instructed to increase sampling and chief medical officers are to report to state authorities on a daily basis. With schools, colleges and other educational institutions opening across the state, there is a possibility that the case count may further increase. The state on Monday recorded 132 new infections taking the state’s tally to 58,777 while the death toll reached 983 after one more patient succumbed to the contagion. Of the new cases, 108 cases were reported in Kangra, of which 98 were Buddhist monks of Gyuto Monastery. Six cases have been reported in Shimla, five in Una, four in Chamba, three in Kullu, two each in Bilaspur and Solan and one each in Mandi and Sirmaur. SPIKE IN ACTIVE CASES The surge in fresh cases has also led to a corresponding increase in the number of active cases, which have reached 434. The number was down to 227 on February 22, indicating a 92% increase in cases in one week. At present, Kangra is the worst affected with 219 active cases followed by 58 in Shimla, 36 in Solan and 33 in Sirmaur. Health secretary Amitabh Awasthi attributes the rise to people lowering precautions and not wearing masks. They are also not following social distancing norms. “We have asked medical college authorities and the chief medical officers to be cautious. The number of infection is also increasing in neighbouring states, which may also affect Himachal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-infections-in-himachal-see-168-increase-in-a-week-101614628103943.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination phase 3: 1,982 get a shot at safety in Mumbai||On first day of the third phase of the vaccination drive, 1,982 citizens were vaccinated on Monday. Of these, 260 were between the ages of 45 and 59 years, with comorbidities, while 1,722 were senior citizens and above 60 years old. Vaccination for citizens was started at five civic-run hospitals and three private hospitals on Monday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has selected the jumbo centres in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Mulund, Goregaon and Dahisar to administer vaccines to the public along with Seven Hills Hospital in Marol. These five centres will provide vaccines free of cost while private hospitals are allowed to charge ₹250 per dose. With technical glitches on the centralised app Co-Win, which is monitoring the nationwide vaccination drive, hundreds of hopefuls experienced long waiting hours on Monday. Many could not register and after long waits were informed they could not be vaccinated on Monday. Crowding was reported at the vaccination centres where senior citizens are being inoculated as many showed up at the centre when they were unable to register on the app. Worli resident Salil Worlikar said, “I took my father to get vaccinated, but the hospital took the registration and said they will contact us with an appointment. I had tried to self-register using the Co-Win portal, but did not get any slot.” Overall, on Monday, 7,530 people were vaccinated, including 2,267 frontline workers and 3,281 healthcare workers. Till now, 228,840 citizens including frontline and healthcare worker have been vaccinated in Mumbai since January 16, 2021.Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “From Tuesday all civic-run hospitals will start vaccination as this will ensure the crowd is divided. On private hospitals, we are yet to carry out inspections to gauge whether they are ready for vaccination. For now, three private hospitals will continue vaccination.” She added, “On Tuesday, we also hope the number of common citizens getting vaccinated will go up as the functioning of Co-win portal is expected to normalise.” Further, as per BMC, the Centre had sent a list of 53 private hospitals which may participate in the third phase of the vaccination drive and are empanelled under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) and the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS).

However, the rising Covid-19 cases across Maharashtra have left the students in a fix as many are worried about the risks of appearing for physical exams in the current scenario.“Exams are just eight days away and after conducting lectures and practicals the entire year online, it is unfair that our exams are being conducted in offline mode, especially when the state is recording more than 8,000 Covid-19 cases each day,” said a final-year student, adding that aspirants and parents are equally worried about the health and safety of staff and students.A group of students on Monday also approached minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, seeking their help over the issue.“For the past one year, we [final-year students] have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 and have not cared for our own health while ensuring the safety of others. We now request the state government to consider our health and safety and push for our final-year exams to be conducted in online mode,” stated the letter signed by several students from KEM, Sion, Cooper hospitals and Grant Medical College. “Our exams last for a full month and with thousands of students slated to appear for them from March 8, we are worried about the risk the students and teachers will be under during offline exams,” said some students, who have also shared their concern on several social media platforms.While the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) had previously released circulars postponing all final-year medical and dental exams from January to February and then to March, there has been no update from MUHS in the past one week.“Without any intimation from the state, we can’t decide to postpone the exams any further. We’ll stick to the schedule, and if there are any updates, they will be intimated to the students,” said an official from MUHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/finalyear-mbbs-exams-students-from-maharashtra-fear-offline-tests-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101614627683782.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Crowding, queues at all vaccine centres in Mumbai on first day of third phase||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started the third phase of its mass immunisation programme on Monday. However, technical glitches in the newly-updated CoWIN app, lack of coordination among civic officials and confusion among the public affected the overall turnout. Vaccination centres also didn’t have adequate number of wheelchairs and seating arrangements for senior citizens. On Sunday night, BMC selected four jumbo centres in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Mulund, Goregaon and Dahisar along with Seven Hills Hospital to start inoculating senior citizens and people above 45 years with comorbidities. On Monday morning, the Central government relaunched the centralized app, Co-WIN 2.0, following which registrations started from 9am. However, much like when healthcare workers (HCWs) had attempted to register on the app in January when the nationwide immunisation programme began, the app crashed when people attempted to register, possibly because it was unable to handle to load from across the country. Citizens can also directly approach any nearby vaccination centres to register for their first shot. The problems with Co-Win, which is monitoring the vaccination drive, led to tussles between beneficiaries and officials at vaccination centres. “They asked us to either wait or go back home and come later. They instructed us to call at the landline number before coming again,” said Sunita Joshi, a 64-year-old who had gone to the NESCO jumbo centre in Goregaon with her 70-year-old husband. Many senior citizens said they had to wait for hours without any food and drinking water. “When I tried to register on the app at around 9am, it didn’t work. When I tried later, I could register my parents, aged 66 and 64 years. It generated a message which suggested reaching the centre after 12.30pm. But on reaching the centre, we were asked to wait in the queue along with people who hadn’t registered online,” said Pratik Goradia, 37, a resident of Dahisar. There was chaos at the NESCO jumbo centre. Madhusudhan Jha, 43, who accompanied his senior citizen parents, pointed out that social distancing could not be maintained at the facility. “Senior citizens are most vulnerable to contracting the infection. So the centres should have made better arrangements because people were pouncing on each other at the registration counter. This is too risky,” said Jha, whose parents got their first shot of the vaccine after waiting for two hours. At the Dahisar jumbo centre, there were only three wheelchairs and not enough chairs. “The entry point at gate 3 has a sloping dome which is extremely risky for elderly to walk across. There were no helpers to assist aged people who were coming alone for vaccination,” said Prasoon Gupta, a Kandivli resident who had taken his 67-year-old father to the centre. At around 2pm, the Dahisar jumbo centre asked those who had come to the centre without registration to return home. “My son took a leave today to get us vaccinated but now, we are being asked to come tomorrow as the app isn’t working properly,” said Girish Pednekar, a 65-year-old Borivli resident. Officials said they weren’t given enough time to prepare for senior citizens. “We have been already conducting the vaccination in phase I and II. So, the Central government should have given us a heads-up before suddenly instructing us to start phase III,” said a senior civic official from the BKC jumbo centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crowding-queues-at-all-vaccine-centres-in-mumbai-on-first-day-of-third-phase-101614627566106.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||British-era water supply structures crumbling in Ambala Cantt||For nearly a century since its inception in the 1880s, the water supply system built by the British Empire quenched the thirst of people in Ambala Cantonment. Around 10-kilometre long, the duct water supply system, known as Handesra waterworks, ensured clean water supply to both troops and civilians.After almost 150 years, the well-like structures and underground pipes spread across three villages and in some areas of the cantonment lie in ruins. Mostly made of limestone and bricks, now surrounded by wild growth, remnants of these structures can be found near Dangri river in Ambala’s Bora Khera village on the Roorkee highway besides in Handesra and Sarangpur villages in Punjab. Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) convener Colonel RD Singh (retired), whose team has done primary research in these pockets, says this water supply system primarily works on the principle of gravity as these villages are at a higher altitude than Ambala. “Water collects in the larger wells through shallow wells and enters the 20-foot-deep pipes without the assistance of any elaborate mechanism. When water levels dropped after an earthquake in 1905, a steam engine was installed, which was later replaced with an oil-based engine after advancement in technology,” the colonel said. Youdhvir Singh, an irrigation research scholar at Panjab University, said the structure came into existence to ensure round-the-clock drinking water after the British setup a permanent colony in the 1840s. “River water was filtered through sand and was used for drinking through storage wells. Even in times of drought, the wells were large enough to meet the region’s requirement till a backup could be arranged,” Singh said. Locals say dependence on the system gradually decreased as the water levels had dropped and tubewells were setup across the region in the decades after Independence. An official from the Cantonment Board said the supply was used in few parts of the cantonment till the 1990s, after which other alternatives replaced it. However, the board has made attempts to beautify it. Intach lists the waterworks as a heritage site and has recommended that the engineering marvel be maintained and developed as a tourist spot or site of historical importance. The board’s chief executive officer, Anuj Goel, said that the body can undertake its restoration either on directions or any proposal from the Military Engineering Services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/britishera-water-supply-structures-crumbling-in-ambala-cantt-101614627504238.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Builder murder case: Bombay HC rejects plea to transfer trial||The Bombay high court on Monday refused to transfer the ongoing trial in the sessions court against the accused in the 2013 murder of developer Sunil Kumar Lahoriya at Navi Mumbai to a different court as the current bench had completed a substantial portion of the trial and the petitioner had not shown any glaring exceptional circumstances to cause a transfer. The petition was filed by the deceased businessman’s son Sandeep, alleging a biased and hurried examination of witnesses and the judge not complying with the 2018 directions of HC to conduct an expeditious trial. The HC bench while directing the sessions judge to conduct day-to-day trial from March 4 also directed all court officers involved to cooperate. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale while hearing the petition filed by Sandeep Lahoriya was informed by advocate Himanshu Kode the sessions judge is biased and he is in a hurry to wrap up the trial, as a result of which, procedural and substantive errors were being committed while conducting the trial, which is prejudicial to the prosecution. Kode also submitted that specific instances have been stated in the writ petition to claim that the aforesaid judge has not been conducting the trial properly and that this has resulted in frequent skirmishes between the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) and the judge, which is detrimental to the trial. It also claimed that vital applications like the application filed under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C. by the SPP have been kept pending and instead, evidence is being hurriedly recorded. Senior advocate Rajeev Chavan for Mahesh Bijlani, one of the accused however objected the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner. Counsels for other 13 accused concurred with the submissions of Chavan and sought dismissal of the petition. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that barring a few accused, all others have been in jail for about seven years by now and this factor needs to be taken into account while ensuring The trial is completed at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/builder-murder-case-bombay-hc-rejects-plea-to-transfer-trial-101614627383245.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Irrigation scam in Maharashtra: HC strikes down nod to prosecute officer||The Bombay high court last week struck down sanction to prosecute Chandan Jibhkate, the then senior divisional accounts officer of the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC), in five irrigation scam cases. Jibhkate had moved high court challenging five separate orders passed by Accountant General (Accounts and Entitlement) II, Nagpur, on January 17, 2019, granting sanction to prosecute him in all the five cases registered against him in connection with irrigation scam cases involving VIDC projects. As the senior divisional accounts officer, the 63-year-old was entrusted with the task of clearing bills submitted by VIDC engineers and officers during the period when estimates prepared for several irrigation projects were allegedly inflated manifold and huge government funds were misappropriated in connivance with the contractors. It was argued on his behalf that sanction to prosecute him was denied by the competent authority in three cases on December 14, 2018 and in remaining two cases on December 7, 2018 and and January 9, 2019, respectively. A week later the competent authority reviewed all earlier orders and granted sanction when there was no fresh material, warranting reconsideration of the earlier decisions, advocate Rajnish Vyas, who represented Jibhkate, had submitted. Vyas added that such an exercise was not permissible under the law and referred to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Nishant Sareen’s case on the point. As a matter of fact, the bench added, it was nobody’s case that after first refusal of sanction further investigation was carried out and that it resulted into discovery of any fresh material that required fresh consideration by the competent authority, the bench added. “All these orders manifestly show absence of consideration of any fresh material or evidence discovered after the earlier orders were passed and as such, would be the orders adversely hit by the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Nishant Sareen,” said HC. In Nishant Sareen’s case, the Supreme Court has held that whenever there is a refusal to grant sanction, it would not be open to the competent authority to review such an order on same material because power of review conferred upon the authority is not unbridled and unrestricted and putting of some fetters on its power of review is essential to accord finality to such an exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/irrigation-scam-in-maharashtra-hc-strikes-down-nod-to-prosecute-officer-101614627203058.html

The 695-metre wooden and glass deck bridge will be constructed above the Mithi river, offering a view of the mangroves. In its recently released budget 2021-22, the development authority also allocated ₹77 crore for the project. Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday tweeted, “MMRDA is now connecting BKC to Maharashtra Nature Park. This connector itself will be a point of tourism, and more so will take a lot of people for a stroll to Maharashtra Nature Park and enjoy its biodiversity!” The nature park, between Dharavi and Mithi river estuary, is spread across an area of 37 acres and is home to more than 130 species of birds, 80 types of butterflies, 32 varieties of reptiles and 12 types of spiders. BG Pawar, joint metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “It will probably be the longest suspension bridge in India. The glass floor of the bridge will also provide a soothing view to tourists.” Earlier, MMRDA had held a global competition for a makeover of the nature park in 2016, which included the plan to construct the bridge. The pedestrian bridge is touted to be one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. Deep Dey, the architect who has designed the bridge, said, “The unique free flowing form of the bridge is enthused with Mithi river flowing below the bridge deck between the mangroves. This design allows gathering of pedestrians at certain intervals on the bridge deck for the soothing view of the lush green mangroves in the river also through the glass floor pockets in the wooden bridge deck, and provides visual access to the migratory birds visiting the vicinity all part of the year creating another opportunity for bird watchers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmrda-invites-tenders-for-pedestrian-bridge-at-bkc-101614627025392.html

Referring to the incident wherein physical hearing had to be suspended after 60 lawyers in Amravati had contracted Covid-19, the bench said that any breach in the standard operating procedure laid down by HC administration would not be tolerated. Two weeks ago, justice GS Patel had also passed similar directions and had even ensured that only those litigants and advocates whose cases were coming up for hearing were allowed in the courtroom. Similarly, justice PK Chavan had last week refused to hear a matter after the petitioner’s lawyer removed his mask, when his case came up for hearing. HC had resumed physical hearing last year in December after nearly six months of virtual hearing, while the pandemic was its peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wont-hear-cases-if-social-distancing-is-not-followed-bombay-hc-to-lawyers-litigants-101614627024949.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mercury crosses 35°C as summer sets in, warmer days ahead||The city continued to witness warm conditions on Monday, recording a maximum temperature of 35.4 degrees Celsius at the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) automatic weather station in Santacruz. While the temperature was down from 36.3 degrees Celsius recorded on Sunday, it marked the second consecutive day that the mercury remained above 35 degrees Celsius — indicating that Mumbai has begun experiencing the onset of the summer.The minimum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 21.4 degrees Celsius on Monday, up from 20.6 degrees Celsius on Sunday. Both minimum and maximum readings were recorded above the mean temperature, with a departure of two and three degrees from normal, respectively. As per IMD data, both readings have remained consistently above normal since February 23.IMD forecast predicts that the mercury may soon touch 36 degrees Celsius in Mumbai, by March 3, while the minimum temperature is expected to hover around 22 degrees Celsius. Mainly clear skies are expected to prevail for the next week. Meanwhile, IMD’s weather station in Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 32.5 degrees Celsius on Monday, little less than 32.8 degrees recorded a day prior. The minimum temperature in Colaba was 23 degrees Celsius, as against Sunday’s reading of 22.5 degrees Celsius. “The daytime maximum temperature will most likely now remain above 35 degrees. Technically speaking, it is not really summer yet, but we can say that the pre-monsoon period has begun. This is the time between March and May which is marked by rising temperatures. The reason for this is due to dry and hot north westerly winds which are blowing close to the earth’s surface,” said Shubhangi Bhute, scientist at IMD, Mumbai.Air quality in Mumbai remained in the moderate category with the air quality index (AQI) at 190 on Monday, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).“Air quality will remain moderate for the next few days as temperature is also rising. This makes the air less dense and increases wind speed, allowing for pollutants to be dispersed easily. On the other hand, hot, dry winds blowing into Mumbai from the north are expected to bring in some dust storms as summer sets in. We will issue an alert three days before such an event is forecasted,” said a SAFAR spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mercury-crosses-35-c-as-summer-sets-in-warmer-days-ahead-101614627023944.html

02-03-2021||Mumbai||Auto, taxi fare hike in Mumbai: Drivers and passengers still confused||Confusion among passengers and autorickshaw and taxi drivers regarding implementation of the new tariff was witnessed on the first day after fare hike on Monday. Many autorickshaw and taxi drivers said they were not aware about the display of tariff cards and continued to charge the earlier tariff.Increased fares of autorickshaw and taxis were implemented from Monday in the city. The minimum autorickshaw fare is now ₹21 as opposed to ₹18 previously and the minimum black-and-yellow taxi fare is now ₹25 as opposed to ₹22. The minimum auto rickshaw fare during night is now ₹27 and minimum taxi fare is now ₹32. The Maharashtra government on February 22 announced the decision to increase the minimum fare of autorickshaw, and thereafter, per kilometre rate has increased to ₹14.20 from the earlier ₹12.19.In case of black-and-yellow taxis, the per kilometre rate has increased ₹16.93 from ₹14.84. “The meters have not started to get recalibrated yet. We were not informed regarding update of the tariff card display which is why we are continuing to charge the old fares. I came to know about the fare hike through newspapers. I was not aware about it,” said Sanjay Singh, a black-and-yellow taxi driver and a resident of Sewri. Drivers also said that with the increase in fares, they are likely to get less passengers as many will shift to Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses.“People will not want to sit in autorickshaws if the bus fare is equivalent or even less at times. The business is already down due to coronavirus. We want financial aid more than a fare hike,” said Rafique Shaik, an autorickshaw driver and resident of Andheri. Passengers also appeared to be confused with non-display of tariff cards on autorickshaws while drivers said they did not know about downloading the tariff card. “We are not tech savvy and had no idea on how to check the new fares. It is good that the autorickshaw drivers have not started immediately charging the new fares and are waiting. The hiked fares will not be financially viable for the citizens,” said Hemangi Desai, a Ghatkopar resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/auto-taxi-fare-hike-in-mumbai-drivers-and-passengers-still-confused-101614626724147.html

In the first incident, a security guard was stabbed to death while in the second case, an autorockshaw driver was killed by a passenger. Kailash Pathak, a 50-year-old security guard with a Vile Parle firm residing in Shankeshwar Nagar in Nallasopara (East), was murdered when he was leaving for work at around 4.30 am on Monday over a tiff regarding loud music. Pathak, who visited his house on weekends, had a tiff over loud music being played by a disc jockey (DJ), who is his neighbour, and the DJ’s friends on Saturday. “It seems the accused knew the movement routine of Pathak that he would board the first Mumbai local for work,” said a Tulinj police officer. The accused stabbed Pathak to death just 50 metres away from his flat. As it was early in the morning, there were no eyewitnesses. During inquiry, the police came to know from Pathak’s relatives about the fracas and arrested the accused for murder. “The arrested accused will be produced before the Vasai court on Tuesday. We are investigating further. The post mortem report is awaited,” he said. In the second case, Kishan Shukla, 25, was stabbed to death by an unidentified passenger who stole Shukla’s mobile.

02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of MC polls in Himachal, BJP attempts to mend fences with Dhumal||In the run up to municipal corporation elections in Dharamshala, Solan, Mandi and Palampur, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has started reaching out to hitherto sidelined leaders, including former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and his supporters. Political pandits attribute this change in strategy to the party’s performance in the recently concluded Panchayati Raj Institution (PRIs) elections, particularly the Zila Parishad polls, where the party had struggled to form councils although it was ultimately able to get BJP-backed chairpersons elected in 10 of the 12 districts in the state. Recently, Avinash Rai Khanna, who is the BJP in-charge of Himachal, held a closed-door meeting with the former chief minister and his son Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur at their native place in Samirpur. It is learnt that they discussed the political scenario in the state and at the Centre. Dhumal and Thakur also apprised him of the treatment meted out to them and their supporters during the tenure of the chief minister Jai Ram Thakur-led government. Dhumal and his supporters are allegedly displeased with the repeated attempts being made by the government to undermine them, especially at a time when the BJP has absolute majority in the Vidhan Sabha. Asked about the party’s overtures to Dhumal, Khanna said, “His (Dhumal’s) contribution to the party cannot be ignored. He has been chief minister twice and is a popular leader. We discussed our future strategy and plans for the party.” “Dhumalji is veteran leader. He was invited to the BJP’s executive in Dharamshala and he addressed workers in separate session after a long time,” said Khanna. The septuagenarian, who has been a farmer and an English teacher at a private college, is seen as the common man’s representative. He has helmed the state from March 1998 to 2003, when he had headed the Himachal Vikas Congress-BJP coalition and again from January 2008 to 2013. Dhumal’s easy availability and amiable nature made him popular among the masses. In 2017, Dhumal, a chief minister designate, had been defeated from Sujanpur by his one-time confidante turned rival Rajender Rana. At 76, Dhumal still wields influence over the state and a substantial number of his supporters have made it to the Vidhan Sabha. Over a dozen leaders from Dhumal’s camp had lost the 2017 assembly polls, among them were former ministers Ravinder Singh Ravi, Gulab Singh Thakur, former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar, Randhir Sharma and Sanjay Chaudhary. Khanna had also recently met Dhumal’s close confidante Ravinder Singh Ravi. Ravi is a former five-time legislator. He was elected for four consecutive terms from the Thural assembly segment. Ravi shifted his base to Dehra in 2012 after his home constituency was reserved in a delimitation exercise. “ I have apprised Khannaji about the issues we faced” said Ravi, who was embroiled in a controversy after a letter alleging corruption in the state government had been widely shared on social media in November 2019. The letter, addressed to veteran leader Shanta Kumar, raised serious allegations of corruption in the health and industry department and questioned the former chief minister’s silence on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-mc-polls-in-himachal-bjp-attempts-to-mend-fences-with-dhumal-101614626486314.html
02-03-2021||Mumbai||Defamation case: Bailable warrant issued against Kangana Ranaut||A metropolitan magistrate court at Andheri on Monday issued a bailable warrant against actor Kangana Ranaut for failing to appear for hearing on the defamation complaint filed by lyricist Javed Akhtar.The magistrate court had on February 1 issued summons to Ranaut to appear before the court on Monday. The actor failed to appear in person while her lawyer, advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, appeared on her behalf.“Ranaut’s lawyer told the court that they wish to challenge the proceedings. However, the lawyer did not file an application seeking exemption for the actor to appear before the court. In the absence of the plea, we move the application seeking non-bailable warrant against the actor,” said advocate Jai Bharadwaj lawyer for Akhtar.On the application of the complainant, the court issued bailable warrant against the actress and posted the matter for further hearing on March 26.Siddiquee said, “The said magistrate court has grossly erred in taking cognisance of the matter and issuing summons to my client, without even verifying the Complainant’s four witnesses on oath, as mandated under section 200 of CrPC. As such the entire proceedings including and not limited to the Summons and the bailable warrant issued against my client are legally sought to be challenged, on merits. I shall be soon moving before an appropriate court challenging all actions taken by the learned magistrate so far; and I am quite hopeful that proceedings initiated till date by the magistrate court, would be stayed on merits.”The court, while considering the application for issuance of warrant, observed, “Though the accused is going to challenge the entire proceedings before the hon’ble high court, as stated by her learned advocate, however, in absence of any orders from high court, her remaining absent shows her conduct. Furthermore, mere intending to challenge the proceedings would not absolve her liability as an accused from attending this court.”The writer-poet approached the magistrate court in November 2020. On December 3, his statement was recorded by the magistrate under the process of verification of the complaint. Later, the court directed Juhu Police to conduct an inquiry and submit their report on the allegations.Police in their report has concluded, “There was a meeting between Akhtar and Ranaut in March 2016. In the said meeting Dr Ramesh Agrawal (family doctor of Ranaut, Akhtar and Roshans’) was also present. It is said that Akhtar has never told her that she will commit suicide or she will have to go to jail.”The police also said that during the investigation they had issued summons to Ranaut on several occasions, but she failed to apprear.Police, in its report, attached statement of three witnesses — the complainant, the family doctor and a family friend of Akhtar.In his statement, the doctor, Ramesh Agrawal, has claimed that it was in 2015-16 that he came to know about the problems between Hrithik Roshan and Ranaut. During that time, Agrawal said, Akhtar had asked him to mediate and resolve the dispute between the two since he knew both of them well.Agrawal claimed that when he asked Ranaut, she agreed to meet Akhtar at his house to discuss the issue between her and Roshan over the alleged fake email controversy. It was in 2016, that Ranaut, her sister and Dr Agrawal had visited Akhtar’s house. The doctor further said that in the meeting, Akhtar had only said, “Aap dono celebrity ho, aap dono ke bich me jo fake email ke bare me vaad hoga uska media me aur public me aapki pratima malin ho jati hain, iss liye aap dono samjhota kar ke vaat mita do. Iss liye aap Hritik Roshan se sorry bolke vaad khatam kar do. (Both of you are celebrities. The dispute between both of you regarding the fake email incident will malign your reputation in media and public. Hence, sort out your differences and apologise to Hrithik Roshan).Aggarwal said Akhtar had never said things like “you will commit suicide, and you will be sent to prison”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/defamation-case-bailable-warrant-issues-against-kangana-ranaut-101614626243655.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: February gone by was hottest in 7 years||With record-breaking hot days towards its end, February 2021 saw highest average temperature for the month since 2015, for which the data is available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the IMD, average temperatures will remain higher than normal in the city from March to May as well.“With maximum temperature going up to 32.7°C, it was expected that the average temperature in February will remain high,” said IMD, Chandigarh, director Surender Paul. “The western disturbances were weak and too few in numbers this February. Even in the first week of March, a western disturbance will be active in the city, but is unlikely to bring any rain. Dry and sunny weather will continue, and maximum temperature will cross 30°C again.”Chandigarh had recorded maximum temperature in excess of 30°C for three consecutive days, as it climbed to 32.7°C on Friday (February 26). It was highest for a February day since 1954, when it had reached 32.8°C. After some rain on Friday night, mercury had dropped below 30°C over the weekend. Maximum temperature went down from 28°C on Sunday to 26.7 degrees on Monday. Minimum temperature stayed unchanged at 11.1°C.Paul said a strong anticyclonic movement had formed over the city, which kept winds under control. “With less traffic and pollution due to Covid, average temperatures have stayed high for previous months as well, as otherwise suspended particulate matter in the air reflects sunlight and keeps the city from getting too warm,” he said.Hot months ahead tooIMD, Delhi, has also released their long-range forecast on Monday, according to which Chandigarh — which is considered a part of Haryana for forecast purposes — will have average temperature 0.71 degrees above normal. La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean (which boost monsoon in the country) are prevailing over the country and are likely to sustain over the period.

Rao, who is still in Nanavati Hospital, approached the court seeking modification of the February 22 order wherein he was granted bail on medical grounds for six months on furnishing a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two solvent sureties. Rao sought modification to be allowed to deposit temporary cash surety for a month till the solvent sureties were arranged. The court accepted the same but said the modification to the bail order was limited to the extent of April 5 only. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the criminal application filed by Rao seeking modification to the February 22 bail order, was informed that as submission of the solvent sureties would take time, Rao was seeking urgent release from Nanavati Hospital on furnishing temporary cash surety. The petition stated that furnishing solvent sureties was taking time due to the Covid-19 situation and would be provided within April 5, and hence the court should grant the limited prayer. On February 22, the HC had granted Rao bail for six months with strict conditions on health grounds. The court asked him to stay within the National Investigation Agency (NIA) special courts’ jurisdiction in Mumbai during that period. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “We are of the opinion that in the interest of justice, due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation, the limited prayer can be granted.” The court then directed Rao to be released on bail on furnishing cash surety of ₹50,000 and granted extension of time till April 5 for furnishing two solvent sureties. While disposing the petition, the court noted that all other conditions mentioned in the February 22 order would operate without any modification and the extension of time to furnish two solvent sureties was being granted for the limited period in view of Covid-19 pandemic situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-allows-varavara-rao-to-temporarily-get-out-on-cash-bail-101614626064763.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Hope for safe future drives people to vaccination centres in Chandigarh||Commoners, couples, those with travel plans and VIPs were seen waiting for their turns as the vaccination drive for elderly kicked off in the city on Monday. As many as 556 were inoculated on the first day, including 493 senior citizens. Among them was former Punjab director general of police (DGP) PC Dogra, who walked in at the GMSH-16 vaccination centre with his wife early in the morning to take the jab.“What apprehensions can one have when the vaccine is approved by the government? It is our responsibility to take the shot as early as possible. Personally, it is a step towards a safer future. After we get the second dose too, we will be completely safe against the deadly virus,” said the 81-year-old.His wife, Vineeta Dogra, 74, said, “We wish normalcy returns in our country and we can move freely without any fear of infection. The vaccine is completely safe.”The first couple to report at the vaccination centre here was Dr PS Handa and Rajesh Handa.“I took the vaccine during the first phase when the retired doctors were invited. My wife wanted it too, but she was ineligible. So, when we got to know that the on-site registration is allowed from today, we rushed in and are waiting for the jab,” said 84-year-old Dr Handa.72-year-old Harbhajan Singh and 77-year-old Suresh Kumar from Sector 38 (West), both retired government employees, waited patiently during the initial hiccups on the registration platform. However, this did not deter them from getting inoculated. “It’s worth waiting for the vaccine,” they said. People keen to travel were also seen reporting at the vaccination sites.“Since the mortality rate in our group is very high and chances of catching infection during the travel increases, I want to get the jab as early as possible as I have to travel. Moreover, it also gives hope for a safe future,” said Raghbir Singh, 82, while waiting for his turn at Government Medical College Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hope-for-safe-future-drives-people-to-vaccination-centres-in-chandigarh-101614626063584.html

02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Water tariff hike: Chandigarh MC to rationalise rates||After the Chandigarh administration asked the municipal corporation to reconsider its General House’s resolution to roll back water tariff hike, the civic body is planning to bring a fresh resolution focusing on cutting down on the 30% sewerage cess and restructuring tariff slabs. “The MC will bring a fresh agenda on the issue for the approval of MC General House in its next meeting,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav on Monday.In September last year, the administration had notified a hike in water tariff, ranging from 50% to 200%, depending on the category of users and consumption levels.After facing public outcry and criticism from the opposition, the MC General House passed a resolution in October , asking the administration to withdraw the notification.Now, rather than asking the administration to shelve the entire notification, the MC will recommend specific amendments in the rates. The MC is likely to call a General House meeting on March 8 or 9.“One, the sewerage cess would be reduced. Currently, it is 30% of the total water usage charges. After water tariff was increased, the cess is adding a huge financial burden on residents,” said mayor Ravi Kant Sharma. The cess was introduced in June 2019.The MC is also considering reduction in rates for water usage in the 31-60 kilolitre slab. Under the notification, it was doubled from ₹6/kl to ₹12/kl. It is likely to be reduced to 8% hike, said Sharma.Even commercial rates may be on actual usage, and not fixed. “Either, we would reduced the fixed rates or charge it on actual consumption basis. This would bring relief to booth owners,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/water-tariff-hike-chandigarh-mc-to-rationalise-rates-101614625343565.html
02-03-2021||Chandigarh||Third vaccination round: 556 jabbed in Chandigarh on Day 1||As many as 556 people were vaccinated against Covid-19 in Chandigarh as the nationwide drive entered the third phase on Monday. The neighbouring districts of Mohali (Punjab) and Panchkula (Haryana) saw a poor response. Only 79 people came forward to get vaccinated in Mohali, while the number stood at 139 in Panchkula. Though all seven government hospitals in Mohali district were to be roped in for the drive, only the civil hospital in Phase 6 was operational. At one of the three centres in Panchkula, many returned after waiting for their turn for long.Among the two priority groups, senior citizens (above the age of 60 years) were seen more enthusiastic in Chandigarh as 493 of them were inoculated as compared to just 63 people with comorbidities in the age group of 45-60. The trend was similar in Mohali and Panchkula.Private hospitals, which had only five sites, inoculated 256 persons, while at 10 government vaccination centres, 300 people received the jab.At 106, maximum number of people were inoculated at a vaccination centre in Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore was the first to get the jab at the dispensary in Sector 7, where only five people turned up. Other prominent people who got the shot in Chandigarh were Union minister of state for commerce and industry Som Prakash, former Punjab chief secretary Sarvesh Kaushal, former UT home secretary Krishan Mohan, former Punjab director general of police (DGP) NPS Aulakh, former Uttar Pradesh DGP Harmol Singh Gill and former Rajasthan DGP Amarjot Singh.Teething problems on Co-WIN portalDue to hiccups in the online registration portal Co-WIN, senior citizens had to wait for more time for their turn, but the process got smoother as the day progressed, said officials. Registration for comorbid groups was also stopped for some time, as it takes more time for them to register on the portal.At the civil hospital in Sector 45, people were seen waiting for more than three hours for the jab. A senior official said the staffers were not able to verify appointments that were pre-booked, and thus the appointments had to be cancelled and booked again at the sites, leading to delays. “The issues with on-site bookings were resolved, but those with online appointments remain,” said the official, wishing not to be named.“At 9am, when the portal was launched, it took more time for registration The initial hiccups were anticipated. However, in the afternoon, the registration numbers picked up. Many people reported at the sites in the afternoon, and we received a good response,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department.Dr Manjeet Singh, district immunisation officer, said: “People can go for both online and on-spot registration. It is advisable to check the portal once. The footfall is less at the Manimajra site; so people can go there as well.” More private hospitals roped in“The five private hospitals that have participated in the vaccination drive also saw a good turnout of beneficiaries, who at most of the places availed the facility of on-spot registration,” an official statement said.“The response was better than expected. There seems to be no hesitancy,” said Dr Neeraj Kumar of Chaitanya Hospital, Sector 44.HS Sehgal, nodal officer for vaccination at Healing Hospital, Sector 34, said they are receiving a number of queries through phone calls, and arrangements are being made as per instructions from the authorities.The other three private hospitals where vaccination took place were Dharam Hospital, Sector 15, and Santokh Hospital and Landmark Hospital in Sector 38.Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department, said: “The authorities have fixed a minimum load of 200 inoculations per day at government sites and 100 at private sites. The number can be increased if more response is received.” She said four new private sites will be open for registration from Tuesday: Eden Critical Care Centre, Industrial Area; Kare Partner Heart Centre and Mukat Hospital in Sector 34; and CHD City Hospital, Sector 8C.The government vaccination sites have been created at GMCH, Sector 32; GMSH, Sector 16; PGIMER; Civil Hospitals in Sector 45 and Manimajra; Health and Wellness Centre, Sector 49; and ESI Hospital, Ram Darbar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/third-vaccination-round-556-jabbed-in-chandigarh-on-day-1-101614625223597.html
02-03-2021||Noida||Covid-19: Inaugural session of phase-3 vaccination drive records over 98% turnout in Noida||NOIDA: Vaccination for senior citizens on Monday saw an overwhelming response in Gautam Budh Nagar with the district recording a turnout of about 98%.District vaccination officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that on Monday, a soft launch for the third round was held in one private hospital (SJM super specialty hospital in Chhijarsi), and two government hospitals (district hospital in Sector 30 and the Government institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida). As many as 319 out of a total of 325 beneficiaries took their first shot at three hospitals in the district on Monday.“While both – SJM Hospital and the district hospital – were sent 100 doses each, GIMS was sent 125 doses. The turnout at SJM hospital was 100% while it was 99% at the district hospital. At GIMS, as many as 120 out of the 125 enlisted senior citizens were inoculated Monday,” he said.Police personnel deployed at the district hospital said they had a tough time lining up the senior citizens and setting up chairs for the six-feet apart, as per social distancing protocols. “Though it is hard to make senior citizens stick to norms, I am really enjoying my duty,” said Rajesh Kumar, a constable posted there.Most of the senior citizens did not appear too worried about the possible after-effects of the jab. “The moment I came to know that I am getting the Covishield, I started feeling at ease. I’ve taken the jab and I am absolutely fine,” said Sushila Singh, who took the shot along with her husband at SJM Hospital.Although the soft launch began on a slow note, due to technical issues, the overall coverage accelerated by the end of day. Officials said the on-spot registration began at 9am, but the dissemination could begin only after two hours, due to a glitch. “We need to fill all details about allotment before administering the doses. The updated Co-WIN application was new for us, so completing this process took a longer time,” said a health official at GIMS, asking not to be identified.Meanwhile, the Gautam Budh Nagar district admin has prepared a list of 424,555 beneficiaries, aged 60 years and above, through the electoral roll, for the third phase of the vaccination drive. Besides, people above 45 years of age with co-morbidities will also be covered in the third phase, but they need to self-register on the updated version of the Co-WIN 2.0 app.Chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that as many as 220 vaccination booths in 26 hospitals, including private facilities, have been identified for the third phase. “The full session of vaccination for phase 3 is likely to begin March 4 in the district. We are waiting for detailed guidelines from the state government. To maximise coverage, the health department has prepared a list of beneficiaries for the third phase with the help of the latest electoral roll,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-inaugural-session-of-phase-3-vaccination-drive-records-over-98-turnout-in-noida-101614624142833.html

DMK president MK Stalin signed the agreement with IUML’s Kader Mohideen whose party would contest under their ladder symbol and not DMK’s iconic ‘rising sun’ symbol.“It is a tradition since Kalaignar’s (late M Karunanidhi) period that DMK’s first signature would be with IUML,” Mohideen told reporters at DMK’s headquarters in Chennai. He said that though the IUML sought five seats, the DMK had explained to them that they needed to contest more seats given the political situation and to accommodate new allies.Also read: Covid-19 in Maharashtra - How various districts fared since Feb 24“The DMK coalition must win most seats and party must form the government with its own majority so that Tamil Nadu remains a cradle of social justice and BJP’s plans are defeated,” MMK leader MH Jawahirullah told reporters. “We have to defeat the BJP-AIADMK alliance,” he said. He said that decisions on which party symbol to contest on would be decided later. Constituencies are also yet to be finalised.The DMK started its first round of negotiations with the Congress last Thursday where the regional heavyweight wasn’t willing to part with more than 20-25 seats even as the national party desired between 40 and 50 seats. The second round of seat-sharing talks will resume between them after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi completes his campaign on March 1. The DMK on Friday formed a seven-member committee headed by party treasurer and MP TR Balu to hold seat-sharing talks with the allies.The DMK won 80 out of 180 seats it contested in 2016 where the AIADMK led by late J Jayalalithaa retained power for the second time. The other allies in the DMK-led alliance are Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Left parties Manithaneya Makkal Katchi (MMK), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and two smaller partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmk-seals-seat-sharing-deal-with-two-minority-allies-101614623766054.html

Police will cancel the arms’ licences of poll aspirants involved in the criminal activities and seize their weapons, officials said. The GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP), Alok Singh, said that police will take stern action against criminals, land mafias and liquor smugglers as they may influence and pressurise the mandate during the election. “All the police stations have been asked to prepare the criminal dossiers of poll aspirants, and that of land and liquor mafias in their respective areas. We will seize all the weapons of those involved in any illegal or violent activities,” he said. Singh further said that the police will also keep a strict vigil on illegal transportation and distribution of liquor and cash, which the poll aspirants generally use to woo the gullible voters in rural areas. “All the station house officers (SHOs) have been asked to ensure timely closure of liquor shops in their areas concerned and take tough action against the bootleggers. The police will also launch joint crackdown with the excise officials in the identified areas,” he said. The district police chief also said that as the panchayat elections will also be held in bordering districts, the state borders will be closed and screened 48 hours before the polling day. “There will be adequate deployment of police force and jawans from provincial armed constabulary (PAC) to ensure free and fair polling in the district. We are also focussing on cleaning societal ills, like drugs and sleaze during the election,” he said. It may be noted that one-day training of officials for forthcoming panchayat election, which is slated to be in May this year, has already been done. The voters in the district will use their rights to franchise for 88 gram panchayats, five zila panchayats and three vikas khand (blocks) representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-police-prepare-criminal-dossiers-of-panchayat-poll-aspirants-101614623482714.html
02-03-2021||Other||Haryana seeks SC approval to restart mining in Gurugram, Faridabad Aravallis||The Haryana government will, on Thursday, seek the Supreme Court’s approval to begin mining in the Aravallis in Gurugram and Faridabad, a controversial move that could threaten one of the oldest mountain ranges in the country and have significant environmental impact, in terms of groundwater recharge and biodiversity.“In view of pending litigation in the Haryana mining matters case, mining in Aravalli hill areas in the districts of Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat is lying closed since May 2009…that on the one hand the state and its citizens are being disadvantaged of the benefit of its natural resources and at the same time it has to depend on mineral from adjoining states at higher cost to its economy both public and private. The execution of infrastructural projects in the state is not only getting delayed but the cost escalation of the same due to higher cost of basic material has been a major concern affecting all new projects,” said Haryana’s appeal in the apex court, which will be heard on March 4. The appeal, reviewed by Hindustan Times, claims that there is large-scale unemployment in Haryana due to the Covid-19 pandemic which can be addressed by opening up mining.Also Read | Students demand protection of Aravallis, withdrawal of amendment to land actIn 2009, the Supreme Court imposed a blanket ban on all mining of major and minor minerals in the eco-sensitive Aravalli hills in Faridabad, Gurugram and Mewat.The order suspended all mining activities in the region till statutory provisions for restoration and reclamation were complied with, particularly in cases where pits or quarries had been abandoned.“We are ready to comply with all of SC’s orders on mining issued earlier. The SC directed us to prepare a rehabilitation plan for areas which were affected by mining. MoEFCC (the union environment ministry) prepared it in 2013 but it is yet to be finalised. Our appeal in SC will be to finalise the rehabilitation plan and allow us to start mining operations in Gurugram and Faridabad ,” said Anil Grover, senior advocate general of Haryana.He added that in 2009, the Supreme Court, in principle, agreed to allow mining on 600 hectares of land across Faridabad subject to finalising of a rehabilitation planMeanwhile, Social Action for Forest and Environment, an environmental activist group has filed an application for intervention in the matter. The group, which will be represented by advocate Sanjay Upadhyay, suggests that the origin of this 600 hectares to be opened up for mining is the report of a private consultant engaged by Haryana. “It is believed that the mining is proposed to be carried out in new areas which remained untouched from mining earlier. That out of the 600 ha which has been identified by the above consultant, about 238 ha land is protected under Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, Aravalli Notification and Aravalli Plantation areas,” the group said in a statement.The Union environment ministry said it is unaware of any plan.“No reference has been made to us on mining in the Aravallis. We can only comment when the reference is made to us. If it goes to court it will be referred to us also,” said a senior environment ministry official who asked not to be named.Environmentalists warned of the dangers of allowing mining to restart in the region.“The total extent of mining leases granted in the past and the extent of illegal mining have not been assessed so far. Illegal mining’s impact has been much greater than the legal mining allowed. It has exceeded any rational level of carrying capacity in the Aravallis. The impact of the illegal mining on forests, wildlife habitat and corridor movement and groundwater recharge were devastating. All three have been recovering slowly with the healing powers of nature. Allowing mining to restart in the Faridabad-Gurugram belt will again devastate the ecology of the region, destroy forest cover, and wildlife habitat,” said Chetan Agarwal, a Gurugram-based environmental analyst.“Haryana has the lowest forest cover in the country, around 3.62%. Most of this is concentrated in the Aravalli hills in south Haryana (and some in the Shivaliks in the north). Allowing mining in the little remaining forest cover will lead to disproportionately high environmental impacts,” added Col SS Oberoi (retd), an environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-seeks-sc-approval-to-restart-mining-in-gurgaon-faridabad-aravallis-101614584841633.html
02-03-2021||World||Easter Sunday bombings: Lankan Catholic Church declares Black Sunday on March 7||Sri Lankan Roman Catholic Church officials declared a “Black Sunday” this weekend to demand justice for the victims of 2019 Easter Sunday bomb attacks that killed more than 260 people.Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said Tuesday that the church has been given part of a presidential commission's report into the coordinated suicide bomb attacks on April 21, 2019, but many questions remain about its findings.“The most important requirement of the commission has not been fulfilled,” Ranjith told reporters. “The misdirection is that instead of concentrating on ... finding the people who were directly responsible for this sad event, the focus has gone in the direction of whether those in power at the time fulfilled their responsibilities or not,” Ranjith said.A power struggle between the then president and prime minister which led to a communications breakdown and a resulting lapse in security coordination is said to have enabled the attacks, which occurred despite prior foreign intelligence warnings.Church leaders have asked their congregations to attend Mass on Sunday dressed in black. Church bells will toll at 8: 45 a.m., the time of the near-simultaneous attacks, and special prayers will be offered for justice for the victims.Two local Muslim groups that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group have been blamed for the attacks at six locations — two Roman Catholic churches, one Protestant church and three top hotels.Of those killed, 171 were attending Easter services at Catholic churches. More than 500 people were wounded in the attacks.Ranjith said the mandate of the commission was to find the people, sources of funding and supporters behind the attacks, but such details were not in the report. He said the church expects the government to carry out a further investigation with vigor.“We want to stress that if there is no concrete action with regard to finding answers to those questions ... we will be forced to call upon the entire nation to protest on the 21st of April, the second anniversary of the bomb attacks," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/easter-sunday-bombings-lankan-catholic-church-declares-black-sunday-on-march-7-101614705665587.html

02-03-2021||World||Coronavirus variant first found in Brazil infected many already recovered from Covid-19: Study||A coronavirus variant of concern (VOC) first detected in Brazil may be up to 2.2 times more transmissible and cause re-infection in people already recovered from Covid-19, a new modelling study has suggested. Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, found that a second wave of infection in Manaus, a city thought to have a high level of existing immunity from the first wave, was associated with the emergence of the new P.1 variant.“P.1 accrued 17 mutations, including 3 virologically-important mutations in a region of the spike protein that interacts with the receptor the virus uses to enter human cells," Dr Nuno Faria of Imperial College London said in a statement.Using statistical analysis of genome sequencing data, the researchers found that the P.1 lineage, which has been identified in more than 20 countries worldwide, has likely been circulating in Manaus since early November 2020. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and available as a preprint.They have estimated that the variant evades 25-61 per cent of protective immunity arising from infection with previously circulating variants. This means 25 to 61 out of 100 people previously infected with non-VOCs that circulated in Manaus could be re-infected if they are exposed to P.1. The study further estimated that the variant is associated with a 1.1-1.8 times increased risk of mortality compared to previous variants circulating in the Amazonian region.Read | Covid-19: Which countries have most number of fully vaccinated people?However, the researchers acknowledged the limitation of the study, saying it is unclear whether the increased risk of mortality is due to the variant or the collapse of the health system in Manaus due to the large second wave. The modelling study has only considered acquired immunity from the previous infection and not from vaccination, which means there’s no evidence that current vaccines are less effective against P.1 lineage.The team stressed that enhanced genomic surveillance of variants around the globe remains critical to accelerating pandemic responsiveness. "Global collaborative efforts on rapid virus genome sequencing are allowing us to identify SARS-CoV-2 lineages of concerns in near real-time. Yet, uncertainty in the ways SARS-CoV-2 is changing and implications for vaccine design calls for much more sequencing and analysis of virus genomes globally,” Professor Ester Sabino of Universidade de São Paulo said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-variant-infected-many-already-recovered-from-covid-19-study-101614702401769.html

Three Chinese-made vaccines require two shots, while another one requires a single dose.China, which has approved four locally developed coronavirus vaccines for use on the general public, had administered 52.52 million doses as of Feb. 28, Zhong said.Authorities had aimed to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, official media outlet Global Times reported in January.Sinovac Biotech's vaccine has been used in mass vaccination drives in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. CanSino Biologics Inc has agreed to supply millions of doses to Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aim-to-vaccinate-40-citizens-by-end-of-july-china-101614702858213.html
02-03-2021||World||Sri Lanka offers to develop new port terminal with India, Japan amid differences||Sri Lanka on Tuesday offered to develop a container terminal of Colombo port with investors from India and Japan, almost a month after it cancelled a tripartite agreement signed in 2019 on developing another facility with the two other countries.Caving in to pressure from labour unions, Sri Lanka decided on February 1 to scrap the agreement signed with India and Japan on developing the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo port. The unions had opposed a joint venture with Indian and Japanese investors holding a 49% stake.On Tuesday, a Sri Lankan government spokesperson told the media in Colombo that a meeting of the cabinet on Monday decided to develop the West Container Terminal (WCT) of Colombo port as a public-private limited company with parties nominated by the Indian and Japanese governments.People familiar with developments in New Delhi and Colombo said on condition of anonymity that no decision has been made as yet by authorities in India and Japan regarding participation in the WCT project. The people also pointed out the agreement on ECT was a tripartite mechanism involving all three governments, whereas the Sri Lankan government’s decision on WCT is aimed at private investors.Both India and Japan were irked by Sri Lanka’s sudden move to scrap the ECT agreement. India said at the time it expected Sri Lanka to abide by the agreement on the trilateral development and operation of the key terminal, while Japan said it was “regrettable” that Sri Lanka had opted to hand over operations at ECT to a state-run body instead of sticking to the agreement.The Sri Lankan government spokesperson's announcement on Tuesday said the build, operate and transfer (BOT) plan for WCT was forwarded to the Indian and Japanese missions in Colombo with a request to “nominate investors”.The spokesperson contended a proposal presented by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ) had been “approved by the Indian high commission” while the Japanese side was yet to name an investor.The spokesperson further contended the Sri Lankan cabinet had approved a proposal to develop WCT on build, operate and transfer basis for 35 years along with APSEZ, its local representative John Keels Holding PLC and Sri Lanka Ports Authority.However, the people cited above said there was “no question” of the Indian mission approving any investor. “This new decision by Sri Lanka is about creating a public-private partnership for attracting investors, and there is no role for the government,” said a person.The Japanese side too has been in touch with the Sri Lankan government on the ECT issue and has not made any decision regarding WCT, the people said.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said the Sri Lankan government’s decision was more of a damage control exercise. “WCT is neither as significant nor as economically viable as ECT. The disposition of Sri Lanka is noteworthy in that it swings away from India whenever a key decision has to be made. At a time when India and Japan are trying to reach out, it rankles that the other side is not upfront about what it is doing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-offers-to-develop-new-port-terminal-with-india-japan-amid-differences-101614698502153.html
02-03-2021||World||China's ex-finance minister says nation's fiscal situation 'extremely severe'||China's fiscal situation is "extremely severe with risks and challenges", former finance minister Lou Jiwei has warned, citing fallout from aggressive US stimulus policies, the global economic slowdown during the pandemic, an ageing Chinese population and mounting domestic local government debt, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).China's revenue is expected to remain low in the next five years, with no prospect of spending cuts, added Lou."The fiscal difficulties are not only a near-term or short-term issue, but also will be serious in the medium term," said Lou.Lou offered his sharp critique in December but the assessment has only been made public more recently, with just days to go before China's political elites meet for their annual legislative session to decide the details of economic policy, reported SCMP.Lou's warning comes as China's National People's Congress (NPC), the country's legislature, and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top political advisory body, prepare for the start of their annual gatherings this week.The meetings, known as the "two sessions", are the most important annual political gatherings in the world's second-largest economy, during which Chinese leaders are expected to announce lower targets for the central government's budget deficit and for the issuance of local government special-purpose bonds this year.Orange Wang, in an article in SCMP, wrote that Beijing is expected to cut back fiscal stimulus.At the annual legislative session, the big issues will be whether to scale back the fiscal stimulus implemented last year to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and instead focus on curbing rising debt risks.Lou, who is director of the CPPCC's foreign affairs committee, said there were further uncertainties and challenges to China's fiscal health on the domestic side.China conducted an expansionary fiscal policy for 11 consecutive years from 2009, resulting in a continuous rise in the fiscal deficit and an explosion in the size of the nation's debt, he said.Moreover, Lou argued that China's ageing population was likely to produce serious challenges to the fiscal sustainability of the world's most populous nation in the coming years."The arrival of the ageing society is speeding up, which will change the size and structure of fiscal spending in China, add to the financial burden of elderly care and put pressure on government finances," Lou said.At the end of 2019, more than 176 million Chinese were aged 65 or older, accounting for 12.6 per cent of the population, while the number of people aged 60 and above was about 177.6 million, making up 13.3 per cent of the total population, according to the National Bureau of Statistics."We are facing major changes unseen in a century," Lou said."No matter the changes in the domestic economic and social situation, or the global economic downturn, soaring government debt and global trade frictions will all create huge uncertainties and severe challenges for China's fiscal sustainability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-ex-finance-minister-says-nation-s-fiscal-situation-extremely-severe-101614695210741.html

Some were taken from their homes, hundreds were seized by riot police and soldiers who charged down protests against the coup. Many are held incommunicado.Myanmar's junta did not respond to requests for comment on the detentions, but has threatened action against those accused of destabilising the country. The army seized power after its allegations of fraud in Nov. 8 elections were rejected.In one account, Pyae Phyo Naing, the lead doctor at a government hospital, was stitching up a patient's head wound when the police came for him. He had joined the civil disobedience movement encouraging government employees to strike in protest at the new junta and had shut the hospital on Feb. 8, only treating emergency cases.Pyae Phyo Naing asked the police to wait until he had finished the stitches, but they refused. He was dragged backwards out of the clinic, a CCTV video shows."We must be patient and keep fighting against the dictatorship," said his wife Phyu Lei Thu, also a doctor. "We need to keep growing our strength to fight back, and believe we will win."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctors-teachers-a-fortune-teller-amongst-myanmar-s-new-wave-of-detainees-101614696158149.html

We appreciate all of the outpouring of love and affection," the statement said.Jordan worked well into his 80s, going back and forth between the jobs at the Gump Akin international law and lobbying firm in Washington and the Lazard financial management firm in New York. Representatives for Gump Akin did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the report.Jordan's role as a Washington insider took him all the way to the White House, where he was a close friend, golfing buddy and adviser to President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.He never held a formal government job, but no one knew better than Jordan how favors, access and requests worked in Washington. In 2018 the Financial Times called him "one of the most connected men in America."Jordan grew up in a housing project in Atlanta before his family bought a home and he was the only black person in his class at DePauw University in rural Greencastle, Indiana.After graduating, Jordan earned a law degree from Howard University and returned to Atlanta to work for a civil rights attorney. Among his cases was one that integrated the University of Georgia and Jordan helped escort his two young black clients past jeering protesters on their first day of class.Jordan later went to work for the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund before becoming head of the National Urban League in 1971.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rights-activist-former-clinton-advisor-vernon-jordan-dies-at-85-report-101614695560415.html
02-03-2021||World||US announces sanctions on Russian officials, businesses for Navalny's poisoning||The Biden administration announced sanctions against Russia over the poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny.The penalties -- like those adopted by the European Union -- target senior Russian law enforcement officials, as well as matching sanctions the EU and the UK imposed earlier on other Russians allied with President Vladimir Putin as punishment for the attempted murder of Navalny.The sanctions are the first ordered by President Joe Biden against Russia and will help set the tone for his relations with Putin. The ruble recovered sharply after the news, reversing earlier losses as investors were encouraged by the sanctions’ relatively narrow scope.The US demands the release of Navalny, his allies and others wrongfully detained in Russia and an end to the persecution of his supporters, one senior administration official told reporters in a briefing.Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia’s National Guard; Igor Krasnov, the country’s prosecutor general; Alexander Kalashnikov, the Federal Penitentiary Service chief; and Alexander Bastrykin, who leads the country’s Investigative Committee, are the targets of the EU’s latest penalties, according to three people familiar with that decision.The 27 EU member states formally adopted the sanctions on Tuesday, according to two officials familiar with the decision. The measures will be published in the afternoon, one of the people said.The US measures will involve the State, Treasury and Commerce Departments, a senior administration official said in the briefing.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would “definitely respond” to the new restrictions, though he didn’t elaborate.The targets of EU and UK asset freezes and travel bans in October were Aleksandr Bortnikov, leader of Russia’s domestic spy agency; Sergei Kiriyenko, first deputy chief of staff in the presidential administration; Andrei Yarin, head of the presidential administration’s domestic policy directorate; Aleksei Krivoruchko and Pavel Popov, two deputy ministers of defense; and Sergei Menyaylo, Putin’s envoy to the Siberian Federal District.The bloc and the UK also froze the assets of one Russian entity: the State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology.Navalny returned to Russia in January after being treated in Germany for a nerve agent attack. He was detained shortly after landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Western governments and Navalny have accused the Kremlin of being behind the attempted assassination. Russia denies that and has said that Navalny’s imprisonment is an internal matter.Last month, Biden called for Navalny’s release, saying he was “targeted for exposing corruption and should be released immediately and without condition.”Since then, Navalny has been sentenced and begun serving a two-and-a-half-year term. Last week, he was moved to a notorious penal camp in the Vladimir region about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Russian capital.During his first call with the Russian leader, in late January, Biden said he “made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning citizens are over.”Biden called the jailing of Navalny “politically motivated.” His administration also has Moscow in its sights for what US intelligence agencies indicate was Russia’s likely role in the SolarWinds Corp. cyber attack.One of the senior administration officials said that punitive actions related to the SolarWinds hack would likely be announced within weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-sanctions-on-russian-officials-businesses-for-navalny-s-poisoning-101614693916328.html

Not only in FATA, but even in the settled areas like in the important cities Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Swat and even in Quetta, there seem to be Taliban activities. They are organising huge gatherings and collecting funds openly and the state is not responding against these activities."Afridi added, "It seems that either the state is responsible for these activities or there is no state in Pakistan. So, in both cases it has to respond to the international community."Last month, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan on the 'grey list' till June for failing to act on six key parameters.Prior to the decision, the global agency had held a three-day meeting to review the progress made by Islamabad in terms of measures taken by its government against money-laundering and terrorist financing.Afridi said, "Whenever there are important meetings of important organisations like the United Nations and FATF, these terrorists and terrorist organisations are banned but the moment these meetings are finished, then again these terrorist organisations resurface".Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist Ehsanullah Ehsan, whose group nine years ago, shot and badly wounded Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, has allegedly threatened a second attempt on her life, tweeting that next time, "there would be no mistake".The threat prompted Malala to tweet herself, asking both the military and Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain how her alleged shooter, Ehsan, had escaped from government custody."Ehsanullah Ehsan is the same case. He threatened openly on Twitter to Malala and the state of Pakistan actually, in the beginning, rejected the claim that it was a fake Twitter account, but it was a genuine Twitter account. So, the state of Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism, it is training Taliban and it seems that in the coming days it wants to destabilise Afghanistan again. And its partnering with other states like Iran, Turkey and Russia in this regard to further destabilise the region and not only Afghanistan," said PTM member."Pakistan Army is very huge and its expenses are not covered by its present economy. So, in that context, it wants to conquer other countries or create instability in the region so that it can earn dollars from the international community as it has done in the so-called war on terror in the last 20 years in which they did not kill the Taliban and other terrorist groups, but they supported them to earn dollars from the international community and instead they killed innocent civilians. Thousands of Pashtuns, Baloch and Sindhis were forcibly disappeared, extra-judicially killed and tortured," he added."So, it is the responsibility of the international community to take notice of it as Manzoor Pashteen (PTM leader) has said openly that if you fund Pakistan, you are indirectly funding terrorism. So, it should be clear to the whole world that action should be taken. Now, even the women are being targeted by terrorists, supported by the Pakistani state. And you have heard of four women workers of an NGO who were killed by these terrorists in North Waziristan region of Pakistan", said the Paris-based Pashtun activist adding that it is the responsibility of UN, FATF, European Union and the US to take action against these terrorist activities of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-collecting-funds-openly-pak-govt-turning-blind-eye-ptm-leader-afridi-101614692183885.html

It said the terminal will be fully owned and developed instead by the state-run Ports Authority.Japan said it regretted the Sri Lankan decision, while India urged that the 2019 agreement be implemented.Sri Lanka announced on Tuesday that it would develop another terminal — West Container Terminal — at the same port with India and Japan.Government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the Cabinet approved the project, to be run as a public-private company with the Ports Authority and companies selected by the governments of India and Japan.India has selected Adani ports, which was earlier chosen to invest in the East Container Terminal. Japan has not yet named its investor in the project, which will be operated on a build, operate and transfer basis for 35 years.Rambukwella said the government was offering foreign participation in the West terminal because it requires a large investment to be developed, while the East terminal is completed and requires little additional money.India was particularly interested in the East terminal because it contributes about 66% of the re-exports from that terminal.India, which considers the Indian ocean region to be its strategic backyard, has for years been worried by rival China’s growing economic and political influence over neighboring Sri Lanka.China considers Sri Lanka to be a critical link in its massive “Belt and Road” global infrastructure building initiative and has provided billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade. The projects include a seaport, airport, port city, highways and power stations.China already operates the Colombo International Container Terminal as a joint venture with the Ports Authority.Critics say the Chinese-funded projects are not financially viable and that Sri Lanka will face difficulty in repaying the loans.In 2017, Sri Lanka leased a Chinese-built port located near busy shipping routes to a Chinese company for 99 years to end the heavy burden of repaying the Chinese loan used to build it.The facility is part of Beijing’s plan for a line of ports stretching from Chinese waters to the Persian Gulf. China has also agreed to provide a $989 million loan to Sri Lanka to build an expressway that will connect its tea-growing central region to the Chinese-run seaport.Japan and India are members of Quad, a group of Indo-Pacific nations that also includes the U.S. and Australia that is seeking to counter Chinese influence in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-approves-new-port-development-with-india-and-japan-101614691478283.html

Here’s the list||Governments around the world are racing to vaccinate their population against the coronavirus disease, with more than 244 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine administered so far. The United Kingdom was the first country to administer a fully tested Covid-19 vaccine, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech, and since then, several countries have rolled out shots to inoculate their residents.The United States is leading the immunisation drive in absolute terms as it has administered over 75 million shots, nearly one-third of the total doses administered globally, followed by China and the European Union. Meanwhile, Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are ahead of other countries in terms of the number of doses administered per 100 people. According to Our World in Data, a scientific online publication, Israel and the UAE have administered nearly 95 and 61 doses per 100 people respectively.The total number of vaccine doses may not equal the total number of people vaccinated as different vaccines may have different dosing regimens. The number of fully vaccinated people are nowhere near the number of doses administered since most of the countries are using Covid-19 vaccines that require a two-doses regimen.Read | Pfizer, Oxford vaccines reduce severe Covid-19 in elderly, study findsMany countries only report the number of doses administered but some countries have been sharing the breakdown of first and second doses. Our World in Data has collated the latest available data from countries providing a breakdown of doses administered.Here’s the list of countries and territories with the most number of fully vaccinated individuals per 100 people:1.

Under Austrian law, inaction by the Alpine nation's legislature can't be challenged in court, meaning the case is being brought directly to the European court, she said.Kroemer said her client's specific situation would be no hindrance to the court making a ruling that is applicable to the general public.“In a legal context, in a strategic litigation context, it really only takes one person to make a huge difference," she said.Since January 2020, Austria has had a coalition government under center-right Chancellor Sebastian Kurz that includes the environmentalist Green party, which oversees the powerful climate, environment and energy ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-sclerosis-patient-sues-austria-over-health-impact-of-climate-change-101614687994556.html

Other Saudi figures named in the RSF filing could not be reached for comment and the Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."Those responsible for the persecution of journalists in Saudi Arabia, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, must be held accountable for their crimes," RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement.RSF said it filed the lawsuit in Germany because of its principle of universal jurisdiction, allowing its courts to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere, and that other names could be added to the complaint at a later stage.The German prosecutor's office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The other officials named in the RSF complaint were Saud al-Qahtani, who was seen as the crown prince's right-hand man; Ahmed Mohammed al-Asiri, a former royal court adviser; Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a general; and Mohammad al-Otaibi, the Saudi Istanbul Consul General at the time of Khashoggi's murder.The filing follows the publishing of a declassified intelligence assessment by the United States last Friday which concluded that Prince Mohammed approved the operation to "kill or capture" Khashoggi.Washington also announced visa bans on some Saudis it believes were involved in the killing and imposed sanctions on others.Saudi Arabia said it completely rejected "the negative, false and unacceptable" intelligence assessment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-watchdog-seeks-german-investigation-of-saudi-crown-prince-over-khashoggi-101614689777616.html

But when her employer offered her a vaccine against the virus, the nurse hesitated."I have some doubts," said Boudret, 48. "I prefer to wait."Around half of health workers in French care homes do not want to be vaccinated, according to the group of experts guiding the state's vaccine rollout - compared to only 20% of the residents who have not been inoculated.If significant numbers of care home workers do not get the jab, they could transmit the disease to residents who are not vaccinated and at high risk of serious illness, say advocates for the elderly.One reason for the scepticism is that those recommending the vaccine are the same people - the French state - whom care home workers blame for their low pay and tough working conditions, said Malika Belarbi, a care worker and trade union official."There's a complete loss of trust," she said.The issue is not unique to France.In Germany, care home operator BeneVit Group surveyed staff in November and found only 30% wanted to get vaccinated.Peter Burri, head of ProSenectute, Switzerland's biggest advocacy group for seniors, said at most half of nursing staff in the medical sector were willing to get inoculated.GETTING THE JAB?At a care home in Clamart, south of Paris, on Monday, 66-year-old Marie-Dominique Chastel was playing a parlour game with residents. Chastel, an activity coordinator at the home, declined the jab because she said her own immune system could fight off Covid-19.She said some relatives of residents had asked if she was going to get vaccinated. "My response was: 'I'm going to wait a bit'," she said.Boudret, the care home nurse, recalled fighting in vain to save her patient during the first wave of the virus. The same day two more of her patients died."That day, I broke. It was the last straw," she said. She said she felt neglected and under-appreciated by the state, citing short-staffing and problems with equipment.Since then, she has had Covid-19. She was unwell for a couple of days, but is now fully recovered.Staff at her care home, in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, were offered appointments to get the vaccine.Boudret said she was not in a high-risk group and felt there had not been time to properly assess the jab.Regulators around the world have repeatedly said speed will not compromise safety and vaccine developers have said they will not cut corners in testing for safety and efficacy.The quicker results have stemmed from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence and can take years.Trials for the shots developed by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have shown only temporary side-effects.France's state drug safety watchdog has said the procedure for approving the vaccines ensures they are safe and that it monitors side-effects and has seen nothing to warrant stopping their use.The number of French care home workers declining the vaccine is half what it was in December, said Patrick Peretti-Watel, head of research at France's National Institute for Health and Medical Research.But Peretti-Watel, also a member of the government's vaccine strategy steering committee, said getting more of them inoculated would require tackling the harm done by disputes over pay and working conditions."It's a question of winning trust," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-covid-19-frontline-half-of-french-care-home-workers-don-t-trust-vaccine-101614686028574.html

His face was blurred out and he was seen sitting behind bars in prison clothes.“My behaviour was an annihilation of conscience,” Qiu was quoted as saying, according to a version translated to English published by state media.“During the many years I surfed online, my writings have become more and more frivolous and arrogant. Without learning about the whole picture, I spoke ill of the heroes who gave their lives to guard our home. My words not only hurt the reputation and honour of those soldiers, but of all PLA soldiers,” Qiu said.Qiu on Monday became the first person to be booked under the newly changed law on harming the reputation and honour of heroes and martyrs.The ruling Communist Party of China has been frequently criticised for airing confessions of suspects – including critics and activists – before their trial. However, Beijing has continued to do so despite critics calling it a violation of the rights of under-trials.In Qiu’s case, the telecast was aired in less than two weeks after he was detained for allegedly insulting the PLA troops on his Weibo account - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - where he has more than 2 million followers.Police in Nanjing, eastern China’s Jiangsu province, on Monday formally arrested Qiu, who had been in detention since February 20, for violating the law on defaming martyrs’ honour and reputation.Qiu’s is the first reported case of a suspect being charged with violating the law on defaming martyrs under the Criminal Law that came into effect on March 1 after China’s top judicial authorities added the new clause.“According to the supplementary articles, Qiu’s infringement of the reputation and honour of heroes shall be punished with a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention if the circumstances are serious,” the state media report said.In a 2020 report to the United Nations, rights groups, including Safeguard Defenders and Human Rights Watch, said the Communist Party forces critics into confessions that are then aired on state-run television, making a mockery of due process and the right to a fair trial.At least seven, including Qiu, have been arrested or detained for insulting PLA heroes and martyrs. The status of the remaining six is unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-airs-video-confession-of-blogger-booked-for-insulting-pla-soldiers-101614688887983.html
02-03-2021||World||Lebanese currency hits record low amid country's worsening crisis||The Lebanese pound hit a record low against the dollar on the black market on Tuesday as the country’s political crisis deepens with no prospects of new Cabinet in the near future and foreign currency reserves dwindle further.The dollar was trading at 9,975 Lebanese pounds around noon Tuesday. The previous record was registered in July, when the dollar briefly sold for 9,900 pounds on the black market. The official price remains 1,520 pounds to the dollar.Lebanon has been hammered by one crisis after another, starting with the outbreak of anti-government protests against the country’s corrupt political class in October 2019. That has been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic and a massive, deadly blast in Beirut’s port last August.In neighboring Syria — where the economy has been hit by the 10-year conflict, corruption and Western sanctions — the dollar also hit a record on Monday, reaching nearly 3,900 Syrian pounds. The economies of the two neighboring countries are connected and many Syrians have had their money blocked in Lebanese banks that have implemented harsh capital controls.The massive blast at Beirut’s port last August, when nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated, killed 211 people and injured more than 6,000. Large parts of the Lebanese capital were badly damaged in the blast.Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government resigned six days after the Aug. 4 blast, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. In October, former Prime Minister Saad Hariri was named to form a new Cabinet but nearly five months later, disagreements between him and President Michel Aoun on the shape of the Cabinet has stood in the way of a new government's formation.Lebanon has also been in desperate need for foreign currency but international donors have said they will only help the country financially if major reforms are implemented to fight widespread corruption, which has brought the nation to the brink of bankruptcy.The crash in the local currency will throw more people into poverty. In Lebanon, the minimum wage is 675,000 pounds, or about $67 a month. Before the protests broke out in 2019, the minimum wage was about 450$.The crisis has driven nearly half the population of the small country of 6 million into poverty. Over 1 million refugees from Syria live in Lebanon.In December, the World Bank warned that Lebanon’s economy faces an “arduous and prolonged depression,” with real GPD projected to plunge by nearly 20% because its politicians refuse to implement reforms that would speed up the country’s recovery.In March last year, Lebanon defaulted for the first time ever on a payment on its massive debt amid ongoing popular unrest. Lebanon’s debt reached $90 billion or 170% of GDP, making it one of the highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-currency-hits-record-low-amid-country-s-worsening-crisis-101614686502689.html

It immediately struck a chord in both India and Pakistan, sparking top trending hashtags on social media, and garnering millions of views and hundreds of spin-offs."It was the most random video. I initially had no intention of uploading it," Mobeen said, expressing surprise at how viral it had gone and adding the trend showed the power and reach of social media."Pawri" monologue renditions have been used by police in India and the Delhi Commission for Women in their social media outreach campaigns.In one video, two Indian soldiers deployed in snowy mountains give it their own spin with "This is us, this is our gun, and we are patrolling here", while popular Bollywood actors Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone each did a version that also went viral.Indian dairy company Amul, known for inculcating trendy takes on current issues in its advertisements, did a "this is our pav-tea" version https://twitter.com/Amul_Coop/status/1362262247809028100?s=20, in a nod to a popular bread snack eaten with tea.Even politicians jumped on the bandwagon, with a leader from India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party using the catchy hook at an election rally."I'm honoured and grateful for all the love across the border," said Mobeen, expressing her happiness at fostering some rare friendly cross-border dialogue.India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, have fought three wars and often had tense relations since gaining independence in 1947.Relations had most recently soured over developments in the northern region of Kashmir, which both countries control in parts but claim in full.Last week, their militaries released a rare joint statement saying they had agreed to observe a ceasefire along the disputed Kashmir border, after exchanging fire hundreds of times over past months.Since the video went viral, Mobeen said she has been inundated with acting and modelling offers, along with requests for product endorsements. Instead, she says she aspires to join Pakistan's foreign services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pawri-power-5-second-social-media-clip-pulls-india-pakistan-closer-101614686067101.html

The military took charge on February 1 and declared a year-long state of emergency following a general election which Suu Kyi's NLD party won by a landslide. The armed forces had backed the opposition which was demanding a rerun of the vote, claiming widespread fraud. The election commission had said that there was no evidence to support these claims after which the coup took place.Read more: Concerned by loss of lives in Myanmar, India calls for restraintWhere is Aung San Suu Kyi?Suu Kyi has been reportedly under house arrest in Naypyidaw, an isolated city that the military built during a previous dictatorship. She appeared in court via video-link on Monday. Suu Kyi is facing obscure criminal charges for possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies, as well as violating coronavirus restrictions by staging a campaign event during last year's election. She is now also accused of a violation of communications laws as well as intent to incite public unrest.

The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a reliable monitoring group, estimated that about 30 people had been killed by security forces since the coup on February 1. More than 1,100 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced since the coup, according to The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.How has the world reacted?Several world leaders and the United Nations have condemned the violence in the country.

02-03-2021||World||Media watchdog files lawsuit in Germany against Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi killing||An international media rights group has filed a complaint with German prosecutors against Saudi Arabia's crown prince and four other top officials accusing them of crimes against humanity over allegations they were involved in the killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, authorities said Tuesday.The German federal prosecutors office in Karlsruhe told The Associated Press that it received the complaint from Paris-based Reporters Without Borders on Monday.The complaint, relying partially on a newly declassified US intelligence report released Friday, identifies five primary suspects: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, his close adviser Saud Al-Qahtani and three other high-ranking Saudi officials, Reporters Without Borders said.They were identified for their “organizational or executive responsibility in Khashoggi's killing, as well as their involvement in developing a state policy to attack and silence journalists,” the group said in a statement.In the US report, intelligence officials stopped short of saying the Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s slaying in Turkey in October 2018, but described him as having “absolute control” over the kingdom’s intelligence organizations and said it would have been highly unlikely for an operation like the killing to have been carried out without his approval.Saudia Arabia's UN ambassador, Abdallah Al-Mouallimi, on Monday disputed the report, saying it didn't come “anywhere close” to proof of any allegations against the crown prince.Saudi Arabia's embassies in Berlin and Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Reporters Without Borders complaint.Under the German legal system, anyone can file an allegation with prosecutors and there is an obligation for them to look into the accusations. It is up to them to determine then whether they justify launching a full investigation.German law allows prosecutors to claim universal jurisdiction in crimes against humanity, and last week they secured the conviction of a former member of Syrian President Bashar Assad's secret police for his involvement in facilitating the torture of prisoners in his homeland.In that case, however, the defendant had been living in Germany. The Khashoggi case has no obvious connections to the country.“Those responsible for the persecution of journalists in Saudi Arabia, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, must be held accountable for their crimes,” Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in a statement. “While these serious crimes against journalists continue unabated, we call on the German prosecutor to take a stand and open an investigation into the crimes we have revealed."The US document released Friday said a 15-member Saudi team, including seven members of the prince’s elite personal protective team, arrived in Istanbul, though it says it’s unclear how far in advance Saudi officials had decided to harm him.Khashoggi had gone to the Saudi consulate to pick up documents needed for his wedding. Once inside, he died at the hands of more than a dozen Saudi security and intelligence officials and others who had assembled ahead of his arrival. Surveillance cameras had tracked his route and those of his alleged killers in Istanbul in the hours before his killing.A Turkish bug planted at the consulate reportedly captured the sound of a forensic saw, operated by a Saudi colonel who was also a forensics expert, dismembering Khashoggi’s body within an hour of his entering the building. The whereabouts of his remains is unknown.Besides the crown prince and his adviser, the complaint names Saudi Arabi's former deputy head of intelligence Ahmad Mohammed Asiri; Mohammad Al-Otaibi, the Consul General in Istanbul at the time of the murder; and intelligence officer Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/media-watchdog-files-lawsuit-in-germany-against-saudi-prince-over-khashoggi-101614684897244.html

02-03-2021||World||Xi mobilizes China for tech revolution to cut dependence on west||For US politicians, China’s potential to dominate sensitive cutting-edge technologies poses one of the biggest geopolitical threats of the next few decades. President Xi Jinping is similarly worried the US will block China’s rise, and this week will unveil plans for greater self-sufficiency.At an annual session of China’s legislature, top Communist Party leaders will approve a five-year policy blueprint to cut dependence on the West for crucial components like computer chips while also making big bets on emerging technologies from hydrogen vehicles to biotech. The push to mobilize trillions of dollars could help China surpass the US as the world’s biggest economy this decade and cement Xi’s goal of turning the nation into a superpower.“The most important thing is the magnitude of the ambition -- this is bigger than anything Japan, South Korea or the US ever did,” said Barry Naughton, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and one of the world’s top researchers on China’s economy. “The ambition is to push the economy through the gateway of a technological revolution.”The race to develop the most advanced technology is stoking US-China tensions following decades of integration that raised living standards around the globe. Now both countries are aiming for self-sufficiency in strategic areas, each fueled by fear the other wants to upend their political system: One that sees free speech and democracy as essential to prosperity, and another that puts one-party rule above individual liberty to deliver economic growth.At stake for Xi is more than just improving the lives of China’s 1.4 billion people, which is key to the Communist Party’s justification for effectively banning political opposition. He also wants to show the party can play a successful role in guiding the economy, particularly after US President Donald Trump’s administration sought to undermine its legitimacy to rule and destroy national champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China’s largest microchip manufacturer.Beijing’s confidence in its political system has grown after it quickly contained Covid-19 following delays by local officials in sharing information that allowed it to spread around the globe. Economists predict China’s economy will expand 8.3% this year, compared with 4.1% in the U.S. “The pandemic once again proves the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” Xi said last year. On Monday, he called the party’s “glorious traditions” a “precious spiritual treasure.”But the U.S. is now looking for allies to help thwart Xi’s aspirations, both through denying Beijing access to key technology and shoring up its own supplies of strategic goods. Last week, US President Joe Biden announced a wide-ranging supply-chain review of semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, rare-earth metals and high-capacity batteries, part of a broader plan to out-compete China that includes $2 trillion in infrastructure spending.“If we don’t get moving, they’re going to eat our lunch,” Biden told reporters in February after holding his first call with Xi. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis separately highlighted concerns that Beijing was giving unfair advantages to Chinese companies, telling Bloomberg Television last month that the bloc would cooperate with the US on challenges stemming “from the socio-economic model of China.”Global investors are closely watching the National People’s Congress session, which starts Friday and runs for about a week. While the Communist Party has shown it can quickly channel billions of dollars to control the supply chains of emerging sectors like solar power and electric vehicles, it has also swiftly reined in the private sector if risks escalate -- seen most recently by the 11th-hour halt of an initial public offering by billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co.Premier Li Keqiang will outline plans Friday to keep the economy humming over the next 12 months, which may include fresh measures to boost consumption even as he stops short of giving an official growth target for a second straight year. Perhaps more importantly, the legislative session will also reveal details of longer-term plans to develop more than 30 “choke-hold” technologies China currently can’t produce, from chipmaking equipment to mobile-phone operating systems to aircraft design software.The focus on technology is more urgent due to the waning efficiency of China’s economic model, which has relied on channeling credit into property investment and infrastructure to shore up growth. Yet with housing sales peaking as urbanization slows and local governments struggling to find viable infrastructure projects, Beijing must leverage technology to boost productivity in order to meet a 2035 target of doubling the size of its economy from 2020 levels.One key number to watch is spending on research and development: Authorities are expected to reveal a target that will match or exceed US annual spending of around 3% of gross domestic product. More will be allocated to state-funded research, with China’s Science and Technology Ministry announcing priority areas such as hydrogen energy, electric vehicles and supercomputing.From 2014 to 2019, China’s government raised at least 6.7 trillion yuan ($1 trillion) in a series of venture-capital funds to take stakes in hi-tech companies, according to estimates from Naughton at the University of California, San Diego. China has already announced plans to invest $1.4 trillion from 2020 to 2025 in high-tech infrastructure, from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to high-speed rail.“If that does end up paying off and Xi Jinping is able to engineer a more centrally steered growth model, then China will overcome the long list of challenges that it’s facing domestically,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “If the state-led model is as unproductive as many think it is, then China will have wasted a generation’s capital pursuing a dream of centrally planned technological innovation.”China’s record of success is mixed. ​An example of what Beijing has in mind is biotech, which barely existed in China a decade ago and was earmarked as a “strategic industry” in the most recent five-year plan. From 2016 to 2020, the market capitalization of publicly listed Chinese companies developing innovative drugs rose from $1 billion to $217 billion, according to McKinsey. In 2019, the first China-developed cancer treatment was approved in the U.S.​The main area in which China has struggled is chipmaking, with its top companies still at least five years behind global rivals. China’s five-year plan will include measures to boost financing for semiconductors, treating the sector with the same kind of priority it once accorded to building its atomic capability, Bloomberg News reported in September.But there’s no guarantee it will work -- and the avalanche of state-directed investment risks spawning bad debt that destabilizes China’s economy. A taste of such a possibility came last year, when state-owned Tsinghua Unigroup Co., whose investments in chip production failed to pay off, roiled financial markets by defaulting on $2.5 billion of debt.‘Dark Storm Clouds’To reduce waste, Beijing has signaled that it would continue to rely predominately on private companies to meet its technology goals through tax breaks, direct investment in startups and minority stakes in promising but financially troubled companies. Beijing also wants more investment from foreign companies such as Tesla Inc., as long as they help meet the goal of upgrading China’s technology.While the West sees Xi’s ambitions as a threat, Beijing’s push to achieve self-sufficiency is mainly a defensive move by the Chinese Communist Party, according to Meg Rithmire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.“If the CCP thought there were no dark storm clouds on the horizon,” she said, “I don’t think they would be taking such a heavy hand. It’s a risk-management mindset.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-mobilizes-china-for-tech-revolution-to-cut-dependence-on-west-101614680641104.html

02-03-2021||World||H-1B visa restructuring will be affected if US immigration bill is broken up||Increases in visas for highly skilled foreign workers could fall by the wayside this year if Democrats decide to overhaul immigration through a series of small bills instead of the sweeping one put forward by President Joe Biden.Biden’s immigration plan calls for dramatically boosting the number of green cards and expanding other avenues for high-skilled workers, a move welcomed by business interests, which have long sought reform of the H-1B visa and other programs.But House Democrats are weighing a piecemeal approach to immigration that would put more popular measures like helping refugees, agriculture workers and people brought to the US illegally as children first, leaving no leverage to push through less popular measures like increasing immigration for skilled workers.Tech leaders like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai want Congress to expand and update the H-1B visa system since demand for skilled workers in computer and information technology far outstrips the annual cap of 65,000. But that reform, once backed by lawmakers in both parties, now faces bipartisan skepticism, according to lawmakers.And without a strong advocate on Capitol Hill, any such measures could falter if asked to stand alone instead of as part of a large immigration package.Reform may be easier after pandemic is overRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said passing skilled worker visa reform during the pandemic-sparked economic crisis would be “pretty difficult.” And Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, who introduced Biden’s bill, said any additional foreign worker visas would only get support as part of a broader bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.“I’m happy to consider other things but the key is, how do I get the 11 million or parts thereof on a pathway?” Menendez said. “So it can’t just be high-tech visas and it can’t just be farm workers for growers.”Senate Democrats haven’t settled on a strategy for immigration, either, leaving reforms for high-skilled workers at risk.Support for expanding H-1B visas was broad-based in Congress for many years, as both parties courted business interests.The visas, often used in the tech industry, are available to workers who have specialized training and advanced education. Fashion models “of distinguished merit” are also eligible under a separate category. But industries want the cap expanded, and workers’ rights group argue that tying the visas to a specific employer hurts employees.The sweeping immigration bill Democrats proposed at Biden’s behest does not raise the annual cap on temporary worker visas. Instead, it expands the number of employment-based green cards available, a move that advocates say will take pressure off the guest worker programs like the H-1B visa.Xiao Wang, who heads Boundless Immigration Inc, a Seattle-based startup that works to streamline the immigration application process, said that the current system forces foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges to leave the country, taking their new skills with them. It also creates a bottleneck of skilled workers from India on H-1B visas who face country-based caps on getting green cards.Skilled worker visas a tough sellAny increase in H-1B visas will be a tough sell in the current Congress, amid potential opposition from labor unions on the left, a more hawkish stance on immigration on the right and a sour economy that makes bringing in workers from overseas seem unnecessary to voters.Biden has supported unions, which are generally skeptical of temporary work visas, throughout his long career in politics.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka warned lawmakers not to support immigration bills that would “expand programs that treat workers as disposable commodities in our global economy.”Meantime, Republicans are much less likely to support increases in high-skilled immigration than in the past, as the party shifted from a largely pro-business posture to a more restrictive stance on immigration under former President Donald Trump.Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller and other hardliners met with conservative House members last week to plot their opposition to Biden’s immigration proposal, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.Trump opposed most immigration as president, adopting restrictions that caused H-1B visa denials to grow from 6% in 2015 to 29% in mid-2020, according to an analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. Later, they were suspended entirely amid the coronavirus pandemic.Trump also hit Biden on immigration in a speech Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, signaling that Republicans plan to keep up their opposition.Republicans splintered on immigration after a 2007 overhaul collapsed in the Senate. Later, GOP lawmakers aligned with the anti-immigration Tea Party movement began winning seats and holding fast to their opposition.“You’ve lost a number of those more moderate Republicans who are probably more affected by the need for high-skilled visas, I think you’ve lost some of that for sure,” said John Sandweg, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Barack Obama, citing the absence of Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake.Wang said he’s doubtful that reforms will make it through “this round of policy making,” but he hopes that a strong economic recovery as the pandemic wanes could make it easier to return to the issue later.Sara Blackwell, a labor attorney in Florida who sued The Walt Disney Co over its use of H-1B visas, said that she hopes any changes include tougher requirements to ensure that big businesses aren’t abusing the system to bring in cheap labor from abroad. Since H-1B visas require a worker to have an employer to sponsor them, she argued that they make it difficult for foreign nationals to switch jobs, depressing their wages and hurting American workers in the same field.“I do think there should be more requirements on making sure no American workers are available, especially with Covid right now and people being out of work,” she said.The next steps will depend on whether the Senate tries to pass immigration reform all at once, where high skilled visa expansion could be included in a package, or by breaking it up into separate bills that would have to stand on their own.H-1B Visas could be part of Congress’s horse-tradingAsked if he supports more H-1B visas or green cards for skilled workers, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin said only if it’s part of the horse-trading necessary to get a bigger bill with a citizenship pathway and other provisions.“I’ll try to answer this tactfully: If it brings votes for final passage, it’s a priority,” the Illinois Democrat said in an interview.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden’s aides have not yet had “extensive conversations” with lawmakers on how his immigration proposal will move through Congress but indicated the package could change.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month signaled she would consider taking on immigration changes piece-by-piece while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Feb 23 that he prefers a comprehensive approach to “get as much done as possible.”And while some Republicans are balking at expanding skilled-worker visas without a broader proposal that invests more in border agents and interior enforcement -- a component that Biden didn’t address in his proposal -- others say it’s best to tackle each piece separately.“The problem with immigration is that everybody’s got their piece and they say, I have to have this or I can’t support it,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who is top Republican on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration. “And then it adds up and finally crumbles under its own weight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1b-visa-restructuring-will-be-affected-if-us-immigration-bill-is-broken-up-101614680196838.html
02-03-2021||World||China's electoral reform 'earthquake' set to upend Hong Kong politics||China's plan to dramatically reform Hong Kong's electoral system, expected to be unveiled in a parliamentary session in Beijing starting this week, will upend the territory's political scene, according to more than a dozen politicians from across the spectrum.The proposed reform will put further pressure on pro-democracy activists, who are already the subject of a crackdown on dissent, and has ruffled the feathers of some pro-Beijing loyalists, some of whom may find themselves swept aside by a new and ambitious crop of loyalists, the people said."It will be an earthquake shaking up local political interests," said one person briefed on the impending changes.The measures will be introduced at the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, which starts on Friday, according to media reports.The plan was signalled last week by senior Chinese official Xia Baolong, who said Beijing would introduce systemic changes to only allow what he called "patriots" to hold public office in Hong Kong.In a full transcript of his remarks published this week by the pro-Beijing Bauhinia Magazine, Xia said Hong Kong's electoral system had to be "designed" to fit with the city's situation and shut out what he called non-patriots, some of whom he described as "anti-China agitators" that would bring destruction and terror to the city - a reference to pro-democracy campaigners who took to the streets in sometimes violent demonstrations in 2019.Xia did not announce any specifics, but the plan will likely include changes to how the 70-seat Hong Kong legislature is elected, and the composition of a committee that will select Hong Kong's next leader, according to the person briefed on the plan and local media reports.Veteran democrats have been quick to condemn the plan."It totally destroys any hope for democracy in the future," said Lee Cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy former member of Hong Kong’s legislature. "The whole concept of Xia Baolong is that the Communist Party rules Hong Kong and only those that support the party can have any role."Lee learned of the impending reform last week, in the middle of his trial, along with a group of eight other pro-democracy activists, for unlawful assembly charges related to a protest in August 2019."It's no longer for people to decide," Lee told Reuters on a lunch break from the trial last week. "It's one party rule, completely."The prospect of further bending the electoral process to China’s liking has also worried some pro-Beijing figures, who think it may be going too far and ultimately hurt Hong Kong."Don't go too far and kill the patient," Shiu Sin-por, a pro-Beijing politician and former head of Hong Kong's Central Policy Unit, told reporters after a briefing session with Xia on the matter. The opposition camp has already been neutralised by last year’s national security law, Shiu said, allowing the government to "push forward policies smoothly."China's main liaison office in Hong Kong, and China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, did not respond to requests for comment.The Hong Kong government said in a statement that it was prioritising the implementation of the principle of "patriots ruling Hong Kong" and improving the electoral system, and that it will continue to listen to views on the matter.POLITICAL MATHEMATICSElectoral reform is the latest political tremor to hit Hong Kong, a former colony that Britain handed back to China in 1997, which retains some autonomy from Beijing and whose status as a global financial hub was built on the rule of law and civil liberties not allowed in mainland China.The city’s atmosphere has changed radically in the past 18 months. Mass street protests in 2019 against China's intensifying control prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law last June, which authorities have used to jail activists and stifle dissent.On Sunday, Hong Kong police charged 47 pro-democracy campaigners and activists with conspiracy to commit subversion for their roles in organising and participating in an unofficial primary election last July, the biggest single crackdown under the new law.Even though such arrests have already marginalised the pro-democracy camp, China wants to exert greater control over a voting process largely unchanged since 1997, and is still afraid of democrats winning a majority in the legislature at the next election, said the person briefed on the electoral reform plan."They did the mathematics and it was seen as too risky to do nothing," said the person.Two senior pro-Beijing politicians told Reuters the electoral reform plan, coming on top of the broader crackdown that has already provoked international criticism, would ultimately damage Hong Kong, potentially destroying its unique character, pluralism and attractiveness for investors."It's really sad that Hong Kong has degenerated to this stage," said one of the politicians, on the electoral reform. "We're handing Hong Kong over to the next generation in a worse state than we inherited it."The two pro-Beijing politicians spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, due to the sensitivity of the matter. It is rare for pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong to voice any doubt about China’s moves, even anonymously."Nothing is normal anymore,” said the second pro-Beijing politician. “It's a new abnormal."One faction that appears ready to benefit from electoral reform is the new Bauhinia Party, formed in May by Charles Wong and two other mainland-born, pro-Beijing businessmen, pushing policies that Wong says will help revive Hong Kong and its leadership."They (Beijing) never really have any opposition to what we do," Wong told Reuters in his 12th-floor seafront office last week.Wong, 56, was born in mainland China but came to Hong Kong as a youth and speaks fluent Cantonese, the local dialect. Describing himself as a "patriot," Wong embodies China's declared wish to have Hong Kong run at all levels by people with closer ties and sympathy with the mainland."We are Hong Kong people," he told Reuters. "We love Hong Kong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-electoral-reform-earthquake-set-to-upend-hong-kong-politics-101614663122752.html
02-03-2021||World||Egypt executes 11 convicted of murder||Egyptian authorities on Tuesday executed 11 people convicted of murder, a security source said, in the latest cases of what rights campaigners have labelled "a horrifying execution spree".Capital punishment for civilian convicts in Egypt, the most populous Arab country, is carried out by hanging."Eleven people were executed at Borg al-Arab prison" near the city of Alexandria, the security source told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity."They were all convicted in criminal murder cases" for killings in recent years in the Alexandria and Beheira governorates, he said.The latest executions came after five convicts, including three women, were also hanged Saturday, according to the source.Rights group Amnesty International in December condemned Egypt's "chilling rise in executions" under the reign of President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.Sisi rose to power following the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and has overseen a wide-ranging, ongoing crackdown aimed at quashing dissent.The London-based rights group said then that at least 57 men and women had been hanged in October and November of 2020."Egyptian authorities have embarked on a horrifying execution spree in recent months, putting scores of people to death, in some cases following grossly unfair mass trials," said Philip Luther, the group's Middle East and North Africa research director."The shocking death toll is likely to be an underestimate, as Egyptian authorities do not publish statistics on executions or the number of prisoners on death row," Amnesty added.New York-based Human Rights Watch at the time also lambasted Egypt's mounting "mass executions", and both groups urged authorities to "immediately halt executions".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-executes-11-convicted-of-murder-101614680269476.html
02-03-2021||World||Pakistan needs legislation to meet three outstanding FATF benchmarks: Report||Pakistan will have to make further legislation on at least two counts to meet three outstanding benchmarks of the 27-point action plan of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog FATF before the new June deadline, a media report said on Tuesday.The Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Pakistan on the grey list in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic. The new deadline was set by the FATF last month.Pakistan has been scrambling in recent months to avoid being added to a list of countries deemed non-compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations by the FATF, a measure that officials here fear could further hurt its ailing economy.The Dawn newspaper reported that the government will have to submit an updated report within a month to the FATF on the progress on legislation and other steps to be taken to address the outstanding concerns.Since the government had changed almost three dozen laws over the past year to meet the FATF requirements, there should not be any hurdle in the way of making two more amendments, the report said.Presiding over a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) on Anti-Money Laundering, Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh asked the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and chairman of the FATF Coordination Committee and Industries and Production Minister Hammad Azhar to immediately finalise the timelines for additional legislation in consultation with agencies of the federal government and the armed forces.The deadlines should be reasonable to be shared with the FATF and all agencies and stakeholders should act in close coordination to meet the deadlines well in advance, the report said.It was observed that Pakistan had made progress over the past two years and was being appreciated by the international community, but at the same time it did not send a good message when international commitments and deadlines were missed repeatedly, it said.The NEC was informed that Pakistan had to update the Paris-based global watchdog on financial crimes on the way forward and its timelines on the basis of observations of FATF plenary and shortcomings pointed out by the FATF assessors within 30 days.The additional legislation has to cover some weaknesses in the existing framework that limited the authorities from taking action, including imposing sanction or apprehending those acting for or on behalf of designated terrorist entities or individuals and prosecuting targeted persons and entities or those working for them, within certain deadlines.The three outstanding action points include demonstrating that Terrorism Financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities and demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.Thirdly, Pakistan has to demonstrate effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, specifically those acting for or on their behalf, the report said.An official statement said FMU Director General Lubna Malik briefed the committee on the overall progress achieved on the FATF action plan and outlined efforts under the way for the remaining targets to be achieved in due course of time.She said Pakistan had received support for making strides vis-a-vis an exigent action plan given by the FATF.Sources said the meeting was also informed that reasonable progress had already been achieved on one out of three remaining points, but two areas that required additional legislation would be time-consuming.Acknowledging the progress demonstrated by the relevant stakeholders, finance minister Shaikh called for expediting efforts to fulfil the requirements in the remaining areas."The strict adherence to timelines would culminate into the successful completion of the FATF action plan,” he said.In February last year, the FATF gave Pakistan, which missed 13 targets, a four-month grace period to complete its 27-point action plan against ML&TF committed with the international community.In its third plenary held virtually in June, the FATF decided to keep Pakistan in the grey list as Islamabad failed to check the flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey list', it is increasingly becoming difficult for the country to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union, thus further enhancing problems for the nation which is in a precarious financial situation.If the FATF in its meeting finds that Pakistan has failed to meet its requirements, there is every possibility that the global body may put the country on the 'Black List' along with North Korea and Iran.The FATF is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-needs-legislation-to-meet-three-outstanding-fatf-benchmarks-report-101614669450193.html

02-03-2021||World||Explainer: Japan to try US men accused of helping Ghosn flee||Two Americans suspected of helping former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn skip bail and escape to Lebanon in December 2019 have been extradited to Japan.Michael Taylor and his son Peter had been held in a suburban Boston jail since May. They were handed over to Japanese custody on Monday and arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday.Ghosn, who led Nissan Motor Co. for more than two decades, was arrested in 2018, and charged with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust in diverting Nissan money for personal gain. He says he is innocent.WHAT ARE THE FATHER AND SON ACCUSED OF DOING?Michael Taylor, with the help of another man, George-Antoine Zayek, hid Ghosn in a large black box supposedly containing audio equipment, according to the authorities. The box passed through airport security in Osaka, central Japan, and was loaded onto a private jet that flew Ghosn to Turkey. Peter Taylor is accused of meeting with Ghosn and helping his father carry out the escape. Authorities say the Taylors were paid at least $1.3 million.WHERE WILL THEY BE TAKEN AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE?The Taylors, like other suspects, can be held up to 23 days without any formal charges at the Tokyo Detention Center on the outskirts of the capital and questioned for hours almost daily by prosecutors, without a lawyer present. Their lawyer can visit and they can receive snacks and books. The detention can be extended with “rearrests,” if more charges are tagged on. Ghosn spent more than 100 days at the center before gaining his release on bail. The solitary cells are simple, with Japanese-style futon mattresses. The center, which is different from prisons for people who have been convicted, also has an exercise area and clinic.IS THIS THE ROUTINE TREATMENT OF SUSPECTS IN JAPAN?The Japanese treatment of suspects has been widely criticized as “hostage justice,” designed to coerce suspects to confess and often resulting in false confessions. The Taylors’ lawyers in the U.S. say they worry they may be treated unfairly in Japan and subjected to “mental and physical torture.” They also argue that jumping bail is not a crime under Japanese law. That is technically accurate, but most people who escape are easily caught in Japan. Japanese prosecutors say they have enough evidence to convict the Taylors.WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED IF THEY GO ON TRIAL?Even after formal charges are filed, closed-door pre-trial sessions by the prosecutors and defendants before a judge generally go on for months. The media have no access to such sessions. Jury trials exist in Japan, but only for murders and other heinous crimes. A panel of three judges will hear the Taylors' case in a trial that could last months or even years. English translation will be provided during the trial. Media coverage is allowed, but no filming or recording. If convicted, the Taylors face up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 300,000 yen ($2,900). They could get a suspended sentence and not serve time. In principle, just as in the U.S., people are presumed innocent until proven guilty. But 99% of criminal trials end in convictions.WHERE IS CARLOS GHOSN AND CAN HE BE TRIED?Japan has put Ghosn on Interpol's wanted list, but Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Extradition from the U.S. isn’t common, so the extradition of the Taylors for an alleged nonviolent crime reflects the determination of Japanese prosecutors to pursue the case against Ghosn. Ghosn is almost certain to be extradited if he sets foot in the U.S. Former Nissan senior executive Greg Kelly is on trial in Tokyo on charges he helped under-report Ghosn’s compensation. Kelly, an American, says he is innocent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-japan-to-try-us-men-accused-of-helping-ghosn-flee-101614679242288.html

02-03-2021||World||US poised to sanction Russia over its treatment of Kremlin critic Navalny||The Biden administration is preparing to impose sanctions against Russia over the poisoning and jailing of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, according to three congressional aides briefed on the plans.The sanctions will be unveiled as early as Tuesday, the aides said, offering no specifics and describing the moves on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. The measures will involve the State, Treasury and Commerce Departments, according to one aide.The measures, if carried out, would be the first ordered by President Joe Biden against Russia and would set the tone for relations with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The White House had no immediate comment on Monday night.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday US sanctions policy “doesn’t attain its goal.” The ruble fell the most among emerging-market currencies on Tuesday, coming under pressure as investors sold riskier assets and crude oil fell for a fourth straight day.Navalny returned to Russia in January after being treated in Germany for a nerve agent attack. He was detained shortly after landing at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Western governments and Navalny have accused the Kremlin of being behind the attempted assassination. Russia denies that and has said that Navalny’s imprisonment is an internal matter.Last month, Biden called for Navalny’s release, saying he was “targeted for exposing corruption and should be released immediately and without condition.”Since then, Navalny has been sentenced and begun serving a two-and-a-half-year term. Last week, he was moved to a notorious penal camp in the Vladimir region about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of the Russian capital.On Monday, European Union ambassadors approved sanctions against four senior Russian law enforcement officials over Navalny’s detention, according to three people familiar with the decision. The measures are expected to be formally adopted by the bloc’s 27 members later this week, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to discuss a private process.During his first call with the Russian leader, in late January, Biden said he “made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor that the days the United States rolling over in the face of Russia’s aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning citizens are over.”Biden called the jailing of Navalny “politically motivated.” His administration also has Moscow in its sights for what U.S. intelligence agencies indicate was Russia’s likely role in the SolarWinds Corp. cyber attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-poised-to-sanction-russia-over-its-treatment-of-kremlin-critic-navalny-101614679218231.html

02-03-2021||World||Nigeria: Kidnappers free all abducted schoolgirls||Gunmen have freed all 279 girls kidnapped from a boarding school in northwest Nigeria, the governor of Zamfara state said on Tuesday, as one of the victims told Reuters how their abductors had beaten her and her schoolmates with their weapons.According to earlier reports, 317 girls from the Government Girls Science Secondary (GGSS) School in the town of Jangebe were abducted by an armed gang at around 1am on Friday.Zamfara state spokesman Sulaiman Tanau Anka told Reuters that some of the missing girls had run into the bush at the time of the assault, and the number of those kidnapped was 279. All had now been freed, Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle said.Reuters journalists in Zamfara's state capital, Gusau, saw dozens of girls in Muslim veils sitting in a hall in a state government building. A few parents arrived later, and one father wept with joy after seeing his daughter.Most of the girls appeared to be unharmed, but at least a dozen were sent to hospital for treatment. The girls were mostly barefoot, and several had injuries to their feet.Farida Lawali, 15, told how she and the other girls had been taken to a forest, with the kidnappers carrying those unable to walk."They carried the sick ones that cannot move. We were walking in the stones and thorns," she said, sitting in the government house building, covered in a light blue veil."They started hitting us with guns so that we could move," she added. "While they were beating them with guns, some of them were crying and moving at the same time."News of the girls' release brings "overwhelming joy", President Muhammadu Buhari said. "I am pleased that their ordeal has come to a happy end without any incident."One father, whose seven daughters were among those kidnapped and freed, said the incident would not deter him from schooling his children."It's a ploy to deny our girls ... from getting the Western education in which we are far behind," Lawal Abdullahi told Reuters. "We should not succumb to blackmail. My advice to government is that they should take immediate precautions to stop further abductions."On Monday, state officials said they were in talks with the kidnappers.Schools have become targets for mass kidnappings for ransom in northern Nigeria by armed criminal groups, in a trend started by the jihadist group Boko Haram, and later its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province.The government has repeatedly denied paying ransoms. But Buhari on Friday urged state governments "to review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously".The raid in Zamfara state was the second such kidnapping in little over a week in the northwest, a region increasingly targeted by criminal gangs. On Saturday, gunmen released 27 teenage boys who were kidnapped from their school on Feb. 17 in the north-central state of Niger.In 2014, Boko Haram abducted more than 270 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok, in Nigeria's most high profile school kidnapping. Around 100 of them remain missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-kidnappers-free-all-abducted-schoolgirls-101614678032163.html
02-03-2021||World||Pandemic-consumed US relapses in drug addiction||Beverly Veres' two sons are addicted to heroin but can't get the help they need, with US health services consumed by the coronavirus pandemic at a time when overdoses are surging."Drugs have just come into this area, and are taking over," says Veres at her Pennsylvania home. "(But) they're not focusing on anything else but Covid," she adds of the authorities.Veres, her husband Steve, and their sons Douglas, 24, and Charles, 29, live in a small house in Houtzdale, a town in rural Clearfield County far from the cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.Coronavirus has officially killed 114 people in this isolated, forested area, where the epidemic is much less visible than in nearby towns.Beverly and Steve say they have only had one contact with someone who had the virus, compared to "a dozen interactions" with people with drug problems.After seeing their sons descend into heroin abuse last summer, the couple is convinced that the pandemic has exacerbated the drug problem in their area.Figures for overdose deaths are not complete for 2020 but the 19 already recorded in the county is higher than in 2018 or 2019.The upward trend is true across the United States.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the number of deaths from overdoses -- mainly because of opiate drugs that have flooded the United States in recent years -- increased by almost 25 percent between July 2019 and July 2020.- 'Downward slide' -Beverly says her younger son Douglas had a long history of drug addiction but was "able to function."He switched to methamphetamines and then last July heroin, resulting in "a downward slide."Incarcerated in early 2020 for driving under the influence of drugs, Douglas did not receive any addiction treatment in prison because of Covid, says Beverly.A drug rehabilitation program that he attempted after his release failed to work in part because family visits and therapy sessions were cut due to the pandemic, she said."I think if we would have gotten to see him and we would have been able to have some type of family counseling with him, (then) we could have helped him along the way," added the 49-year-old auditor.A few miles (kilometers) away in the community of Olanta, Savannah Johnson -- a 26-year-old former drug addict -- explains that she risked relapse at the start of the pandemic.In early 2020, after a year of treatment and unable to resume her nursing profession, Johnson took a small job in a pizzeria. She lost it with the pandemic.Suddenly Johnson was isolated at home with no job and unable to hang out with recovering friends."Those little things, even though they might seem little to somebody else, to a recovering addict are huge," she told AFP.Isolated, she began to reminisce about her time on drugs."You start thinking, 'I wasn't so depressed. I didn't feel so anxious. I was more sociable.' Once you think about that for so long it really does cause you to want to go use now," Johnson said.She suffered six overdoses in 2019 and survived thanks to the Narcan opioid antidote.Johnson has been clean for 13 months now and credits her recovery to her parents, who she now lives with and who have custody of her two young children.- 'Overwhelmed' -The house has become "quite chaotic," said Savannah's mother Bobbie Johnson, who has absolutely no regrets."Her being here and seeing her growth and seeing her rebuild that relationship with her kids, it's priceless, best thing ever," Bobbie said.Bobbie is well aware of the increased difficulties of drug addicts during the pandemic due to her role as local leader of "Parents of Addicted Loved Ones," of which Beverly and Steve Veres are also members.Kim Humphrey, the association's CEO, says the pandemic has caused a "complete explosion" of drug addiction in the United States."You can't get a job... you can't go anywhere, you can't do this, you can't do that. So you can see how the mind of somebody that's in this would go, 'Well, you know, I'll just use something to take away the pain," said Humphrey.The opioid crisis has caused about half a million deaths in the United States since 1999, including 50,000 in 2019 alone.But before the pandemic, it appeared to be stabilizing."We were starting to make some progress but some of that is being lost," said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials."The pandemic has become all consuming. Everybody's just kind of overwhelmed," he told AFP.The pandemic, though, has highlighted some of the "difficult social situations" and "real disparities," which may help the drugs fight in the long run, Plescia added."One of the positives maybe that we now have a society that is perhaps better able to begin to address those issues," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemicconsumed-us-relapses-in-drug-addiction-101614677678097.html
02-03-2021||World||Syrian victims of 2013 chemical attacks file case with French prosecutors||Lawyers representing survivors of a chemical weapons attack in 2013 in Syria have filed a criminal complaint against Syrian officials whom they blame for the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a rebel-held area.France is home to thousands of Syrian refugees, and its investigating judges have a mandate to determine whether crimes against humanity were committed anywhere in the world.The case, which about a dozen people have joined, follows a similar one opened in Germany last year. It offers a rare legal avenue for action against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.Attempts by Western powers to set up an international tribunal for Syria have been blocked by Russia and China at the UN Security Council."This is important so that the victims have the possibility to see those responsible being brought to justice and held accountable," Mazen Darwish, who heads the Paris-based Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), told Reuters.The SCM filed the complaint along with two other NGOs: the Open Society Foundation’s Justice Initiative and Syrian Archive.France's intelligence services concluded in 2013 that a sarin gas attack on the Eastern Ghouta region just south east of Damascas that killed 1,400 people had been carried out by Syrian government forces.The Syrian government denies it has used chemical weapons against its own civilians.The complaint is based on what the lawyers say is the most comprehensive body of evidence on the use of substances such as sarin gas in Syria.They include testimonies from survivors and defectors, an analysis of the Syrian military chain of command, and hundreds of items of documentary evidence, including photos and videos."We have compiled extensive evidence establishing exactly who is responsible for these attacks on Douma and Eastern Ghouta, whose horrific effects continue to impact survivors," said Hadi al Khatib, founder and director of Syrian Archive.A UN-commissioned investigation to identify those behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria concluded in 2016 that Syrian government forces had used chlorine and sarin gas.Darwish said he expected another case to be opened in Sweden in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-victims-of-2013-chemical-attacks-file-case-with-french-prosecutors-101614677078939.html

CDC chief Dr Rochelle Walensky also told CNN that the average death rate has increased due to the spread of the new variants.Dr Walensky asked the people "to be strong", "continue wearing face masks" and follow the other protocols needed to prevent themselves from the disease. She also expressed concern about the relaxations being offered in some states. "We stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we have gained," she said.Among the new variants that are spreading fast in the US is the one that emerged in New York City in November. So far, 735 cases of the new variant have been identified, including 585 in the last two weeks, according to federal health officials.The mutation has travelled extensively through the metropolitan New York region, and individual cases have also been found in 14 other states, including Texas, Wyoming and Maryland, Gregory Armstrong, director of the CDC's Advanced Molecular Detection Programme, told Bloomberg.Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, said at a briefing on Monday that the variant is known scientifically as B.1.526 and it started off in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. It is one of five concerning variants now being tracked nationally by health officials.Twenty nine out of 50 states reported more new infections last week compared to the previous seven days, whereas only seven states in the prior week reported weekly increases, according to analysis by news agency Reuters.New York had the highest number of new cases per 100,000 residents last week, followed by New Jersey and South Carolina, said Reuters.As of Sunday, 15% of the US population has received at least one dose of a vaccine and 7.5% has received two doses, according to the CDC. The country administered an average of 1.6 million shots per day last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-concerned-over-spread-of-covid-19-variants-says-all-recent-gains-will-be-lost-101614677300032.html

He is also concerned about the support of Afghan Pashtuns to PTM in social media, reported Gandahara British website on April 11, 2018.Durand Line was fixed by British civil servant Sir Henry Mortimer Durand and the then Afghan Emir, Abdur Rahman Khan in 1893. It was established in order to mark the respective spheres of influence and also to improve the diplomatic ties between the British establishment in India and the Afghan Kingdom. Afghanistan has opposed the move since then.For Pakistan Durand Line is a vital subject, the disputed areas (Durand Line) include almost 60 per cent of the country, while for Afghanistan, it is about losing Pashtun's territory and two to three per cent of the population of its largest tribe, reported Afghanistan Times.Earlier, former President Hamid Karzai in a conference in Kabul said that Pakistan's attacks (on the areas located across the Durand Line) "could be to press the people of Afghanistan to set on negotiations on Durand Line and recognize the Line," Karzai said.He further said that any kind of effort to prevent development in Afghanistan and pave the ground for Durand Line's recognition would fail.Forty years ago Afghanistan experienced its second military coup d'etat within five years. This was a golden chance for the Pakistani government to destabilize the Afghan government, abolish the government's infrastructure and the national army. This would ensure that Afghanistan would not be as powerful to lopsidedly determine the borders with Pakistan, reported Afghanistan Times.With the establishment of Mujahideen in 1992, Pakistan reached its goal to destroy the country's infrastructure, security forces and eventually placed the Taliban in power.With the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in 2001, the policy regarding Durand Line was that resolving the issue lies on the tribes living on the two sides and that the Afghan government is not authorized to make any decision about it, reported Afghanistan Times.The possibility of declaring their political independence and forming an independent country by the Pashtuns and Balochs appears high, and therefore, it seems impossible for Pakistan to agree on, reported Afghanistan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pashtun-demand-for-greater-afghanistan-could-ignite-nation-s-rivalry-with-pak-101614674811157.html
02-03-2021||World||FBI chief Christopher Wray to face questions on extremism, US Capitol riot||FBI Director Chris Wray is set to testify for the first time since the deadly Jan. 6 deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, with lawmakers likely to press him on whether the bureau adequately communicated with other law enforcement agencies about the potential for violence that day.Questions about the FBI's preparations for the riot, and investigations into it, are expected to dominate Wray's appearance Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He's also likely to be pressed on how the FBI is confronting the national security threat from white nationalists and domestic violent extremists, and whether the bureau has adequate resources to address the problem.The violence at the Capitol made clear that a law enforcement agency that revolutionized itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to deal with international terrorism is now scrambling to address homegrown violence from white Americans. The Biden administration has tasked his national intelligence director to work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to assess the threat.Wray has kept a notably low profile since a violent mob of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol two months ago. Though he has briefed lawmakers privately and shared information with local law enforcement hearings, Tuesday's oversight hearing will mark Wray's first public appearance before Congress since before November's presidential election.The FBI is facing questions over how it handled intelligence in the days ahead of the riot, and whether warnings it had of potential violence reached the correct officials.Last week, for instance, the acting chief of the Capitol Police said a Jan. 5 report from the FBI made its way to investigators within the police force and to the department’s intelligence unit but was never sent up the chain of command. The report warned about concerning online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington the following day. The FBI has said the report, which it says was based on uncorroborated information, was shared through its joint terrorism task force.Wray may also face questions about the FBI's investigation into the massive Russian hack of corporations and U.S. government agencies, which happened when elite hackers injected malicious code into a software update.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-chief-christopher-wray-to-face-questions-on-extremism-capitol-riot-101614663745748.html

He re-emerged in January with a 50-second video appearance.China's current richest man, Zhong, made his first appearance at the top spot largely thanks to the share price performances of Nongfu Spring and vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, which he also controls.Tencent's Ma saw his wealth swell 70% over the year to 480 billion yuan ($74.16 billion) while Pinduoduo's Huang's fortune grew 283% to 450 billion yuan, the list said. In comparison, the wealth of Ma and his family grew 22%, to 360 billion yuan.Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok owner ByteDance, broke into the top five rankings among Chinese billionaires in Hurun's Global Rich List for the first time, with an estimated personal wealth of $54 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jack-ma-loses-title-as-china-s-richest-man-after-coming-under-beijing-s-scrutiny-101614674724207.html

Historically, we have been closer to India. China is also our friend but we don't interact with them that much because they lie on the other side of the Himalayas," said former Nepal PM."Nepal is going through a crisis. Nepal Communist Party that had formed a government with a majority is almost divided into two factions...This is not right for a country's democracy when Parliament is dissolved midway to give way to instability," he said.Asked whether Nepal's ties have strained with India, the former PM said, "India and Nepal have not been able to talk on a high political level. BJP came to power (in 2014) in India in recent past and democracy arrived in Nepal around that time. Talks should be held between the major political parties of the two countries to bring back relation on track.""Also, we need to further strengthen people to people tie between India and Nepal," he added.On the question of political instability in Nepal, Bhattarai said, "This is all happening because democracy arrived a bit late in Nepal. The partial change started in the 1950s. But complete change happened in 2015. Because of this, revolution and counter-revolution are taking place. This is how democracy will flourish. ...All major parties will have to collectively find a democratic solution."Finding a way out of the crisis, former PM Bhattarai stated that, "We will talk to all parties in Nepal to bring stability, economic development and ensure that India-Nepal relations are good. This is our main agenda."Earlier this month, Nepal's Supreme Court reinstated the House of Representatives, which had been dissolved by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in December last year that led the country into a political crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-beijing-only-new-delhi-nepal-s-ex-pm-says-indo-nepal-ties-remain-strong-101614674336621.html
02-03-2021||World||With first dose, PM Modi joins ranks of world leaders vaccinated against Covid||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 70, on Monday became one of the few prominent world leaders to have received the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Among the Group of 20 countries, PM Modi is only the ninth leader to receive at least the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.Among the first was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 71, closely followed by US President Joe Biden, 78. Netanyahu was the first Israeli to be inoculated. He was administered the vaccine developed Pfizer-BioNTech on live TV as the Prime Minister said he wanted to set a “personal example” to encourage other Israelis to get the shot.Biden received his first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December last year, a month before being officially sworn in. He also took the vaccine on live television to counter vaccine hesitancy in the US, which is the worst-affected by the virus in the world, in a marked contrast to the mixed messages sent by former president Donald Trump. Also Read | PM Modi gets first shot as second leg of inoculation drive begins“I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine,” Biden had told reporters in Newark, Delaware, where he got the jab. “There’s nothing to worry about.” He received the second jab in early January. PM Modi’s first jab follows that of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who also took the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. “Pleased to get my #COVID19 vaccine today along with Australia’s CMO Professor Paul Kelly to give further confidence to Australians in these vaccines, which have been tested and approved by our medical experts, are safe and effective,” PM Morrison, 52, wrote on Twitter after receiving the shot in late February. Saudi King Salman, 85, received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine in early January, three weeks after the kingdom started its vaccination programme. The country’s health ministry said the inoculations would be rolled out in three phases, starting with people over 65 and those with chronic ailments or at high risk of infection. His son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, considered the de facto leader of the country, was administered the vaccine in December. After the crown prince, 35, received his first jab of the Pfizer vaccine, registrations in Saudi Arabia to receive the vaccine increased five-fold, according to minister of health Dr Tawfiq Al-Rabiah. In January, President Alberto Fernandez, 61, received the first dose of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine in January, a day after Argentina’s health regulator cleared the vaccine for use among those aged 60 and above. Also Read | US downplays possibility of sharing Covid-19 vaccines with MexicoTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also received the first dose of a vaccine in January in front of TV cameras. He received a shot of the Chinese-developed Sinovac. “I believe it will be vital for political leaders and deputies to encourage the vaccination drive (by getting vaccinated) themselves,” Erdogan told reporters after receiving the vaccine.Indonesian President Joko Widodo, 59, also received his first dose of the Sinovac vaccine in January, after the country approved the vaccine and began its efforts to vaccinate the population. He was vaccinated along with top leaders across the country and even social media influencers in an effort to encourage people to take the vaccine when it is available to them. South African President Cyril Rampahosa was one of the first citizens to vaccinated, in January, with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, which was also rolled out for health case workers. His vaccination was broadcast on live TV to build confidence among people. At the time, Johnson & Johnson was not authorised anywhere in the world and Ramaphosa effectively joined an observational study by taking the jab. Vaccine shot awaitedLeaders of the major European countries, the European Union bloc, Japan, South Korea are facing flak for the slow vaccine roll-outs in their countries. Prime Minster Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Prime Minister Moon Jae In of South Korea have been overseeing the vaccination of frontline workers, which have only recently begun. They have not yet been vaccinated themselves. In Europe, most countries began by vaccinating either the elderly or health workers. Both French President Emmanuel Macron, 43, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 66, have said they will wait for their turn to be vaccinated. There is no news on when recently sworn-in Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is expected to receive the vaccine.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, 49, will also wait for vaccinations in the general category to take his shot. “We obviously have to give priority to the most vulnerable but the second I have a chance, like all healthy adults, I will do so very visibly and with enthusiasm,” Trudeau told French-language broadcaster Radio-Canada in December. Also Read | Chinese vaccines sweep much of the world, despite concernsWhile UK approved its first vaccines three weeks before the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56, is yet to receive the vaccine. Press secretary Allegra Stratton said in December that PM Johnson would not jump the queue and take the vaccine before those in greater need. “I think we also know that he wouldn’t want to take a jab that should be for someone who is extremely vulnerable, clinically vulnerable and who should be getting it before him,” she said. Johnson spent several days in intensive care in April last year after contracting Covid-19. Mexico started vaccinated people over the age of 60 with Sputnik V in mid-February. So far, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 67, has not been vaccinated.Despite actively encouraging the use of Sputnik V globally, President Vladimir Putin has not taken the vaccine yet. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin is following a vaccination schedule that requires him to take other shots first, including against flu and pneumococcal infections, before he can decide to have Sputnik V.It is still unclear whether President Xi Jinping of China, where the virus first emerged, has received the Covid-19 vaccine. China was the first country to begin vaccinations in July last year and has approved five local vaccines since then. However, there is no official comment on whether President Xi has taken any vaccine or whether he intends to take it soon. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, likened to Donald Trump, has said as early as last year that he will not take the vaccine. “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s my right,” he said in November last year. The president has been calling the virus a “small flu” and has been fighting virus-related restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic. Brazil is the second-worst affected country in the world.Other world leadersSome world leaders outside the G20, such as Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan and UAE Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have been publicly inoculated.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, his family and several senior North Korean officials have also been vaccinated, a US analyst said in December, citing two unidentified Japanese intelligence sources. “Kim Jong Un and multiple other high-ranking officials within the Kim family and leadership network have been vaccinated for coronavirus within the last two to three weeks thanks to a vaccine candidate supplied by the Chinese government,” Harry Kazianis, a North Korea expert at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, wrote in an article for online outlet 19FortyFive.In October, Kim had told the audience at a military parade that “not a single person” in North Korea had contracted the coronavirus.Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo on Monday became the first recipient of a Covid-19 vaccine under the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (Covax) scheme. The global initiative aimed at providing vaccines to poorer countries is using at least 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India. “It is important that I set the example that this vaccine is safe by being the first to have it,” he said. PM Modi was given Covaxin, the vaccine developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech Limited, at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). He was vaccinated on the first day of the second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive that has been rolled out across the nation. In this phase, people above 60 years of age and those in the 45 years to 59 years age group with co-morbidities are being inoculated. “Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!” he wrote on Twitter after getting the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-first-dose-pm-modi-joins-ranks-of-world-leaders-vaccinated-against-covid-101614674367302.html
02-03-2021||World||US downplays possibility of sharing Covid-19 vaccines with Mexico||The Biden administration on Monday downplayed the prospect of sharing coronavirus vaccines with Mexico, saying it is focused first on getting its own population protected against a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans.The remarks by White House press secretary Jen Psaki came before a video conference between Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and US President Joe Biden, in which the Mexican leader was expected to ask the United States to consider sharing some of its Covid-19 vaccine supply."The administration's focus is on ensuring that every American is vaccinated. And once we accomplish that objective, we're happy to discuss further steps," Psaki said at a White House news conference.Biden told reporters that the two leaders would discuss the issue at the meeting's outset. But an official statement released after the meeting ended made no mention of vaccine distribution.Biden has predicted the United States will have enough supply by late July to inoculate all Americans. US authorities have administered 76.9 million doses to date, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), enough for 23% of the population to get the two doses recommended for full protection under the vaccines that have been deployed so far.Mexico has vaccinated roughly 2.5 million doses so far, enough for about 1% of the population, according to data compiled by Reuters officials have been frustrated by bottlenecks in supply and raised concerns that wealthy countries are hoarding vaccines.Loprez Obrador said at a news conference before the meeting that he would ask Biden to share the vaccines it has. Mexico would repay Washington once pharmaceutical companies have delivered on their orders, according to Reuters reporting.In a joint statement released after the meeting, the two countries said they would deepen their cooperation on Covid-19 response.They also said they would work together on immigration policies "that recognize the dignity of migrants and the imperative of orderly, safe, and regular migration."Lopez Obrador is pushing for more US work permits for Mexicans and Central Americans, including professionals.The two countries also said they would try to cooperate on efforts to slow climate change and would restart high-level diplomatic talks on trade and labor rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-downplays-possibility-of-sharing-covid-19-vaccines-with-mexico-101614671823667.html
02-03-2021||World||Victims of anti-Asian attacks reflect a year into pandemic||Nearly a year after they were almost stabbed to death inside a Midland, Texas, Sam's Club, Bawi Cung and his two sons all have visible scars.It's the unseen ones though that are harder to get over. Cung can’t walk through any store without constantly looking in all directions. His 6-year-old son, who now can't move one eyebrow, is afraid to sleep alone.On a Saturday evening in March, when Covid-19 panic shopping gripped the nation, Cung was in search of rice at a cheaper price. The family was in the Sam's Club meat section when Cung suddenly felt a punch to the back of his head. A man he didn't know then slashed his face with a knife. The assailant left but soon returned to stab the boys. He wounded the 3-year-old in the back and slashed the 6-year-old from his right eye to a couple of inches past his right ear.The grisly encounter brought home the dangerous climate Asian Americans have faced since the coronavirus entered the US, with racially motivated harassment and assaults occurring from coast to coast.Now, just over a year and thousands of incidents later, some of the early victims find moving forward has been difficult or, at best, bittersweet. A recent wave of attacks on elderly Asian Americans — including the death of an 84-year-old San Francisco man — has fueled worries that hostilities have only worsened.In Cung's case, the man responsible for the attack believed the Myanmar man and his children were Chinese and spreading the virus, according to the FBI.Cung said he’s not sure what would have happened had a Sam’s Club employee, Zach Owen, not intervened.“Maybe I might kill him. Maybe he might kill all of my family. I don’t know,” Cung said. “God protected my family, God sent Zach to protect my family right there at the right time.”Owen, who was stabbed in the leg and deeply cut in his right palm, and an off-duty Border Patrol agent detained the suspect, Jose Gomez, 19.Verbal attacks have also made a lasting mark.In April, a confrontation in a Richmond, California, park left an irrevocable impact not just on Kelly Yang, 36, but her children. She was forced to discuss anti-Asian racism with her son, 10, and daughter, 7 — a talk she didn't think would happen for a few more years. An elderly white couple, upset over her unleashed dog, called Yang, who is Chinese American, an “Oriental” and said the words many Asian Americans dread: “Go back where you came from.”Her children thought the couple meant for them to go home. Torn, Yang eventually explained they meant “for us to go back to Asia.""It means that we’re not welcome here.”Her son burst into tears.Yang believes the couple felt emboldened by then-President Donald Trump’s use of racially charged terms like “Chinese virus." She applauded President Joe Biden's recent executive order condemning anti-Asian xenophobia as a good start. But Yang is afraid a lot of non-Asians have already shrugged off the issue as though it ceased when Trump's presidency did.“I don’t know what can be done,” said Yang, who writes young adult novels and plans to weave her experience into her next book. “But I do know talking about it, acknowledging it, remembering — that’s what we do with wars — we have to remember what happened.”Douglas Kim, 42, chef and owner of Jeju Noodle Bar in New York City, is certain COVID-19-fueled racism was behind the April vandalizing of his Michelin-starred, Korean restaurant. Someone used a Sharpie to scrawl on the winter vestibule “Stop eating dogs,” referring to a stereotype about Asian cuisines. Ultimately, Kim decided not to report it.“At the time it pissed me off, but I have more important things to worry about," Kim said. "Maintaining a business is more important.”He shared a picture of the graffiti on Instagram to call attention to hate crimes. There was a groundswell of support, but he feels like much of it has faded.Yet, Kim is hopeful fewer people are stereotyping Asian Americans as foreigners who don't belong in the U.S.“I think it’s all about education,” Kim said. “If you raise your children that way, they’re gonna learn that way. I think things are changing but it’s not 100% yet. That’s why somebody obviously wrote that on our door.”More than 3,000 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since mid-March 2020. What's frustrating is that the encounters don't often rise to the legal definition of a hate crime. Still, police in several major cities saw a sharp uptick in Asian-targeted hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, according to data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University, San Bernardino. New York City went from three incidents to 27, Los Angeles from seven to 15, and Denver had three incidents in 2020 — the first reported there in six years.A rash of crimes victimizing elderly Asian Americans in the past two months has renewed outcry for more attention from politicians and the media. On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on legislation allocating $1.4 million to Stop AAPI Hate and the UCLA Asian American Studies Center. The funding will go toward community resources and further tracking of anti-Asian hate incidents.Local officials and citizens have also taken notice. Initiatives like increased police presence, volunteer patrols and special crime hotlines are coming to fruition. Big-name brands like the Golden State Warriors and Apple, based in the Bay Area, have promised to donate to the cause.Cynthia Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate, wishes news cycles would focus not just on the latest crimes but the solutions being discussed. Policing and prosecution aren't necessarily the answers, she said. COVID-19 vitriol is rooted in more than a century of anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant attitudes. She and other advocates think more investment in education and community resources could help get at those root causes. Anti-Asian xenophobia should be part of the ongoing conversations on racial reckoning, Choi added.“Our work to address anti-Asian racism is inextricably tied to fighting anti-Black racism,” Choi said. “That’s gonna take all of us, it’s gonna take public education efforts, it’s gonna take racial solidarity efforts that really bring our communities together."Before immigrating to the U.S. six years ago, Cung, the Texas hate crime survivor, had never encountered racism. Now, it's difficult for him to hear stories about anti-Asian American violence. Initially after the attack, Cung wrestled with how Gomez tried to kill him simply because of how he looked. Now, he prays for his attacker.As for what should happen to Gomez, who remains jailed on three counts of attempted capital murder, Cung said that's up to the courts.“I can forgive him, but we cannot accept racism or that kind of terrorist attack,” said Cung, who received more than $20,000 in online donations.One thing he is looking ahead to — life as a newly naturalized U.S. citizen in a country where “they respect people.” Cung remains unbothered that he may not fit some people's idea of what America looks like.“Maybe personally they have racism,” Cung said. “I don’t care. I’m proud of being Asian and Asian American.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/victims-of-anti-asian-attacks-reflect-a-year-into-pandemic-101614670818463.html

The plane can also carry weapons and act as a shield to help protect more expensive manned fighter jets.The US Air Force in December awarded multi-million dollar contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions to produce unmanned aerial prototypes that can team with crewed jets."The airpower teaming system is the basis for our Skyborg bid," Boeing airpower teaming programme director Shane Arnott told reporters. "Obviously the US market is a big market. That is a focus for us, achieving some sort of contract or programme of record in the United States."Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for cheaper and safer ways to maximise their resources.Australia, a staunch US ally, is home to Boeing's largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing.The Australian government said on Tuesday it would invest a further A$115 million ($89 million) to acquire three more Loyal Wingman aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to develop tactics for using the jets with crewed planes, on top of its initial investment of A$40 million."Our aim with Boeing is to understand how we can get these aircraft to team with our existing aircraft to be a force multiplier in the future," RAAF Air-Vice Marshal and head of air force capability Cath Roberts said.Britain in January signed a GBP 30 million ($42 million) contract with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems for a similar type of pilotless aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years.During the test flight in Australia, the Loyal Wingman took off under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify its functionality and demonstrate the performance of the design.Arnott said that three Loyal Wingman aircraft would be used for teaming flights this year and that the Australian government's order would take the number available to six.Boeing has said up to 16 Loyal Wingman jets could be teamed with a crewed aircraft for missions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-to-base-us-air-force-prototype-on-australian-pilotless-combat-jet-101614670626277.html

She has been living in Vancouver since then with a court-appointed security detail and restrictions on her movements. Her case has become a flashpoint in US-China relations, with Canada caught in the middle.In seeking the admission of new evidence Monday, Addario argued that HSBC brass had known for some time that Huawei controlled the accounts of Canicula Holdings Ltd., the parent company of Skycom, the entity accused of doing business in Iran.Meng went into the 2013 Hong Kong meeting, which featured a Powerpoint presentation by Meng in Chinese and translated into English, assuming her counterpart from the bank had full knowledge of Huawei’s “non-arm’s-length” relationship with Canicula, Addario said in court.Huawei sold Skycom to Canicula in 2007. Meng’s lawyers argued that Huawei’s continued affiliation with Skycom through its control of Canicula’s accounts was widely known within the bank.Also read: HSBC sees its future occupying 40% less office space after coronavirus pandemic‘Conduit of Information’HSBC’s relationship manager on the Huawei account, who cannot be named because of a court-ordered publication ban, “couldn’t be doing his job and not know about the relationship” between Huawei and Skycom, Addario said. “He’s far more than a gopher. He’s the actual conduit of information between the two institutions.”Last month, Meng’s legal team failed in an attempt in a British court to obtain internal documents from HSBC that might bolster her case.In rebuttal, Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater reminded the court that the extradition hearing is not meant to take the place of the trial Meng might face in the US if she is sent there.The proceedings are expected to continue until at least May and may be subject to further appeals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hsbc-banker-knew-about-dealings-with-iran-meng-s-defense-argues-101614649381587.html

The accused include some of the city’s most prominent activists such as Joshua Wong, Benny Tai and Jimmy Sham and most have objected to government requests to keep them in jail while also delaying further proceedings until at least May 31.The mass hearing before Chief Magistrate Victor So lasted much of the day Monday, with hundreds of supporters staging a defiant rally outside. It adjourned around 3 a.m. after one defendant, Clarisse Yeung, 34, fainted. A small number of protesters gathered outside the courthouse in the West Kowloon area for a second day.Police gave tickets to 42 people for breaching Covid-related restrictions during the protests outside the court Monday, Cable TV reported. One person was arrested for crossing a cordoned area and refusing to produce identification, the broadcaster said.Also read: China asks Australia to abandon its interference in Hong Kong's affairsThe case comes days before an annual meeting of China’s legislature opens in Beijing, with senior officials calling for lawmakers to overhaul the former British colony’s election system to further diminish the influence of pro-democracy politicians.

The exact details of the plan would be written by the NPC’s Standing Committee and Hong Kong’s government would then put them into force, the Chinese-language newspaper said.The Sing Tao Daily said in a separate column that the whole process would take four to five months, citing people it didn’t identify. Both of the pieces were published under pseudonyms.The 47 opposition figures are being prosecuted over their roles in helping organize a primary that drew more than 600,000 voters in July last year to choose candidates for Legislative Council elections that were later postponed. Authorities say the primary and plans to force the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam using a provision of the mini-constitution were an illegal attempt to paralyze the government.Alan Leong, a former lawmaker and chief executive candidate who is serving as a lawyer for four defendants, suggested in court Monday that prosecutors were hurrying the arraignment hearings because of the Chinese legislative gathering, which starts Friday.“Why were the charges laid now,” he said. “Are they rushing for the NPC meeting?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activists-return-to-court-continue-arraignment-on-subversion-charges-101614660599603.html
02-03-2021||World||Fossils of oldest member of huge dinosaur group found in Argentina||Scientists have unearthed in Argentina's Patagonian wilderness fossils of what may be the oldest-known member of the dinosaur group known as titanosaurs that includes the largest land animals in Earth's history.Researchers said on Monday the fossils represent a dinosaur species named Ninjatitan zapatai that lived 140 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. They identified Ninjatitan as a titanosaur, a group of long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four pillar-like legs.The dinosaur's incomplete skeletal remains were discovered south of the city of Neuquen. The researchers said Ninjatitan demonstrated that the titanosaurs as a group first appeared longer ago than previously known."It is the oldest record known, not only from Argentina but worldwide," study lead author Pablo Gallina, a researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina (CONICET), told Reuters. "Titanosaurs are recorded on various sides of the world, but the oldest-known records were more modern than this find."At a length of about 65 feet (20 meters), Ninjatitan was a large dinosaur, but much smaller than later titanosaurs such as Argentinosaurus that reached a length of around 115 feet (35 meters). The researchers also said the presence of such an early titanosaur in Patagonia supports the idea that titanosaurs originated in the Southern Hemisphere.The findings were published in the scientific journal Ameghiniana.Titanosaurs are part of a larger dinosaur group called sauropods that includes others with similar body designs such as Brontosaurus and Diplodocus that lived in North America during the Jurassic Period, which preceded the Cretaceous Period.A number of the titanosaurs that inhabited Patagonia achieved gigantic proportions such as Argentinosaurus, Patagotitan and Dreadnoughtus.José Luis Carbadillo, another CONICET researcher, told a local university publication http://www.ctys.com.ar/index.php?idPage=20&idArticulo=3796 that the age of Ninjatitan's remains could have led people to assume that the bones belonged to a dinosaur group that pre-dated titanosaurs."In Patagonia, titanosaurs are only known about from less than 120 million years ago," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fossils-of-oldest-member-of-huge-dinosaur-group-found-in-argentina-101614661258541.html

It also issued visa bans on 76 Saudis.Price said he could not disclose the names of the 76 people and declined to say whether or not Mohammed bin Salman was among them. The United States has urged Saudi Arabia to disband the RIF, Price added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-focused-on-future-conduct-of-saudi-arabia-after-khashoggi-sanctions-101614661515650.html

Her condition was not immediately disclosed.Local media reported three other defendants fainted after the hearings were adjourned.On Monday, about 1,000 supporters gathered outside the West Kowloon courthouse as the defendants, charged under the Chinese-ruled city's contentious national security law, faced charges after their arrest over the weekend.The crowd chanted slogans such as "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times" and with many dressed in black, the images were reminiscent of scenes during anti-government demonstrations that roiled the city in 2019.The activists are accused of organising and participating in an unofficial primary poll last July aimed at selecting the strongest candidates for a legislative council election that the government later postponed, citing the coronavirus.Authorities said the informal poll was part of a plan to "overthrow" the government, stoking concerns alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn since Beijing imposed the security law on the former British colony in June.The detentions have drawn international condemnation and accusations that the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing are using the law to crush dissent and stifle the opposition.US State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday Washington called on Hong Kong authorities to release those still held and drop charges against them.Beijing has said the security legislation, which punishes what it broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, is necessary to restore stability in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hearing-for-hong-kong-democracy-activists-resumes-after-marathon-session-101614653490413.html

Paul Kelly, their lawyer, confirmed they were en route for Japan aboard a flight from Boston scheduled to arrive in Tokyo around 1600 local time (0700 GMT)."This is a sad day for the family, and for all who believe that veterans deserve better treatment from their own country," he said in a statement.The US Justice Department and the US State Department declined to comment. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, which will handle the case, also declined to comment.The two men will not be indicted immediately, but will likely faces charges once an investigation, which will start when they arrive in Japan, is concluded.Also read: US top court rejects bid by Ghosn's accused escape plotters to avoid extraditionJapanese prosecutors have declined to say where the pair will be detained. One potential location is the Tokyo Detention House, the city's main jail where Ghosn was held after his arrest.The Taylors are alleged to have helped Ghosn flee Japan on Dec. 29, 2019, hidden in a box and on a private jet before reaching his childhood home, Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.Ghosn was awaiting trial on charges that he had engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements and enriching himself at his employer's expense through payments to car dealerships. Ghosn denies wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the elder Taylor, a 60-year-old private security specialist, and Peter Taylor, 27, received $1.3 million for their services.The Taylors, with the aid of a collection of high-powered lawyers and lobbyists, for months waged a campaign to press their case against extradition in the courts, media, State Department and White House.The Taylors' lawyers argued that their clients could not be prosecuted in Japan for helping someone "bail jump" and that, if extradited, they faced the prospect of relentless interrogations and torture.Under Japanese law, suspects can be held for up to 20 days before being charged or released, and are not allowed to have their lawyers present during questioning by prosecutors.

Eventually, the work will be done by a combination of humans and automation, it said.Twitter had already banned some Covid-related misinformation in December, including falsehoods about how the virus spreads, whether masks are effective and the risk of infection and death."Through the use of the strike system, we hope to educate people on why certain content breaks our rules so they have the opportunity to further consider their behaviour and their impact on the public conversation," Twitter said in a blog post Monday.People with one violation — or strike — will see no action. Two strikes will lead to an account being locked for 12 hours. Five or more will get a user permanently banned from Twitter.Facebook has also stepped up its vaccine misinformation fight after years of half-hearted enforcement. It announced an expanded policy last month that includes all vaccines — not just those against Covid-19.San Francisco-based Twitter did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on whether it also plans to include broader anti-vax misinformation in its policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-cracks-down-on-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-101614653124063.html

Trump also said he is not launching a new political party and called on Republicans to unify.Taking the stage for the first time since leaving office, Trump launched an attack on his successor, President Joe Biden, saying he has had the “most disastrous first month of any president in modern history”.Trump’s remarks came on the closing day of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida.“As you know, they just lost the White House,” said Trump, repeating his claim about the November election, as he set up his 2024 run for the US presidency. “I may even decide to beat them for a third time,” he added, referring to his first win in 2016 and the defeat in 2020, which he continues to portray as a victory.As a straw poll of the attendees at the CPAC showed he is the front-runner for the party’s nomination for president by a wide margin.“We’re not starting new parties,” Trump told the attendees. “We have the Republican Party. It is going to unite and be stronger than ever before.”WH defends decision not to sanction Saudi princeThe Biden administration defended its decision not to sanction Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US has not historically sanctioned the leaders of countries “where we have diplomatic relations”.Meanwhile, UN human rights investigator Agnes Callamard has said it was “extremely dangerous” for the US to have named the de facto Saudi ruler as having approved the operation to kill Khashoggi but not to have taken action against him.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-again-hints-at-a-2024-poll-run-101614649437043.html
02-03-2021||World||One in four people will have hearing problems by 2050: WHO||One in four of the world's population will suffer from hearing problems by 2050, the World Health Organization warned Tuesday, calling for extra investment in prevention and treatment.The first-ever global report on hearing said that the causes of many of the problems -- such as infections, diseases, birth defects, noise exposure and lifestyle choices -- could be prevented.The report proposed a package of measures, which it calculated would cost $1.33 per person per year.Against that, it set the figure of nearly a trillion US dollars lost every year because the issue was not being properly addressed."Failure to act will be costly in terms of the health and well-being of those affected, and the financial losses arising from their exclusion from communication, education and employment," said the report.One in five people worldwide have hearing problems currently, it said.But the report warned: "The number of people with hearing loss may increase more than 1.5-fold during the next three decades" to 2.5 billion people -- up from 1.6 billion in 2019.Of the 2.5 billion, 700 million would in 2050 have a serious enough condition to require some kind of treatment, it added -- up from 430 million in 2019.Much of the expected rise is due to demographic and population trends, it added.Poor access to treatmentA major contributor to hearing problems is a lack of access to care, which is particularly striking in low-income countries where there are far fewer professionals available to treat them.Since nearly 80 percent of people with hearing loss live in such countries, most are not getting the help they need.Even in richer countries with better facilities, access to care is often uneven, said the report.And a lack of accurate information and the stigma surrounding ear disease and hearing loss also prevents people getting the care they need."Even among health-care providers, knowledge relevant to prevention, early identification and management of hearing loss and ear diseases is commonly lacking," it noted.The report proposed a package of measures, including public health initiatives from reducing noise in public spaces to increasing vaccinations for diseases such as meningitis that can cause hearing loss.It also recommended systematic screening to identify the problem at key points in people's lives.Among children, it said, hearing loss could be prevented in 60 percent of cases."An estimated one trillion US dollars is lost each year due to our collective failure to adequately address hearing loss," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the report."While the financial burden is enormous, what cannot be quantified is the distress caused by the loss of communication, education and social interaction that accompanies unaddressed hearing loss."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-four-people-will-have-hearing-problems-by-2050-who-101614647809196.html

His first overseas trip as president was to the kingdom, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner developed a close relationship with the crown price.At the same time, the Biden administration has indicated it’s only willing to go so far. The U.S. has held off imposing sanctions directly against the crown prince, and Price offered little new information a day after White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the State Department would provide “more details and elaborate” on the administration’s approach.Price declined to detail the list of people who are subject to a new policy, announced Friday, known as the “Khashoggi ban,” which imposes visa limits on anyone who violates the rights of dissidents beyond their country’s borders. On Friday, 76 Saudi individuals were put on that list.The decision not to directly target Prince Mohammed drew criticism from human rights activists and supporters of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was killed by a Saudi hit team after he visited the country’s consulate in Istanbul to pick up some marriage documents.“It appears as though under the Biden administration, despots who offer momentarily strategic value to the United States might be given a ‘one free murder’ pass,” Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan wrote on Monday. “We should not make exceptions to favor one brutal dictator over another based on favors they do for us or fears that they might not always respond as we would like them to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-tougher-saudi-stance-a-recalibration-not-a-rupture-101614644350175.html

Greg Abbott appointed Walker to the commission in 2017, and she is one of two commissioners who used to work in his office. In a letter to Abbott, Walker said she accepted her role in the outages but that others should acknowledge their responsibility, including gas companies and lawmakers.“I believe others should come forward in dignity and courage and acknowledge how their actions or inactions contributed to the situation," Walker wrote.Also Read | Texas’s power market is $1.3 billion short after energy crisisShe resigned the same day Texas' largest and oldest power cooperative announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and as the state's attorney general launched an investigation into one electricity provider, Griddy, whose customers incurred massive bills during February’s winter storm.Abbott, a Republican, blamed the power failures on the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, commonly known as ERCOT. But the three-member commission appointed by Abbott has oversight authority over ERCOT.Abbott's spokesman Renae Eze said in a short statement that the governor thanks Walker “for her years of service to the State of Texas." The statement did not reflect on Walker's performance ahead of the outages.Walker struggled in two lengthy appearances before legislative panels investigating the state's electric grid breakdowns, the commission's response and the lack of communication with the public over the approaching storm.She initially said her agency has little control over ERCOT, but later said it has total control. Lawmakers questioned her knowledge of her agency’s authority and the decision to reduce or reassign enforcement staff charged with policing the utility companies.“Despite the treatment I received from some legislators, I am proud that I spoke the truth," Walker wrote.She was also criticized for a lack of communication about the approaching catastrophic storm. Walker testified that she spoke with Abbott’s office, as well as staff for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and others several days before the storm hit to warn them about the weather and its potential impact on power distribution in the state.Texas was hit with historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures in an icy blast that cut across the Deep South for days starting Feb. 14. More than 40 deaths in Texas — and double that toll regionwide — have been blamed on the storm and the resulting blackouts.ERCOT officials have said the entire grid — which is uniquely isolated from the rest of the U.S. — was on the brink of collapse in the early hours of Feb. 15 as power plants froze in the cold and record demand for electricity to heat homes overwhelmed the system.At least six ERCOT board members have resigned in the wake of the power failures.Also Monday, Brazos Electric Power announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing the punishing storm. The state's largest and oldest power cooperative said it received excessively high invoices from ERCOT for collateral and purported cost of electric service during the storm, and that it was not prepared to pass those costs along to its members or customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-top-utility-regulator-quits-in-fallout-over-blackouts-101614643519242.html
02-03-2021||World||Pakistan may witness 3rd wave of Covid-19 amid dull vaccination drive: Experts||Pakistan may witness a resurgence in the number of Covid-19 cases that might lead to a third wave of coronavirus in the country as restrictions related to the virus have been relaxed, Dawn reported citing health experts.Moreover, there has been a lukewarm response of even health workers to the government-run vaccination campaign. As many as 1,176 Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday.The country has reported over 5,81,00 Covid-19 cases and 12,896 deaths so far.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarlier on Feburary 24, Pakistan's National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Covid-19 relaxed most of the restrictions on commercial activities, schools, offices and other workplaces, allowing them to function at full strength.Under the directives, time limit on commercial activities has been lifted and the condition of 50 per cent attendance at workplaces removed.Schools have been asked to function five days a week with full strength. Permission to hold indoor wedding ceremonies and opening of cinemas and shrines has been granted with effect from March 15.The decision to allow indoor dining will depend on the outcome of the review meeting to be held on March 10.While talking to Dawn, Secretary-General of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Dr Qaisar Sajjad said: "We are living in a society where people do not follow the SOPs. They even laugh at those wearing face masks. We have already observed the results of lifting of restrictions in September last year when 100 to 200 daily cases were being reported, and within a month the government had to declare a second wave of coronavirus.""I believe that restrictions should be lifted after vaccinating 70pc population as only then we can get herd immunity. Just two weeks ago, three cases were reported in Melbourne, Australia. Though all three persons had arrived through foreign flights but the whole Melbourne city was closed for five days. It is unfortunate that we are taking even over 1,000 cases lightly," he added.While pointing out that the response to the vaccination drive in Pakistan was very slow, the PMA secretary-general blamed the government for it and said that no one at the helm had bothered to handle the issue seriously."Actors have been engaged for vaccination campaign rather than renowned doctors. How a person can get medical advice from an actor? Moreover, advertisements should be shown during peak hours. Currently, we see a bombardment of advertisements during PSL matches but we don't see a single ad on vaccination during matches. Also, data of healthcare workers, who have been vaccinated so far, is not being shared. We don't know how many general practitioners, nurses, etc have been vaccinated," he said.Due to the lukewarm response to the vaccination, Islamabad's biggest hospital Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) has warned its employees of disciplinary action.Unfortunately, the government was looking at the issue with a mere focus on the country's economic growth rather than public health, Dr Javaid Usman, a microbiologist, said while talking to Dawn."Possibility of a third wave cannot be ruled out. We are giving another opportunity to the virus to bounce back. We should not forget that now there are more than one variants of the virus in Pakistan and they are more infectious and transmissible. Luckily, they are not as virulent as the previous type. But it is not a good decision to lift restrictions as cases are continuously fluctuating and we have been observing sudden spikes," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-may-witness-third-wave-of-covid-19-amid-dull-vaccination-drive-experts-101614643828847.html
02-03-2021||World||Biden tries to reset relationship with Mexican president amid migration issue||As President Joe Biden looks to dismantle the last administration’s hardline immigration agenda, he worked Monday to build a partnership with someone who found an unexpected understanding with Donald Trump: Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Biden and López Obrador met for a virtual bilateral meeting, with immigration, the coronavirus pandemic and climate issues on the agenda. Looming large was how the two leaders would get along in what has become an increasingly complicated relationship.“We haven’t been perfect neighbors to each other,” Biden acknowledged in brief remarks at the start of his video conference meeting with the Mexican president.López Obrador, for his part, told Biden that he was thankful that the new president was “willing to maintain good relations for the good of our people in North America.”The Mexican president also gave a wink to a rueful observation attributed to José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori, the Mexican general who served seven terms as the country’s president, about the two countries’ relationship: “Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the U.S.”“I can now say ‘It’s wonderful for Mexico to be close to God and not so far from the United States’” López Obrador said.Lopez Obrador came to the meeting with his own checklist of priorities, including pressing Biden to give pharmaceutical company Pfizer permission to sell his country vaccine produced in the United States, something that Canada has also requested from the White House.“We want to have an answer about a request we made,” Lopez Obrador told reporters at his daily news conference, hours before speaking with Biden.Ahead of the meeting, White House officials reiterated that Biden remained focused on first vaccinating U.S. citizens before turning his attention to assisting other nations. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters at the start of the meeting, said the two leaders would be discussing vaccines.Relations with Biden will be much more complex and multi-faceted than they were with Trump.As a candidate, Trump referred to Mexicans as rapists. The Republican's signature campaign promise was building a “big, beautiful wall’ across the length of the southern border. And leaked conversations showed Trump hectoring López Obrador's predecessor, Enrique Peña Nieto, against publicly saying that Mexico would never pay for a southern border wall.But López Obrador appeared to reach a one-issue understanding with Trump: Mexico stopped the flow of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. border, and Trump often appeared to turn a blind eye to just about every other facet in the complicated relationship.There was no shortage of issues that Trump largely overlooked or played down in exchange for Mexico slowing the flow of undocumented immigrants from the border.López Obrador, who took office in 2018, accused U.S. officials of fabricating drug trafficking charges against the country’s former defense secretary, Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, and demanded the general's return after he was arrested in Los Angeles in October. U.S. prosecutors eventually acquiesced.Under his watch, López Obrador has attempted to consolidate the position of Mexico’s national oil company and national electric utility, and prioritized fossil fuel companies amid a global push to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Early in his term, the Mexican president pursued a counter-narcotics strategy that largely ended the pursuit of high-profile arrests and focused more on poverty alleviation.Still, Trump heaped praise on López Obrador, calling him a “friend” and “great president” in one of his final presidential speeches, an address from the border to celebrate progress made on building the wall.The effort to reset the U.S.-Mexico relationship under Biden comes as a flood of migrants have rushed to the border since his victory in November.Biden has backed a bill to give legal status and a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally. Biden also broke with Trump by supporting efforts to allow hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. illegally as young children to remain in the country.Border Patrol agents are apprehending an average of more than 200 children crossing the border without a parent per day, but nearly all 7,100 beds for immigrant children maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services are full.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday sought to push back against the notion that the situation at the border was spinning out of control.“The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are working around the clock seven days a week to ensure that we do not have a crisis at the border, that we manage the challenge as acute as the challenge is, and they are not doing that alone,” Mayorkas said.Ahead of the meeting, López Obrador also floated a proposal for a Bracero-style immigrant work visa program for 600,000 to 800,000 Mexican and Central American workers annually.Asked about the Mexican president’s proposal, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that reinstituting the Bracero program would require action by Congress.The original Bracero program allowed Mexicans to work temporarily in the United States to fill labor shortages during World War II and for a couple of decades after the war. López Obrador said the U.S. economy needs Mexican workers because of “their strength, their youth.”On Monday, López Obrador added that his new proposal would be a program not only for agriculture workers but for other sectors and professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tries-to-reset-relationship-with-mexican-president-amid-migration-issue-101614643562039.html

"Hong Kong affairs fall entirely within China's internal affairs. No foreign country has the right to interfere," Chinese state media Global Times quoted Wang as saying."China urges Australia to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs in any way, to avoid further damage to China-Australia relations," Wang said.Also Read | Explainer: What is love?

The school is in the city of Pine Bluff, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock.The school went on lockdown after the shooting. The shooter ran away but was found in a nearby neighborhood by a tracking dog, Sergeant said.The wounded boy, who was also 15, was airlifted to a Little Rock hospital where he was “in very serious condition,” Sergeant said. The boy later died, said Lt. David DeFoor, Pine Bluff's police spokesman.“We don’t have a definite motive right now as to why the incident occurred,” Sergeant said. “However we do believe this was a targeted incident as opposed to a random incident.”The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention center and prosecutors have not yet decided whether charges will be filed in juvenile or adult court, officials said. His name was not released because of his age.Monday was scheduled to be Watson Chapel's first day back for on-site learning in several weeks after winter weather and water issues closed the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/15yearold-boy-shot-killed-at-arkansas-junior-high-school-101614636440404.html
02-03-2021||World||US presses Saudis over Khashoggi's killing amid calls to punish prince||The United States on Monday pressed Saudi Arabia to take further measures after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as Washington faced growing criticism that it did not directly target Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.President Joe Biden on Friday released an intelligence report that found that Prince Mohammed approved the 2018 killing of Khashoggi, a US-based contributor to The Washington Post who was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was strangled to death and dismembered.The report -- classified under former president Donald Trump, a close ally of the Saudis -- found that seven of the 15 members of the hit squad that flew to Istanbul came from the Rapid Intelligence Force, which it said "exists to defend the crown prince" and "answers only to him.""We have urged Saudi Arabia to disband this group and then adopt institutional, systemic reforms and controls to ensure that anti-dissident activities and operations cease and cease completely," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters."We have made crystal clear -- and will continue to do so -- that the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi 28 months ago remains unacceptable conduct," Price said.He also called on Saudi Arabia to act on other fronts including lifting a travel ban on Loujain al-Hathloul, an advocate for women's right to drive in the ultra-conservative kingdom who was provisionally freed in January after nearly three years in jail.The Biden administration imposed sanctions on the Rapid Intervention Force -- meaning any US transactions with it will be a crime -- and said it was banning entry into the United States of 76 Saudis under a new policy against foreign officials who harass dissidents.Biden has sought to "recalibrate" the decades-old Saudi alliance and has already said the United States will end support for offensive operations in the devastating Saudi war in Yemen.But the administration stopped short of personally targeting the 35-year-old crown prince -- the de facto leader as well as defense minister of the major oil provider.Asked why no action was taken against the prince, also known by his initials MBS, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the United States does not typically sanction foreign leaders -- despite frequent US actions against senior officials of hostile nations.But she hinted that Prince Mohammed was not permanently off the hook, saying: "Of course we reserve the right to take any action at the time and manner of our choosing."Price said that the United States would not "preview" who would be banned in the future but said, "I am not aware of any plans for the crown prince to travel to the United States in the near term."'Punished without delay'Khashoggi's Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said that the crown prince had lost legitimacy after the publication of the report."It is essential that the crown prince, who ordered the brutal murder of a blameless and innocent person, should be punished without delay," Cengiz said in a statement posted on Twitter."This will not only bring the justice we have been seeking for Jamal, but it could also prevent similar acts recurring in the future."Her comments were echoed in Geneva by Agnes Callamard, the UN's special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions.Callamard called Washington's inaction against Prince Mohammed "extremely worrisome.""It is extremely, in my view, problematic if not dangerous to acknowledge someone's culpability and then to tell that someone that we won't do anything," Callamard told reporters."I am calling on the US government to act on its public findings and to sanction MBS for what he has done."The Saudi government denounced the US report. It insists Khashoggi's killing was a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presses-saudis-over-khashoggi-s-killing-amid-calls-to-punish-prince-101614636125682.html
02-03-2021||India||Srinagar market desolate after death of eatery owner's son in militant attack||An uneasy silence has engulfed a small market in Srinagar, which would otherwise be frequented by hundreds of tourists and locals daily, after the killing of the son of an eatery owner.For the past 13 days, the Durga-Nag market at Dalgate in Srinagar has been desolate and locals and traders in grief. The market’s star landmark Krishna Dhaba was hit by a tragedy last month.Aakash Mehra, 25, the only son of the eatery’s owner Ramesh Chandra Mehra was shot-at on February 17 and succumbed to his injuries 11 days later.The eatery is famous for its vegetarian dishes which attract a large number of customers and has been the main reason for the flurry of activity in the area. Among its clientele, are many of Srinagar’s influential and prominent people.Other shopkeepers in the locality said that the young Mehra was studying in Jammu and had come to help his father after the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 pandemic was lifted a few months back.Mehra’s extended family, which is originally from Jammu and has been here for the past many decades, runs four eateries and two general stores in the market. There are half a dozen Kashmir art shops and a sweet store run by locals and a commercial complex near Krishna dhaba. All the shops mostly have been rented out by a trust. While the Mehra’s have been closed since the attack, the whole market was shut on Sunday and Monday as a mark of protest over the killing. Though the other shops were open on Tuesday, the roadside carts which would add to the hustle and bustle outside the Mehra’s dhaba were absent.“Everybody in this market is heartbroken. The market closed for two days after his death. This place is famous because of them and they are always helpful to everyone here,” said Javaid Ahmad Khan, who runs a Kashmir art outlet just opposite the dhaba on the other side of the road.“I live here and have grown up with them. During floods in 2014, they also helped in organising a langar here” he said. “They have been here for many decades and nobody raised a finger against them during the thick of militancy”.Khan was in his shop when the attack took place on the late evening of February 17 as most of Srinagar was observing a spontaneous shutdown during the visit of a delegation of EU envoys.He heard the sound of the first bullet late evening and thought it was a firecracker. The sound of two more shots sent people scurrying. Khan rushed out of his shop and ran to the dhaba where Mehra was lying injured.“I didn’t see them but people say they came on a bike, went to the counter and fired thrice at him. There was a lot of rush that day owing to strike on the occasion of the visit of a foreign delegation,” he said.Khan said that he visited the injured Mehra in the hospital on the second day before he underwent a surgery for his perforated intestines. “He asked if I had seen them. I said, no, I was inside. I thought he would be fine but then his condition deteriorated after the surgery,” he said.Police have already arrested three persons involved in the attack who they said have confessed to the crime. Kashmir’s inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar had said on February 19 that the trio was newly recruited militants and was instigated by The Resistance Front (TRF) to strike at Krishna Dhaba where tourist rush is always high and the shop even remains open during hartals. The police have also recovered the bike and the pistol used in the attack.However, most of the people in the market said that the Mehra’s would always close on the occasion of strike calls.“They would always close their shop on hartals. That day many other shops were also open. It was not clear why they opened that day but it may be because there was ambiguity as there was no call of shutdown. But that does not mean they should be killed. There seems to be some conspiracy behind this,” said an auto driver who often ferries tourists to the area.“We had witnessed a good rush of tourists from January 20 to February 15. Now it is just silence,” he said.The traders have been mulling to send a delegation to express their condolences to the Mehra family in Jammu.“Whosoever did this is condemnable. He was an innocent young man. The market has been desolate since Krishna Dhaba closed. It was the reason for the footfall in our trade outlets,” said Manzoor Ahmad, president of Durga-Nag Traders’ Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/srinagar-market-desolate-after-death-of-eatery-owner-s-son-in-militant-attack-101614706700242.html

His action clearly violates the provisions of Part VII (Party in Power) of the Model Code of Conduct that clear states: “The party in power whether at the Centre or in the State or States concerned, shall ensure that no cause is given for any complaint that it has used its official position for the purposes of its election campaign and in particular…(4) Issue of advertisement at the cost of public exchequer in the newspapers and oter media.”HT has a copy of the letter.The Election Commission announced the poll schedules for West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry on February 26.The election in Bengal will be held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. Modi is scheduled to address an election rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds on March 7. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has planned 20 rallies for him in the coming days.“After elections have been declared, the PM is debarred from publicizing this name and claiming credit in this manner through the government's Co-WIN platform of vaccination,” the letter says.“By placing his photograph, name and message on the provisional certificates issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, he is not only exploiting his post and powers but also stealing commendable credit from the producers of Covid vaccines. He is bluntly appropriating the dues of the vast army of selfless doctors, nurses and health service workers,” O’Brien wrote.Reacting to the TMC’s allegation, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “The ECI will surely look into the complaint. However, the TMC has lost its political and moral right to raise such issues because we have seen how chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s photographs have been misused.”“Millions of people in Bengal could have seen the Prime Minister’s photographs all these years had the TMC government not changed the names of the Centre’s welfare schemes and passed those as its own. The chief minister’s face was used to publicise these,” Bhattacharya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-photo-on-vaccination-certificate-violates-model-code-tmc-tells-eci-101614704488606.html

It was read out to journalists later by senior Raijor Dal functionaries.“I appeal to all opposition parties that in order to defeat the communal and fascist BJP we should put up one common candidate against the BJP and its alliance partners,” said the letter.“That will help prevent division of anti-BJP votes. If required, I will not contest the election,” it added.Raijor Dal and another newly formed outfit, Assam Jatiya Parishad have decided to contest the election jointly, but have decided to stay away from the Congress-led grand alliance which has All India United Democratic Front, Bodoland Peoples Front, three Left parties and a new regional party as partners.On the other hand, the BJP is continuing its alliance with Asom Gana Parishad and tied-up with United Peoples Party Liberal.Terming AIUDF as a communal party similar to BJP, Gogoi said that was the prime reason why his party decided to stay away from the Congress-led grand alliance.The assembly election in Assam will be held in three phases on March 27, April1 and April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-assam-leader-urges-parties-to-put-up-common-candidates-against-bjp-101614701784068.html

The notice was issued on March 1 by the DM of Imphal West district and served on Tuesday morning. “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform,” the notice said, further directing the publisher/intermediary to “furnish all relevant documents that ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules, failing which, it warned, “steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice.”This was probably the first instance in the country of such action against against a digital news platform.Significantly, the programme is hosted on the Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist, against whom the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has slapped several cases, also jailing him thrice. Reacting to the notice, Kishorechandra told HT, “We’ve hosted just four-five shows. The last show aired on February 28 and was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope.’” Kishorechandra, also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, Kishorechandra spoke to HT over the phone from Imphal.Frontier Manipur works in collaboration with a news portal called Seven Salai, and uses the latter’s infrastructure. Paojel Chaoba is the publisher and executive director of Frontier Manipur.In January, Chaoba, along with Frontier Manipur editor-in-chief, Dhiren Sadokpam, was detained for more than 24 hours on the basis of an FIR filed by a police officer over an opinion piece titled ‘Revolutionary Journey in a Mess.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/notice-against-manipuri-talk-show-served-under-new-digital-media-laws-revoked-101614700327923.html

Senior leader AV Gopinath, former legislator and Palakkad district Congress president, on Tuesday announced his decision to contest as a rebel in Palakkad constituency if he was denied a ticket for the polls. The assembly polls in the state will be held on April 6.The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party have welcomed the sulking leader to their camps. “I have been side-lined for quite some time and party leaders never bother to consult me when they take decisions. There is a limit to humiliation. If age is a factor it should be applicable to all. It is unfair to side-line a select few,” said Gopinath announcing his decision to contest.The CPI (M) Palakkad district committee said it will take necessary steps if he quits the party. The BJP which has a sizeable base in the district has also promised its support to him. Gopinath said he is in touch with many senior leaders of the CPI (M).Last month senior leader and former Union minister Prof KV Thomas had threatened to walk out of the party but he was placated after the intervention of party president Sonia Gandhi. Later, he was appointed as the working president of the state unit. Party leaders fear that dissension may heighten in the coming days-- posters and notices have started appearing at many places against probable candidates. Party leaders fear that dissension may heighten in the coming days-- posters and notices have started appearing at many places against probable candidates. Hectic efforts are on to convince Gopinath but people close to him said he has made up his mind. The Congress has reportedly promised him a key organisational position but he has declined it.Desperately trying to grab power after a five-year hiatus, the Congress leadership has already announced that win ability will be the sole criteria and more youngsters and women will be inducted in the list of candidates. Party leader Rahul Gandhi, a member of parliament from the state, has made it clear that the selection process will carry his stamp and dividing seats on the basis of faction allegiance will not happen this time. Two prominent groups, one led by former CM Oommen Chandy and the other by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, call shots in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-woes-pose-a-threat-to-congress-in-poll-bound-kerala-101614695908445.html
02-03-2021||India||On West Bengal elections in 8 phases, a plea in Supreme Court||The Election Commission’s decision to hold West Bengal state elections in eight phases, the longest ever, has been questioned in a public interest litigation filed by a lawyer before the Supreme Court.Lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma filed the petition on Monday and the same was registered by the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The petition questioned the February 26 decision of the poll panel declaring eight-phase polling in West Bengal as against three phases in Assam, and a single phase in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Union Territory of Puducherry.“Conducting election in eight phases while in single phase in other states, especially when West Bengal is not facing any terrorist attack or under disputed war zone…is a clear case of violation of Article 14 (right to equality) of the Constitution of India,” read the petition.Along with the issue of holding polls, the petition even urged the top poll body to take note of the “Jai Shri Ram” slogan being used as a religious tool by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek votes ahead of the polls.The petition demanded the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to register a case against Union home minister Amit Shah and state BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari for promoting enmity by raising the religious slogan.Sharma asked the apex court to decide whether use of a provocative religious slogan “Jai Shri Ram” should be treated as an electoral offence under Sections 123(3) and 125 of the Representation of the People Act which does not permit a candidate or anybody associated with the election to promote feeling of hatred on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language.“Using the slogan ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is liable to be prohibited and whoever, individual or party or group of person of a party uses it prior to election or during election or thereafter must be prohibited to participate in election,” Sharma stated in his petition.In addition, the petition included a prayer to debar the political party indulging in such actionsElections will begin in West Bengal on March 27 and the results will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-west-bengal-elections-in-8-phases-a-plea-in-supreme-court-101614695331226.html

But the government instead of listening to them, lathi charged them and attacked them with water cannons injuring women which was extremely shameful," said Singh."The police on the order of this government attacked the women and elderly which reminded us of General Dyer during the British rule who ordered fire on the freedom fighters at Jallianwala Bagh. It seems this government is hell-bent on crushing any protest against it and doesn't believe in democracy," he said.Accusing the government of insulting the "motherhood of the hills", Hridayesh demanded an apology from the government over the incident."If this government has come to power to insult the motherhood of the hills who are the backbone of this society, then it should resign and offer its apology to them in this House," said Hridayesh who also attacked chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat for "calling the protesters Andolanjivi" on Twitter on Tuesday after ordering a magisterial probe into the incident late Monday evening.Later while answering the Opposition on the matter, parliamentary affairs minister Madan Kaushik said that, "The villagers' protest was going on peacefully near the police barricade 6 km away from the Assembly when it suddenly turned violent. The police used water cannons to control them as a usual process when some villagers started pelting stones and glass bottles at the policemen."As soon as he said that the villagers pelted stones at the police, the Opposition erupted again objecting to his statement and moved towards the well of the House accusing Kaushik of "giving wrong information in the House."The Opposition MLAs then staged a walkout and held a sit-in at the entrance of the House raising slogans against the government accusing it of "exploiting and insulting the women of hills."The Opposition had staged a walkout once before in the day following a heated debate during an adjournment motion on price rise.Speaking on the issue, Hridayesh accused the government of "doing nothing to control skyrocketing prices of essential commodities including fuel and food items.""The common man is suffering because of very high fuel prices which are more than the neighbouring countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, China and others. He is also not able to have a two-time meal due to high prices of food items. The government is doing nothing to give any relief to them," said Hridayesh.Countering her minister Kaushik presented the comparative figures of fuel prices in states of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Punjab and West Bengal saying the "Uttarakhand has fuel prices lower than all these states". The opposition then walked out citing "unsatisfactory answers by the government on price rise."Earlier during the day, Opposition MLA Qazi Nizamuddin and minister Kaushik were involved in a heated debate after the former raised the issue of the government "not following the rules for House proceedings".Nizamuddin raising the issue said, "Since last four years, CM Rawat who holds many important departments like home, health, finance, excise and others is not present in the House during questions about his departments which is beyond our understanding. Also, as per the rule, a debate on the budget should be there after two days of it being tabled so as to give time to the members to study it. But this is not being done ever."Kaushik objected saying, "The agenda of the House is decided after a meeting with the business advisory committee which includes the leader of opposition. It is then passed by the Speaker also. After all this, if an objection is raised then it is not fair."Despite the pandemonium, the House passed two amendment bills related to a change in a non-government university operating in Uttarakhand and the other related to marketing of agricultural produce and livestock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-crackdown-on-villagers-sparks-pandemonium-in-uttarakhand-assembly-101614694275647.html

Rajewal added that the union will not support any political party in the upcoming assembly elections.“We'll send teams to poll-bound states - to West Bengal and Kerala. We will not support any party but appeal to people to vote for the candidates who can defeat BJP. We will tell people about Modi govt's attitude towards farmers,” Rajewal said at the press meet, according to news agency ANI.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been holding Kisan Panchayats all over the country to drum up support against the new farm laws, announced in February that farmers will be going on a tour of poll-bound West Bengal since farmers there do not get fair price for their crops.“We will definitely go to West Bengal; it is not as if the state is outside the country. We are getting a lot of response from our panchayats and this has baffled the government. Farmers are facing issues in West Bengal as well and their issues should find a way to the manifestos of political parties who intend to come to power. There, farmers are not getting the appropriate price (for their crops) while those involved in fisheries are also facing problems,” Tikait said.Swaraj India founder Yogendra Yadav was also present at Tuesday’s press conference. He reiterated Rajewal’s words, adding that the programme is scheduled to begin on March 12 with a public meeting in Kolkata.“In the Assembly elections, we will appeal to people to punish this party (BJP) and its allies who brought anti-farmer laws. We will go to the boll-bound states. This programme will begin in Kolkata on March 12 with a public meeting,” said Yadav.BKU has plans to spread the movement against the farm laws to non-poll bound states of the country. Tikait had also announced in late February that he will undertake a tour of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana in March to garner support for the ongoing farmers’ protest. "Farmers' meetings will be held in Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while two meetings will also be held in Uttar Pradesh in March," BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-will-send-team-to-poll-bound-states-ask-people-to-vote-for-candidates-who-can-defeat-bjp-says-farmer-leader-101614694045964.html

02-03-2021||India||Congress walks out of HP Assembly over MLAs' supension||The Congress on Tuesday staged a walkout from the Himachal Pradesh Assembly seeking the revocation of the suspension of its five MLAs, a demand opposed by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur who said "manhandling" of the Governor is an "unpardonable" act.Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and four other Congress MLAs Harsh Vardhan Chauhan, Satpal Raizada, Sunder Singh and Vinay Kumar were on Friday suspended for the entire Budget session of the Assembly till March 20 after they allegedly manhandled Governor Bandaru Dattatraya.The alleged incident had taken place outside the Speaker's office when the Governor was leaving for the Raj Bhavan after he cut short his address in the House following a ruckus on the opening day of the Budget session.Speaker Vipin Parmar had also lodged a complaint with police in this regard.On Tuesday, Congress MLA Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu moved a call attention motion in the state Assembly, demanding that the suspension of his party legislators be revoked.He also denied the charge against his party's MLAs and claimed that Deputy Speaker Hansraj and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj had manhandled the Congress MLAs on Friday.If their suspension is not revoked, the proceedings of the House will not be allowed to run, he added.Reacting to it, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said "manhandling" the Governor is "unbearable and unpardonable".Mentioning that no one is above law, the CM said the entire episode has been captured by several cameras.Thakur said that the Leader of Opposition hit the bonnet of the Governor's car while the other Congress MLAs shouted “Governor bhag gaya, Governor bhag gaya (Governor has run away, Governor has run away).The CM said the Congress MLAs also "manhandled" the Governor's ADC. The incident took place when the Governor's family members had come to watch the House proceedings and their faces blenched, he added.Thakur stated that the Congress resorted to such an act as it has lost its political ground.The CM said he and his entire cabinet apologised to the Governor for the incident but the Opposition has no shame. Defending the action by the deputy speaker, the chief minister said the entire government is with him. He did what he should have done in such circumstances, Thakur said.On the chief minister’s request, the Speaker initiated the proceedings of the question hour at 11.55 am after the Congress staged a walkout from the House.After the Congress walkout, Deputy Speaker Hansraj said he wants protection from the House as he is receiving threats from the Congress student wing NSUI and its "goons".Earlier in the day, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj said the suspended Congress MLAs should tender an unconditional apology to the Governor. Subsequently, the issue of their suspension may be discussed, he said.Meanwhile, Congress MLA Asha Kumari termed the proceedings of the special meeting of the Assembly regarding the episode on Friday afternoon illegal as it had been called at a notice of four minutes, which is against the rules.The MLA said several legislators had already left the Assembly as the House was adjourned till Monday at 2 pm.Asha Kumari said no Congress MLA tried to stop the Governor on his way to his car from the Speaker's office. On the contrary, the deputy speaker and the parliamentary Affairs minister pushed the Congress MLAs, she said.The ruling party should have told the Opposition that the Governor won’t be reading his entire address, she added.Meanwhile, the suspended Congress MLAs continued their dharna outside the House on the second day consecutively against the registration of an FIR against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-walks-out-of-hp-assembly-over-mlas-supension-101614681060293.html

No serious side effect has been reported so far," Shailaja said.Over 1000 centres have already been set up in various districts across the state for people to take the jab, she said.Apart from this, a mass vaccination centre was set up in Thiruvanathapuram recently on an experimental basis.The possibility of similar mass centres would also be looked into in the coming days so that more people can get vaccinated at the same time, she said.To get vaccinated, everyone should register at the prescribed portal beforehand and the shot should be taken on a priority basis.Barring a slight technical issue while registering, there were no other hurdles reported in Kerala in connection with the registration, the minister added.Urging people to take the second dose also without any fail after 28 days, Shailaja said they should not assume that they would be immune after receiving the first dose.Immunity would be achieved only 14 days after that, she said, adding people should be vigilant till then.Stating that the state's fight against Covid-19 was progressing in a scientific manner, she said though the viral infection was first reported in the country in Kerala, its peak was last seen here.In other states, the death toll rose sharply as the graph scaled up."At the same time, the mortality rate in Kerala is still 0.4 per cent," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-health-minister-2-cabinet-colleagues-take-first-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101614689528837.html

The notice under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on February 25, was issued on March 1 and served on Tuesday morning to the publisher/intermediary of Khanasi Neinasi, the talk show which means ‘Let’s Talk’ in Manipuri.Incidentally, the show is hosted on Facebook page of Kishorechandra Wangkhem, an Imphal-based journalist against whom the ruling BJP-led government in the state has slapped several cases since 2018 and jailed him thrice.The notice issued by Naorem Praveen Singh, district magistrate of Imphal West district, says, “It has come to the notice of the undersigned that you are providing online services on news and current affairs on the social media platform.”The publisher/intermediary were directed to “furnish all relevant documents that ensure compliance of the provisions” of the new rules “failing which steps as deemed fit shall be initiated without further notice”.The programme Khanasi Neinasi is around two months old and besides being shown on Facebook it was also telecast on the YouTube channel of Frontier Manipur, an Imphal-based digital news platform.“We have hosted just 4-5 shows. The last show aired on February 28 (a day before the notice was issued) was titled ‘Media Under Siege: Are Journalists Walking a Tightrope’” Kishorechandra, who’s also an associate editor of Frontier Manipur, told HT over the phone from Imphal.Frontier Manipur is in collaboration with another news portal called Seven Salai and uses the latter’s infrastructure.

02-03-2021||India||Brinda Karat writes to CJI urging him to withdraw 'marriage' remarks made at bail hearing of rape accused||CPI(M) Politburo member Brinda Karat has written to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde urging him to withdraw his remarks made during the hearing of a case where he asked a rape accused if he was willing to marry the victim, saying that courts should not give an impression of supporting such "retrograde" approaches.Karat was referring to remarks made during the hearing of a plea filed by a public servant, who is accused of repeatedly raping a girl, against the Bombay High Court February 5 order which had cancelled his anticipatory bail.The Left leader said that these questions, words and actions have serious implications in granting of bail in cases of rape of minors."Please reconsider and withdraw these comments and questions... Please uphold the judgment of the Aurangabad High Court which rules that bail granted to him by the lower court was 'atrocious'," she said.When the hearing on the plea commenced on Monday, the bench also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked the accused “Are you willing to marry her?”“If you are willing to marry her then we can consider it, otherwise you will go to jail,” observed the bench adding “We are not forcing you to marry.”The counsel appearing for the petitioner said the accused was initially willing to marry the girl but she had refused and now he was married to someone else.As the counsel said that the accused is a public servant, the bench said, “You should have thought this before seducing and raping the girl. You knew that you are a government servant”.The apex court granted the accused protection from arrest for four weeks to allow him to apply for regular bail in the trial court.In the letter, Karat said, "The girl was gagged and raped by this criminal, when she was just sixteen years old. He repeated his crime 10-12 times. The girl tried to commit suicide. Does this show consent?"In any case, in the case of a minor, as this girl was, the law is clear that there is no issue of consent.¨She also asked the CJI to consider the effect such questions will have on the psyche of victims,The message given is that a rapist can escape jail if after the crime he “agrees” to marry his victim whether she wants to or not, she said.¨There is a prevailing retrograde social approach that the victim of rape is a 'bad' woman and if the rapist marries her, she gains respectability in the eyes of society. Comments of the apex court should not give the impression of supporting such approaches," she said.Karat said that the processes of justice must keep the interests of the rape victim at the centre. "Unfortunately in this case, the opposite has happened," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brinda-karat-writes-to-cji-urging-him-to-withdraw-marriage-remarks-made-at-bail-hearing-of-rape-accused-101614688540218.html

Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk happen to be members of the Extinction Rebellion India chapter and his interaction with them is strictly in his capacity as liaison and in their capacity as volunteers in Extinction Rebellion, which is completely unconnected with the offences that the hypothesis of the Delhi Police alleges,” Chaudhuri’s lawyer said in his petition to the court.The petitioner pointed out that the Delhi Police has in media briefings referred to his name as a suspect in the case leading to his fear that he will be falsely arraigned as an accused in the case and arrested.“Despite the above facts, and the fact that the petitioner is not connected with the offences alleged in the FIR he apprehends that the Delhi Police intends to arrest him forcing him to file the application” the petition said.Chaudhuri, 29, has been working in Goa since August 2020 has been working for the accreditation of khazan lands as a United Nations Agricultural Heritage Site besides also volunteering with Extinction Rebellion actively involved in seeking ecologically sustainable solutions and proposing an environment oriented approach towards policy making.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-in-goa-files-anticipatory-bail-plea-fearing-arrest-in-toolkit-case-101614687764842.html

02-03-2021||India||Tackle terror, prevent persecution of minorities: India tells Pakistan at UNHRC||India on Tuesday criticised Pakistan for again raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), saying the government in Islamabad had failed to tackle terrorism or prevent the “systematic persecution” of religious minorities. New Delhi’s position was conveyed in response to a speech by Pakistan’s representative at the UN human rights agency following an update on the global human rights situation by UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet last week. Bachelet had said restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir remained a concern. Pawan Badhe, first secretary in India’s permanent mission in Geneva, said Pakistan has “ignored that terrorism is the worst form of human rights abuse and the supporters of terrorism are the worst abusers of human rights”. “The members of this council are well aware that Pakistan has provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of state funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN,” he said. Pakistani leaders had “admitted the fact that it has become a factory for producing terrorists”, he added.Also Read | Pakistan needs legislation to meet three outstanding FATF benchmarks: ReportTurning to Pakistan’s religious minorities, Badhe said: “The council should ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs has drastically shrunk since independence and why they and other communities, such as Ahmadiyas, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis and Baloch, have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuses and forced conversions.” Holy sites of Pakistan’s religious minorities have been “attacked and vandalised daily”, he added. Enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and arbitrary detentions of those who speak against the security establishment are “rampant in Pakistan and have been carried out by the state’s security agencies with impunity”, Badhe said. The Indian side also pointed the recent acquittal by Pakistan’s Supreme Court of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, convicted for his role in the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl, and the disappearance and killings of Baloch human rights activists in other countries. Badhe said this showed that such “human rights defenders are not safe even after they leave Pakistan”. While accusing Pakistan of deliberately misusing UNHRC for “malicious propaganda against India”, Badhe said Pakistan should stop wasting the time of the council, “stop state-sponsored cross-border terrorism and end institutionalised violation of human rights of its minority and other communities”. The Indian side also rejected a reference to Jammu and Kashmir in a statement by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and said it has no locus standi to comment on Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. “It is regrettable that OIC continues to allow itself to be exploited by Pakistan to indulge in anti-India propaganda,” Badhe said. Following Bachelet’s update on Friday, which was also critical of raids against human rights activists in Kashmir, Pakistan’s permanent representative in Geneva, Khalil Hashmi, had criticised alleged human rights violations and demographic changes in the region. “These illegal actions are aimed at transforming the Kashmiri majority into a minority in continued defiance and violation of international law,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tackle-terror-prevent-persecution-of-minorities-india-tells-pakistan-at-unhrc-101614687147861.html

Some people say that the group behind the attacks is Chinese but we don't have evidence. China will definitely deny it,” news agency ANI said quoting Singh.He also said that two teams had conducted an investigation and found “human error” to be the reason behind the power outage.“Two teams investigated the power outage and submitted that the outage was caused by human error & not due to cyber attack. One of the teams submitted that a cyber attack did happen but they were not linked to the Mumbai grid failure,” Singh told reporters.The minister acknowledged that cyber attacks were carried out on the country’s southern and northern region load dispatch centres but they were not able to reach the main operating system.Singh’s remarks comes on the heels of claims made by Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh who on Monday blamed a cyber-attack behind the power outage in Mumbai in October last year. Citing a preliminary report of the Maharashtra police’s cyber cell, Deshmukh told reporters, “Some 14 trojan horses may have been introduced in the server of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, and data of around 8GB may have been transferred from unaccounted foreign servers.”On October 12, 2020, a grid failure resulted in massive power outage in Mumbai and its suburban areas. Power for essential services came back after two hours, the rest ofMumbai was plunged into darkness for quite some time as power was restored in a phased manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-power-outage-due-to-human-error-no-proof-of-china-s-role-union-power-minister-rk-singh-101614684817135.html

This is the first symptom of downfall. The concept of self-analysis has been left aside,” he said in his address to a meeting of BJP’s Rajasthan unit. Nadda said leaders should be productive. “In politics, you have to be relevant, and this depends on your contribution to the party. The leader will have to develop the quality of taking along everyone which will increase your acceptance.”“Are we working with maturity?” asked Nadda while stressing that leaders should keep on working to enhance their relevance and acceptance. He added that one becomes a leader by actions. “The BJP is a cadre-based party, and it is our responsibility to strengthen that cadre,” he said. Nadda asked the leaders to make strong mandal units by April 6, the party’s foundation date, active booth committees by September 25 (Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s anniversary), and panna pramukhs by December 25 (Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s anniversary).Nadda hit out at the farmer leaders for doing just politics. “It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who thought of their welfare,” he said amid the ongoing farmer agitation against the three farm laws passed in September. He added the farm reforms introduced in September will change the fate and future of the farmers. “The Prime Minister said he is open for dialogue with food growers, but political parties and leaders are misguiding [farmers]. It is our responsibility to tell them about the reforms.”Nadda called the Congress a “frustrated lot”. “…they can promise anything to come to power but never fulfil them...” He said the Congress-ruled Rajasthan is top in crime, corruption and injustice to Dalits and women. “Congress leaders have zero knowledge about employment. Jobs would not be there till a conducive environment… who will come if such is the state of the law and order?”Nadda blamed chief minister Ashok Gehlot for misgovernance while praising Modi for effective Covid management. He added Modi saved the country by timely imposing lockdown and encouraging scientists to develop the vaccine against the disease. State BJP president Satish Poonia said the party will hold demonstrations on issues such as unemployment and loan waiver across the state from March 6 to 14.Poonia expressed confidence that the BJP will win by-polls to all four seats in the state.Congress leader Archana Sharma said Nadda’s visit was aimed to bridge the divide in BJP’s state unit. She said Nadda unnecessarily criticised the Congress despite knowing that the masses support the government. “The rift inside the BJP and among its senior leaders is evident with lawmakers writing to state chief of being neglected and other faction demanding that [Vasundhara] Raje be projected as the next chief minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-in-rajasthan-asks-bjp-leaders-workers-to-do-a-selfanalysis-101614684687840.html
02-03-2021||India||Kangana Ranaut moves SC, seeks transfer of cases from Mumbai to Shimla||Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut has told the Supreme Court that she does not wish to go to Mumbai as her life and property are under threat from the Maharashtra government. With her tweets and interviews inviting two police complaints and criminal proceedings against her and her sister Rangoli Chandel, the actress has moved a transfer petition in the top court to shift the criminal cases and trials to a Shimla court. The transfer petition by Ranaut and Chandel was filed in the top court on February 24 and is yet to be listed. The two have been named in separate FIRs for promoting enmity and insulting religious beliefs, registered last year at Amboli and Bandra police stations. A case against the duo is also pending on the same charges before the 66th Metropolitan Magistrate court at Andheri. In addition, Ranaut has sought the transfer of a defamation trial pending against her in an Andheri court filed by poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar. Also Read | Karnataka HC refuses to stay proceedings against Kangana RanautRanaut currently enjoys Y-plus category security of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) granted by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “It becomes quite evident that the petitioners face serious threat to life and property and if the trial of the cases are not transferred out of Mumbai, the petitioners’ life will be at risk,” stated the petition filed by the actress through Supreme Court lawyer Neeraj Shekhar.The actress pointed out instances from which she apprehends danger to her life, including the demolition of her Pali Hill bungalow by the Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in September 2020. She further quoted an insulting statement issued against her by senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut to highlight the vitiated atmosphere for trial in the state. “These acts of the Maharashtra government clearly show that the Maharashtra government has malafide intentions against the petitioners herein and that if the petitioners visit Maharashtra to attend the said trials, there will be a constant threat to them from the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra government,” the petition stated.The sisters have invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Section 406 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to transfer the two FIRs and trials in two criminal cases from Maharashtra to Himachal Pradesh. The two FIRs were filed by Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh and Munawar Ali. The first complainant had also approached the Andheri court accusing the petitioners of spreading hate, promoting enmity, and insulting religion or religious beliefs with their tweets. In one tweet, Ranaut had criticised the attack on a medical team led by doctors in Moradabad’s Nawabganj who had gone on Covid-19 duty. The second criminal case was lodged by Munawar Ali over her subsequent tweet where she criticised the Maharashtra government over handling of the Covid-19 situation.“The petitioners herein have a stellar reputation and huge fan following amongst the Indian public and are public spirited citizens,” the petition stated invoking the top court’s jurisdiction to get the matters transferred to a court in Shimla. Ranaut hails from Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-moves-sc-seeks-transfer-of-cases-from-mumbai-to-shimla-101614684267942.html

02-03-2021||India||Insurgency-related incidents dipped by 80% in N-E states last year: MHA data||Insurgency-related incidents in the northeastern (N-E) states dipped by 80% and civilian deaths by 99% last year compared to 2014, according to the Union home ministry data. The civilian deaths were in single digits (two) in 2020 for the first time since 1999. The deaths of security forces’ personnel also came down by 75%.The insurgency peaked in the region in 2000 when 1,923 incidents related to it were reported. The number came down to 162 in 2020 compared to 824 in 2014 when 212 deaths were reported. The highest number of civilian killings (907) in the region was also reported in 2000.In 1999, 208 security forces’ personnel lost their lives fighting insurgents in the region. Five deaths of security personnel were reported in 2020 compared to 20 in 2014.The highest--2,644--number of insurgents belonging to various outfits surrendered to security forces in 2020. Prior to this, the highest number of surrenders was in 2000 when 1,962 militants gave up arms. About 1,824 insurgents have surrendered from 2014 to 2019.Also Read | 2 years of Pulwama terror attack: The day when India lost 40 CRPF menThe data suggest that insurgency has reduced drastically, particularly since 2015, a year after the National Democratic Alliance government came to power at the Centre.G Kishan Reddy, Union minister of state (home affairs), informed Parliament in March last year that there was a 70% reduction in violence in the region in 2019.A ministry official, who did not wish to be named, said the 80% reduction in insurgency-related incidents and rise in the number of insurgents giving up arms by over 1600% from 2019 is further improvement and a great achievement for the government and security forces. “Because of the improvement in the security situation, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, has been removed completely from Meghalaya and Tripura and its application has been reduced in Arunachal Pradesh,” the official said.“Overall, the security situation in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura has improved to a satisfactory level.”All four factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) disbanded themselves last year 34 years after it was formed to seek a separate Bodoland state from Assam. This came following the signing of a memorandum of settlement of the outfits with the Centre in January. Following the settlement, 1,615 NDFB members surrendered in January 2020.Experts and officials said almost all major insurgent groups, including the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) and its factions, have signed ceasefire agreements with the government. They added regional diplomatic cooperation between India and neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar have denied insurgents safe havens. These factors along with economic development in the region and movement of people to the mainland for job opportunities have also resulted in the dip in violence.Subir Bhaumik, a former BBC journalist and analyst, said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s return to power in Bangladesh in 2009 was the game-changer for the insurgency. “Earlier, all the insurgent groups had safe havens there. Sheikh Hasina made sure that Bangladesh’s soil is not used by the extremists and their leaders were handed over to India...the Myanmar army is now backing India against insurgents because it needs the Indian help in fighting [its insurgent group] the Arakan Army.”Bhaumik said the main armed movement– NSCN-Isaac Muivaah--and all its factions are now involved in peace talks. “Nagas not fighting the government is the primary reason for the significant reduction in incidents. More importantly, the Indian economy and its growth have proved to be a magnet of opportunities for the younger generation in the Northeast. The basic attraction for joining the underground [groups] is now gone,” he said. Bhaumik added younger people from the region are now moving to Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru for work. “People of the Northeast have shunned the insurgent groups. There is a strong sentiment against rebel action. In fact, there are more recruitment rallies for the Indian army in the Northeast than probably in Punjab and other regions.”Pushpita Das, a research fellow at New Delhi’s Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, echoed Bhaumik. “Major insurgent groups are engaged in peace talks and this has raised hopes that there will be all-round peace and development in the region. A lot of development push has gone into the [the region] in the last several years and large scale migration of youth from the Northeast to the mainland has also played a role in reducing the recruitment pool for insurgent groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/80-reduction-in-insurgency-related-incidents-in-n-e-states-last-year-mha-data-101614676827488.html

02-03-2021||India||Unemployment high in India due to government's 'ill considered demonetisation decision': Manmohan Singh||Attacking the Centre, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Tuesday said unemployment is high in the country and its informal sector is in shambles following the "ill considered demonetisation decision" taken by the BJP-led government in 2016. He also criticised the central government for not holding regular consultations with the states. Inaugurating a development summit virtually organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies, an economic think tank aligned to the Congress ideology in poll-bound Kerala, Singh said temporary measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank to paper over the credit problem cannot blind us to the looming credit crisis ahead that could affect the small and medium sector. "Unemployment is high and the informal sector is in shambles, a crisis precipitated by the ill considered demonetisation decision taken in 2016", he said at "Pratheeksha 2030." The summit was organised to launch a Vision Document, a framework of ideas for development of Kerala well in advance of the state elections. He said in Kerala and in many other states, public finances are in disarray with states having to resort to excessive borrowing, which creates an intolerable burden on future budgets. "Federalism and regular consultation with states, which was the cornerstone of Indias economic and political philosophy as enshrined in the Constitution, no longer finds favour with the present Central government," he said. Singh said while Kerala's social standards are high, there are other sectors that need strong attention in the future. "There are many roadblocks ahead that the state has to overcome. The global downturn of the last two or three years, aggravated by the pandemic, has made the global interface of Kerala more fragile. "While the increased use of digital modes of work may keep the IT sector afloat, tourism has been hit badly and the rate at which the pandemic is galloping in Kerala poses challenges for this industry", Singh said. Noting that the focus on health and education has enabled Kerala to take advantage of job opportunities elsewhere in the country and in all parts of the world, Singh said this has led to a growing stream of remittances from abroad which created a booming real estate sector and sharp growth of the services sector, led by tourism and information technology. "In the midst of all the gloom, I see the UDF's steadfast adherence to planned growth with a clear sense of direction and concern for the common man a beacon of hope, not only for Kerala, but for the whole country", he said. "When I presented the national budget in 1991 as Finance Minister, I quoted Victor Hugo, who had said, "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come." I get the feeling that the unanimity and clarity displayed by the UDF on the road ahead will lead to Kerala's idea moment arriving this year", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-high-in-india-due-to-government-s-ill-considered-demonetisation-decision-manmohan-singh-101614674381644.html

But transgender people often face serious discrimination and mistreatment at work, school, and in their families and communities,” the plea has claimed.It said transgenders faces stigma and discrimination and get fewer opportunities as compared to others.Referring to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019, the plea said Parliament had passed the bill to protect transgender rights but the new law is “inadequate on several fronts”.The plea alleged that living conditions of transgenders are very poor and that majority of them are living in rented accommodations.It said that as per a 2017 report of the National Human Rights Commission, 79 per cent of transgenders either live in rented rooms or share accommodations with others and 52.61 per cent have monthly income below ₹10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-seeks-a-transgender-welfare-board-to-address-social-welfare-issues-101614673645433.html

Harsh Vardhan explains||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said that on the first day of vaccination on March 1, some technical glitches were encountered during registration through Co-Win, but all those issues were immediately resolved, the health minister said. The glitches were mainly because of the huge number of people trying to log in on the website, the minister explained and said that there were already five lakh registrations on Tuesday before 9am. On Monday, 34 lakh registrations were done."Ministry officials are coordinating with state governments and we will again meet with them in the afternoon," the minister said as he came to take his first shot of vaccine at a Delhi hospital, accompanied by his wife Nutan Goel. Both of them were administered Covaxin doses and they paid ₹250 for each dose, the minister said."Those who can afford to pay for the vaccines should go to private hospitals and get vaccinated," the minister added.On Monday, several glitches were reported from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh delaying the drive. Confusion on day one prevailed as many people thought they will have to download Co-Win app to register themselves. The health ministry clarified that the mobile app that can be downloaded from the play store is only for administrators. The self-registration option is available on cowin.gov.in website.According to a PTI report, Mumbai district, Amravati, Chandrapur, Jalgaon, Latur, Nanded, Nandurbar, Solapur and Thane districts have either not reported any vaccination or partially uploaded data (on all eligible groups) due to technical glitches.In Andhra Pradesh, vaccination of senior citizens and those eligible for vaccine did not begin on Monday as the pre-registration and prerequisite for getting vaccinated got delayed. "Everything is in place and vaccine doses have been kept ready in all hospitals, including selected private clinics. But, the pre-registration did not happen as expected," an official said.Dr Vardhan on Tuesday urged people to not spread rumours about Co-Win and get vaccinated. "This vaccine will become sanjeevani. Hanumanji had to cross half the country to get sanjeevani, but now it is here at your nearest hospital," the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-were-some-glitches-on-co-win-but-harsh-vardhan-explains-101614671695893.html
02-03-2021||India||Cong’s new campaign style: Dance, push-ups and deep sea diving||The distance between Lakhimpur in north eastern Assam and India’s southern tip of Kanyakumari is more than 3,000 kms. But on Monday, the two corners saw a similar political portrait: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Kanyakumari and his sister party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Assam, breaking into a dance with the locals. On Tuesday, Priyanka followed it up by plucking tea leaves in Sadhuru tea garden at Biswanath district, connecting with a key vote bank in the populous north-eastern state going to three-phase polls from March 27. Rahul, the top campaigner for the party in this round of assembly election in four states and a UT, too, came up with new ideas to reach out to the people. He joined the students of St. Joseph’s Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Mulagumudu of Kanyakumari in their dance. Then, he accepted a push-up challenge by Merolin Shenigha, a student who is also a Judo enthusiast. Rahul, trained in Japanese martial art Aikido, did a bonus stunt of push-up with one hand to the thunderous applause of the students who came to meet him on a Sunday morning. A few days ago, in Kerala, he dived into the sea along with some fishermen and helped a group of villagers cook mushroom biryani in Tamil Nadu. He did it earlier too, when he joined MGNREGS workers in UP in their work when the UPA was in power. Also Read | West Bengal: How the Left diluted its own politics to try and outmanoeuvre TMCAll these antics are part of what is seen as a new-age Congress campaign with top leaders eager to break the barrier between them and the public. No more confined to addressing large meetings or road shows, Gandhis make it a more personal appearance and an engaging, direct interaction with their audience. History of such engagements, of course, goes back to the days of Indira Gandhi when she would climb the barriers and freely interact with rural women frequently during her Prime Ministerial days. Or, when Rajiv Gandhi would drive his own jeep on dirt roads and meet people. The BJP and other parties too, have come up with such plans to add a dash of personal touch in their political progammes. Sharing a meal with a villager, spending a night in a village or riding pillion with an aam admi, are all parts of a changing canvas of political propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congs-new-campaign-style-dance-push-ups-and-deep-sea-diving-101614673347158.html

02-03-2021||India||Kerala strike against rising fuel prices hits normal life||A strike called by various trade unions to protest the recurring fuel price hike affected normal life in poll-bound Kerala on Tuesday with public transport remaining off the roads and most of the shops remaining shut. Though private vehicles were allowed to ply, many kept off the roads; and in some areas a virtual shutdown was witnessed. Except the Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) all trade unions were supporting the dawn to dusk strike.In view of the strike, various examinations scheduled for the day were postponed. The government and private buses, taxis, autos and trucks suspended their services and shops that opened, later pulled down their shutters. In a joint statement, protesting trade unions said rising fuel prices were making operation of goods and passenger vehicles costlier and many employees were rendered jobless.Continuously rising fuel prices have become a major political issue with the opposition accusing the BJP led Central government of being insensitive to common man’s woes by refusing to slash high central taxes levied on Petrol and Diesel, however, the Centre has passed the buck to the states, asking them to cut down high state taxes levied on fuel to bring down the price. Petrol and Diesel prices have been rising continuously due to improved demand of crude oil in the international market, renewed hope due to launch of Coronavirus vaccines and low production. While prices of fuel in India have been deregulated subjecting them to near-daily fluctuations in the international market, more than half of its price in the country is composed of taxes levied by the Centre and the states. The Central government has accepted that the rising prices are a vexatious issue, however, it has also indicated that a reduction in Central taxes could negatively impact the revenue targets.Also Read: 'Metro man' E Sreedharan's entry triggers steady flow of bigwigs to party: BJPEarlier, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) requested the state government for a cut in state taxes to bring down fuel prices to ease the burden on the common man but the state finance minister, Thomas Iassac, ruled it out saying a reduction in state-levied taxes on fuel will cripple revenue flow to the state exchequer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-strike-against-rising-fuel-prices-hits-normal-life-101614668968868.html
02-03-2021||India||Hash constant: Govt’s solution to tracing originator of viral messages||Significant social media intermediaries can comply with the government’s norm for disclosing the originator of viral messages by assigning each message a unique mathematical value that can be traced to their creators, an official familiar with the matter said even as the chorus against the new rules for digital media escalates. The value is called the hash constant or the hash value. The value changes at the slightest alteration of the original message, say with the insertion of even a comma or a full stop, leading to a new originator being created.Significant social media intermediaries are the ones that have over five million users, according to the new online media rules. The Centre last Thursday notified the rules that will govern online content. The rules include allowing users to dispute action taken against them by social media intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for so-called over the top platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.Also Read | Centre announces rules for OTT, digital mediaMost end-to-end encrypted messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, fall in the significant social media category. They have 90 days to comply with the extra due diligence rules.“The hash constant is barely 1 kb and will take up not more than 1% of the memory of the messaging application,” said a second official, on the condition of anonymity. The official added the government would already have identified the text of the message, so at no point will the messaging company have to violate the encryption. “All we are saying is store the hash, identify it for a particular message and tell us the originator for the same as the value is constant,” the official said. “We do not even want to know who all the message was forwarded to.”The official added the ambit under which a judicial or competent authority order can be exercised is very clearly laid out in the rules. They include a threat to sovereignty, integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order, or of incitement to an offence relating to them or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material, punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years. The official said the rules also state that no order shall be passed in cases where other less intrusive means are effective in identifying the originator of the information.A person familiar with Signal’s policies said that the company is completely open-source and collects no data. “The policy being requested by the government will lead to breaking end-to-end encryption,” the person said. “It seems India is moving towards controlling the internet the same way China does, or even worse–Iran.”Signal has been designed to minimise the data it retains about users. “...the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user’s connectivity to the Signal service,” it said in response to a grand jury subpoena for Signal user data in the US in 2016. “Notably, things we do not have stored include anything about a user’s contacts (such as the contacts themselves, a hash of the contacts, any other derivative contact information), anything about a user’s groups (such as how many groups a user is in, which groups a user is in, the membership lists of a user’s groups), or any records of who a user has been communicating with.” The company emphasised all message contents are end-to-end encrypted, and they do not have that information either.WhatsApp, too, is involved in a case in the Madras High Court, where it has been suggested that originator information be attached to every message. “But that is not possible as the... protocol... WhatsApp uses for end-to-end encryption as well provides for cryptographic deniability,” said a person familiar with WhatsApp’s policy.The person added the meta-data that WhatsApp collects is shared with law enforcement agencies. In its affidavit filed in the high court, WhatsApp said it is unable to comply with providing originator information as it does not store it. It is unable to search for and view messages exchanged on its platform, it added.Anand Venkatanarayanan, disinformation, cyber weapons and data security researcher, said there is simply no way to comply with the guidelines without breaking end-to-end encryption. “At the heart of E2E [end-to-end encryption] is the Diffie–Hellman algorithm, which allows shared encryption keys to be generated by two parties by exchanging their public keys,” Venkatanarayanan said. “...these keys are not static but change for every new message sent out. This scheme allows anyone to forge an entire transcript with anyone, thus rendering any attempt to add originator information into the E2E protocol dead on arrival. Hence, the only way to comply with the guidelines is to break E2E.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hash-constant-govt-s-solution-to-tracing-originator-of-viral-messages-101614667706841.html

02-03-2021||India||Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha channels merged to create new platform, Sansad TV||Indian Parliament integrated its two TV channels for the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to create Sansad TV—a new platform that will continue to live telecast house proceedings and also pack news and current affairs programme in Hindi and English. Officials said that the Rajya Sabha TV establishment—that runs from a rented public property adjacent to the Talkatora stadium, will be merged with the LSTV’s infrastructure to create the new entity. Former textiles secretary Ravi Kapoor has been appointed as the CEO of the new entity for a period of one year on a contract basis, an internal order of the Lok Sabha secretariat said. The plan was proposed by an expert committee headed by Prasar Bharati CEO Surya Prakash in 2019 and aims at cutting costs, streamlining management of the channel and rejig the content to make it a more attractive product for viewers and advertisers. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV were profit-making entities and the channels bagged advertisements primarily from public sector giants and central ministries. According to the new plan, Sansad TV will have two platforms or channels to ensure smooth telecast of live proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament. “During the recess, the options would be to run current affairs channels in English and Hindi or just shut down one channel and run programmes on the other,” said a senior official involved in the plan. “The integrated plan would be a major cost-saving exercise as the RSTV shells out ₹10-12 crore on rent alone for its office and studio on the Talkatora Road,” said a senior official of the Rajya Sabha. The new address for the Sansad TV will be a small bungalow at Mahadev Road that also houses kennel for eight sniffer dogs of the Parliament security service. The Lok Sabha TV also has a studio in the Parliament library building and a feed centre on the first floor of Parliament building. These existing infrastructures would be enough, officials believe, to run Sansad TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lok-sabha-rajya-sabha-channels-merged-to-create-new-platform-sansad-tv-101614665667181.html

The court permitted him to furnish temporary cash surety of the same amount for a period of six weeks, by which he would have to submit the solvent sureties.In January this year, he had approached the high court after a sessions court rejected his bail plea while observing that Dasgupta had played a vital role in the scam and appears to be "appears to be the mastermind" of the scam.However, Dasgupta has denied any wrongdoing.He was arrested on December 24 last year. Police investigating the rigging of TRPs have accused Dasgupta of exploiting his position for conniving with the owner of the media house to manipulate TRPs.Earlier this year, several television news channels were accused of tampering with TRPs by the Mumbai Police.

02-03-2021||India||Separate depart for Odisha SHGs as their growth continues under Naveen Patnaik||Odisha government is planning to make a separate department to administer the self help groups (SHGs) like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, two decades after their inception, by dividing the SHGs into cluster level, gram panchayat level, block level, district level and finally a state level federation, said officials."The unified structure would go a long way in strengthening the SHG initiatives and provide greater focus, synergy and help utilise the manpower and resources in a more organised manner," said a senior state government official. The department would be headed by a secretary and there could be a separate minister for it.The plan to make a separate department for the SHGs came in the backdrop of a recent government decision asking them to collect property tax and holding taxes in state's urban local bodies, where there were less number of officials to collect the dues.In Bhubaneswar municipal corporation, the largest urban local body in the state with a million plus population, there were at least 804 big defaulters of property and holding tax. Till January, BMC could only collect property/holding tax of ₹24 crore out of the ₹90 crore target for 2020-21. The state housing and urban development department now hopes to meet the target by handing over the job of collection of arrears and current tax dues to the SHGs."The main objective of the exercise was to achieve full and complete coverage of all assesses in respect of property Tax/holding Tax and other taxes by involving SHGs. We are engaging the SHGs in urban local bodies where each tax collector has to handle more than 1000 cases a year. The department would pay anything between 2 to 3% of the collection as commission to the SHGs," said a senior official of the housing and urban development department."The move to give more work to the SHGs would definitely add to their confidence and provide more money in their hands. It's a concrete step towards women empowerment and in line with chief minister Naveen Patnaik's faith in women of Odisha carving a separate niche in the society," said Pratap Deb, spokesman of Biju Janata Dal.Though the women SHGs existed in Odisha in 90s, they got a separate identity when Biju Janata Dal under Naveen Patnaik rode to power in 2000. A year after becoming CM, Patnaik started Mission Shakti programme and began formation of these SHGs with the objective of organising women into groups for holistic empowerment and targeted livelihood activities. Today, there are a little over 6 lakh SHGs in Odisha under Mission Shakti with 70 lakh members. In April 2017, a separate directorate of Mission Shakti was created under the Women & Child Development Department.These SHGs take loans from banks and provide small loans to members; make packaged ready-to-eat fortified power food for children in anganwadi centres and look after the mid-day meal schemes of state's schools. This financial year, at least 2 lakh SHGs were given credit linkages worth ₹3411 crore. For SHG groups that take loans up to ₹3 lakh from banks and repay it on time, the state government takes care of the interest payment.Apart from providing small loans to the members, these SHGs are also engaged in a variety of works including collection of power tariff from consumers. A little more than a year ago, the government tied up with Amazon and Flipkart to help the SHG members gain access to a bigger market. An exclusive Mission Shakti e-commerce portal is also being developed in collaboration with the Tata Trusts to market women SHG products online. In May 2019, the Naveen Patnaik government approved provisioning of services and goods for different government departments through Mission Shakti, which would provide direct business worth ₹1000 crore to the SHGs every year.Last year during Covid 19, SHG groups in urban areas were engaged as implementing partners under the Urban Wage Employment Initiative. The scheme, now renamed as Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan, helped urban women in slums and poor households earn through desilting of drains, construction of rain water harvesting structures, plantations, recycling and reuse of waste, beautification of city through wall painting and murals. Around 7000 SHGs were engaged as implementing partners in execution of work with contract value/wage component amounting to ₹62.08 crore.Apart from this, around 400 SHGs manufactured over 3.3 million masks for distribution among people last year. During the Covid-19 lockdown, when dry ration and vegetable shops were shut in rural Odisha, these groups distributed more than 9 million cooked meals through the free kitchen centres managed by them in Odisha's gram panchayats.Political science professor of GM University, Sambalpur, Gyana Ranjan Swain said it is remarkable the way Naveen Patnaik has built a core constituency for his party through SHGs. "In any election, the electorate are vulnerable to money and muscle power. Yet in Odisha, these women have stood rock-solid behind BJD due to the SHG movement. It's a win-win strategy for both BJD and rural women as the SHG groups empower rural women and Naveen Patnaik is assured of a committed vote base. I don't think there are any other committed vote banks of any political party in India as SHG groups in Odisha," said Swain. To show his commitment towards the SHGs, Patnaik in 2019 nominated SHG leader Pramila Bisoyi to contest from Aska Lok Sabha constituency, which he first represented after joining politics in 1997.Also Read: Odisha acid-attack survivor marries long-time friend, recalls journeyThe growth of SHGs in Odisha over the last 20 years is also matched by the rising participation of women in elections. In 2000, when Naveen Patnaik was first elected as CM, only 55.6 % of the women electorate cast their votes as against 63.8% men voters. In 2019 polls, close to 75% of the women electorate cast their votes as against 71% men. "Though there is no empirical evidence to show how many of these women voted for the BJD, we can surmise that most of the women must have voted for BJD," said Panchanan Kanungo, former finance minister of Odisha.Professor of sociology of Utkal University, Navaneeta Rath said one needs to study how the SHG movement has changed the entrepreneurship model in rural Odisha. "Traditionally women in Odisha are not considered to be worthwhile in households. But the SHG movement has altered the power balance in Odisha society. Now they are being taken seriously due to their financial muscle," said Rath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-depart-for-odisha-shgs-as-their-growth-continues-under-naveen-patnaik-101614661264590.html

"Vande Bharat Mission began with 64 flights and about 12,800 passengers on 6 May 2020. Since then we have facilitated repatriation and International travel of more than 6 million people," Puri said on Twitter.The Indian government had launched Vande Bharat Mission, considered to be the world’s largest expatriation exercise to bring back stranded Indians from foreign destinations due to Covid-19 restrictions. Foreign carriers have also been conducting unscheduled repatriation flights for their citizens since March 23.Earlier this month, the eighth phase of the mission was initiated and is currently in progress.Meanwhile, the Union minister earlier said that domestic air traffic was inching closer to pre-Covid levels with 2,90,518 passengers travelling on 2,360 flights on Friday. On February 28, the number of domestic passengers rose to 3,13,668 which was the highest since the resumption of domestic flights on May 25 last year. "Number of domestic passengers on February 28, 2021, rose to 3,13,668 on 2,353 flights.

While leaders are pointing guns and taking pot-shots at the decisions of the party, the party high command is assessing the situation,According to sources, the party high command is dealing with the situation with care so that no wrong message goes to the party cadre. The top leadership is not in a mood to take action against senior leaders who gathered at the event of Gandhi Global Family in Jammu and has not sought for an explanation from them for their remarks. It is easy to understand that the top leadership is avoiding any kind of public embarrassment."Planning of a rally is underway in Kurukshetra district. Though it is yet to be finalised under which banner it would be held, G-23 leaders are not in a mood to normalise the tension building up after group opened a front in Jammu in which leaders like Anand Sharma, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tiwari, Raj Babbar, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the party is getting weak which is weakening the opposition too. Sibal had advocated for Azad, saying, "We do not know why the party is not using the experience of Gulam Nabi Azad."In response, party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said from the forum: "It would have been better if they helped the Congress in five poll-bound states. These are respected leaders and we respect them."The leader said: "The one who has used the term 'used' does not know the legacy of the party. The man about whom the word has been used has been a Congress MP seven times."Soniaji made him the Chief Minister. Indiraji bestowed cabinet berth in central government. He has been general secretary in party and has exercised supervision over 20 states across the nation," the leader said.A senior leader in the group, who wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi and was present at the Gandhi Global Family Function in Jammu, told ANI that no one from the AICC contacted them after the programme and "We are being advised to work for the Congress in poll-bound states but we have not been made a star campaigner by the party. If we go for campaigning it will included in the expense of a candidate and we have not been contacted and assigned any task but we will continue to raise our voices to strengthen the party and we will go the other states too."Even on Monday the crisis went on to next level when senior leader of Congress raised questions about party's Alliance with Indian Secular Front (ISF). Anand Sharma tweeted that "Congress' alliance with parties like ISF and other such forces militates against the core ideology of the party and Gandhian and Nehruvian secularism, which forms the soul of the party. These issues need to be approved by the CWC. Congress cannot be selective in fighting communalists but must do so in all its manifestations, irrespective of religion and colour. The presence and endorsement by West Bengal PCC president is painful and shameful. He must clarify."After that AICC Incharge of West Bengal Jitin Prasad wrote on Twitter, "Alliance decisions are taken keeping in mind the best interests of the party and the workers. Now is the time for everyone to join hands and work towards strengthening the prospects of the Congress in the poll bound states. @INCIndia @rssurjewala @adhirrcinc @AnandSharmaINC."While West Bengal PCC Chief and Leader of the Party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary tweeted that "Know ur facts @AnandSharmaINC ji CPI(M) led Left Front is leading the secular alliance in West Bengal of which Congress is an integral part. We are determined to defeat BJP's communal and divisive politics and an autocratic regime."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-deadlock-to-continue-g-23-planning-event-in-haryana-now-101614657073512.html

02-03-2021||India||Bihar police books landowners for illegal opium cultivation to check the menace||Bihar police have begun lodging FIRs against the original landowners, whose lands are being used for cultivation of opium, in a crackdown on the illegal farming and trade of the contraband. So far, cases against 18 landowners in Gaya and two in Jamui have been filed for letting use of farms for cultivation of opium.The forested and hilly areas of Gaya, Jamui and Nawada in Bihar became notorious for illegal opium cultivation over the past two decades since authorities failed in effective action. The periodic destruction of crops and lodging of cases against those engaged in cultivation of opium while sparing the landowners, did little to stem the thriving trade and the contraband crop kept resurfacing on the same fields.Experts, however, remain sceptical if the new approach will be able to uproot the illegal trade considering the growing scale of opium production, called ‘afim’ locally. They also ask if the law can be enforced in areas where anti-government militias are active and when even politicians are alleged to be involved in the drug trade.Officials in the Bihar police headquarters claim Maoist sympathizers are engaged in opium farming in land located near the Jharkhand border, which can’t be accessed through motor able roads. “Locate crops using drones and satellite images by separate teams of central reserve police force (CRPF), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), narcotics control bureau (NCB) and destroy them right before they get ready for harvesting,” an official said, suggesting a way to tackle the menace.The official quoted above noted other reasons for the trade to flourish. He said lack of employment and quality education in these areas and limited infrastructure drove people to this. He said since most of the illegal farming is done on forest department land, identification of the real grower becomes difficult.Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said all previous cases were of possession or seizure of illicit opium and other drugs. This was the first-time that cases were filed against illegal opium farming. People are growing opium as a cash crop to make fast and easy money, he added.Confirming that the police had recently destroyed opium crops, the SSP said Maoists have raised opium in over 500 acres of land in Barachatti, Dhangai, Dobhi and Mohanpur area. The operation will continue till the last opium plant was uprooted, he added.Police said that besides extortion, earnings from narcotics remain an important source of Maoist funding. The money thus gained is spent on procurement of weapons and maintenance of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army, the armed wing of the CPI (Maoist).In Jamui, a joint team of CRPF, NCB and district police destroyed the standing opium crop in five acres of land in Chakai police station area of the district.Also Read: RJD's Tejashwi Yadav meets Bengal CM Mamata, extends support to TMCJamui SP Pramod Kumar Mandal said two separate FIRs have been lodged against the landowners. “The sowing of poppy crops begins in November while the harvesting takes place mid-March. The crops are generally grown on fields located beside rivers and in deep forests in order to avoid detection,” he added.According to the officials of SSB Frontier headquarters, Patna, the security personnel have so far destroyed a maximum of about 325 acres of opium crop in Gaya, followed by Jamui and Khunti in Jharkhand since January 1, 2021.A senior CRPF official pointed out that each poppy crop destruction effort is classified as a special operation because of the risks involved. “There are times when the forces have to think hard about entering the fields because there could be an ambush waiting for them”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-books-landowners-for-illegal-opium-cultivation-to-check-the-menace-101614656810580.html

Here is all you need to know about the disclosure:• It fuelled speculation that a blackout in Mumbai last year may have been the result of sabotage.• First reported by the New York Times on Monday, security consultancy Recorded Future said the attackers (which it calls RedEcho) targeted at least “10 distinct power sector organisations” with malware known as ShadowPad.• Hours after the disclosure, the Union power ministry said it had received inputs from Indian agencies — first in November and then again in February this year — about the threat of infection from ShadowPad, prompting remedial measures.• The ministry said no data breach or data loss has been detected due to these incidents.• The ministry’s statement appeared to suggest that the attacks were not behind the October 12, 2020, power outage in Mumbai that had lasted up to 12 hours in some parts of India’s financial capital, bringing the city’s local trains to a halt and forcing the airport to switch to back-up supply.Also Read | No data breach in Chinese hacking attempt at power grid system, says govt• Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, the cyber threat intelligence division, also referred to the Mumbai blackout but said it did not have forensics evidence to link the incident to the China-linked campaign.• In Maharashtra, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Monday the state police suspect a cyber-attack to be the reason for the power cut in Mumbai.• Some 14 trojan horses may have introduced in the server of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, data of around 8GB may have transferred from unaccounted foreign servers, similarly, the login may have been made by blacklisted IP addresses in the MSEB server, Deshmukh said.• He cited the preliminary probe of the cyber police following analysis of the supervisory control and data acquisition networks.• Deshmukh did not give details about what malware was used or the identity of the attackers.• The disclosures of the attempts of sabotage of critical infrastructure by Chinese operatives point to the possibility of an unprecedented escalation of conflict between India and China in cyberspace.• The two countries had a bitter border confrontation, including the first fatal clash between their troops in decades, last year. • The two sides have since stepped back from the border stand-off.• According to Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, the campaign targeted “a large swathe of India’s power sector” and shares the same digital infrastructure and left similar footprints as other Chinese actors, which, too, use ShadowPad, a modular backdoor malware that can hand attackers full control over a computer system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinalinked-attackers-target-india-s-power-infra-what-you-need-to-know-101614656966399.html

The notices will help the UK authorities to arrest the three for India to begin their extradition process.HT has seen the notices issued by the international police organisation, which say Hajra Memon and Junaid Memon are Indian nationals while Asif Iqbal Memon is a British citizen. They fled to London from the UAE when the Enforcement Directorate (ED) launched an investigation against them for allegedly using drug money to acquire properties across the world.The notices were issued days after a Mumbai court on Friday declared the three fugitive economic offenders and ordered the seizure of their properties in India and abroad. The declaration will help in the deportation of the three and stop their financial activities abroad.The ED has accused the three of running a drug syndicate after Iqbal Mirchi’s death in London in 2013 and amassing properties in India and abroad.Mirchi was alleged to be a henchman of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim and allegedly involved in drug trafficking and extortion. According to the ED, Mirchi indirectly owned properties in and around Mumbai. ED attached the family’s properties worth ₹798 crore, including a farmhouse, two bungalows, and 3.5-acre land in Panchgani in 2020. It filed a money laundering case against the family in 2019 linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of real estate in Mumbai.A charge sheet was filed against the family before the Mumbai court in December 2019 and the ED issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi’s sons and widow.HT was unable to reach the family’s lawyers for comments. Nobody represented them in the court on Friday.A UK court on Thursday last cleared diamantaire Nirav Modi’s extradition to India as it found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank. The court dismissed Modi’s claims that he would not get a fair trial at home three years after he fled India in January 2018 after siphoning off around ₹6,498 crore. Modi’s case has been sent to UK home secretary Priti Patel to decide whether to order his extradition to India.India last year secured the extradition of former liquor baron Vijay Mallya. But his extradition has been held up due to secret legal proceedings. Mallya is learnt to have applied for asylum in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interpol-notices-against-iqbal-mirchi-s-wife-two-sons-101614647191476.html

Vice president Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar got vaccinated on the first day. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also got vaccinated on Monday.On the question of getting vaccinated, the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge said he thinks the priority should be youngsters who have a long life ahead. "I am above 70 years of age. You should give the COVID-19 vaccine to youngsters and increase the longevity of their life. I merely have 10 to 15 more years to live, Youngsters have a long life to live. I will also take the vaccine," the veteran Congress leader said.It is believed that MPs — half of the total number of MPS eligible for vaccine — will be vaccinated before Parliament resumes on March 8.Of the 777 MPs India currently has, 366 are above the age of 60, meeting the criteria of those who can be vaccinated in the current phase.Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Monday said he does not need the vaccine as his antibody count went up to 300 after he contracted Covid-19 in December. In November, he was administered one dose of Covaxin, as part of the third phase trial. In December, he contracted the infection and was hospitalised.आज आम जनता के लिए कोरोना वैक्सीन शुरू होने जा रही है । सब को निस्संकोच लगवानी चाहिए । मैं तो नही लगवा पाऊंगा क्योंकि कोविड होने के बाद मेरी एंटीबाडी 300 बनी है जोकि बहुत ज्यादा है । शायद मैंने जो ट्रायल वैक्सीन लगवाई थी इसमे उसका भी योगदान हो । मुझे अभी वैक्सीन की जरूरत नही है ।"Today corona vaccine is starting for the people.

02-03-2021||India||SC dismisses PIL to clip Centre's power on IPS transfers||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a petition challenging Centre’s power as the cadre-controlling authority to override states on matters of transfer and deputation of police officers in the backdrop of the row over Centre’s December order to transfer out three senior cops from West Bengal following a breach in security of BJP national president JP Nadda, whose cavalcade was attacked on the way to a public meeting at Diamond Harbour in the state.A West Bengal-based lawyer Abu Sohel filed the petition in public interest challenging the authority of the Centre to transfer police officers out of a state without the state government’s consent. The provision under challenge was Rule 6(1) of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhatt was not keen to entertain the petition and dismissed the matter without hearing arguments on merits.Sohel questioned the rule in the light of constitutional freedoms, in particular the right to equality (Article 14), arguing that the provision provides ‘arbitrary’ discretion in the hands of the Centre and allegedly also impacts the right to dignity of the officers concerned.The Rule 6(1) provides that a “cadre officer may, with the concurrence of the state government or the state governments concerned and the Central government, be deputed for service under the central government or another state government….provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the Central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the Central government.”Also Read: TMC govt, CBI set for another face-off in Supreme CourtSohel’s petition said, “Arbitrary action by the Central government by virtue of the impugned Rule ultimately plays havoc with the right of officers to live a dignified life as guaranteed (by the Constitution).” Further, it claimed that the rule in question created “unjustifiable and illegal deviation” from the original intent of the framers of the Constitution to create harmony between the Centre and the states.The petition cited a similar instance from the year 2001, where the decision of the Centre to recall three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from Tamil Nadu led to an ugly spat between the state government and the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-pil-to-clip-centre-s-power-on-ips-transfers-101614651028530.html

02-03-2021||India||TMC govt, CBI set for another face-off in Supreme Court||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the West Bengal government are set to have yet another face off in the Supreme Court over the agency’s authority to carry out investigations in the state, a battle that reprises one that the two fought around two years ago in the Saradha chit fund case, and which comes ahead of the assembly elections.On Monday, the state’s Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government filed a petition in the top court challenging CBI’s power to register a coal smuggling case, pointing out that the state government withdrew the general consent to the central investigation agency to conduct investigations within the state as far back as November 2018.Rujira Banerjee, the wife of TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee has been questioned by the central agency in connection with the case. Abhishek is also a nephew of the chief minister.The state’s petition requests the court to stay the probe in the case until the validity of CBI’s FIR is finally decided.The TMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (which heads the Union government) are in the midst of a bitter electoral battle which has been marked by high-intensity campaigning, incidents of violence and alleged political killings and assaults, and a spate of defections.In its petition, the state said CBI could not assume jurisdiction to probe just because the case involved illegal mining and pilferage of coal from the leasehold area of Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) to certain so-called railway areas and railway sidings since the state of West Bengal, through its railway police force, was vested with powers of general policing of railways.Railways is a Union ministry.“Further, for any unlawful possession of railway property, the relevant investigating agency is the Railway Protection Force, under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. Therefore, CBI through the impugned FIR is attempting to usurp the constitutional powers of the state police and the Railway Protection Force,” added the state’s plea, which will be argued by senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi.The West Bengal government has disputed the correctness of an order of the division bench of the Calcutta high court, which, on February 12 permitted CBI to continue its investigation in the entire state despite revocation of the consent by the state government.This order was passed by the division bench on the appeal filed by CBI as well as one of the prime accused in the case, Anup Majee, who has also approached the apex court.The state has submitted in the apex court that the high court erred in holding that railway areas in a state are excluded from the purview of consent to be provided by states, and that withdrawal of consent by a state would have no impact on investigation in such areas.Meanwhile, an SC bench of justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah took up Majee’s petition for a hearing on Monday but adjourned it to March 10 on a request made by CBI, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-govt-cbi-set-for-another-face-off-in-supreme-court-101614650182628.html
02-03-2021||India||Madras HC to monitor IPS officer’s sexual harassment case against top cop||The Madras high court on Monday took suo-motu cognizance of a woman Indian Police Service officer’s complaint of sexual harassment against special director general of police and said it will monitor the CB-CID investigation ordered by the state government on February 26.The CB-CID has registered an FIR against the accused under sections 354-A (sexual harassment), 341, 506(1) under the IPC and section 4 of the Tamil Nadu prohibition of harassment of women Act 1998, officials said.The agency will also investigate the role of superintendent of police (SP) of Chengalpet district, D Kannan, who allegedly stopped the woman police officer’s vehicle from entering Chennai when she was on her way to file the complaint with the Director General of Police (DGP) JK Tripathy and the home secretary.Justice N Anand Venkatesh of the Madras high court on Monday said he is taking suo motu cognisance and monitor the CB-CID probe.According to a senior police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity, the incident resulting in the complaint happened on February 21 when the complainant travelled in the accused’s car while on official duty for chief minister Edappadi Palanisami’s tour of the central districts.The accused in the case denied the charges and said he is being subject to a media trial.“I’m challenging the complaint; everything is hearsay,” he told HT.“People who are politically motivated and professionally jealous are doing it. Why are people jumping the gun and conducting a media trial? Why can’t they wait to get access to the official complaint when nobody knows what is in it? Why so much uproar for something that hasn’t happened. Why are they not allowing a committee which has been constituted based on Supreme Court directions to function without influence? On what basis are people jumping to a conclusion?...This (suo motu) is because of things in the media. If there is substance in the original, if this is a solid case, why would you indulge in a media trial?” he asked. The Tamil Nadu government on February 24 formed a six-member committee to inquiry the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-to-monitor-ips-officer-s-sexual-harassment-case-against-top-cop-101614650076100.html

Now it has been decided that a hybrid manner of hearing will start soon in which physical hearing may take place on certain days in a week."The Chief Justice of India made it clear that the judges of Supreme Court themselves are willing to restart the open court hearings but there are medical and technical issues which the registry of Supreme Court of India is trying to sort out and solve. Therefore, it will be done gradually," said a press release recently issued by the Bar Council of India.The Supreme Court registry has arranged a vaccination facility on the premises in addition to the ones at the government hospitals listed for the vaccination. The cost of vaccination will be as per the Central government’s guidelines. Private hospitals can charge up to ₹250 per shot.The judges will not be able to choose between Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, developed by Pune's Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-judges-to-get-vaccine-today-no-choice-between-covaxin-covishield-101614649293323.html

02-03-2021||India||17-year-old dalit girl was strangulated, smothered to death: Police||The body of a 17-year-old Dalit girl was found near a field at a village in Aligarh, police said on Monday, adding that the post mortem report suggested she was strangulated and smothered to death.“Strangulation and smothering have been assigned as reasons for death of the girl. The body was dragged from a nearby field to the spot where it was found by villagers,” said SSP Aligarh Muniraj G.When asked about possibility of rape, the SSP said no injury marks were found on the internal parts of the body.“Yet, we cannot be conclusive about rape as doctors have not confirmed it in post mortem report…,” said the SSP, who did not rule out attempt to rape as a possibility. He added that some people have been rounded for interrogation and five teams constituted to work out the case.Earlier, tension prevailed in the area when the police took the body for the post mortem. Heavy force was deployed at the post mortem house.Also, Rapid Action Force (RAF) and women police force were deployed during a protest march taken out by locals in Aligarh city against the killing.The girl had reportedly gone to gather fodder at about 12pm on Sunday but did not return. Her family began searching for her and was soon joined by other villagers. Later, the body was found in a field, police said.The incident comes in the backdrop of Unnao case, wherein two minor girls were found dead in a field last month when they had gone to collect fodder.Sources said villagers blocked police vehicles and resorted to stone-pelting when police tried to take the body for autopsy, injuring Pramendra Singh, the in-charge of Gangiri Kotwali of Aligarh district, in the head.Police have registered a case under sections 302, 376 of Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on the family’s complaint, the Aligarh SSP’s office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17yearold-dalit-girl-was-strangulated-smothered-to-death-police-101614647941866.html
02-03-2021||India||Over 5 million sign up on Day 1 as vaccine drive enters Phase 2||Over 5 million people signed up and close to 150,000 people from the general public received coronavirus vaccines on Monday, the first day the drive was opened up beyond health care and frontline workers, leading to a rush of registrations and crowds of hopeful recipients at hospitals across the country.The Union health ministry said nearly 3 million registrations were done on the Co-WIN portal, with each having the provision to sign up four people. “Even if we assume one mobile phone registered at least two beneficiaries, it is more than 5 million recipients registered in a single day that we are talking about,” said RS Sharma, the chairman of the empowered group on Covid vaccinations.The drive kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking his dose of the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi early in the morning, following which a bevy of prominent people too took shots in an attempt to encourage others.“I appeal to all those who are eligible to take the vaccine,” Modi said on Twitter, posting a picture of him getting the shot. “Together, let us make India Covid-19 free!”People above 60, and those who are 45 or more and suffering from certain medical conditions, are now eligible for the vaccinations. But some inoculation centres reported issues with the Co-WIN portal used to coordinate the drive, and people elsewhere reported being confused into trying to book appointments on a synonymous app that is available on application stores.Amid the teething troubles and the crowds seen at the hospitals, there were close to 430,000 doses administered on Monday – lower than the peak of roughly 800,000 seen late last month. But the numbers are set to pick up given the spate of registrations had proven the demand for the shots was high, officials said.“I think people are quite willing to take the vaccine and there is a huge demand at this point of time...We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board since today and 15,000 hospitals in the public sectors. So 27,000 institutions in all and even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100, we will have 2.7 millions in a day,” said Sharma.India, which has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, has so far delivered 14 million doses, mostly to health and front-line workers since starting its immunisation programme in mid-January. It wants to cover 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by August.On average, India has been vaccinating about 500,000 beneficiaries daily across the country, a rate that experts say is inadequate at a time when cases have begun inching up across the country.Over the past three days, the country recorded over 16,000 cases on an average, compared to close to 12,000 in the middle of last month. At least four states are showing signs of a resurgence, making officials fear a second wave may be building.Among the prominent people who took a dose were Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and his wife.“I felt no discomfort after getting the shot. I would now drive back to my village. The only regret is that my wife didn’t come with me as we have only one helmet,” said Ramkishore Sahu, an 80-year-old retired school teacher, who rode his motorcycle for around 68 kilometres to reach Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital to get the first dose of the vaccine.In Madhya Pradesh, 70-year-old Jagdish Pal was among the first to get vaccinated. “I reached the hospital at 8AM for vaccination but due to some technical error in the software. I had to wait for two hours. I am feeling good after vaccination,” said Pal, who recovered from Covid-19 three months ago.In some places, people complained about lack of clarity. “No information was provided on the procedure at the walk-in center nearby home. I have been asked to come back in a few days,” said Mumbai resident Abdul Khadas.In Chennai, Naidu and Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit took the first doses of the vaccine at the Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital. Dravidar Kazhagam president K Veeramani also took the shot at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital here, officials said.(With inputs from regional bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-million-sign-up-on-day-1-as-vaccine-drive-enters-phase-2-101614647410418.html

Last month, the railways had promised customers low fares for the tickets of the luxury train and rolled out a prototype of the Economy AC 3-tier coach with aircraft-style comforts. On Monday, it tweeted a video of the coach being tested at 180 kmph on the Kota - Sawai Madhopur section.Oscillation Trial :New AC 3-Tier coaches with modern facilities have been built.These coaches have been designed in an innovative way having capacity of 83 berths.Trial was conducted at 180 kmph in Kota - Sawai Madhopur section in loaded condition. pic.twitter.com/SVWGjLeJj7"New AC 3-Tier coaches with modern facilities have been built. These coaches have been designed in an innovative way, having a capacity of 83 berths.Trial was conducted at 180 kmph in Kota - Sawai Madhopur section in loaded condition," it tweeted.While an AC 3-tier coach has 72 berths, the new coach has 83 berths. According to reports, the Economy AC coach is likely to replace sleeper coaches in Express trains that run up to 130kmph. The non-AC sleeper coaches cannot attain the speed of 130kmph and hence there is a need for all AC coaches in Express trains, according to the railways. The luxuries of the Economy AC 3-tier coaches include personalised reading lights, AC vents, USB points, mobile charging points, improved ladder to climb to the upper berth and snack tables next to the aisle berths. In addition to all this and foot-operated taps for better hygiene, the coach also has a toilet and entry/exit points for those with special needs.  The fare for the tickets of this coach is expected to be higher than the sleeper class coaches, but lower than the regular AC 3-tier coaches, reports said. RCF Kapurthala has manufactured the luxury coaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-completes-trials-of-new-economy-ac-3-tier-coach-at-180-kmph-101614647231128.html
02-03-2021||India||‘Are you willing to marry her?’ Supreme Court to rape accused||A Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Monday asked a rape accused whether he was ready to marry the complainant, attracting criticism from some lawyers.The comment came at a time when another bench of the Supreme Court is mulling sensitisation programmes and guidelines for judges of the subordinate courts to stop comments and stipulations that might trivialise sexual offences against women.“Are you willing to marry her?” the bench, led by the CJI, asked the accused who is a government employee at an electricity board in Maharashtra, and who approached the top court for bail in the rape case.“Will you marry her? If you are willing to marry, we will consider this (petition)…or else you will go to jail and lose your job,” added the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. It added that the court was not forcing the accused but was only asking about his willingness.But the lawyer, appearing for the accused, said he could not marry her since he was married. The counsel told the court that his client offered to marry the complainant, who was a minor in 2016, but she refused. “Then I married someone else,” said the accused, adding he was requesting for a protection from arrest since he would be suspended from the government job if jailed for 48 hours or more. The lawyer also pointed out that the alleged offence dated back to 2014-15 but the complainant lodged FIR in 2019 when she attained majority.According to the FIR, the complainant was stalked and raped by the accused several times in 2014-15 when she was a student of ninth standard. Later, mother of the accused assured that she would get her son married to her once she turned 18 but that promise was broken. The lawyer for the accused said his client was on bail since January 2020 but the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court cancelled his pre-arrest bail on February 5, this year on the woman’s complaint. The SC bench stayed the arrest of the accused for four weeks, allowing him to apply for regular bail before the trial court concerned.Supreme Court lawyer Aparna Bhatt said: “I am not aware of the full facts but it is shocking that in a case of rape, the Supreme Court considers marriage as a solution. These are serious crimes and no leniency should be afforded to the accused in such crimes... I hope the bar takes up the issue...”Bhatt, along with six other women petitioners, last year filed a petition in SC against a Madhya Pradesh high court order granting bail to the accused in a case of molestation on the condition that he would have the victim tie a rakhi (implying he would accept her as his sister). She also cited another case wherein an accused got bail to marry the victim.Bhatt’s petition came up before an SC bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar in October and November 2020 when it was strongly supported by attorney general KK Venugopal. Pressing for training and sensitisation programmes for the judges of the subordinate courts, the A-G condemned the “patriarchal mindset” and added: “Any judge who wants to pass such an order must place themselves in the shoes of the victim of the sexual violence and assess the crime as if the same had been committed on a member of their own family.”Advocate Shobha, who has represented several victims of sexual offences said: “Such statements (about marrying victims) not only trivialise rape offences but shows how crimes against women in general, are seen by the society. It is very disturbing indeed when judges make such statements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-willing-to-marry-her-supreme-court-to-rape-accused-101614646926673.html

Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer in India, said: “My client Mehul Choksi has clarified that he is very much an Antiguan citizen. His citizenship has not been revoked.”According to people aware of the developments, Choksi was issued a show-cause notice by Antigua and Barbuda authorities last year as part of the process to cancel his citizenship.Lionel Hurst, chief of staff to Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, said the process to strip Choksi of his citizenship will take time. Hurst told news channel India Today that the government attempted to revoke Choksi’s citizenship but he filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda. “This matter will take about seven years to be resolved. With enough money to pursue these legal challenges, 2027 is the earliest for a final resolution.” Choksi can move the Court of Appeals and the Privy Council in London if he loses in the HC.Comments from Hurst, Antigua’s immigration department and the Antiguan PM’s office were not available till the time of print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-challenged-move-to-revoke-citizenship-lawyer-101614646712606.html
02-03-2021||India||Looking back at the coronavirus war room||In July last year, while Delhi slowly emerged from the unprecedented trials of a lockdown and grappled with an average of 2,000 Covid-19 cases a day and a death toll nearing the 4,000-mark, HT spoke at length, over multiple phone calls, to two young doctors on the front lines of the fight against the disease about their experiences.Dr Richa Narang and Dr Saurav Kumar should have been done with their postgraduation -- Narang in anesthesiology and Kumar in general surgery — and in a job of their choice by April 2020; instead, with exams repeatedly being postponed, the lockdown and the pandemic spreading rapidly in the city, they found their teaching facility — the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital being turned into the city’s first dedicated centre for Covid-19. All other work was now indefinitely on the back burner; as “junior residents” (which is what doctors in the final year of postgraduation are called) they were now the core ground force in the battle, working 14-day shifts interspersed with 14 days of quarantine.The two doctors witnessed it all: the transformation of the hospital into the largest Covid facility in Delhi, the initial days of “complete chaos and fear” when there weren’t enough “ventilators, oxygen masks or even cannulas”, learning to work in PPE suits in which they felt “suffocated” and would often be “terribly thirsty, desperate to go the washroom, drenched in sweat and finding it difficult to see through the fogged goggles — all at the same time”; and learning to deal with death.Narang, who grew up in a small apartment in Karnal in Haryana, said that she always wanted to be a doctor because she grew up idolising her sister, 12 years older to her, who is a doctor too. Narang is the youngest of four siblings born to a former school teacher and her husband, a lawyer.“I have a drive, I want to save lives, I want to keep trying,” Narang said in July, her voice choked with tears after a patient she cared for two weeks died in front of her. “I was very affected by the way patients died on my first shift: unable to breathe, no family members around, having spent all the time in hospital in isolation without loved ones.”Kumar grew up in a large joint family on a farm on the outskirts of Araria in Bihar; his father taught Botany in the government college in the city and Kumar is the older of two brothers, both doctors.“When I got into MBBS, I was not just becoming a doctor; for me, it was a generational leap,” Kumar said last year.“In 26 years, I’ve seen two completely different lives, one in the village where I grew up, and one here in the city. And now I am experiencing being on the front line in a pandemic.”How did life unfold for the two doctors since those conversations in July, as the pandemic hit a terrifying peak in the city in October and then slowly began to ebb?Richa Narang: Finally in August we finished all our MS exams. August 1, I gave my last practical exam, got my degree. It was a Saturday. On Monday, I went back to LNJP and joined the hospital as a Senior Resident. I had not met my parents since February, yet they insisted that I join immediately so I could be of service at this time of emergency. That was very inspiring. The one day’s break, on Sunday, I spent with my family. I was meeting them after six months but I spent the entire time in a mask and a face shield, keeping my distance. I ate my meals alone in my room.Saurav Kumar: Immediately after completing my MS, I left LNJP and started preparing for entrance exams for post-MS superspecialty courses. I cleared those exams too. In November, I joined RML (Ram Manohar Lohia) hospital. I joined because it was not a fully Covid hospital. Being a surgeon, Covid had a very negative impact on my training. For months at LNJP I did only Covid management, nothing to do with surgery at all. In November, when I put on my scrubs and entered the RML OT (operation theatre), it was the first time in about eight months that I was doing surgery. I cannot describe the feeling of happiness, it was almost an intoxication. I had to do a stomach closure on a 22-year-old. It felt to me like a second life!Narang: I was on the ground through the worst wave in Delhi. I felt very strong and proud of myself. I was constantly in the ICU, fighting to save patients. Yes, it was hard, it was sad to lose patients, but I kept going, wearing that PPE kit again for six hours a day in the ICU. A patient came in, 18 years old, so strong and positive, fighting Covid, but then she died of kidney failure. There was a 76-year-old patient who was suffering badly, but when I went to help, he held my hand and thanked me and blessed me and said that I’ll do a lot of good in my life. We were both crying. Thankfully, he survived. Another lady, around the same age, did not. Just before I intubated her, she said, even though she was struggling to speak, “god will bless you and look after you”. Then I put the tube in and later that day she passed away.Kumar: RML was the only Delhi government hospital at that time (November) where surgeries were being done. All emergencies were being sent here. We were running full, and of course when a patient came in to casualty we had to admit without knowing their Covid status. In an emergency, you can’t first do a Covid test and wait for the result, and then admit a patient -- you have to straight away start procedures. Outside of emergency, all patients coming in were being screened by the SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections) team to be sent to Covid or general wards. I didn’t have to wear a PPE kit anymore, just double masks, but after being in a Covid hospital like LNJP, once I emerged from that, all fear of the disease had disappeared.Narang: The situation in October was what I imagine a battlefield will be like. We would lose a patient in the ICU, and immediately that bed will be filled with another patient coming in. One day when I was on duty there were five deaths. At one point we were losing 8-10 patients every day at the ICUs. A patient dies, is taken out, another patient is rushed in. It was relentless.For me the drill was the same. Fourteen days of work, 14 days of quarantine. On the seventh or eighth day of my quarantine, I would get a Covid test done, and if I was negative, I would go home for 2-3 days. I never tested positive. But then, in October, my father tested positive. He is 78, a heart patient. My mother is 80 and mostly bedridden. That was the worst time for me. I shifted my father out to an apartment we have in Noida; left my mother under the care of her domestic help. I took care of my father and worked my shift at the hospital. More than the physical stress, and the long drives, it was the emotional stress that was really hard. I slept badly at night thinking what if my father’s oxygen saturation drops at night and he is not able to call for help and I don’t wake up? Luckily, he got through it.Kumar: Once I was done at LNJP, I moved out of the hostel and into an apartment complex near Ferozeshah Kotla because it’s close to the MAMC (Maulana Azad Medical College) library, where I was studying. I was living alone, but that complex has a lot of young doctors like me, so I had a group of friends around which was important. Otherwise it can get so depressing and lonely. I could not risk going home to Bihar. Life was highly restricted. Just my apartment, the library, and back. This was how it was from August till November. No weddings, parties, birthdays, holidays... I still haven’t met my family. But they are all doing well. My brother has just finished his internship at the Armed Forces Military Hospital in Jammu.Narang: When the fall (in cases) started, it was a massive relief. From every ICU being full all the time, people dying and instantly getting replaced by another patient struggling for life, a time came when there were no mortalities. A time came when there were two patients in the ICU, and no calls for more patients coming in. That’s how the new year began for us.I think the one great thing that happened through this is that our infrastructure improved a lot. Every bed in every ward in LNJP now has oxygen supply. Earlier most wards would have 2-3 oxygen beds, and some had none. We got a lot of ventilators. In the anesthesia department, we had only one ICU to begin with. By October, we had four ICUs, each equipped with ventilators. We got lots of Bi-PaP masks (a small, pressurised breathing device) which worked wonders for Covid patients.Kumar: Covid has taught us some important things. We spent an extremely hard year learning these lessons, we should not let go of them easily. Hand hygiene for example, or standing in line, and maintaining distance. From personal experience in government hospitals I can tell you that there used to be constant chaos at the OPDs (out-patient departments) --people pushing and shoving -- now we see them standing in neat lines. They don’t have six feet distance between each other, but there is some distance. See, TB is also contagious, and it’s highly prevalent in India. We used to constantly tell people to not cough in our faces or in each other’s faces but they did not listen. Now they are covering their faces. I think because of Covid, the spread of some of these other infectious diseases are going down.Narang: In the first week of February, I got a Covishield jab. Then I celebrated my birthday in the Covid ward on night shift. In January, LNJP finally started admitting non-Covid patients too, people with serious illnesses like cancer who have been waiting for months for their surgeries. This week I’m on duty at the non-Covid OT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looking-back-at-the-coronavirus-war-room-101614644744871.html
02-03-2021||India||One year after Covid-19: A transformed political arena||To discern any change in politics — and remember changes in politics are, more often than not, incremental and take years to have a noticeable impact — the first clue is political vocabulary. The coinage of new terms reflects new ideas, and in turn, get reflected in political communication. Once the vocabulary gains legitimacy or appeal, there is an impact on political mobilisation — it is ideas that constitute the basis for any organised activity — as well as on policymaking — these ideas, when in power, get translated into action.This, then, generates debate and opposition, and ideas which till then enjoyed limited traction have become a part of everyday discourse.A year after Covid-19 hit India, it is instructive to examine — from the prism of politics — what has changed and what has not.Vocabulary offers a clue. On March 1, 2020, when news of the first case hit the national Capital, no one thought that terms such as mahaamaari (pandemic), do gaj doori (six feet distance, to describe social distancing), lockdown, migrant workers, unlock, corona warriors (to hail frontline workers), RT-PCR (the gold standard for Covid-19 testing), testing labs, Covishield and Covaxin (the two vaccines currently deployed in India), and atmanirbharta (self-reliance) would become a part of everyday discourse in India. No one thought that the idea of video conferencing between the Prime Minister and state chief ministers, or between the PM and world leaders, would become such a regular occurrence that it wouldn’t be even seen as a departure from the older physical format of meetings.No had thought that the impact of Covid-19 — reflected in this new discourse and new methods of interaction — would result in swasthya, or health, becoming a public policy priority of the highest order, with increases in budgets and allocations and renewed commitment to health-related institutions. No one thought that demand for better health care, more facilities for health workers and speedier vaccination, would come from below in the crowded political marketplace of demands. And no one thought that the link between health and economy — reflected in the long march of migrants back home — would become so starkly clear.Yet, all of this happened. And that reflects the story of political transformation in India 2020-21.But alongside, it is important to remember what has not changed.Politics remains driven as much by real or perceived identity-related grievances. There remains a powerful Centre, led by a dominant Bharatiya Janata Party, which has, for most part, so far, been able to politically overcome the disruption caused by the pandemic. There remains a weak national Opposition, which has neither been able to present an alternative model of how it would have dealt with the pandemic and associated challenges nor leverage the discontent the pandemic produced among citizens. There remains an even greater economic challenge of generating jobs at a time when inequality has only become more stark and more starkly visible. There remains both cooperation and discord in India’s federal structure, with differences between the Centre and states ruled by non-BJP forces. There remains the everyday staple of political rhetoric, as can be seen in states going for polls over the next eight weeks. And there remain questions about the health of India’s institutions and whether democracy can navigate the dominance of one party while ensuring checks on it.But along with this, the change is palpable.There may be differences on the quantum of public spending on health, but there is little doubt that no government can now afford to go to the people without a report card on what it has done to handle the pandemic and improve health systems. There may be differences on the quantum and nature of welfare spending, but political parties cannot discard the idea of State support to the vulnerable — at a time when instruments of welfare came to the rescue of India’s poorest citizens.There may be differences on the Centre’s new economic paradigm of embracing reforms and the private sector, but it clearly stems from a sense that the political economy cannot function in business-as-usual mode if India is to become “self-reliant” — and remember, the idea of self reliance itself is a product of the pandemic which disrupted global supply chains, brought home the reality of dependence on China, and the need to develop autonomously.And there may be differences on India’s foreign policy posture, but the pandemic has added to the urgency of making difficult geopolitical choices. The change is palpable in unlikely realms too, including the government’s relationship with big tech. Political communication — if you are on the side of the ruling dispensation or a part of the Opposition or a member of civil society organising protests — has become overwhelmingly dependent on digital communication. And while the dispute between sovereign States and online platforms was a long time coming, it is perhaps not a coincidence that this has intensified in recent months as the value of digital platforms has become even more pronounced.The pandemic has affected both social and economic structures. And if this is the case, politics and governance cannot be divorced from the underlying changes. It is still too soon — India is still confronting the pandemic — to accurately gauge the nature and scale of changes. It is also tempting to underplay the continuities and overplay the disruption. But what is clear is that the pandemic presented, arguably, one of the most difficult challenges the Indian State has confronted. When it emerges from it, scarred but also healed, the State — just like citizens — will not be the same. It will be better, in some ways, and it may be worse, in other ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-after-covid-19-a-transformed-political-arena-101614644039257.html
02-03-2021||India||Covid-19 changed the meaning of home, exposed social chasm||In a corner of the leafy Lake Gardens area in south Kolkata is an old one-storey house owned by the Boses. The matriarch of the family, Sutapa, is in her 70s and has lived by herself for almost 30 years. Her days are spent between the morning newspaper, the afternoon soaps, and the evening walk and adda with her neighbourhood friends, most of whom are senior citizens too.Last June, she welcomed new guests – her son and daughter-in-law who moved back from Mumbai after being laid off, as companies across the country shed jobs to survive after Covid-19 crushed the economy. Sutapa was initially glad for the company but soon realised the new occupants were more lax about the virus, and didn’t follow rules she had laid down for the house.During the nationwide lockdown, Bose changed the orientation of her living space. The passage between the door and the living room transformed into a sanitation area, the ACs were switched off and long-shut windows were pried open. She shifted into a smaller room but with a balcony and attached bathroom, put the television next to her bed, and removed her favourite four-seater sofa from the living room to discourage visitors. She paid her help, Malati, extra cash for putting a table and chair in the bedroom – for the occasional reading, letter writing, and bank pension work.“The first day of lockdown, I went downstairs for my evening walk and saw the street was deserted. Someone said, didi go back. I hadn’t realised how much I craved those two hours with my friends,” said Bose. She identified a long corridor inside the house for her walks, and continued her evening routine until Durga Puja in October, when she finally started stepping out more regularly.For a week after the lockdown, Malati helped Bose around the house, but soon, a stricter crackdown made any travel impossible. The rooms quickly lost their functional independence: the bedroom was the kitchen and the living room. When her son arrived in June, the second bedroom doubled up as a freelance workspace and the dining table was the new play area for their child.When the younger residents were careless with sanitising or called their friends over after the curbs were lifted in August, Bose refused to come out of her bedroom-kitchen-living room. “That room became my whole world and I was never gladder to own a house,” she said.Malati’s year was more difficult. A domestic help at five households, she lives in the rows of slums that line the nearby railway track. She braved the lockdown initially for work but soon found that she – and other helps from the slum – were being looked at with suspicion for being possible carriers of the virus. One building refused to let her enter and the families even abused her. In another, friends told her that the owner had Covid-19 symptoms but was refusing to get tested.With increasing crackdown, by the middle of April, Malati was no longer going to work. Instead, she and her husband were sharing their two-room shanty with their two children. With no income – her husband is disabled and unable to work – and her children’s local school closed, she not only found it tough to make ends meet, but also to observe any Covid-19 guidelines.“I came to know of many precautions one must take to stop the virus. But look at our condition, we struggled to get even rice and our water is not clean. How will we sanitise our hands?” she asked.In three months, she burnt through most of the money they had saved for their children’s high-school education. By June, she was back at work in the neighbourhood but salaries were depressed. Still, she supported the lockdown and was thankful that she didn’t contract the virus. “Every time I go for work, I see so many new furniture and contraptions to keep the infection at bay. I am struggling to even buy a second-hand phone to help my children follow school lessons at home,” she said.Covid-19 transformed not just our homes but their purpose. The television screens turned to home workout tutors in the morning, conference tables for Zoom meetings in the day, and movie screens for binge-watching at nights. Dining tables became work desks and balconies the new parks. Virtual Saturday night parties was the new going out.But this was also a time when the home lost its ability to make someone feel secure. The refuge suddenly became a space where one could bring in a life-threatening virus. As the world distanced itself, we clung to our homes and tried our best to make it more secure.A year into the pandemic, many of the curbs that kept us indoors during the summer are gone. But experts point out that the transition in home design and psyche may be permanent.“Homes can no more merely serve the basic purpose of containment or a place to sleep after work. They need to be empowered with the ability to speak to outdoors and cater to the multifunctional demands of the hour,” said Shraddha Kumar, a professor of urban planning at the Xavier University in Bhubaneswar.The transformation is already visible in the design of new homes – balconies, terraces and courtyards are more important, interiors are less rigid to accommodate more transformational spaces, entrance lobbies are designed as sterilisation spaces, and focus has increased on ensuring privacy of home residents.The neighbourhood is changing, too. Aware that any future surge in infections can render them islands, localities are trying to be self-sustaining, and balance a quality social life with maintaining a personal bubble in public spaces. “With the change in the way we live, work, socialise and communicate, our neighbourhoods also need to go through a transition to cater to social distancing without social disintegration,” Kumar added.But the disease and the lockdown also brought in sharper focus the growing gap between affluent neighbourhoods and the low-income shanties that often ring them — as mirrored in Malati’s struggles to ensure basic sanitation in her home.The outbreak exacerbated multiple other challenges faced by these marginalised communities: low income, inadequate infrastructure, lack of identity documents and state entitlements — that make complying with physical distancing and lockdown rules difficult.Experts suggest a raft of proposals, including community quarantine (not just central or home quarantine) options, support for livelihood loss, factoring in existing problems – lack of clean water, for example – into health policy and ensuring that community health workers, not police, is the first response of the administration.“The vulnerabilities that such neighbourhoods face have always been there, Covid didn’t create them. We’re talking about access to basic social infrastructure like water, sanitation and adequate housing that should mark a basic social safety net always… the key has to be to have universal access to core human development needs be a non-negotiable, regardless particularly of the tenure status of a settlement,” said Gautam Bhan, a professor at the Indian Institute of Human Settlements, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-changed-the-meaning-of-home-exposed-social-chasm-101614643265126.html
02-03-2021||India||Elderly dispel fears, say vaccines are safe||HT Correspondentletters@hindustantimes.comNew DelhiEighty-year-old retired school teacher Ramkishore Sahu drove his motorcycle for around 68 kilometres to reach Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital on Monday to receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “I felt no discomfort after getting the shot,” he said.The only regret, he said after getting the vaccine, was that his wife could not accompany him as the couple only own one helmet. “I would now purchase one [helmet] for her today itself and bring her tomorrow,” Sahu said.India on Monday expanded its vaccination drive against Covid-19 to include people above 60 of age and those over 45 with significant comorbidities.The vaccine is being administered free of cost at designated government hospitals and for 250 at private hospitals across the country. Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, however, will administer the vaccine for free after the state governments in the respective states made promises to this effect.In Karnataka’s Bengaluru, 97-year-old Ramaswami Parthasarathy was the first to get the vaccine jab at Manipal hospital. “Mr Parthasarathy has been vaccinated and he is doing fine,” the hospital said in a statement.Several senior political leaders were also vaccinated on Monday.In Rajasthan, governor Kalraj Mishra, 80, received the first dose at the Raj Bhawan in the state and called upon all those eligible to take both doses of the vaccine.The first beneficiaries in the state were a family of senior citizens, including 72-year-old Mangala Dixit, a retired health director, who were vaccinated at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital. After the inoculation, Dixit said, “This vaccine is very safe. Everybody should get vaccinated.”Vice-president Venkaiah Naidu was vaccinated, along with Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit, at the Governor Omandurar Medical College Hospital in Chennai.In Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar was administered the first dose of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, along with deputy chief ministers Renu Devi and Tarkishore Prasad, and judges of the Patna high court, including chief justice Sanjay Karol.After receiving the first dose, Kumar said, “We had decided last year itself to provide the vaccine free of cost in the state. The state government will reimburse the cost of the vaccine at the 50-odd private health facilities, identified for vaccination.”Some states, however, also reported glitches with registration and walk-in vaccinations on the first day.In Madhya Pradesh, 70-year-old Jagdish Pal, who was among the first to get vaccinated, complained of technical errors in the software. “I reached the hospital at 8 AM for vaccination but due to some technical error in the software I had to wait for two hours. I am feeling good after vaccination,” Pal, who recovered from the Covid infection three months ago, said.MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is scheduled to get the first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday, officials familiar with the matter said.In Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, his wife, Pratibha Pawar, and daughter Supriya Sule, were given the first dose of the vaccine. Sule (51) represents Baramati Lok Sabha seat in Pune.Amid reports of glitches and some people saying they were finding it difficult to navigate the Co-WIN 2.0 app to register and book an appointment, the Union Health ministry clarified to say the app on Play Store is meant for use only by administrators. Registration and booking for appointments has to be done through the portal, it said.(With inputs from regional bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elderly-dispel-fears-say-vaccines-are-safe-101614642162914.html
02-03-2021||India||PM Modi gets first shot as second leg of inoculation drive begins||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday received the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, which has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech, as India’s immunisation drive against the infectious disease entered the second phase to cover about 270 million people.The Prime Minister, who was administered the dose at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), appealed to all those eligible in the latest phase of the vaccination to get inoculated. Modi reached the premier hospital on Monday morning and was administered Covaxin by nurse P Niveda, who hails from Puducherry. Another nurse, Rosamma Anil from Kerala, also assisted in the process.“Took my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS. Remarkable how our doctors and scientists have worked in quick time to strengthen the global fight against COVID-19. I appeal to all those who were eligible to take a vaccine. Together, let us make India COVID-19 free!,” the PM tweeted.On Monday, the government opened up Covid-19 vaccination to those over the age of 60 and people aged 45 years or more with specified comorbidities.The PM opting for the indigenously developed vaccine was perceived as a move to support the Make in India campaign and to counter speculation about the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. Other than Covaxin, India has approved Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield for emergency use.“The PM took Made-in-India Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN and showed that both vaccines are safe and efficacious. We must come forward and take whichever vaccine is available. There’s been controversy comparing one vaccine to other that has been laid to rest,” AIIMS director Randeep Guleria told ANI.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech tweeted it was “inspired and humbled” by PM Modi’s “remarkable commitment to build an Aatmanirbhar Bharat”.According to people aware of the developments, PM Modi opted for an early-morning slot at the busy hospital and to avoid inconvenience to the general public, no traffic restrictions were imposed. With a traditional Assamese stole draped over his shoulders, the PM chatted with the nurses while the vaccine was being administered. “Realising that the AIIMS staff could be nervous around him, he struck a conversation with them before he was given the shot and joked whether they were going to use a needle meant for veterinary purposes. When two nurses did not understand the question, he explained that politicians are known to be ‘very thick-skinned’,” a person aware of the developments said.The Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “In PM’s inoculation visuals, there was ‘gamcha’ (Assam), and nurses who vaccinated him were from Kerala and Puducherry. Coincidentally, there are elections in these states. It would’ve been five states had he also carried Rishi Aurobindo’s photo and Geetanjali.”AIMIM leader and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi said the government should clarify if Covishield was not good for those above 65 years of age. “Everybody in the country will have to take Coronavirus vaccine be it Covishield or Covaxin. I have one question, the German government said that Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India... the data published on the website of AstraZeneca says that it is good for people between 18 and 64 years. It is not effective on those above 64. PM Modi received a Covaxin shot. I want to request the government to clear the confusion,” he said.PM Modi taking Covaxin should remove all doubts people have about its side effects, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said, underlining no death has occurred till now due to Covid-19 vaccination in the country. Vardhan said that if any death occurs a few days after receiving the jab, it cannot be linked to vaccination. Each such death is being scientifically probed, he said.As the vaccination drive got underway, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and several Union ministers including home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, minister of state in the PMO Jitendra Singh and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also received the vaccine. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar was also administered the shot.Several ministers who are eligible for the shot are in the process of finalising the schedule for their vaccinations. “BJP MPs, senior leaders and ministers who are eligible for the vaccine will be taking the shots at private hospitals where they will be charged for it. No one including the PM jumped the queue or got preferential treatment,” a person familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-gets-first-shot-as-second-leg-of-inoculation-drive-begins-101614641978969.html
02-03-2021||India||Nearly half of all MPs eligible, likely to get jab before phase 2 of budget session||lmost one in two of India’s MPs are eligible to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the second phase of vaccination that got underway, and it is believed that most of them will at least get their first shot of the two-shot vaccine before Parliament resumes on March 8.Of the 777 MPs India currently has, 366 are above the age of 60, meeting the criteria of those who can be vaccinated in the current phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took his first shot of the vaccine — the indigenously developed Covaxin — at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, on Monday morning.People above the age of 45 years with significant so-called co-morbidities are also eligible to be vaccinated, although it isn’t known how many parliamentarians fall in this category.While the first shot by itself isn’t adequate, the availability of vaccines for MPs comes as a relief with Parliament that is preparing stage for the second phase of the budget session.The pandemic forced the government to skip the winter session 20 and the budget session saw significant precautions, including social distancing.According to parliament data, 36% Lok Sabha MPs are above 60 years of age. The Rajya Sabha, popularly called the House of the Elders, naturally has more eligible candidates with 62% of its MPs above that age.While official data shows that 218 out of 539 MPs in Lok Sabha and 148/238MPs in Rajya Sabha are eligible for vaccines in the 60-plus category, there is no data to show how many MPs in the age bracket of 45 to 60 years have comorbidities. “We do not keep any data on health conditions of MPs or ministers,” said an official in the Lok Sabha secretariat.An Opposition leader added that one of the key benefits of the vaccination would be that many MPs can campaign safely ahead of the upcoming assembly elections polls in four states and a union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-half-of-all-mps-eligible-likely-to-get-jab-before-next-budget-session-101614641282982.html
02-03-2021||India||'Will be able to scale up Covid vaccinations to 2.7 million a day’: RS Sharma||As the government opened up vaccination to people above 60 and people above 45 with comorbidities in Phase 2 of its Covid vaccination drive, Hindustan Times spoke to National Health Authority chairperson RS Sharma, the man behind registration system, about the process and the targets. Edited excerpts:The Prime Minister got his jab this morning. What kind of impact will it have?It’s a positive and powerful message to everybody, especially those who were doubting the vaccine and fearing side effects. The PM has been the spirit behind the entire citizen-centric approach we have taken from today.Can you clarify the registration process? Initially it was meant to be via Co-WIN app, but now we are told that it is only through the website.I’m glad to clarify this because I have also been sent screenshots saying this part is not working. There are as of now only two inlets, besides the walk-in registrations. One is the website (www.cowin.gov.in) where you can register up to four persons by providing your number. The other way is through the Aarogya Setu app, which has created an extension where you can also register.Was it decided later on to not have a different app for vaccinations?No, the confusion was not created by the government or any miscommunication — confusion gets created by WhatsApp messages etc. We’ve always maintained that there will only be two ways, besides being able to walk in and getting yourself registered and vaccinated immediately, provided there is vacancy. In future, in the next one or two months, people can create apps, get them certified, and register people.At what stage does one choose their slot?After you register, you can go back to the website or the Aarogya Setu app. When you log in, you can see your details, and you schedule the appointment. The two-step process is so that you can choose slots of your choice. You can also reschedule. Suppose you have a slot tomorrow, and something urgent comes up, you can just reschedule it on the website. The idea is that the vacancy created by your change can be taken by someone else. Earlier it was a captive audience of health care and frontline workers, and now it is a demand-driven situation. So, the possibility of no-show is much less.What has been the response?Well, about 1.5 million people have registered thus far (at 3pm on Monday -- the number was up to 2.9 million by late evening). If there are two people registered with one phone number, then we can assume there are three million registrations already. People are quite willing to take the vaccine. The software is capable of handling any numbers at this point of time. There may be some issues on the SMS gateway (for OTP generation) but otherwise our back-end infrastructure can handle it.How do you think the pace of vaccination will be impacted? Till now less than 1% have been vaccinated. At that speed, it will take a long time to complete.I’m not involved with the numbers, but more like a plumber, providing support to the drive. As an individual, however, I see a huge spurt in numbers, and we’ll be able to scale up very fast. It all depends on how private sector hospitals speed up, and also on supply etc. We have a total of 12,500 private hospitals that have come on board today, and about 15,000 hospitals in the public sector. So with 27,000 institutions in all, even at a conservative estimate of each one vaccinating 100, we’ll have 2.7 million in a day.Final question, how will the walk-in vaccination work?The walk-in facility is for slots which have not been filled up. For instance, suppose you have 100 vials for the public, of which you have a few of no-shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-be-able-to-scale-up-covid-vaccinations-to-2-7-million-a-day-101614639415350.html

02-03-2021||Today's||Provide data on the education of Muslims||Educational reform is critical to promoting and sustaining the development of communities. This is particularly true for Indian Muslims, who are, today, India’s most educationally disadvantaged community. However, this change cannot even be articulated without addressing the limitations in the official education data sets available on Indian Muslims.Without empirical evidence, educational planning will depend on subjective and impressionistic views. This was highlighted by the 2006 Sachar Committee Report on Muslims, which observed that it was often believed, without data, that most Muslim children studied in madrasas, thus encouraging religious fundamentalism. The evidence indicated that far fewer Muslim children attended madrasas than believed — around 4% of those aged seven-19 — and that most Muslim students attended government and government-aided schools.A major contribution of the report was to highlight the paucity of data on Indian Muslims in general and their education in particular. Consequently, more official educational data was released, but glaring omissions and deficiencies persist in many government sources of information. This includes the most recent compilation of the department of education, Educational Statistics at a Glance, 2018, which has continued with the post-Independence tradition of providing data for the general population, and separately for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), but excluding Muslims as a separate category. Muslims have also been excluded, and SCs and STs included, in the student enrolment data furnished by special government school networks run by the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS).Muslims are also conspicuous by their absence in the National Achievement Surveys (NAS) of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The most recent 2017 NAS evaluated the learning outcomes of about 2.2 million students in language, mathematics and environmental studies in classes 3 and 5, and tested social studies, science and environmental studies in Class 7. Like the previous publications, learning data was provided separately for SC and ST students. While now including Other Backward Classes (OBCs) too, the NAS Report excluded Muslims from its purview.The importance of this type of learning data, enrolment and other statistics is highlighted by comparing the post-Independence educational trajectories of Muslims, SCs and STs. Educational statistics in colonial India indicated that Muslims were far ahead of SCs and STs in educational enrolment at all levels of school and higher education.However, unlike Muslims, SCs and STs made educational progress in post-Independence India. The availability of data on SCs and STs allowed for special educational schemes to be launched for them. National and state planners and government agencies used a variety of educational indicators to track their quantitative and qualitative progress, thus enabling corrective action. On the other hand, monitoring the educational progress of Muslims was hamstrung by the near-total absence of official data, and consequently, their inexorable downward spiral went publicly unnoticed for decades. When official education statistics and the 2001 Census data on Muslims was finally made publicly available, the true extent of their “invisible” comparative decline was revealed.Muslims have been the most educationally backward group in India. In comparison to their population, they have the lowest enrolment rates at elementary, high school and higher secondary school education, as well as higher education.Since the official educational statistics have revealed for almost a decade that Muslims are the most educationally backward, it is unreasonable for the department of education’s Educational Statistics at a Glance, KVS, NVS and NCERT to continue to exclude Muslims from their purview. Though recent school and higher education reports — District Information System for Education and All India Survey on Higher Education — do provide data on Muslims, it is not comprehensive.What should the government do to remedy this? First, review all official publications including the Census, and publish data on Muslims that is made available for SCs and STs. This includes statistics on enrolment, learning, examination results, provision of facilities/ scholarships in all central and state reports, which would assist in tracking the educational progress of Muslim students, at all stages and networks of school and higher education. Institutions such as Unicef, Unesco and the World Bank should also be urged to follow suit in the reporting of data.Data on Muslims and all other religious minorities should be reported separately. This will help avoid any ambiguity since it is unclear whether the use of the term “minority or minorities” refers to Muslims only or all religious minorities.Indian Muslims are now close to 200 million and comprise almost 15% of the population. Any sustained educational reform that can pull them out of the economic, social and political morass they find themselves in, can only be implemented on a strong foundation of comprehensive data on Indian Muslims that can help track their educational progress.John Kurrien has been working in the field of the education of disadvantaged groups for four decadesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/provide-data-on-the-education-of-muslims-101614691531951.html
02-03-2021||Editorials||Discrediting secularism | HT Editorial||West Bengal is witnessing a fierce electoral battle between the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But in the mix is also a third force, with the Left Front and the Congress as partners. This third front has a new ally in the Indian Secular Front (ISF) led by Pirzada Abbas Siddiqui, a cleric of the shrine of Furfura Sharif in Hooghly district, who has been known for his regressive politics, especially on gender. In Assam, the Congress has tied up with Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front, a force that has made no secret of its religious base and whose leader has often made communally provocative remarks in a volatile state. In both cases, “secular” formations such as the Congress and the Left believe that the Muslim vote brought in by their allies will alter electoral outcomes.In a democracy, all citizens have a right to form political parties. In India’s democracy, where so much of politics is driven by identity, citizens also have a right to form identity-based political formations. And at a time when minorities are insecure with the rise of the BJP, it is but natural that they will explore political alternatives led by community leaders. But this is not as much about the political choices being exercised by either Mr Siddiqui or Mr Ajmal. It is about the political choice exercised by the Left and the Congress.In theory, secular formations should not treat religion as a category of political mobilisation; they should stay away from both majoritarian communalism and minority communalism; and they should be at the forefront of steering political discourse back to the realm of individual rights and justice. In practice, however, secularism has often got equated with wooing the minority voters. This eroded the credibility of a cherished constitutional ideal and created room for the BJP to allege “minority appeasement” and create a majoritarian vote base. The Left and the Bengal leadership of the Congress believes ISF will help bring back Muslim votes from the Trinamool, thus opening up post-poll possibilities in a hung assembly. In Assam, the Congress is banking on a substantial Muslim consolidation to defeat the BJP. But tactical considerations aside, India’s secular forces need to carefully rethink their strategy, for allying with extreme identity-based groups on one side will not help in their aim of defeating an identity-based formation on the other side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/discrediting-secularism-hteditorial-101614691528204.html
