A case has been registered at the Karol Bagh police station and teams have been formed to identify and nab the impersonators, senior police officers associated with the case said.Deputy commissioner of police (Central) Jasmeet Singh said that on Friday evening, the police control room received a call about stealing R12.50 lakh from a man’s bag by three unknown persons who claimed themselves as CBI officers. A police team reached and met the complainant, Bhanwar Singh, who told them that around 7 pm, he visited a jewellery showroom in Karol Bagh for making a payment of R24.25 lakh.“The employees at the showroom did not receive the amount after which Singh left the shop. Outside the shop, three men came near him and introduced themselves as CBI officers. They asked him to show his bag. While checking the bag, they stole some bundles of banknotes worth R12.50 lakh and fled. The remaining amount was there in the bag,” said the DCP.The police are examining the CCTV cameras installed near the crime scene for clues about the suspects. They are also probing if any insider passed on the information about the money to the suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-arrested-for-posing-as-cbi-officers-stealing-rs12-5-lakh-101616264496934.html

They were cheating foreign nationals in the name of social security number processing and providing technical to the clients of a leading cellphone company and antivirus support for the equipments of a leading cellphone and laptop brand.Deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) Anyesh Roy said that the arrested persons also extorted money from foreigners by sending them voice recordings, pretending to be US Drug Enforcement. They sent pop-ups to unsuspecting people that their electronic devices have been hacked and then cheated them on the pretext of providing technical support by a leading anti-virus company. The arrested persons also used to send recorded messages pretending to be from the technical support team of a leading cellphone company and then cheated the callers.“Among the arrested persons are the owners of the two call centres. They have been identified as Kshitiz Bali, Abhishek and Dhananjay Negi. While Bali ran a call centre on the building’s third floor, the other two ran another call centre of the fourth floor,” added DCP Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/34-arrested-in-uttam-nagar-call-centre-scam-101616264076247.html

The plea has alleged that no permission was taken to cut about 980 trees and 1,500 shrubs and neither was any other mandatory clearance obtained for the flyover construction.The plea, filed through advocate Anand Varma, has contended that the construction is being carried without having obtained the necessary permissions/approvals from Delhi government, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).It has said that under the garb of execution of the Dwarka Expressway Package 2, the construction is being carried out “for the ulterior and extraneous purpose of providing connectivity to an exhibition and convention centre”.On March 10, the court had noted that the project is an important project and the concerns of the residents are also valid. It had then directed the DCF, who had earlier granted the permission in 2019, to appear before the court.On March 17, the forest conservator told the court that permission was granted to the NHAI on Sep 14, 2019 for removal of 1047 trees in Sector 20 to 22, Dwarka. However, the approval expired after 90 days and no renewal has been sought by NHAI.The court, noting this, asked the NHAI to seek fresh permissions and posted the matter for further hearing on May 4. It also granted one last opportunity to the DDA to file their response on the plea.The petition has alleged that the “unapproved” construction carried out by the NHAI, to which the other authorities have turned a blind eye, would lead to exponential increase in traffic, air and noise pollution in addition to the creation of traffic bottlenecks, increase road safety issues for residents, not to mention the impact wrought by the felling of trees on the residential road.It also claimed that the residents were not consulted before the work began. Varma has said that from an RTI (right to information) reply given on July 22, they got to know that there was no record of the road being handed over to the NHAI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-tells-nhai-to-seek-fresh-permission-for-cutting-trees-before-constructing-flyover-in-dwarka-101616264016839.html

The health department has permitted private hospitals to hold vaccination drive in coordination with Resident Welfare Association (RWA) to increase the vaccination coverage by reaching out to senior citizens and physically disabled people who have been facing difficulties to visit hospitals to get the vaccine dose. “The hospital has already done a dry run at a community centre in Ansal Sushant Estate, sector 52 on Saturday, where we vaccinated 50 people. It will help us in extending the vaccination camp to multiple RWAs and scaling up the drive from next week onwards,” said Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute. Following the Covid-19 vaccination guidelines, hospitals will be setting up separate rooms for vaccination and observation in clubs, within the premises of condominiums and apartments. In some cases, community centres will be used to set up vaccination camps. As per norms, vaccine beneficiaries will pay ₹250 for a dose and on spot registration can be done by showing ID proof. “We have contacted 30-40 RWA committees. They have all given us positive feedback about the onsite vaccination initiative, especially for the elderly. We are working on the logistics of sending our team of nurses and doctors to the RWAs,” said Arpita Mukherjee, vice president operations and head, Max Super specialty Hospital, Gurugram. At Vatika India Next Township, sector 83, the preparation has already begun where vaccination camp will be set up on March 23 and 24 from 9am to 4pm. “Arrangements are being made at the club house, within the township as per the vaccination guidelines. There are over 30,000 residents, out of which more than 1,000 are senior citizens and about 10,000 are above the age of 45 . Since Saturday morning, at least 375 people have already registered for the March 23 vaccination camp,” said Ajay Kumar Singh, president, Enviro. According to Singh, in order to streamline the vaccination while maintaining social distancing, at least 20 people will be given vaccine jabs every hour. “Gatherings or queues will be prevented. In a day only 500 people will be vaccinated. To cover the identified population group, we are planning to extend the vaccination camp further,” said Singh. The expansion of vaccination to residential societies will also help in expediting the vaccination coverage, which has been gradually declining in private facilities due to multiple factors. “There has been gradual decline in overall turnout in hospitals for vaccination as people are a little reluctant of visiting hospitals for the fear of contracting the virus. Some people are finding it difficult to bring their parents to vaccination sites due to their office hours. Vaccination camps with the help of RWAs will help us in addressing these issues and increase coverage,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, internal medicine specialist, Medanta Hospital. She said, “The hospital will conduct the first drive on Sunday at two societies. It will be extended to at least 10 camps on March 22 as a part of a mega camp by the district health department.” According to hospitals, to retain the quality of vaccine — which requires to be stored at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius — a proper cold chain supply will be maintained. “Vaccine vials will be kept in ice boxes and just enough stocks will be kept at the site. Since the main hospital is located within the city, vaccine doses will be transferred to the camp if the stock gets over early,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hospitals-to-start-vaccination-camps-in-condos-societies-from-today-101616263616926.html

According to the amendments, customers on two-wheelers will now be allowed to enter the market along with vehicles of a certain section of shopkeepers and those carrying goods during the rest of the trial period.Around 10am on Saturday, an hour before the trial was scheduled to start, shopkeepers surrounded all the entry and exit points of the market and started protesting against the move. Almost 90-95% of the shops also remained closed in the market. Sadar Bazar has more than 1200 shops. The cultural programmes planned to mark the beginning of the trial could also not happen and vehicles were e seen plying in the area during the day.The shopkeepers contended that the parking space provided by the MCG was nearly a kilometre away from the market which will make it difficult for the shoppers to reach the area. They also demanded that customers travelling on two-wheelers should be granted entry into the market.“The MCG’s arrangements for the trial were shambolic. Shopkeepers had to walk nearly a kilometre from the parking area to reach their shops. Our businesses have already been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. If customers cannot bring their vehicles to the market, they will simply stop coming and visit other sector markets or malls. Hence, we held protests against the trial,” said Pawan Sharma, a protester who sells utensils in the market.Following a meeting with the MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh on Saturday evening, the civic body and shopkeepers came to an agreement on the matter. For the remaining six days, the MCG’s trial will continue, however, with major changes.Two-wheelers of customers will now be allowed entry to the market, although the MCG will appeal to them for parking their vehicles at three designated points near Old Jail Complex, Grover ground and the ground near the session house. Further, shopkeepers with disabilities or above the age of 60 will also be allowed entry to the market on their two-wheelers. Officials also agreed to the shopkeepers’ demand to allow entry of vehicles that supply goods to all shops till 12 pm.“The trial was scheduled to commence on Saturday, however, shopkeepers raised issues. We held a meeting with them on the matter and resolved the matter after a discussion. We will take feedback from shopkeepers and customers for the remaining six days of the trial and to incorporate any changes if needed,” said Singh.Regarding the changes in the plan, Singh said that the shopkeepers, their employees will have to park their vehicles at the five specified parking spots designated by the MCG for the remainder of the trial. However, shopkeepers with disabilities and senior citizens will be allowed entry to their respective shops, provided one of their workers or acquaintance, park the vehicle at the designated spot eventually.“Since it is a trial, we will request customers of the market to park their vehicles at the designated spots chosen by the MCG. We want the experience in Gurugram to be better than the project being implemented to make Delhi’s Chandni Chowk pedestrian-only zone,” said Singh.The MCG selected a 650-metre stretch of the market, between Jama Masjid and Head Post office — the market’s main street — for the trial. Prior to Saturday evening’s decision, 18 entry and exit points to the market were barricaded while the entire lane was slotted to remain vehicle-free.The MCG had scheduled to host a list of cultural events at the market, however, following the shopkeepers’ protest it was called off. The MCG, however, was able to set up dedicated street vending zones on lanes running parallel to the 650m stretch, installing benches, streetlights, and developing green belts as part of the trial.In addition, the MCG’s micro-pedestrian-friendly trial at a government school near the market remained unaffected, and the civic body’s cultural events scheduled at this location also took place without any hindrance.Following the meeting with the MCG commissioner, shopkeepers’ association leaders said that they were content with the changes made by the civic body to the trial, as per their requests.“It was vital that the supply goods to the market were allowed till noon. Without goods, Sadar Bazar, will no longer remain a market. Further, we also appreciate that the MCG allowed entry of customers on two-wheelers to the market, as this would have affected business in a major way,” said Rajiv Sharma, a member of the Sadar Bazar wholesaler association, who attended the meeting with the MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sadar-bazar-trial-mcg-forced-to-change-rules-after-protest-by-shopkeepers-101616263615712.html

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday had announced that Delhi will increase the number of shots given daily from the exiting 30 to 40 thousand to 125,000. This will be done by increasing the number of sites at each hospital, starting the drive at all dispensaries in the city, and increasing the time slot to 12-hours instead of the current eight hours.On Saturday, 46,769 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were administered in the city, which is the highest so far since the drive began in mid-January. So far, nearly 287,000 people over the age of 60 have been administered their first dose and 47,410 people over the age of 45 with comorbidities, according to data shared by the government. All the Delhi government hospitals have been asked to open at least six vaccination sites from Monday onwards. At the biggest Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital, there were already five sites running on the first floor of the out-patient block. Another site will likely be added on the same floor.The hospital is currently looking at staff requirement for the two-shifts needed to run the centres from 9am to 9pm. “We are currently looking at allotting staff for the extended number of centres and extended timings. The district officials have also assured us that they will divert some staff for the same,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.At the newly inaugurated hospital in Burari, which treats only Covid-19 patients currently, there are five centres running at present. “Another centre will be added on Monday. We have already made the roster for all the six centres to remain open for twelve hours. As the number of Covid-19 cases is low at the moment – we are seeing only ten to fifteen admissions at a time and we have staff to spare for the vaccination centres. If the number of cases goes up, we will have to ask the government for more staff,” said a doctor from the hospital.The Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which is the biggest hospital in the trans-Yamuna region, is facing a shortage of staff. The hospital has been grappling with a staff crunch ever since other non-Covid services resumed . Officials said the hospital hardly has staff to spare for the new centres. There are three vaccination centres at the hospital at the moment.“All our staff is already engaged in non-Covid work; we have asked the district officials to provide more vaccinators but have been told that they cannot spare any either,” said a doctor from the hospital.A district official said, “We are planning to rope in more vaccinators and train them. Usually, hospitals do not have a shortage of nurses who can administer vaccines, but if they do, then we can provide them the same.”Sparing vaccinators from districts might also be difficult, with all 260 Delhi-government-run dispensaries scheduled to open up vaccination centres from Monday onwards. Currently, there are about 40 dispensaries that give the Covid-19 shot.The district officials are currently assessing the space available at the centres for carrying out the vaccination drive. “Almost all the dispensaries have cold chain arrangements because they carry out routine immunisation. However, we are assessing the space available and looking at erecting temporary structures to create the three room space if need be,” said district official.Over the weekend, the districts will also map out the closest hospitals and ambulance presence in case of an adverse event following immunisation (AEFI). “We are looking at which hospitals are the nearest to every dispensary so that a patient can be taken there if there is an adverse event. Plus, we are also looking at where the nearest ambulance is stationed; each dispensary cannot have one ambulance. There are ambulances available with the SDMs that can be utilised. We will also share an advance list with CATS (Centralised Accident and Trauma Services) to check where their nearest ambulance will be stationed,” said a second district official.A third district official said, “All hospital – whether government or private – have been told that they cannot refuse anyone who has had an adverse reaction after taking the vaccine.”can be utilised.

In a written directive issued to schools, the education department said that the exams would be conducted through the AVSAR app in a 12-hour window. While officials from the department said that they had updated the testing mechanism following snags that cropped up last time, school heads raised concerns about potential technical challenges. Last month, structured online assessment tests in government schools were conducted for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began. The tests were conducted through the app and had been clouded by various technical issues, due to which many exams had to be conducted again. Raj Kumar, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School in Islampur, said that while students had faced challenges during the app-based monthly tests last month, they were relatively more familiar with the testing mechanism now. “Last time, there were some issues with the AVSAR app. This time, the final exams will also be conducted through the mobile app. The department is of the view that since some students are yet to return to classrooms, online exams will be better for all. We are expecting some issues, but will ensure that they are addressed in time,” said Kumar. He added that teachers will be available in school to resolve queries like last time. “If at all students and parents require any assistance, they can visit us in school. Since time is limited, they can visit the school in case of snags,” said Kumar.Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school had directed teachers to apprise students about the pattern of examination and hold mock tests ahead of the final exams. “We have asked our teachers to brief students about the online exam. In addition to this, we have asked parents to reach out to us, in case they get stuck. We can only take precautions, since the medium of testing is the same as last time,” said Raghav. Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer, said that since the tests will comprise of questions in the multiple choice pattern, the online mode of exam will be more convenient. She added that the department had resolved the technical issues that cropped up last time and the exams would take place seamlessly this time around. “While there were some issues with the testing mechanism last time, the department was notified about it and the issues were resolved immediately. The issues also arose because students were not familiar with it. However, now, they are familiar with the app interface and should be able to take the test within the stipulated time,” Yadav said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/schools-to-conduct-annual-exams-in-online-mode-101616263613782.html

DTCP officials said the online module is being tested and it will be launched by next month. The decision to create an online portal comes after complaints by buyers that they were not able to get applications for projects offering affordable housing from private developers. The city has around 85 under-construction affordable housing projects and there are around 40,000 residential units in these projects. Affordable housing has witnessed maximum sales in the city in the last year, according to several real estate reports and the government has recently made several changes in the norms to make it an attractive proposition for buyers. “To streamline the booking process of affordable projects and ensure transparency in allotment, it has been decided to launch an online module on DTCP website. The software is under trial and would be launched soon,” said Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner. DTCP officials said a login ID and password will be issued to the developers who will have to upload details of the affordable projects and flats available for booking. A link for each project will be created and the buyers can click on these links and check the availability of flats and apply for a flat, if they are interested. The buyers, who apply online, can also pay booking amount after which a booking number will be issued to the applicant. Those who want to surrender their flats can also do so on the same portal. The draw for allotment of flats will also be held online and till the time allotment does not happen, the booking amount will remain with the department. The department will return the booking amount to unsuccessful applicants in two to three days, said officials. Department officials said they have been receiving complaints from home buyers that they were finding it difficult to procure application forms from private developers, who were allegedly selling them at a premium. The department also said that they have also asked the developers building affordable housing to share details of flats, whose allotment has been cancelled or which have been surrendered by buyers, so that these can be made available for allotment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dtcp-to-launch-online-module-to-help-buyers-of-affordable-housing-projects-101616263612427.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Surrogacy laws for overseas citizens need review||The ministry of home affairs’ March 4 notification has created a dilemma for non-resident Indians hoping to become parents through adoption or surrogacy due to disparity in Indian laws. NRIs have been equated to overseas citizens of India (OCIs) in matters of inter-country adoption. Gazetted Indian Adoption Regulations, 2017 (AR) treat NRIs at par with resident Indians when it comes to adopting an Indian citizen. Despite the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 proposing to allow surrogacy for OCIs, the March 4 notification makes no mention of the same. Our constitution does not allow dual citizenship. Upon voluntary acquisition of the citizenship of another country, a person ceases to be an Indian citizen. A child born to foreign citizens of Indian origin cannot become a citizen of India, as neither parent is an Indian national. A new category of citizenship, OCI, was created in 2005, which gave overseas citizens limited privileges and no rights. The March 4 notification defines an OCI as a foreign national holding the passport of a foreign country and who is not a citizen of India.Both the constitution and Citizenship Act (CA), categorically prohibit dual citizenship. CA specifically prohibits OCIs from having political and other rights. They have, however, been granted multiple entry life-long visa facility for visiting India for any purpose at any time. They are also exempted from registering with the Foreigners’ Registration Office or police authorities, for any length of stay in India and are entitled to benefits notified under CA by the Centre from time to time.The 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court in Shafin Jahan Vs Asokan recognises the right to choose one’s life partner as an important facet of the right to life holding that social approval of intimate personal decisions should not be the basis for recognising them. A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy held that a promise of a right of privacy is embedded in Article 21 of the Constitution. In Navtej Johar, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised consensual homosexual relationships was read down and declared unconstitutional. The Supreme Court liberalised equality and equal protection of laws.The AR permit any prospective adoptive parents, irrespective of marital status to adopt a child from India, except that a single male shall not adopt a girl child. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJA) defines an NRI as an Indian passport holder residing abroad for more than a year. The AR equates an NRI with a resident Indian for adoption of Indian children. The March 4 notification grants parity to an OCI with an NRI in matters of inter-country adoptions. Equality prevails for achieving parenthood. However, the ministry of health and family welfare debars single persons or unmarried couples from commissioning surrogacy in India. Under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020, surrogacy is proposed to be confined to only Indian married couples and commercial surrogacy has been declared illegal. All unmarried or single persons and foreigners, except OCIs, have been declared ineligible for surrogacy. There is no object for this classification with the purpose to be achieved. Married and un-married persons cannot be treated as a class apart, particularly when inter-country or in-country adoptions are permitted under the AR. There is no parity provided in the March 4 Notification to OCIs with NRIs in matter of surrogacy. Why the discrimination? It may be argued that this unreasonable classification in surrogacy is violative of mandate of the constitution, discriminating against people on grounds of marital status, nationality and rights of procreation as they have no nexus with the object sought to be achieved. It directly curtails and interferes with ‘the right of reproductive autonomy, which is a facet of the ‘right of privacy’ under Article 21 of the constitution advocating the right to life. People, whether citizens, NRIs or OCIs cannot be treated differently in matters of parenthood whether to be achieved through surrogacy or adoption. No reason, justification, logic or explanation is forthcoming as to why single persons, unmarried couples or foreigners have been debarred and excluded from commissioning surrogacy in India when such people are allowed inter-country adoptions under the AR. There cannot be different parameters for the same ultimate purpose of achieving parenthood, be it through surrogacy or by adoption. None of the grounds made out justify or validate this arbitrary exclusion and unfounded ineligibility of OCIs, who do not find mention in the March 4 notification. Moreover, the AR duly notified by the government of India and made under the JJA clearly stipulates the policy of permitting single parents irrespective of nationality or marital status to adopt a child of any gender with the only exception that a single male shall not be eligible to adopt a girl child.The rational approach would be to control and coordinate by a selective screening process of checks and balances. A similar parallel exists in matters of adoptions. Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA), a statutory body under the Juvenile Justice Act, functions smoothly to regulate all adoption matters. A regulated, defined and effective procedural mechanism rules out all possible unapproved adoptions. Law steps in to check but not to bar eligible persons from adopting children. Hence, a similar balanced approach in matters of surrogacy requires serious introspection. Surrogacy, in vogue for over a decade, cannot be stamped out of existence by law. Its practice ought to be regulated and coordinated without offending equality of law and equal protection of laws to all people and not only citizens in a democratic society.The author, a practicing lawyer, has to his credit nine books pertaining to issues of private international law.

The arrested persons were running their nexus in connivance with some private exam centres, the police said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said that on March 4, the Naraina police raided a private examination centre and arrested a candidate, identified as Rohit, after receiving information about illegal practices at the centre during the examination for the post of Forest Guard. A cellphone was recovered from Rohit, a Sonepat resident, and he was found using it to solve his online exam paper, said DCP Goel.The police said that after interrogating Rohit, they also retrieved and analysed data from the seized phone. It helped them identify and arrest the three key players of the nexus from Delhi and Haryana. They were identified as Vaishali, the kingpin of the racket, her brother Love Kumar and their associate Himanshu.During the interrogation, DCP Goel said, it was revealed that Vishali is the mastermind and she along with her partner, Anil Sharma, brother Love Kumarm and other associates ran the racket dealing in online examinations for various government jobs. They operated in Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and targeted job aspirants living in rural areas.“We recovered two fake police uniforms. Vaishali impersonated a senior IPS officer and her two associates posed as Delhi Police personnel to trick their targets believe that they were well connected. They promised them of clearing their exams through illegal means and charged between R15 and R25 lakh for each candidate,” said Goel.According to the DCP, the arrested persons usually managed employees at the private examination centres to provide mobile phone to their candidate sitting in the exam. They also used to send their dummy candidate inside the examination centre with mobile phone.“The dummy candidate used to leak the examination through mobile phone to the Vaishali through high tech applications. She operated from a different location along with solvers, who are experts in different subjects. The solvers solved the paper within few minutes and it was circulated to the managed examination centres in various north Indian states. The answer-key reached the candidates through their managed employees at the exam centre,” added DCP Goel.The police are now looking for other people involved in the racket.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-arrested-for-impersonation-running-exam-racket-101616263537315.html
20-03-2021||Other||Delhi govt launches mentoring programme for girls in its schools||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday launched a mentoring programme for girls studying in its schools in order to encourage them to participate in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and support them to clear entrance exams for higher education related to these subjects.In a statement released on Saturday, the Delhi government said under the ‘Education Mentoring Programme’ as many as 200 students from state-run Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University of Women will mentor 1,000 girls enrolled in government schools. The mentor students will be from courses like BTech, MTech, PhD and MBA. Later the programme will cover 10,000 to 15,000 school girls.Addressing the gathering at the launch of the programme, education minister Manish Sisodia said, “Our world is becoming a knowledge economy, with dedicated research and innovation quickly becoming key to progress. Although our nation is seeing some major innovations in every field of work, these innovations are mostly led by men. The participation of women is abysmal when it comes to innovation, especially in the field of STEM. According to a study I recently came across, women form only 33% of the total workforce in research and innovation in STEM in South Asia.”“With the Education Mentoring Programme, Delhi Government wants to empower students of Delhi in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. We want our students, especially our girls, to receive the right guidance, which will help them build sustainable innovations. It is our vision that our girls equally dominate the STEM sector,” he added.Stressing upon lower enrolment of girls in Science in higher education, Sisodia asked the mentor students to fill in the gap.“If I have to speak about the enrolment rate of pre-primary and primary schools, approximately 21 lakh children are enrolled every year. However, only 10,000 girls take up STEM studies in higher education. Our students and teachers are continuously endeavoring to work hard in this field but we need to fill in this gap. Therefore, your participation and mentoring will play a crucial role,” he said.Delhi government schools principals welcomed the initiative. AK Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said, “The initiative will help our female students to know about the career opportunities available for them and the mentors will guide them to prepare for different entrance exams. Many of our students are from economically weaker families and can’t afford expensive coaching. All the mentor students are girls and it will help them connect with our students well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-launches-mentoring-programme-for-girls-in-its-schools-101616263477318.html

He said the state government implemented extensive reforms to develop and promote pilgrim spots, which will not only give the state a worldwide recognition, but also play a vital role in generating numerous employment opportunities for the locals. He was speaking while laying the foundation stone of tourism projects worth over ₹180 crore for 373 assembly constituencies of the state in Gorakhpur. “Tourism greatly supplements an economy and creates jobs at the local level. A number of countries are totally tourism-driven economies. Our state government is also proactively promoting the tourism sector with this objective,” Yogi Adityanath said. Rural, religious and heritage spots proposed by the legislator will be developed and beautified under the “Chief Minister Tourism Promotion Scheme” in every assembly constituency, the state government said in a statement. In consonance with a central road map to boost domestic tourism, UP has witnessed the development of maximum religious tourism hubs, which prominently comprise the Ramayan circuit, Buddhist circuit, Krishna circuit, Sufi circuit, Shaktipeeth circuit, Adhyatmik circuit and the Jain circuit. These were yielding results and attracting foreign, as well as domestic tourists, besides creating employment opportunities for the local youth and giving a boost to the business of regional hotels, markets and restaurants, the statement said. Referring to the Kumbh Mela-2019, Yogi Adityanath said that the government succeeded in giving the mega-event a global recognition with the participation of 24 crore devotees. Prayagraj attracted a large footfall as people flocked to be a part of the auspicious event, which also enhanced the economy of the local shopkeepers up to 15 times more than the usual, he added. The chief minister also mentioned Prime Minister Modi’s dream project Kashi Vishwanath Corridor in Varanasi. He said Kashi would become the centre of the biggest cultural events in the world through the Vishwanath Temple Corridor under the guidance of PM Modi. Yogi said that during the inauguration of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in 1916, Mahatma Gandhi was dismayed by the narrow streets and the lack of cleanliness in Kashi. “Bapu had made the comment 100 years ago, but today under the guidance of PM Modi, the fame of Kashi is being established internationally,” the chief minister said. He said flower petals that used to be considered a waste after being offered to the deities were now giving employment opportunities to women belonging to self-help groups in villages of Chandauli as they were making perfumes, incense and incense sticks from the petals to earn a living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-lays-foundation-of-rs-180-cr-tourism-projects-101616262875851.html

The draft is titled “Regulation of Public Religious Structures (on public places)”. It was submitted on Friday. Justice AN Mittal is a former judge of the Allahabad high court. According to the state law department, the government will soon come up with a law on the basis of this report. Justice Mittal prepared this draft after studying similar laws of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. In his representation to the chief minister, Justice Mittal pointed out the increasing practice of grabbing public land by constructing temples, mosques and other religious structures. These structures on public land are initially small and, thereafter, they get bigger.“I have recommended three- categories in my 135-page report. The first category will cover religious structures constructed on public land before September 27, 2009,” said Justice Mittal.“The second category will cover religious structures constructed from September 27, 2009 till the framing of law (to check religious structures on public land). The third category will cover religious structures constructed after the framing of the law,” he added. “I have recommended demolition, relocation and reduction in the size of religious structures constructed on public places. A three-year jail term and fine have also been recommended on violation of the law,” he said. In 2009, the Supreme Court had ordered the state government to frame a policy for removing religious structures from public places. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL), the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on June 3, 2016 had ordered the state government to remove all religious structures from public places. As this PIL is still pending, the high court on March 10 had ordered the state government to remove all religious structures from public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/religious-structures-on-public-places-up-law-panel-recommends-3-year-jail-term-fine-101616261855593.html

The table preparation is known as “HaftŠeen” has Serkeh (vinegar), Sekkeh (coins), Sabzeh (vegetation), Seeb (apple), Suzaan (needle), Seer (garlic), Sonbol (hyacinth), Sauat (clock), Samanu (sweet wheat germ pudding), Senjed (oleaster), Somaaq (sumac) used to decorate the Meez E Murad for Jamshedi Navroze.The Zoroastrian Youth Association usually plans a social gathering at the fire temples in the city every year, but this year due to Covid, Navroze celebrations are confined to be celebrated within their homes.“We have advised many people to avoid visiting the fire temple to offer prayers and have cancelled all the social events that are usually planned. We have food, dance and socialising for all the Parsis in the city, but this year, it will not be so,” said Kaipashin Raimalwalla, priest at Sir JJ Agiary, Dastur Meher Road, Camp.The SR Patel Agiary also wears a deserted look with only the priest in the fire temples. “This year the situation is different and this second wave of Covid has doubled the fears. Instead of going out for dinners as most of the people do for New Year’s, they are ordering from various Parsi restaurants,” said Farah Arzaan Khambata.It is a busy day for Darius Dorabjee, with almost 100 orders of the traditional Parsi meals to be sent out. “The families have ordered early, enough for one or two families to eat together for Navroze. The traditional dishes include patrani macchi, salli mughi, mutton pulav, dal, and a sweet, lagan nu custard. All these dishes are auspicious especially the fish, even the sweet is in the shape of a fish, which is looked upon as a good omen,” said Darius.Mabrin Nanavati from Food Gallery is still taking orders, “Almost 150 families have ordered complete meals as they prefer to stay indoors instead of visiting the restaurants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navroz-celebrations-confined-to-homes-101616259936632.html

The timely measures adopted by the country became an example for the entire world, he said.Schemes were launched across the country to make the youth self-reliant, which increased the confidence of the public and gave a boost to the economy, he added.Mishra said India is not only manufacturing vaccines against Covid-19 but has also taken the initiative to supply them to other countries.Till date, he said, India has exported more than 16 million doses of vaccine to 20 countries."India successfully vaccinated 7 million citizens within 24 days. It took the United States 26 days and Britain 46 to achieve this goal," he added.During the programme, the governor also honoured Bollywood actor Sonu Sood with the Justice Narendra Singh Memorial International Peace Award for his philanthropic services during the pandemic.Sood helped scores of migrant workers reach home to different parts of the country by arranging buses and flights for them during the nationwide lockdown imposed early last year to contain the spread of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/india-suffered-least-damage-due-to-effective-management-of-covid-rajasthan-guv-101616259804644.html

20-03-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt hands compulsory retirement to ACP who sought sexual favours||Rajasthan government has handed compulsory retirement to ACP Kailash Chand Bohra who was arrested by the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) for seeking sexual favours from a rape victim. Earlier, state minister Shanti Dhariwal, in the assembly session, asserted that the state government will terminate the accused ACP but the Gehlot government on Saturday handed over compulsory retirement by an order of Principal Secretary, Home, Abhay Kumar.RPS officer, Kailash Bohra has rendered 24 years and 7 months of service in the government. Regarding the case, DG, ACB, BL Soni said, “On March 6, a 30-year-old woman filed a complaint against Bohra in the ACB stating that she had lodged three cases, including rape and cheating, against a man and others at the Jawahar Circle police station. The ACP was investigating these cases”.Two weeks ago, the accused Rajasthan Police Service officer demanded a bribe to take action against the accused and when she refused, saying that she doesn’t have money, the officer demanded sexual favours.“The victim alleged that the investigating officer, Kailash Bohra, first demanded a bribe from her to take action in all the three cases. When she could not give the money, he started calling her to the office repeatedly in the name of the investigation. Eventually, he started harassing and demanding sexual favours as a bribe. The woman also alleged that Bohra pressured her to meet him even after office hours,” added Soni.In order to trap the ACP, the anti-graft body had applied chemical on the clothes of the victim, which is generally applied on currency notes to verify any undue favour taken by a government servant.Additional director general (ADG), ACB, Dinesh MN, said along with a corruption case, a case has been registered under section 376C (government official taking advantage of his official position to seduce any female at a workplace), 354 (outraging modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-hands-compulsory-retirement-to-acp-who-sought-sexual-favours-101616259876294.html
20-03-2021||Other||Second Covid wave could be severe, warn experts||PUNE As Pune continues to report as many new Covid cases as it did during the first wave, city experts say that the ongoing wave could be more severe than the first one. City experts have opined that with no restrictions in place, those who were protected during the first wave are now exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid infection. State officials have also said that the new variant which is possibly milder is also more infectious as there is rapid spread.Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “It could be harsher given that we are reporting more cases than the first wave peak. People should understand this only by adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour that the cases could be curbed.”“As of now, there is evidence that the spread could be blamed on the variant of the virus. With the vaccine in place, people have let down their guard. The vaccine does not treat the infection as of now it is only proven that the spread and also that the severity could be reduced post-vaccination. Some people who have got the first dose can be seen completely ignoring the safety norms which is not right,” he said.While during November and December when the number of cases was coming down the Pune administration hoped that the ‘second wave’ would be milder owing to the ‘herd immunity factor’ Dr Gangakhedkar said, “People have been using the herd immunity factor as per their convenience. Now we see variants so there the herd immunity is not going to protect you. People need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour for at least a year.”Dr Shashank Joshi, state Covid task force member, said, “We have found at least 400 variants in the country we do not know which is from where. They could be foreign or even developed domestically. With the rise in cases, all we could conclude is that the spread of the infection is faster, but the death rate has gone down and so this variant is leading to more cases but is not as deadly as the previous ones.Dr Ghose Aurnab, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), who was part of the team which did the first and only serological survey in the city, said, “We took the samples for the serosurvey during the lockdown period and so there was not much intermingling of people which restricted the spread of the virus. During the survey, we did find high levels of antibodies in the samples we tested. The ongoing rise could be partly reinfections or mutations, however, there is no proof of it. But it largely appears that in the current wave those who remained safe or protected during the first wave are now being affected.”“The reason is that we see that most cases are now coming from areas which were earlier reporting the least number of cases. There is a large population of untouched people and the virus will always find a place to intrude into places that were left out. Also, now that people have completely left off their guard we are seeing an exponential rise in the number of cases,” he said.Dr Ghose also said that currently the city is already at par with the September peak and if we continue to go higher the second wave will be worse or if we report lower than we are already at par with the first wave. However, Dr Joshi said it would be too premature to claim if this wave is harsher or not and that a conclusion could be drawn only after 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/second-covid-wave-could-be-severe-warn-experts-101616258255153.html

Also, after selective testing 560 of them have tested positive at 67 places and now have been isolated.Super-spreaders are the people who have a much higher rate of social interaction than the common people such as shopkeepers, grocery store owners, social workers, traders and politicians.“We could not test all of them because it takes time and costs money. We tested only those who required to be tested after the screening as they had some minor symptom and had proximity to hotspots. We will continue the drive,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune ZP.On March 19, Pune rural reported 902 new cases and two deaths, according to the state health department.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), meanwhile, has not started such a drive yet.

The policeman has been hospitalised," said party spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi.The policeman had sustained a minor injury on his forehead and a video of Scindia putting a handkerchief on the wound went viral on social media.Superintendent of Police (North) Vijay Khatri denied that the policeman was hit by one of the vehicles in Scindia's entourage."He fell after feeling dizzy. Scindia helped him," the SP said.Meanwhile, the Congress, in protest against the way their government fell last year, observed 'Loktantra Samman Diwas' and held a 'Tiranga Yatra' across the state, said party spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta.Gupta said all Covid-19 norms were adhered to during the protest.State BJP media in charge Lokendra Parasar, however, tweeted that Saturday was "khushali diwas" (happiness day).Later, Scindia and Chouhan, along with several of the latter's cabinet colleagues, had lunch, BJP functionaries said.Scindia mocked the Congress' 'Loktantra Samman Diwas' and said it was the latter that had killed democracy in the state during its 15-month rule.The day started off with Nath releasing a video message from Delhi claiming he was aware of the "opposition's (BJP at the time) dealings" but he preferred to respect democracy and save the Constitution rather than enter into any deal to form a "purchased government".He said the opposition, after his resignation on March 20 last year, formed a government through a deal and "killed the spirit of the Constitution".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/scindia-helps-injured-mp-cop-video-goes-viral-on-social-media-101616254320977.html

We are ready with excess bed facilities if the need arises,” said Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer, PCMC.Currently, Pimpri-Chinchwad is conducting over 5,000 tests every day and administration has also increased contact tracing. “We have increased contact tracing and at least 1,000 people are being tested daily,” added Salve.As most of the patients having mild symptoms, 70 per cent of Covid positive people are under home isolation.“People who asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are opting for home isolation. The number of serious patients is fewer,” he said.As of March 21, there are 10,229 positive patients in the twin cities, out of which 7,671 are home quarantined while 2,558 patients are undergoing treatment at hospitals.The administration is keeping a strict watch on the people who are under home isolation and PCMC have kept their officials in the respective area to keep track of their movement.“Before allowing patients to isolate themselves at home, we are making sure patients understand what protocols they need to follow. Even if symptoms are mild we are not allowing them to come out of their homes,” said, Dr Laxman Gophane, assistant health medical officer, PCMC.Currently, most cases in PCMC are seen between the age group of 22-39. “In this age group immunity level is higher as compared to other age groups. They are recovering fast, but at the same time youth should restrict unnecessary movements across the city which is one of the reasons for the increase in cases,” added Gophane.PCMC trackerNo of testing per day: 5000+Major containment zone: 182Micro containment zone: 845Covid cases and deathsDate; Covid positive; deathsMarch 20 ;1,431;11March 19; 1,326; 6March 18; 1,296; 9March 17; 1,248; 5March 16; 894; 5March 15; 728; 4March 14; 845; 5||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pimprichinchwad-reports-over-1-000-cases-for-four-days-in-a-row-101616254474906.html

The chief minister’s statement drew much flak from experts and the Opposition who cited the recent surge in Covid-19 infections.“I invite all devotees across the world to come to Haridwar and take a holy dip in the Ganga during Mahakumbh. Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19 as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus,” Rawat said.During his visit to Haridwar, the chief minister inspected the ongoing works for Mahakumbh and inaugurated many completed projects worth ₹120 crore.“Prior to my taking charge (as CM), there were clouds of uncertainty hovering over Mahakumbh. But now they have been cleared. The government is fully focused on organising the Mahakumbh in a grand way,” Rawat told the media after performing rituals at the sanctum sanctorum of Brahmakund in Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghat along with BJP state president Madan Kaushik and state assembly speaker Premchand Agarwal.“We have to take a risk as Mahakumbh is not a normal annual fair but one which is held after every 12 years. Every devotee wants to take the sacred Ganga dip and take back Gangajal home. So how can we stop or restrict them from coming here? But the Covid-19 guidelines of the Centre will be adhered to,” he said.The chief minister said, “Religious sentiments need to be given priority as faith is stronger than fear as was seen during the Shahi Snaan on Mahashivaratri on March 11. About 3.4 million people arrived in Haridwar for that holy bath.”During his visit to Haridwar, Rawat met seers of Bairagi Akhada in the mela area and sought their blessings.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who was present with Rawat, said, “In times of the pandemic, Mahakumbh would be the biggest public congregation in the world while following the Covid-19 guidelines.”After taking charge as the CM, Rawat had overturned several decisions taken by previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, including mandatory RT-PCR negative test report by the devotees coming to Haridwar and no plying of extra buses or running of special trains to Haridwar during Shahi Snaans to limit the crowd amid the pandemic.The new CM had lifted the restrictions, saying, “The mega event is no ordinary one and devotees will be welcomed without any unnecessary restrictions in the name of Covid-19.”Experts and the Opposition criticised the CM for his move to remove restrictions amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in many states that has raised fears of a second wave.“With the Covid-19 cases again increasing in the country, the government’s approach should be “health first” but that doesn’t seem to be the case, which is worrisome,” said PS Chauhan, a Haridwar-based senior academic who has been keeping an eye on the Mahakumbh event. “The easing of restrictions would be very dangerous for the health safety of our state,” he said.Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “The CM is saying that all are welcome to the Mahakumbh and nobody will stop them with restrictions. We are not against the devotees coming but is the government prepared to handle a congregation of millions of people in one city? The answer is no. And this is a huge risk for the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/devotees-faith-will-overcome-fear-of-covid-19-in-mahakumbh-cm-rawat-101616253395877.html

However, ten per cent wastage during such a large scale immunisation drive is considered acceptable, said, officials.Currently, the district has limited Covaxin doses which are used for first doses.As of Friday, the district has received 5.82 lakh doses of Covishield out of which 3.82 lakh have been administered and 1.67 lakh are in stock. Over 33,000 doses have been wasted. With regards to Covaxin, the district received 1.12 lakh vaccines, out of which 66,000 have been administered, 39,000 are pending and 6,044 have been wasted. The wastage percentage for both vaccines is almost the same. With the city reporting the highest wastage percentage in proportion to the highest consumption too.Dr Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said, “The state average of vaccine wastage is about 5.2 per cent. Multiple factors can contribute to wastage. However, in any large scale immunisation drive about ten per cent vaccine wastage acceptable.”“Maharashtra is now vaccinating the highest number of beneficiaries that any state. Also, people need to remember that both the approved vaccines are only proven to reduce the severity and not stop the spread per se. Therefore Covid-appropriate behaviour is the right solution,” he said.While Covishield is currently being used only as a second dose for those covered under phase one, health care workers and frontline workers, Covaxin is now being prioritised as the first dose vaccine. However, with only 39,000 doses pending, the dose is enough for only two days as over 23,000 beneficiaries are taking the vaccine for the first time daily. The district aims to vaccinate about one lakh people daily however the shortage of vaccine looms large.Dr Patil said, “For us, both the vaccines are the same. We have demanded over 33 lakh vaccines from the Centre for the state. Besides, we have asked various district authorities to ensure that they have enough doses for at least five days and if Covaxin is over they have been instructed to restart using Covishield as the first dose. Meanwhile, we are expecting another allotment by Monday or Tuesday (March 22 and 23).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-district-s-vaccine-wastage-higher-than-state-average-101616253274775.html

If he doesn't then CM must remove him," the former chief minister said.Fadnavis’ remarks came shortly after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh accused Deshmukh of being involved in extortion through Vaze. Singh made the allegations in a letter sent to Thackeray."Home minister Anil Deshmukh expressed to Sachin Vaze that he had a target to accumulate ₹100 crore a month," Singh’s letter tweeted by news agency ANI reads. According to the letter, Singh informed Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar about the home minister’s actions.“Sachin Vaze who was heading the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police was called by Anil Deshmukh to his official residence in the last few months and repeatedly instructed to assist the collection of funds for the home minister,” the letter reads.“For achieving the target, home minister told Vaze that there were about 1750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of ₹2-3 lakhs were collected from each of them, a monthly collection of ₹40-50 crore was achievable,” Singh told the CM in the letter.The home minister, however, has refuted the allegations and said that Singh made the claims as his involvement in Ambani bomb scare case as well as in the case of Mansukh Hiran's death was getting clearer. “There are possibilities of him getting exposed, the then police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me to save himself from the action," Deshmukh said in a series of tweets.Fadvnavis, meanwhile, said that apart from Deshmukh’s resignation, there must be an impartial probe into the matter by central agencies or a court-monitored probe."This is more explosive than the gelatin sticks which were recovered. The charges made by Param Bir Singh are serious. Singh has also attached some chats as evidence," he said."Letter also states that CM was intimated about this earlier so why didn't he act on it?" Fadnavis asked.The Ambani security threat cases as well as Hiran’s death case are currently being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-should-resign-or-cm-should-sack-him-fadnavis-on-claims-made-by-param-bir-singh-101616252315642.html

The Sena leader’s remark came after the Union ministry of home affairs transferred the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).Raut accused the Centre of finding opportunities to put the state government in trouble, but ruled out any setback because of the transfer. “Let NIA carry out their investigation. In reality, NIA should not have rushed here (in Maharashtra). The Mumbai Police and Maharashtra ATS are capable to investigate such cases or any case for that matter,” he said.“But there is a different government at the Centre and they have a different stand. They keep looking for opportunities to put Maharashtra government in trouble, but no matter which agency comes and however they investigate it does not affect the government. Let them bring CIA and KGB as well to investigate,” the Sena leader added.The death of Hiran, the man who claimed ownership of the explosives-laden SUV found outside Mukesh Ambani’s home, was being probed by the ATS after it took it over from the Mumbai Police and registered a murder case against unknown persons. Earlier in the day, the case was handed over to the NIA which is also investigating the Ambani security threat case.The investigation was transferred under section 8 of the NIA Act, which states that any connecting offence related to a scheduled offence already under investigation can also be taken over by it. The NIA will re-register the Mumbai police FIR in the alleged murder case and take over the case file as well as Hiran’s autopsy report.After the explosives-laden vehicle was found outside Ambani’s Antilia residence in Mumbai on February 25, Hiran was found dead in a creek on March 5.NIA, the central agency probing the case, has arrested Mumbai's assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze. He was accused by Hiran's wife of being involved in her husband's suspicious death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bring-cia-and-kgb-too-shiv-sena-on-transfer-of-mansukh-hiran-death-probe-to-nia-101616251257201.html

This category of persons needs to be vaccinated without any documentary proof so that herd immunity can be developed amongst them.”According to officials at Yerawada Mental Hospital, there are many as 375 inmates who don’t have any documentary proof as they were admitted by their parents or relatives long ago. The hospital authorities have written to the state immunisation department to bring them under the vaccination drive at the earliest and have extended all the necessary assistance in the said context.Shailesh Korde, a homeless who resides on the footpath in Juna Bazar, said “ I don’t know anything about vaccination and who is giving the medicine. I am sure that we won’t be getting the vaccination.”Mukta Pardeshi, a social worker, said, “Such vulnerable people must be vaccinated as it is their fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.”The state government has sought guidelines from the Centre regarding vaccination for the deprived section.Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer, said, “We have asked the Centre about guidelines for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/homeless-poor-are-left-behind-in-covid-vaccination-drive-due-to-lack-of-identity-proof-101616249315981.html

Shadab said he was happy to get his pet back after seven months.In November 2020, Shadab Khan claimed to have lost his dog Coco in August that year and accused the ABVP leader of stealing it. He told police that he had seen his dog at Shivhare’s home. A day later, Shivhare reached the police station with papers and claimed that the dog belonged to him and that his name was Tiger. Shivhare claimed that he had purchased the dog from Itarsi. As both were adamant on their claims and the dog was equally friendly to both, the then police station in-charge Hemant Shrivastava discussed the matter with the SP and decided to get the dog’s DNA test done, said the police.Till the report of the test arrived, Shivhare was allowed to keep the dog. One police team was sent to Pachmarhi and the second to Itarsi to collect the sample for the dog’s DNA test to establish its origin. Later, the samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad.Last week, the police received the report, confirming that the dog’s parentage was from Pachmarhi and therefore it was returned to Shadab.Hoshangabad dehat police station in-charge Anoop Singh said, “We are investigating to find out who stole the dog. We will interrogate the person from Itarsi, who gave the dog to Kratik Shivhare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/it-took-a-dna-test-to-end-the-dispute-over-dog-s-ownership-in-mp-101616230953316.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||DU’s first online fest rocked the campus!||Who says digital campus is devoid of fun?Delhi University’s varsities haven’t allowed the pandemic to play the role of a party pooper this year, by moving their college fests and parties to the online space. The Janki Devi Memorial College became the first DU college to recently host their college fest called Symphony 2021 completely online!Sharing how the authorities decided to have an online fest, Professor Smita Mishra, Department of History says, “The staff advisors consulted the Students’ Union and got the feedback from students of the college and across DU, that though academics was progressing at a fair clip online, the cultural scene was almost dead and there was an emotional out cry for an online festival! So the authorities resolved to give the students a fun time by hosting an online fest.”A month long virtual fest is a first that’s ever happened in DU! Staff Advisor Professor Saumya Gupta shares the motivating factor behind having an online fest. “Online fest was essential keeping in mind the Covid protocol and the safety of students. We didn’t want to deprive the students of the excitement and creativity that is the hallmark of DU festival season. So we took on the challenge to visualise the events virtually, and decided to have a month long cultural festival!” she claims.It’s normal to wonder what was different in an online fest as compared to an offline one? Did the students enjoy? “I think the online fest went better than expected with some differences from conventional offline fests like instead of being spread over three days the fest was spread over a month with one event per day, so there was no question of anyone missing any events for being held simultaneously with others as is the case during offline fests,” informs Mishra adding, “Some events like dance and drama were displays of pre-recorded work. For students it was fun engaging in virtual platforms and a learning experience but they would have enjoyed the conventional off-line fest more ofcourse!”Hailing a digital fest over no fest, Jagriti Bathra, a third year student and member of the college’s student union says, “The whole month of the festival was a roller coaster ride and it was a remarkable experience for all of us. Everyone had imagined college fest to be full of singing, dancing, and gatherings but who would have thought that it could be online as well. We were able to make new connections while at home and celebrate with students across the county! Although it was not like a regular college fest, we had a lot of fun organising it and it was a great learning experience.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-first-online-fest-rocked-the-campus-101616230894420.html

Whether it’s the glitz of bollywood movies that have portrayed Delhi University as a hip and happening place to be, or just the pull of Delhi for being a party capital for youngsters, the curiosity of outstation students to check out the city and their campus is almost palpable! A couple of Delhi University freshers recently visited the campus and had some interesting experiences and observances to share : Itna Vadda Campus?!“The first thing that took me by surprise was how huge North Campus is! I came to check out Delhi and my college – Hansraj- along with my friends. We even rode the Delhi Metro and were stunned to encounter the rickshaw bhaiyas asking us for fifty bucks to cover a distance of just a U-turn. ‘Chahe aap 1km tak jaana chaho, chahe yeh U turn lena chaho, rate toh yehi rahega,’ they told us. We ended up walking 10,000 steps in a day because rickshaw ka scene mehenga hai yaha! Coming from a small town where the village ends in a 10 km radius, Delhi seemed massive,” shares Vinit Mehta, resident of a village near Sirsa, Haryana.Campus ka street food A1 hai ji “Campus aah kar samajh aaya ki aaj tak main jis khaane ko butter chicken samjhti thi woh actually no better than kauaa biryani nikli. Momos, Bun tikkis, Bunta, cheese maggi – yaha sab milta hai! I love the food that the small canteens around the campus have and the rate is so normal. I don’t know how I’ll ever be able to enjoy daal chawal sitting in front of the laptop and attending the online classes back at home again,” shares Devina Kapoor, a resident of Kanpur who recently visited the campus with her foodie girl gang. Palika Bazar is a steal (literally)“Yaha toh har cheez ka rate 5 guna-6 guna price zyaada maangte hai. I wanted to shop for my campus look so I went to Palika Bazaar with my friends. Ek banda tha jo chashme bech raha tha. Pehle he offered us one sun glass for 250 rupees. By the end of our bargaining session we ended up with four sunglasses for 250 rupees. Bargaining ki skills sharpen ho gayi Delhi aa ke! Why do they over quote? Chori ka maal hai kya?” asks a startled Sarthak Mishra, a fresher from Kanpur. CP (Connaught Place) mein single ki aatma tadap gayi “Humare parents bolte hai ki Delhi bada sheher hai, dhyaan se jaao chori naa ho jaye. Koi yeh nahi bolta ki raat main koi bhi single banda CP na jaaye. Yeh CP main saare couples kyun aate hai? I have never been so aware of being single in my life.

20-03-2021||Patna||With ethanol policy in place, no food grains will now be wasted in Bihar: Husain||Bihar’s industry minister, Shahnawaz Hussain, has said no food grains will now be wasted as the Ethanol Production Promotion Policy approved by the state Cabinet on Wednesday allows investors to directly make ethanol from maize, molasses, broken rice, and rotten grains. “This will bring money to farmers and make Bihar ethanol hub of the country,” said Husain as he introduced the policy to prospective investors on Friday.The new policy allows ethanol production from all feedstocks permitted under National Policy on Biofuels, 2018, and subsequently by the National Biofuel Coordination Committee.Ethanol is widely used in alcohol production and now increasingly in motor fuel. Most of this organic chemical in the state is produced by distilleries in the Vaishali district. Officials said the production in these distilleries is 65-75 kilolitre per day.Husain said by 2025, the state proposes to increase production by 50 crore litres. He added that soon Bihar will also come out with a textile policy.Additional chief secretary Brijesh Mehrotra said in last one month, 30 prospective investors have shown interest in establishing ethanol factories and submitted their proposal with the State Investment Board.Mehrotra said that last fiscal, the state produced 40 lakh MT of maize. Similarly, the sugarcane production was 160 lakh MT and that of paddy was 82 lakh MT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/with-ethanol-policy-in-place-no-food-grains-will-now-be-wasted-in-bihar-husain-101616229093247.html
20-03-2021||Patna||Bihar: 1.20 lakh litre liquor seized, 1800 arrested ahead of Holi||A consignment of 1300 cartoons of liquor was seized in Bihar’s Vaishali district on Friday. It included around 12,000 litre of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL), which is witnessing a peak in demand ahead of Holy with revellers looking to stock up.The liquor, seized from two vehicles including a container from Lalganj and Sadar police station area, is estimated to be worth ₹1 crore, said Vaishali SP Maneesh.The first consignment of 5,900 litre of IMFL was recovered near Langri-Pakad village on state highway-74 when training deputy superintendent of police (DSP)-cum-station house officer (SHO) of Lalganj police station, Viplav Kumar, seized a truck bearing registration number UP-21N/6615. The driver and smuggler managed to escape from the spot. Another container bearing registration number MH46-AR/0577, ferrying 5,800 litre IMFL was seized on Hajipur-Mahua state highway-49, leading to arrest of Rajasthan based truck driver Krishna Ram. In the last 78 days, more than 1.20 lakh litre IMFL, spirit and country made liquor have been recovered from across the state, as per Bihar prohibition and excise department. Deputy excise commissioner Krishna Paswan said at least 1,800 persons have been arrested since January this year and following the CM’s directive to crackdown on bootleggers. According to police officials, IMFL is mainly being smuggled from neighbouring states of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and even from Haryana and Punjab, following its high demand across the state. Officials said country-made liquor was also being smuggled to rural areas with ease. “As Holi celebrations are approaching, the rate of IMFL is set to spike. A bottle of whiskey is set to sell at ₹1200, half at ₹600, quarter at ₹300 and one carton at ₹9,000. The supply in villages is no less than in the cities, in terms of safety and easy ferrying,” said an official. “In this festive season, anyone who smuggles liquor anywhere in Bihar will earn the highest in a month as its demand is skyrocketing,” said a person associated with the liquor mafia, on condition of anonymity. Several people have died after consuming country made liquor in Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Kaimur and Rohtas in recent times despite the prohibition. All officials are keeping a strict watch and raiding possible illegal outlets involved in manufacturing and supply of liquor. IG (prohibition) Amrit Raj said surveillance at border check posts has been stepped up to check entry of vehicles carrying liquor. In addition intelligence is being gathered on the illegal trade. Joint teams of the excise department and the police were engaged in preventing liquor smuggling, Raj added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-1-20-lakh-litre-liquor-seized-1800-arrested-ahead-of-holi-101616228493137.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||International Day of Happiness: Finding joy in others’ smiles||“I realised that making them happy made me happier. It sounds selfish but it’s true,” says Vibha Tomar, a Delhi-based veterinary student, who feeds stray dogs in Delhi, a habit she picked up during the lockdown. On International day of Happiness today, youngsters in the Capital say the pandemic made them realise true happiness lies in helping others. “It started with 50 dogs, and I ended up feeding 350 dogs on a daily basis. During the lockdown all the people were safe at their homes but the strays had nowhere to go, and depended on leftover food given by people outside the markets, restaurants, hotels, schools, colleges and offices. I made posters which said that strays do not transmit Covid-19 virus and they needed our help. I was so happy because those posters went viral on social media and were even shared by some Bollywood actors which helped circulate my message,” Tomar says, adding, “I started an initiative of tying reflective collars to stray dogs to avoid major accidents and have collared more than 1000 strays till now. I also made tyre beds for them, and I am so happy that many people have come forward to help strays.”While Tomar cares for strays, in another part of the city, 17-year-old twins, Asheer and Asees Kandhari, run a Covid-19 helpline with an intention to assist people in distress. “In the early days of the lockdown, we realised many underprivileged people, who had been laid off, were unable to provide for themselves. So we started the initiative to provide food and medicines to those in need,” says Asheer. They also partnered with food outlets, and took help from volunteers to distribute the resources. “The police also helped us out and we had many students from Delhi University who helped us with the delivery of the necessities to villages in the city,” says Asees, adding, “The helpline is still functional but now instead of food, people call in to ask help with sourcing covid supplies such as oxygen cylinders, so we are doing that at the moment.”The pandemic year did bring with it a sense of despondence but youngsters in the city tried to help others battle negativity with love and support. “I saw so many people who lost their jobs, and even loved ones. I wanted to spread some positivity so I started dance and yoga classes for the underprivileged kids,” describes Anjali Soni, a student of Indraprastha College for Women. She adds, “I had around 14 kids who came everyday to learn how to dance, and I also conducted classes online for others. And I am still taking classes for them! For me, making them smile is the biggest reward.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/international-day-of-happiness-finding-joy-in-others-smiles-101616228255086.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||World Sparrow Day: Bringing back our childhood sound of music||Once ubiquitous to our surroundings, the chirping of the humble house sparrow, the state bird of Delhi, has gone quieter in the last few decades. As we observe World Sparrow Day (March 20), bird lovers in the capital seek to raise awareness about the plight of our winged companion, which currently sits on the red list of the endangered species of The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Concerned with the declining population of sparrows, environmentalist Rakesh Khatri has been making nests for the critters for over a decade now. “When I was growing up, sparrows would make their nests on balconies, near our windows, but now in this concrete jungle, they have no place to go. We have robbed them of their houses, without providing any alternatives,” he rues. To educate the younger generation about sparrow conservation, he founded Eco Roots Foundation, and conducts workshops in schools, corporates and Residential Welfare Associations, where he teaches them how to build hand-made nests. “I have built over 1,25,000 bird houses across India, and make them from bamboo sticks, threads, jute, and recycled tetra packs. It doesn’t take much time to care for these birds, who belong here as much as we do,” Khatri adds.Vivek Saxena, country representative, IUCN-India, concurs with Khatri and says, “Urbanisation, pollution, less vegetative cover and lack of food had led to a decline in the number of sparrows. We need to ensure our ecosystem can support these birds by providing for nests, breeding spaces, and they are provided with a suitable habitat to coexist with humans in the same area.” Delhi-based Nin Taneja, an artist and avian photographer, has been working to sensitise Delhiites about building a hospitable environment for the embattled bird. “Hearing birds chirp in your balcony is a therapeutic experience. I started building a habitat for sparrows by planting native plants like pomegranate on which they like to feed, apart from putting out water and fruit peels. It is important to understand that sparrows are found in patches; so I have been researching on the areas they are found in, and have been providing people in that area with nest boxes, apart from making informative videos on social media” says Taneja, who works with Nature Forever Society, a conservationist group whose efforts had led to declaration of house sparrow as the state bird of Delhi in 2012. Jasleen Chadha, founder of NGO Jeev Shakti Foundation, has been putting out cemented bowls of water for sparrows in parks and localities. “With summers upon us, it is important to make sure these birds have access to clean drinking water. Each year we rescue scores of birds that suffer from dehydration. I ask people to invest in simple, doable and affordable things like putting nesting boxes and food bowls in their balconies. Sparrows give me a sense of nostalgia about my childhood, and we must work to bring their sounds back to our city,” she says.

20-03-2021||Mumbai||Dharavi sees 62% jump in Covid-19 cases in March as compared to Feb||Dharavi, the biggest slum in Mumbai, has reported 272 coronavirus cases so far in the month of March as against the entire February's infection count of 168, a rise of 62 per cent, civic officials said on Saturday.The spike in cases in this slum sprawl, which is spread over 2.5 sq km of area, has set alarm bells ringing for the authorities, although they say that they are better prepared this year to tackle the situation as compared to last year when the outbreak had started.The officials said that the number of single-day cases in Dharavi, which had started steadily going up since February, has witnessed a significant jump starting this month.Till March 19, it has reported 272 cases.The officials said that the cases being reported now are scattered across the slum and not concentrated in any particular pocket.Dharavi currently has 72 active Covid-19 cases. Of the total number of 4,133 patients so far, 3,745 have recovered, while 316 have died due to the infection.Around 6.5 lakh people live in Dharavi, with a population density of 2,27,136 per sq km. Maintaining social distancing there is a tough task, as families of eight to 10 members live in 10x10 hutments and residents have to walk along narrow lanes lined with crowded tenements on either side.This slum is also home to several small-scale leather, pottery and textile manufacturing units.The first Covid-19 patient in Dharavi was found on April 1 last year, about 20 days after the city reported its first case. Thereafter, the daily case count in Dharavi kept rising and it was declared as Covid-19 hotspot.In the first week of May last year, it had reported 94 cases in a single day, its highest daily count. However, the number started going down gradually from the following month.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, the daily number of cases from Dharavi went down significantly from November and it even did not report any case a few days in January and February.In the last four months, the slum hardly reported any double-digit daily growth in cases. The highest single-day count during this entire period came on on February 16, when it recorded 16 new cases.A number of steps, including proactive screening with the assistance of private doctors and community support, the authorities had managed to flatten the curve of viral spread. Even the World Health Organisation (WHO) took cognisance of the efforts and praised the "Dharavi pattern".Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC's G-North ward that houses Dharavi, said that the number of Covid-19 cases in this slum are rising due to "pro-active testing and screening", but the situation is quite different from last year and fully under control."Last year, when there was an outbreak of Covid-19 in Dharavi, there were limitations on testing and reports were getting delayed. Now, there are no such constraints as ample number of testing kits are available and we could do on-the- spot testing of all the traced contracts of a positive patient," he said.He said that besides focusing on early contact-tracing and screening of people in Dharavi, they are also focusing on speedy vaccination of vulnerable people, like senior citizens and the people with co-morbidities, to keep the number of fatalities under control."Though the cases are rising fast, the fatalities are quite less. We are focusing on vulnerable people like senior citizens and those with the co-morbidities," he said, adding that they are going to start a new vaccination centre with five booths at Dharavi, where at least 1,000 people will be vaccinated per day."We are detecting the cases at early stages enabling them for early treatment. As per the data, 70 per cent cases are asymptomatic and either home quarantined or institutional quarantined," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dharavi-sees-62-jump-in-covid-19-cases-in-march-as-compared-to-feb-101616222110609.html

20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Understanding the residency requirement for jobs in Haryana||Haryana’s controversial 75% private sector quota law had set off another debate last week when Congress lawmakers and some in the ruling BJP-JJP alliance expressed concerns over the five-year residency (domicile) requirement instead of 15 years to get a bona fide resident certificate. It turned out that most of the doubts were rather unfounded. Hitender Rao explains:What is the requirement to get bona fide resident certificate in Haryana?According to the January 14 order, children or dependents of persons having a permanent home in Haryana and those residing in Haryana for a period of not less than five years or who have a permanent home in Haryana but on account of their occupation are living outside Haryana will be eligible for grant of resident certificate. The earlier requirement for getting a resident certificate was 15 years.Why did the state government bring down the residency requirement to five years?This was done to provide some flexibility to private companies in hiring when the private sector job quota law gets implemented. The law provides for 75% of new employment to Haryana domiciled candidates for private sector jobs having gross salary of not more than ₹50,000 per month.What were the concerns expressed by the ruling alliance and opposition MLAs regarding the amended residency requirement?The worry is that due to the amended domicile condition, Haryana-based Scheduled Caste aspirants will face competition in government jobs from SCs of other states settled in Haryana.Can residency be ground for getting a government job?No. Article 16 of the Constitution provides for equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Article 16(2) says no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the state.What about reservation in government jobs for the SCs?Article 16 (4) of the Constitution provided for reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens.So, won’t the amended residency requirement facilitate SCs of other states to compete in Haryana?No. Accordign to a four-judge 2018 Supreme Court judgment, a person recognised as a member of SC in his original state, will be entitled to all benefits of reservation under the Constitution in that state only and not in other states or union territories.What was the basis of the SC judgment?The top court had said that consideration for specifying a particular caste, or class for inclusion in the list of SCs or backward classes in a given state depends on the nature and extent of disadvantages and social hardships suffered by these individuals in that state and these may be absent in another state to which the person belonging to some other state may migrate.Won’t an SC person of another state whose caste is recognised in Haryana get benefit of the changed residency requirement?No. Only a person who is resident of Haryana by birth or an employee or dependent of a state government employee is entitled to get a caste certificate. The caste certificate is essential to confirm a person’s eligibility for reservation in public employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/understanding-the-residency-requirement-for-jobs-in-haryana-101616219972368.html

The fire was doused with the help of four fire tenders that were rushed to the spot. The officials said there was no injury to any of the passengers. The officials of the district fire department said they received a call around 7.04am informing them about the fire in the train and rushed at least four fire tenders to the spot from the Kotwali fire station, which is located nearby. “The fire was doused within half an hour after our fire tenders started operation. The last coach of the train, which also houses a luggage compartment, was affected. We cut open one of the gates of the coach while the other gate was opened by applying manual force. The fire was completely doused within half an hour. Before starting the operation, we ensured that the overhead electricity supply was disconnected,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer of Ghaziabad. He said the fire likely started in the coach while the train was running and thick smoke was detected when the train reached Ghaziabad railway station at around 6.50am. The senior officials of the Railways also rushed to the spot and said that the train was allowed to leave at 8.20am.

20-03-2021||Mumbai||Spotlight on Deshmukh as Vaze case strains ties||Strained relations between Maharashtra’s ruling coalition partners came to the fore again on Friday as the Shiv Sena backed former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh in connection with explosives found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, refuting state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s charge that Singh’s transfer was not a routine affair but due to serious mistakes made made by certain policemen in the high-profile probe.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday stated that just because Singh was shunted out did not imply that he was guilty. “The government had to do the reshuffle in police department under certain specific circumstances. Param Bir Singh was replaced in the post of Mumbai police commissioner, which doesn’t mean he is guilty. He took the charge of the post at a very difficult time,” the editorial said.On Wednesday, Singh was replaced by Hemant Nagrale. On Thursday, Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, told reporters that a few officers from Mumbai Police has committed “serious and unpardonable mistakes” that had come to light in the preliminary inquiry in the explosives case, and that Singh’s transfer was not “routine”.Sena leader Sanjay Raut had previously come out in defence of Sachin Vaze, a suspended police officer who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13, for his role in the explosives-laden SUV parked outside Antilia, Ambani’s residence, on February 25. The party has also questioned the National Investigation Agency taking over the investigation, as directed by the Centre earlier this month.The Saamana editorial added that Singh showed commitment towards the fight against Covid-19, visited Dharavi, which was a hotbed of infections last year. It also added that the TRP scam, in which Vaze had been part of the team that arrested certain accused, was brought to light under his tenure.The Shiv Sena, which is in coalition with the NCP and the Congress in the state’s Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, has been at odds with the handling of the case in the past as well.The Congress noted the contradictory tone. “Shiv Sena is praising commissioner Parambir Singh, while home minister who is from NCP said that the commissioner committed a mistake. Such contradictory statements would further damage the image of the government,” tweeted Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam.Meanwhile, Deshmukh’s own position in the government came under a cloud as the state home minister met NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday at the latter’s Delhi residence.On Thursday, Deshmukh had refuted allegations that he might be replaced over the state police’s controversial handling of the investigation of the Scorpio with explosives found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house last month.Late on Friday, Deshmukh issued a statement denying news reports that he had resigned. “Had a discussion with Pawar saheb over the developments in the last two days in the probe being carried out by NIA and ATS. The news reports going on a few channels over my resignation are baseless,” he tweeted.Earlier in the day, Deshmukh told reporters that he had briefed Pawar over the Antilia case, and sought his help in bringing an international firm which is interested in setting up a plant at Multi-modal International Hub Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN).“I have briefed Pawar saheb about fresh developments in Mumbai related to the Ambani case. Both the NIA and anti-terrorism squad (ATS) are probing the case. The state has extended full cooperation to the NIA and will also take action based on their findings,” Deshmukh said.The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made this case a political issue with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis accusing the government of protecting Vaze.In an apparent response to former chief minister Fadnavis’ subsequent claim that “handlers” of Vaze should also be brought to the fore in the investigation, the Sena mouthpiece said that the Opposition should investigate it and added that there were no “political bosses” in such cases.“If the Opposition is loyal to Maharashtra, then it will not play politics over the reputation of Mumbai police. They have questioned that who is the political boss behind Mansukh Hiran case. They should find answer to this. But in cases like this there are no political bosses. This has been the culture of Maharashtra. If Mansukh Hiran has been killed, the culprit will not be sparred,” the editorial said.On Friday, BJP MP Narayan Rane told news agency ANI that he has written to Union home minister Amit Shah and sought resignation of state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the imposition of President’s rule in Maharashtra.“Due to poor law and order situation and corruption, I have written to Home Minister Amit Shah for Maharashtra Chief Minister’s resignation and the imposition of President’s Rule in the state,” Rane said.NCP leaders said that the party leadership was mulling names of Deshmukh’s successors but denied the possibility of any change until a full cabinet reshuffle.“It all depends upon the three parties [of the ruling coalition government: Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP]. If all are ready and could decide their names of those involved, there would be a reshuffle and only then Deshmukh may be replaced. Until then he is likely to continue as the home minister,” a senior NCP minister said.Party leaders said that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state party unit chief Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil and health minister Rajesh Tope could be considered for the post after the re-shuffle. Tope was also called by the NCP chief on Tuesday.However, the minister quoted above clarified that the NCP leadership didn’t want to create an impression that Deshmukh was in any way responsible for the botched handling of the high-profile case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spotlight-on-deshmukh-as-vaze-case-strains-ties-101616203634179.html
20-03-2021||Bangalore||Anti-social forces trying to thwart resolution: RSS||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Friday said “anti-national and anti-social forces” were trying to thwart efforts to resolve the standoff between the government and protesting farm unions over the three new farm laws.The RSS’s annual report was released in Bengaluru during a three-day convention of the Akhil Bharatiya Prathinidhi Sabha (ABPS), its highest decision making body of the RSS, that started on Friday.“The problem becomes more serious when anti-national and anti-social forces try to thwart the ongoing efforts towards a solution [farmers’ protest]. The leadership of the present agitation should not allow such a situation to arise,” the RSS said in the report.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, seeking a repeal of the new farm laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile large stocks of food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.In its report, the RSS said that prolonged agitations were counterproductive for all.“It is not in anyone’s interest for any kind of agitation to be prolonged for a long time. Discussions are a must, but with a view to finding a solution. It is possible that not all issues are agreed upon, but it is essential that some agreements must be reached upon,” the report said.It stated that people cannot be given the right to create instability in the country. “In a democracy, all have the freedom of expressing their views but none can be given the right to create disturbance and instability in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/antisocial-forces-trying-to-thwart-resolution-rss-101616201522223.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Old wine in a new bottle||People change but their essentials remain the same. Same with places.For decades, the second-hand Sunday Book Bazaar functioned from the pavements of Old Delhi’s Daryaganj. Then, more than a year ago, the court ordered its removal for the sake of obstruction-free traffic. The bazaar shifted to Mahila Haat, an exhibition space across the road from Delite Cinema, the very landmark from where the bazaar used to start.The market didn’t get much time to get used to its new home. A few weeks later, the coronavirus wrecked the world. Eventually the Sunday bazaar reopened after successive lockdowns, but as a pale shadow of its self. For one thing, it would start only at 4pm, and wrap up in a few hours. It’s been only a month since the market started to operate every Sunday from morning to evening, though with lesser booksellers and lesser crowds.The Mahila Haat is built above an underground parking area, and is an unsatisfactory setting for a much-loved destination. In the old bazaar, the books were laid along a mile-long pavement. The great joy was to stroll along the lane, dodging the traffic on the right and fellow booklovers (and pickpockets) on the left, while stopping by one’s favourite stalls. There were eateries for quick bites. Here in Mahila Haat, the sellers are crammed within a limited space and one seems to walk about in rounds, like a donkey in circles.But gradually the disappointment fades, as books start to catch your attention. You start bargaining with the sellers. Then there’s the happiness of a successful acquisition, in exchange of an amount of money you know in your heart is minuscule compared to the book’s true value.Like in its old location, the bazaar has priceless editions on sale this Sunday too —a collection of Churchill’s war writing, a first-edition UK hardbound of Nehru’ Discovery of India (already sold). Mushtaq Khan’s stall has a 19th century edition of poet PB Shelly’s prose work, bound in black leather.Some of the charm of olden times has survived—like booksellers lounging beside their stacks of books, using bundles as pillows.As you spend more time, you’ll spot food hawkers. Plus, a garden to sit and lounge—something that wasn’t there in the old market.Soon a day shall come when we will have forgotten what the old bazaar was like. The present version will make new memories in the new normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-old-wine-in-a-new-bottle-101616198767170.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||In test-track-treat plan, Capital to focus on areas with low exposure||Parts of Delhi that did not have a significant outbreak of Covid-19 till now are being targeted for aggressive testing and vaccination, while grassroots workers have stepped up contact tracing, officials involved in the Capital’s fight against a new surge of cases have said, outlining an approach that combines strategic allocation of resources with shoe leather epidemiology.At 716, the city on Friday recorded its highest number of cases in a single day this year. The increase in cases began sporadically early in March but have now turned into a steady trickle, rising from 368 new cases on Monday.As per the new strategy, finalised during a meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday, wards that had a sero prevalence of 50% or less are being targeted for testing and vaccination, senior officials aware of the plan said, asking not to be named.“Of the 276 wards in Delhi, including four from the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi cantonment board, the government is narrowing down its focus to 129. These are where prevalence of antibodies among residents was 50% or less, which means people here are most vulnerable to Covid-19 infection. So, we are intensifying vaccination and aggressively conducting RT-PCR tests in these wards,” said a senior health official, who asked not to be named.The list includes areas such as Tagore Garden, Trilokpuri, Rajouri Garden, Narela and Vishnu Garden. The data being used by the government is that of the fifth serological survey conducted across the Capital between January 15 and January 23. The survey found as many as 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled to have antibodies, which indicates a past infection.Delhi has a population of 20 million.In these wards, the officials are pinpointing their attention to zones that did not report a surge in cases during the three waves of the Covid-19 outbreak. At its worst, Delhi recorded 8,593 cases on November 11, which was the third wave.“Districts such as north and northwest Delhi on Friday informed the government that they have observed an uptick in cases in a few areas which did not see many cases during the third wave. So, this is where our latest containment strategy is also being rolled out,” said a second government official, asking not to be named.Micro-containment ZonesAt least 360 micro-containment zones – out of the total 682 active ones as on Friday – have been created since March 1. Data seen by HT showed that as on Friday, a record 60.56% of the 3,165 active cases were contained or inside containment zones. Till March 15, this number stood at around 54%. During the November peak, only around 34% of the active cases were located inside containment zones.Micro-containment zones are limited to one or a few neighbouring houses, single-unit buildings and floors within buildings in some cases depending on space and risks of potential transmission.Contact tracingThe government is currently tracing around 31 individuals per Covid-19 case, revenue department records show. Among the 11 revenue districts, East Delhi is tracing the highest per case (around 36), closely trailed in decimal figures by the south district. With 28 contacts per case, southwest Delhi is tracing the lowest, the data, seen by HT, showed.“We have made a strict protocol in which identified contacts of a Covid-19 patient are asked to immediately go into home isolation. The new thing that we are doing now is that even if any of them test negative despite having symptoms, we test them again after 8 days. This means such persons have to be under strict home isolation even after getting treated and testing negative for the first time,” the health official said.The Union health ministry sets the maximum ideal contact tracing standard at 30 per case.VaccinationOn Thursday, Kejriwal announced the city administration will increase Delhi’s daily capacity from around 40,000 to 125,000 by doubling the number of centres from the existing 500 session sites, and extending their timing by four hours.Documents seen by HT showed that the target to increase the daily vaccination capacity in government centres has been set at 70,000, almost double the current capacity. Private hospitals have been given a target to increase from around 23,000 to 40,000.From Monday, all vaccination centres will operate from 9am to 9pm and all Delhi government hospitals will have at least 6 centres each.District teams have fanned out across the Capital in a bid to convince people aged above 60 and those over 45 with serious illnesses to get inoculated. A senior government official said the teams have also been entrusted with helping people register and book vaccine slots through the Centre’s Co-WIN system and arrange conveyance for them if required.TestingFor the week ending Friday, Delhi tested 73,333 samples per day – which is lower than the peak of 83,151 average tests a day exhibited by the government for the week ending December 23, a month after the city brought its third Covid-19 wave under control.“On testing, strict directions have been issued not to decrease Delhi’s total daily Covid-19 tests below the 80,000 mark from now on. Also, our RT-PCR testing capacity is 48,000 and we utilising it,” a third official said.In the last one week, Delhi conducted 45,471 RT-PCR tests on an average every day. The remaining were with rapid antigen kits which are capable of showing results much quicker, but are less accurate than RT-PCR ones.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said: “Delhi should go for a strong containment policy and club that with aggressive tracing, testing and isolation. The government should not only aggressively identify contacts of Covid-19 cases, but ensure that they are all tested and isolated on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive.“Delhi has a large number of people who were not infected in the worst of the phases we have seen in 2020. Also, another large chunk of people are the ones whose antibodies have depleted. That is contributing to the present spike.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-test-track-treat-plan-capital-to-focus-on-areas-with-low-exposure-101616192838378.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Mercury dips slightly, rain relief likely soon||A day after Delhi recorded the highest maximum temperature of the season, at 35.3 degrees Celsius, the mercury levels fell slightly to settle at 34.5 degrees Celsius on Friday.India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said there is a forecast of light rain in the city from March 22 to March 24, which would bring some relief from the rising temperatures.On Friday, too, Delhi’s maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 34.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above the season’s normal. The minimum temperature at the observatory was 19.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year. .A senior Met official said on Saturday, the maximum temperature is expected to be around 34-35 degrees Celsius. However, from March 22, there is a possibility of a brief respite from the heat.“We are expecting an intense western disturbance so there is likely to be widespread rains over northwest India. In Delhi its likely to rain from March 21 night or March 22 early morning. There may be light rain or drizzle on March 23 also. Till March 27 temperatures are likely to remain relatively low and pleasant. There is likely to be heavy rain and hailstorm in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir during the period. There is likely to be rain and thunderstorms over Punjab and Haryana also,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.A western disturbance is an extratropical storm that originates in the Mediterranean, which brings with it rain and a drop in temperature. It is mostly associated with winter rain in India. In the week between March 24 to 31, due to absence of any active western disturbance, rainfall activity is likely to be below normal over northern parts of the country, IMD said in its two-week forecast.“The western disturbance impacting Delhi-NCR will bring down the temperature marginally. The wind speed on March 23 and March 24 is expected to rise to around 40kmph, which will also help pull down the mercury levels,” the official said.This is the fifth western disturbance to pass over the region this month. The last time the city received rain and thunderstorm was on March 12, when the city woke up to light to moderate showers, with hailstorm in parts of NCR.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality improved from the "very poor” to the ”poor” category on Friday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Friday was 279, which was a marginal improvement from Thursday’s 315, categorised as “very poor” on the AQI scale.IMD officials said with the wind speeds expected to improve next week, the pollution levels will also decrease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mercury-dips-slightly-rain-relief-likely-soon-101616188836922.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Nod for corridor between Sarai Kale Khan and IGIA||The apex traffic and transportation body in Delhi, UTTIPEC (Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre), on Friday approved the integrated transit plan made for handling the increased vehicular traffic around eight government group housing colonies that are being redeveloped by the Centre.The proposal, which includes the construction of a 14km long elevated corridor in South Delhi, aims at providing smooth access between Sarai Kale Khan and Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).The Centre is redeveloping eight colonies — Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Srinivaspuri, Kasturba Nagar, Netaji Nagar, Mohammadpur, Thyagraj Nagar and East Kidwai agar — in an effort to provide better housing to its employees. NBCC India has already redeveloped East Kidwai Nagar and the Centre is presently constructing over 25,000 dwelling units and a commercial complex in the remaining seven colonies.The proposal was tabled in the UTTIPEC meeting, chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, on Friday. After the meeting, Baijal tweeted, “After detailed deliberations following proposals were approved: Integrated Transit Corridor Development and Street Network/ Connectivity Plan for the corridor and influence zone from Sarai Kale Khan to IGI Airport.”Baijal had asked the Delhi Development Authority to discuss the funding plan for the ₹5,000 crore (approximately) project with the Union housing urban affairs (HUA) ministry before it is cleared by the UTTIPEC.HT had reported the details of this project on March 1. The matter was duly discussed in a meeting between HUA minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Baijal on March 2.A senior official aware of the development, on condition of anonymity, said as the funding issue has been addressed, the project was tabled in the UTTIPEC meeting on Friday for approval.The transit plan includes a 14km elevated corridor from INA on Aurobindo Marg to Mahipalpur underpass on National Highway-8 and connecting all flyovers between Moolchand and Moti Bagh, just before the start of the elevated Metro corridor on the Ring Road.The feasibility study for the corridor was done by Delhi government’s public works department, while it will be executed by the central public works department.Another proposal approved in the UTTIPEC meeting was the multimodal intergration plan of Karkardooma Metro station.The DDA is planning a transit oriented development project around the station and the project was reviewed in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nod-for-corridor-between-sarai-kale-khan-and-igia-101616188133103.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Centre objects to AAP’s doorstep ration scheme||The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing tussle between the Centre and the state government, with the Union ministry of food and public distribution rasing objections at several aspects of the scheme that was due to be launched on March 25.In a letter to the Delhi administration, the Union ministry has principally raised two objections — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA); and any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA can only be done through a Parliament amendment.“Upon examination of the said notification, it is clarified that the subsidised food grains being allocated by this department for distribution under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) cannot be used for the operationalisation of any state specific/other scheme under a different nomenclature other than NFSA, as the same is not permissible under the Act. Further any changes/amendments in the provisions of the Act, including nomenclatures used for distribution of NFSA foodgrains can only be done through the parliamentary procedures,” said the letter by S Jagannathan, joint secretary in the ministry of food and public distribution.The ministry further said any change in the nomenclature may give rise to confusion among the people. “It is also highlighted that while states may like to enhance the distribution of subsidised foodgrains, including additional entitlements, more subsidy etc. the nomenclature from NFSA to any local state scheme name may be misinterpreted by the beneficiaries as state benefit and may give rise to confusion regarding their rights under the Act,” the letter said.The letter added that the Delhi government is "free to launch” the scheme “without mixing the elements of the NFSA food grains”.Siraj Dutta, a food rights activist, said specific provisions under the National Food Security Act give the Centre the power to stop the supply of subsidised food grains if state governments are found violating the law. But he added, “I am yet to get clarity on what exactly the central government has told the Delhi government.”The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said the move by the Union government was “anti-people”, and stressed that the Centre was aware of all modalities of the scheme. “I would like to appeal to the central government to not interfere in matters related to governance. They should withdraw such anti-people directions and let the Delhi government launch the ‘Mukhyamantri ghar ghar ration yojana’. The Delhi government has held several meeting with the central government on this matter.They were aware of all the modalities. It could have put an end to corruption and leakages. Now, they not only have a problem with just the name of the scheme but also the modalities. They decided to send this letter less than a week before launch of the scheme.”Delhi has around 7.2 million ration beneficiaries, according to government data.The distribution of ration is currently managed by a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops. The doorstep delivery scheme was one of the major poll promises by the AAP in the run up to the 2020 assembly polls. The Delhi government already offers nearly 100 services across departments which the people can avail by calling a helpline number and paying a processing fee of ₹50.Responding to the AAP’s allegations, the BJP said that the Centre has not stopped the scheme but only pointed out issues related to provisions under NFSA. “The AAP is trying to mislead the people. Under NSFA, no state government can use the foodgrains provided by the Centre for a populist state-specific scheme. The people of Delhi know how the AAP government failed to properly distribute food grains even during the lockdown. Their attempt to use food grains provided by the Centre for gaining political mileage is condemnable,” the Delhi BJP said in a statement.In the February 20 notification, the Delhi government cited Section 12 and Section 24 of NFSA in the gazette notification relating to the scheme. Both the sections refer to the role of the state governments ensuring the delivery of foodgrains to ration shops – and not exactly doorstep of beneficiaries.DJ Narain, spokesperson for the Union ministry of food and public distribution, said: “One state cannot suo motu change the basic elements of a scheme being implemented nationally. PDS consists of key features like amount and type of subsidised ration for given categories of specific households. If all the states and UTs start changing the basic rules of PDS implementation, it will become almost impossible to implement it nation wide. Measurable tools of PDS monitoring will also break down. States are free to have their own schemes over and above this.”The Delhi government has been at loggerheads with the Centre over a Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday which gives overarching powers to the lieutenant governor in the day-to-day administration and also limits powers of the assembly to constitute enquiry committees.Anjali Bhardwaj, member of the Right to Food campaign, said the modalities of the Delhi scheme may affect beneficiaries but there were gaps in the national distribution plan as well. “There are gaps, no doubt, in the modalities of the Delhi government’s proposed doorstep delivery scheme and that may affect beneficiaries. However, the NFSA mechanism is also not foolproof. It excludes a very large number of poor people across the country. And it came to the fore during the lockdown when we came across a large number of people who either did not have ration cards or could not avail ration for some reason or the other despite having cards. In Delhi’s case, the city government should ideally launch an additional food security scheme. With that, they can fill up the exclusion gap left behind by the NFSA mechanism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-objects-to-aap-s-doorstep-ration-scheme-101616186761927.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Back your peace rhetoric with concrete action: Amarinder Singh to Pakistan army chief||Terming “Islamabad-sponsored terrorism” as the biggest hurdle in normalising relations between the two neighbouring countries, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa should back his rhetoric on peace with India with solid action. In a press statement, Amarinder said, “Bajwa should control the ISI first and then talk about stability in Indo-Pak relations. India cannot afford to go soft with Pakistan till it walks the talk. Infiltration into India from across the border is still happening and our soldiers are being killed at the borders daily. They (Pakistan) are dropping arms and heroin in Punjab via drones. All this should stop first and only then we can talk peace.” For India to trust Pakistan, he said, the latter will have to do much more than offer an olive branch, citing his own experience of the army in 1964. “We used to receive daily reports then of firing from the western border, as we continue to do now. It is important for not just Gen Bajwa but the entire Pakistan military apparatus to be on board with the idea of burying the past and paving the way for peace with India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/back-your-peace-rhetoric-with-concrete-action-amarinder-singh-to-pakistan-army-chief-101616186068076.html

In the survey, the AAP has been projected to get 51 to 57 seats, while the ruling Congress has been given 43 to 49 seats, while the Akali Dal and BJP will grab only 12-18 and 0-5 seats. In terms of vote share, the AAP has got the highest number of votes at 37%, followed by the ruling party at 32%, the Akali Dal at 21% and the BJP and others at 5-5%.Rejecting the claim, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said the AAP was given 100 seats by a similar survey in its projections before the 2017 assembly polls. “They are trying to put life into a dead horse. The elections are still about a year away, but we do not take anybody lightly, survey or no survey. We do not take even the BJP lightly because they have all these tricks up their sleeve and same for the SAD and the AAP. We will fight with our full strength and are confident that people will repose their faith in the Congress and its leadership,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/channel-survey-shows-aap-will-form-govt-in-punjab-says-chadha-congress-rejects-claim-101616185407957.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab agriculture department to add 50,000 hectares under cotton cultivation in Malwa||Keeping in view a bumper production in 2020 and no major pest outbreak in the crop for the last five years, the Punjab agriculture department has decided to add 50,000 hectares under cotton cultivation in the Malwa region this year. This will be an increase of 10% over the current area of 5 lakh hectares. The sowing for the major cash crop in eight semi-arid districts of the region will start from next month. Experts say as farmers received good rates for their produce and global and domestic demand of raw cotton is increasing, more growers will be motivated to diversify towards the cash crop. If the state authorities manage to achieve the set target, it will be the highest since the 2010 season of 5.16 lakh hectares. State agriculture director Sukhdev Sidhu said, “Cotton sowing will start from April 1 and the department is planning to increase area under the traditional kharif crop. We have put all arrangements in place to meet the target and 25 lakh packets of seeds will be made available to farmers.” While cotton sowing commences in the first week of April in the mustard-growing areas, but the bulk is done after April 15 when wheat is harvested in the region. “In the wake of an incident of deadly pink bollworm in Bathinda last year that infested nearly 100-acre land, cotton ginning and pressing units, key source of such infestations, have been instructed to follow the protocol to complete processing by March-end and destroy the waste immediately,” said Sidhu. Officials said the direct payment mode adopted by Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) was successful for the last two consecutive years under which more than ₹2,000 crore, including ₹1,525 crore in 2020-21, was paid to the cotton growers. Paramjit Singh, director, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) regional research station, Bathinda, said the first step will involve removing weeds like ‘kanghi buti’, ‘peeli buti’, ‘puth kanda’, ‘dhatura’ and ‘bhang’ that grow on field bunds, wasteland, roadsides and irrigation channels/canals through community participation. “In the last two seasons, weed removal proved immensely beneficial in keeping the whitefly pest at bay. Coordinated efforts by agriculture scientists, extension teams and farmers resulted in a disease-free season in 2020. It will encourage the farmers to go for cotton in a bigger way,” he added. Mandi board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said till March 17, at least 41 lakh quintal cotton was purchased and farmers were paid up to ₹6,270 for a quintal, which is ₹545 above the minimum support price (MSP). Goel said in 2020, the average yield was close to 833kg lint per hectare whereas it was recorded 800kg in 2019. In 2015, cotton yield dropped to a low of 197kg lint per hectare due to whitefly attack. The crop yield in the Malwa belt was 756kg; 750kg and 778kg from 2016 to 2018. “Amid the coronavirus scare in 2020-21, the CCI played an important role by purchasing a record 24 lakh quintals on MSP. Timely announcement by the central government on increasing the MSP will lead to increase in the area under cotton,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-agriculture-department-to-add-50-000-hectares-under-cotton-cultivation-in-malwa-101616184990673.html
20-03-2021||Other||Ex-cop Sachin Vaze, Mansukh Hiran met on Feb 17: ATS officer||CCTV footage shows that arrested police officer Sachin Vaze and deceased businessman Mansukh Hiran had met on February 17, the day before Hiran reported a Scorpio in his possession stolen, a Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad official told news agency PTI on Friday.The same green-coloured Scorpio was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note on St Carmichael Road, across from Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, on February 25.Hiran, a 48-year-old auto spare parts businessman, was likely murdered and his body washed up ashore at a creek in Thane district on March 5.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 for reportedly being the mastermind behind the plot to park an explosives-filled Scorpio outside Ambani’s residence.The NIA told HT that Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch had staged the whole thing in a bid to regain his “lost glory”.Vaze, who joined the Mumbai police in 1990, was suspended in 2004 for his alleged involvement in a purported custodial death of a terror suspect, Khwaja Yunus. Vaze was reinstated last year.The ATS, which is probing Hiran’s suspicious death, recovered CCTV footage of a spot near Chhhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai which showed Vaze and Hiran sitting in a Mercedes, the official said.The NIA, which is probing the recovery of the explosives-laden SUV and arrested Vaze on March 13 in connection with that case, seized the same black Mercedes car earlier this week.The CCTV footage showed that Hiran and Vaze were seated in the car for close to 10 minutes.Hiran had claimed that on February 17 while he was heading for south Mumbai from his house in Thane, the steering of the Scorpio jammed, so he left it on Mulund-Airoli road and proceeded in a cab. Next day he found the SUV was missing, he said.The CCTV footage showed Vaze leaving in the Mercedes from police commissioner’s office. Hiran was seen walking towards the car when it was parked outside CSMT.Ten minutes later Hiran stepped out and walked away while Vaze drove back to the commissioner’s office.The ATS suspected that Hiran handed over the keys of Scorpio to Vaze during this meeting, PTI reported.The NIA had earlier this week seized a black Mercedes car from a parking lot near CSMT and seized ₹5 lakh in cash, note-counting machine and some `incriminating’ documents.Hiran’s family alleged that Vaze had a role in his death.The NIA and ATS investigations have also been grist to the mill of politicians in the state, as opposition leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party, including Devendra Fadnavis, have blamed the Shiv Sena, which is part of the ruling coalition government, for protecting Vaze.The state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray as well as the home minister Anil Deshmukh have spoken against these allegations and said that the investigations will reveal the truth, and that no one would be spared.However, on March 17, Vaze’s former boss, police commissioner Param Bir Singh was transferred as a fall-out of this investigation.Deshmukh told reporters that his transfer was not routine, but a result of mistakes committed by Singh’s colleagues.Meanwhile, a state minister on condition of anonymity said, “Hiran’s death case is part of the investigation of Antilia bomb scare which NIA has been probing. The SUV was said to be owned by the deceased. The investigation cannot be completed without investigating the death of Hiran. There is no need for the NIA to take permission from the state government to probe Hiran’s death case. They have already started probing this aspect of the case.”A NIA team late on Friday evening recreated the scene near Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, where a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned with 20 lose gelatin sticks and a threatening note in it. The NIA officials also made Sachin Vaze walk small distances and video recorded his walk - perhaps to ascertain if the man captured walking with his face covered by a cloth and a face shield on the February 24 night in CCTV footage, was Vaze or someone else.The entire exercise was conducted in presence of two forensic teams, one from Pune and the other from Kalina in Santacruz. The forensic teams recorded videos and took pictures at site and earlier in the day also visited NIA office.NIA and police officials, however, refused to comment on the development.NIA officials on Friday, including Inspector General Anil Shukla and Superintendent of Police Vikram Khalate met newly-appointed city police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, a police official said.Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Milind Bharambe and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Akbar Pathan were also present at the meeting, he said.The NIA officials spent around 30 minutes at the police commissioner’s office. It was the first visit by senior officials of the central agency to the commissioner’s office after Nagrale replaced Singh two days ago.The NIA on Friday interrogated an officer and four constables attached to the CIU. One of the constables questioned was the driver of the Innova that was seen tailing the Scorpio on the night of February 25.The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado, one of the two vehicles seized by NIA on Thursday and registered in the name of Shiv Sena functionary Vijaykumar Bhosale was sold in 2019, one of his family members confirmed.Vaze used to bring the Land Cruiser Prado only on Sundays and public holidays, said a crime branch officer. On February 26, Vaze had brought Hiran to the CIU office in that car.Vaze knew Hiran “well” Traders who knew Hiran well said that the auto spare parts dealer had known Vaze for the past seven to eight years.A relative of Hiran’s said that the family also knew Vaze well, and the suspended police officer had been to Hiran’s residence on occasion. The family believed Vaze to be a close friend.An officer bearer of the traders association in Thane said that Hiran had at one point of time thought of starting a new business in partnership with a man suggested by Vaze. But the proposal did not fructify.Another owner of a shop in the vicinity of Hiran’s shop revealed that meetings between the two had “increased”.On March 7, Hiran’s wife Vimla gave a statement to the ATS that Hiran had been in Vaze’s company for three consecutive days -- from February 26 to February 28 – after the Scorpio was found outside Antilia. On the 26th, Hiran had approached the CIU stating that the Scorpio was his, but that he had reported it stolen on February 18.The statement also revealed that Vaze had helped Hiran get a complaint drafted from a lawyer stating that several officers from various units of the Mumbai police and the Maharashtra ATS were harassing him by repeatedly calling him for questioning. The complaint was submitted to the Mumbai police commissioner and a copy was also marked to his Thane counterpart as well as the chief minister.The statement further revealed that Vaze had suggested to Hiran that he get arrested in the SUV case and assured him that he would help secure bail for him within a few days.When Hiran went missing on the night of March 4, his brother Vinod called up Vaze to seek help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/excop-sachin-vaze-mansukh-hiran-met-on-feb-17-ats-officer-101616184627799.html

20-03-2021||Other||Thane trader’s death: Sachin Vaze’s bail hearing adjourned till Mar 30||The Thane district and sessions court on Friday adjourned till March 30 the hearing of an anticipatory bail application filed by suspended police officer Sachin Vaze in connection with the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, even as the Maharashtra Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) sought his custody. ATS got production warrant from Thane court. Now they can arrest Vaze anytime once he is bailed out from NIA case.Vaze is currently under arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), in connection with the explosives-laden SUV found outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house last month.On March 12, Vaze had filed an anticipatory bail plea in connection with the ATS investigation into Hiran’s murder, after Hiran’s wife Vimla told the investigators that she suspected Vaze had a hand in her husband’s death.The court had posted the matter to March 19 but had also said that custodial interrogation of Vaze was necessary as prima facie there was evidence against him.Vaze’s lawyer Aarti Kalekar sought time to study the reply submitted by prosecutor Sanjay Londe representing the ATS which is probing the murder of Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to Scorpio found outside Antilia on February 25.Seeking Vaze’s custody from the NIA, the ATS told the court that they wished to interrogate Vaze over his whereabouts the night of March 4, when Hiran went missing.Hiran’s body was found in the Retibunder creek on March 5, without any identifying markers including his wallet, watch, gold ring and mobile phone, all of which were missing. His mouth was stuffed with handkerchiefs and covered with a scarf.“Mansukh Hiran, Thane based trader went missing from his house on the night of March 4, his body was found on March 5. We want to interrogate Vaze on his movement from the time Hiran went missing to the time his body was found. Secondly there is a larger conspiracy in his death which we want to uncover. We want to find out how many people and who all are involved,” the ATS reply read.“We wish to investigate who took these valuables and why. The fourth important point for our investigation is where was the Scorpio, found outside Antilia, parked between February 17 to February 25, who changed the number plates, the making of bogus number plate, why and how.”A Scorpio that Hiran had been driving for three years and reported stolen on February 18, was found parked outside Antilia on February 25. It had 20 sticks of gelatin (no detonator or timer) and a threatening letter addressed to Ambani. Two identical sets of three different registration number plates were kept beneath the rear seat of the vehicle, and its own engine number and body number of the vehicle were removed. Even the chassis number embossed on the car near right front wheel was wiped out.“The ATS had submitted its say in the court. It was a large document, so we will read and study it. We would also take instructions from our client on the course of argument for the next hearing for March 30,” Vaze’s defence lawyer Aarti Kalekar said adding that Vaze had been falsely implicated before. Vaze had been taken to court by the Crime Investigation Department for his role in the alleged custodial death of terror suspect Khwaja Yunus in 2003. After he was suspended in 2004, Vaze retired from the force in 2007. He was reinstated last year after his suspension was revoked.Vaze’s sister Anuradha Hatkar (50) on Friday moved court to issue directions to the media stationed outside her house ever since her brother was arrested. The court of District Judge Shailendra Tambe directed the Rabodi police station to look into her complaint.“We filed an application in the court for increasing vigilance near the residence. The sister who stays in Saket has no connection in the case,” Kalekar said, adding that Vaze’s relatives in Kolhapur too were being questioned by the media about Vaze.Meanwhile, the special NIA court refused to entertain applications filed by Vaze and NIA on the issue of presence of lawyer during interrogation of Vaze.Vaze’s lawyers had on Thursday moved applications first seeking clarity on presence of lawyer in interrogation room and second meeting Vaze in privacy after the interrogation for exchanging instruction. The court had asked NIA to respond to the said plea.The special NIA court had partly allowed this application by allowing an advocate representing Waze to be present while he is being interrogated. The advocate was to be within visible range but not in hearing range according to the court order. The court had however rejected the prayer of Vaze for meeting with lawyer in private during the time of his NIA custody.On Friday, the NIA moved the special court seeking direction to the lawyer of Vaze to remain present at the time of Vaze’s questioning. The NIA claimed that Vaze has been insisting for presence of his lawyer during questioning and his lawyers are not available. This NIA claimed has stalled their probe.Vaze’s lawyer Abad Ponda contended that it is the right of the accused to have a private meeting with the lawyer during the custody period for giving instructions. The lawyers sought that Vaze should be allowed to meet the lawyer in privacy.The court refused to entertain NIA’s claim stating the agency can continue their probe on their own and such direction is not needed. While Rejecting Vaze’s claim the court said the order passed on Tuesday about the terms of presence of lawyer were clear enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-trader-s-death-sachin-vaze-s-bail-hearing-adjourned-till-mar-30-101616183848833.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||HC defers hearing on Khaira’s plea for March 24||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Friday deferred hearing on the petition of Punjab Ekta Party president and Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira for March 24 with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking time to respond to the issues raised by the legislator. The properties of Khaira and some persons associated with him were raided by ED on March 9 in a case of probe involving the 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. The central agency recently filed a Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) case in connection with the 2015 FIR. Nine persons were convicted in October 2017 in the case by a trial court and sentenced them to imprisonment, ranging from three to 20 years, for trans-border heroin smuggling. The court had summoned Khaira as “additional accused” through same order. Two months later, Supreme Court had stayed the summons to him. Khaira has moved the high court seeking quashing of the investigation launched by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. He also sought quashing of the ED’s summons issued on March 12, asking him to join the probe. Besides, he has requested the court to direct the ED not to take any coercive action against him, if he joins the probe. His counsel Vikram Chaudhari said Khaira has told court that he has not been provided with a copy of the ECIR (enforcement case information report). Khaira has also questioned sanctity of the proceedings saying as how the probe was initiated even as there is a stay from apex court in the main case.He has also demanded that in the event of his appearance before the ED, audio/videography of the proceedings be allowed so that it is known why he is being called to join the probe. Chaudhari claimed that during the hearing the ED has told the court that Khaira was not an accused so far. That further raises questions as to why searches were carried out that too during pandemic with ED raiding his premises with 30-40 personnel, Chaudhari added. The plea filed last week demands that the outcome of the search and seizure exercise by the ED, his married daughter’s house and other persons related to him shouldn’t be taken note of. It further demands that the ED be stopped from unlocking his mobile phones and viewing the contents as it would “violate his fundamental rights”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-defers-hearing-on-khaira-s-plea-for-march-24-101616183847825.html

TAAI also asked Air India to allow agents to book Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights. TAAI also sought an urgent meeting to discuss these issues with the national carrier on Thursday.According to the association, it is “inappropriate” to sell the tickets of VBM flights only on the airline’s website. “Being International Air Transport Association (IATA)-accredited agents and Air India being an IATA BSP (billing and settlement plan – a system designed to facilitate and simplify the selling) concurrent airline, it must ensure that the trade agents are protected and assisted,” stated the letter.Claiming that genuine travellers miss out on the opportunity to book their seats and that many do not have access to websites or are not in a position to make online bookings, TAAI suggested that a special circular with conditions to make the bookings for VBM flights must be issued to assist the agents.TAAI also pointed out that Air India is the one of the airlines which is not permitting refunds on GDS, and hence passengers are unable to get their money back.“You are required to open up the access to process refunds for previous refunds which were to be processed during the lockdown as well as for flights or bookings which have been cancelled for immediate process in the billing cycle as prescribed by IATA without setting any further conditions and promptly refund the amounts as per the resolutions thereto. We expect Air India to permit booking of all flights across all GDS systems,” the letter stated.TAAI also demanded a 5% agent commission from Air India on the total airfare. Addressing the issue, the letter stated, “Since last year, Air India had withdrawn the commission of 1.5% and is only giving it as an incentive on a monthly basis. We reiterate our demand for a minimum of 5% as commission on the total airfare...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/address-concerns-on-bookings-refunds-country-s-largest-tourism-body-to-air-india-101616183547774.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze row: Maharashtra home minister Deshmukh meets NCP chief Pawar, says have not resigned||Amid the row over police officer Sachin Vaze’s link to the security scare at industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and death of the trader, Mansukh Hiran, who owned the car, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh met Nationalist Congress Party supremo Sharad Pawar on Friday. Deshmukh reached Pawar’s Delhi residence in the morning and the meeting between both the leaders lasted for over an hour. Deshmukh told reporters after the meeting that he came to meet Pawar to seek his help in bringing an international firm which is interested in setting up a plant at Multi-modal International Hub Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) at Nagpur and also briefed him about developments in the Antilia bomb scare case. The meeting assumes significance as there are speculations that Deshmukh is likely to lose the home portfolio. According to party insiders, the NCP leadership is mulling names of his successors who are more capable to handle the home department. The deliberations started following the Antilia bomb case, which hit the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s image. The case also raised doubts over Deshmukh’s grip on the crucial home department, NCP insiders said. “I have briefed Pawar saheb about fresh developments in Mumbai related to the Ambani case. Both the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and anti-terrorism squad (ATS) are probing the case. The state has extended full cooperation to the NIA and will also take action based on their findings,” the home minister told reporters while leaving Pawar’ residence. Later in the evening, he denied news reports of him resigning from the post of home minister. “Had a discussion with Pawar saheb over the developments in the last two days in the probe being carried out by NIA and ATS. The news reports going on a few channels over my resignation are baseless,” he said in a tweet. NCP insiders also denied the possibility of any change until a reshuffle of the state cabinet. “It all depends upon the three ruling parties. If all are ready and could decide their names of those involved, there would be a reshuffle and only then Deshmukh may be replaced. Until then he is likely to continue as the home minister,” said a senior NCP minister, requesting anonymity. He clarified that NCP leadership doesn’t want to create an impression that Deshmukh was in any way responsible for the mess in the Antilia bomb scare case after NIA arrested police officer Sachin Vaze accusing him of planting the gelatin sticks in a SUV. According to party insiders, the names that are doing the rounds as possible replacement to Deshmukh are deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state party unit chief Jayant Patil, Dilip Walse Patil and health minister Rajesh Tope. Tope was also called by the NCP chief on Tuesday and discussion between the leaders was kept under the wraps. Deshmukh said on Thursday he will remain the home minister until the NCP chief wants him to handle the responsibility. “Recently, Pawar saheb in a press conference in Delhi praised my work. I will remain in this position until he wants me to continue. His word is final in our party,” Deshmukh said in response to a question at a function organised by Lokmat Group. “In the political career spanning 30 years, there is not a single blot on my image.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-row-maharashtra-home-minister-deshmukh-meets-ncp-chief-pawar-says-have-not-resigned-101616183487746.html

20-03-2021||Mumbai||PMLA cases totally independent of base offences: Bombay HC||In an important ruling, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday held that investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, are totally independent of the scheduled base offences and ED can continue the probe even if the base offences are closed, compounded or quashed.A single-judge bench of justice AS Gadkari said for probing a money laundering case, registration of a scheduled offence - one of the offences mentioned in the Schedule to the PMLA - is necessary, but once an enforcement case information report (ECIR) is registered under the PMLA is registered, the ECIR stands on its own and it thereafter does not require the support of the scheduled offence.HC clarified that ED’s probe thereafter does not depend even on the ultimate result of the scheduled offence. “Even if the scheduled offence is compromised, compounded, quashed or the accused therein is/are acquitted, ED’s investigation is not affected.The ruling will enable ED to continue its investigation unabated in where base cases are closed, like the one filed by Akbar Travels of India Pvt Ltd (ATIPL) against Jet Airways and its directors, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita. Similar was the situation in the alleged fraud at Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank in which several political leaders are suspected to be involved and in which a closure report is filed by the economic offences wing of the Mumbai Police.Justice Gadkari was hearing a petition filed by Babulal Verma and Kamal Kishore Gupta, both promoters of a realty firm in Mumbai, against whom ED has started investigation under PMLA. eD’s probe was based on an offence of criminal breach of trust and cheating, registered at City Chowk police station at Aurangabad on March 7, 2020.Based on the offence, ED on December 16, 2020, registered an ECIR and started an investigation. Verma and Gupta thereafter cleared all dues of the complainant and accordingly, the offence against them was compounded and closed by a judicial magistrate on February 10, 2021In this backdrop, the accused, promoters of Omkar Realtors and Developers, had sought their release on bail on the ground of closure of the scheduled offence. They moved HC after the special PMLA court in Mumbai rejected their plea on February 15, 2021.Before HC, his counsel submitted that the moment scheduled offence comes to an end, the PMLA proceedings also comes to an end. bail. The lawyer added that it was a settled legal proposition that if initial action does not align with law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall through for the reason that the illegality strikes at its root and the applicants could not have been remanded to further custody and were entitled to be released on bail.Justice Gadkari rejected the argument, observing that the investigation under the PMLA is totally independent of the scheduled offence.“PMLA is a special statute enacted with a specific object i.e. to track and investigate cases of money laundering,” said HC. “Therefore, after lodgment of the scheduled offence, its ultimate result will not have any bearing on the investigation of a crime under the PMLA and the offence under the PMLA will survive and stand on its own.”HC said if the argument of the petitioners was accepted, getting the base case closed would be the easiest mode for the accused to scuttle and/or put an end to the investigation under the PMLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmla-cases-totally-independent-of-base-offences-bombay-hc-101616182828894.html

Yadav and Patil would extort huge sums of money from builders, said Sagar. “Vaze would advise Yadav on how to escape the law and was instrumental in helping him flee to Uttar Pradesh. Yadav was arrested in April 2017,” said Sagar. He added that Vaze also provided Yadav with a car and met him in Gujarat, where they destroyed the evidence. “However, LCB recovered a revolver, which was used by Yadav to extort money from a Vasai builder. Of the ₹25 lakh demanded, ₹2 lakh was taken by Patil as first instalment from the builder,” said Sagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exmumbai-police-cop-sachin-vaze-was-charge-sheeted-in-25-l-extortion-case-101616182827813.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai may see brief respite from heat this weekend||After temperatures soared to a season high of 38.2 degrees Celsius on March 13, the city saw its coolest day in at least a week on Friday when the daytime maximum temperature settled at 33.2 degrees Celsius; down from 34.2 degrees Celsius the day before. As per official forecasts, daytime temperature may drop further to 32 degrees Celsius over the weekend, before starting to rise again around March 24.A spokesperson for the India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Mumbai said that the dip in temperature was due to the influence of an impending weather system forming over Northern Madhya Maharashtra, with thunderstorms expected in Jalgaon, Dhule, Nashik, Nandurbar, Pune and Ahmednagar districts over the next three days. Parts of Buldhana district, as well as Jalna and Aurangabad, saw hailstorms on Friday.“We have issued a weather alert for these districts. While showers are not expected over western Maharashtra, the passage of moisture heavy clouds over some parts of the state are having a cooling effect on cities like Mumbai. But after the weather system passes, temperatures will start rising again. The maximum reading may touch 36 degrees Celsius by March 26,” the official said.The minimum temperature in Mumbai on Friday settled at 22 degrees Celsisus — also the lowest in at least a week — down from 24.4 degrees Celsius the previous day. As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, minimum temperature is expected to remain at about 23 degrees Celsius during the next week, touching a high of 24 degrees Celsius around March 23. Clear and partly cloudy skies are expected to prevail intermittently.Air quality in the city, meanwhile, entered the moderate category after at least five days, with an air quality index (AQI) of 197, down from about 230 the day prior, as per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). A spokesperson for SAFAR, which maintains a network of 10 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, said, “AQI in Mumbai will, for the most part, remain in the upper end of moderate to lower end of the poor category for all of March. Once temperatures rise in April, resulting in faster winds and quicker dispersal of pollutants, the AQI should settle around 150, with the exception of some dust storms that are to be expected during the summer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-may-see-brief-respite-from-heat-this-weekend-101616182587728.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Supreme Court collegium clears 13 names for Bombay HC judges||The Bombay high court (HC) is all set to get 13 new judges after the Supreme Court (SC) collegium, in its meeting held on March 19, decided to elevate nine advocates and four lower judiciary officers to the post of high court (HC) judges.The Bombay HC, which has a sanctioned strength of 94 judges, is currently functioning with only 62 judges who are assigned duties at the principal seat in Bombay and its benches at Nagpur, Aurangabad and Goa. The nine persons elevated have been doing duties as additional public prosecutors, additional government pleaders or represented other government and local bodies in the HC. The elevated persons include Aruna Pai, Shailesh Brahme, Kamal Khata, Sharmila Deshmukh, Amira Abdul Razaq, Sandeep Marne, Sandeep Parikh, Somasekhar Sundarsen and Mahendra Nerlikar. The implementation of the decision is, however, awaited in light of a notification which has to be issued by the governor’s office. The last batch of new judges had been added in January 2020 when four judges were sworn in. This year, a list of 22 probable candidates had been forwarded to the collegium for consideration, of which nine were approved for the post of judge while four were approved for the post of judicial officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/supreme-court-collegium-clears-13-names-for-bombay-hc-judges-101616182347675.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||81% seats reserved for ST students in PhD courses vacant in 16 IITs||Almost 81% of the total PhD seats reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category on an average in the past two years at 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) across the country, shows data released by the ministry of Education in Lok Sabha.In 2020-21, 82% seats reserved for STs were vacant in these IITs, whereas 80 seats were vacant in 2019-20. Of the seats reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) category students, 61% were vacant in 2020-21 and 62% in 2019-20. Almost half the seats reserved for Other Backward Classes (OBC) were vacant in both the years. Of the 23 IITs in India, data for Tirupati, Mandi, Indore, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Ropar and Kharagpur IITs were unavailable as the campuses do not have a fixed intake capacity, minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal said in Lok Sabha.The data also shows that five candidates had applied for each seat in ST category, nine SC candidates applied to each seat and nine for each OBC seat.S Sudarshan, IIT-Bombay’s deputy director for academic and infrastructure affairs, said that not enough research scholars from all categories were applying for PhD courses. “The vacancies are also dependent on the departments — some get a good number of applications while some don’t get enough. This is across all categories, including general category,” said Sudarshan. In 2020-21, IIT Bombay saw 52 seats go vacant in general category, 28 in SC, 21 in ST and 21 in OBC category.N Sukumar, professor, department of political sciences, Delhi University, said systemic issues prevented SC, ST and OBC students from accessing IITs. “These students are forced to study in government schools, where the teaching-learning process is very haphazard. They also do not have access to quality coaching centres to help them prepare for IIT entrance exam. They lack socio-cultural capital to encroach into ‘meritorious’ institutions. Despite all these issues, if students do get qualified as the data reveals, one needs to reflect on the reasons as to why the seats are still vacant.”City-based economist Ajit Ranade, who has served in the board of governors of IIT-Bombay in the past, said, “The lack of representation of SC and ST category students cuts across various fields of education as well as professions. Subconscious biases not only affect the way selections work, but also extend to the curriculum. There is also a need to monitor how many students are graduating at the end of the programme to see if any candidates fell through the system.”Sudarshan said that each department of the institute conducts an entrance exam and cut-offs are then decided. “We follow the reservation policy in our selection process. Necessary relaxations are given to each category for both written and interview marks,” he said.However, Sukumar added that the interview process was highly subjective as the students are judged on the basis of caste, language, gender, region, etc biases. “Caste discrimination is blatant as many IIT directors have openly claimed that they will not implement reservations in faculty positions as ‘merit’ will be diluted. Such mentalities are part of the SC/ST/OBC students’ everyday experiences. When there is no enabling environment to complete their education, how will they proceed to attain faculty positions,” he said.Ranade said institutes must intensify their efforts to improve representation of SC and ST category students. “It is also the responsibility of the system to make resources, remedial classes and support, in terms of mental health, available to researchers so they can cope,” added Ranade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/81-seats-reserved-for-st-students-in-phd-courses-vacant-in-16-iits-101616182167601.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh excise dept earns ₹398 crore in liquor vend auction||A liquor vend in Dhanas has fetched the highest ever bid of ₹11.55 crore in the auction held for the 2021-22 fiscal by the Chandigarh excise and taxation department.The previous record was also set by the same vend in 2019-2020, when it fetched ₹10.78 crore.All four vends with top bids — Dhanas, Sector 61, Mauli village and Sector 47 — are located near the city’s border with neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab, where liquor prices are much higher.“Traditionally, liquor vends located in proximity to Mohali and Panchkula have fetched higher bids as vendors expect to earn more in these areas, as residents of the two satellite cities tend to come to Chandigarh to buy cheaper liquor,” said a department official, requesting anonymity. All four vends have been bought by a single firm – Kler Wines.The department had received 162 bids electronically for 80 liquor vends put on auction with a combined reserve price of ₹317.31 crore. It earned ₹398.04 crore in the form of licence fees, registering 25% earning over the reserve price. It also received ₹5.67 crore as participation fee.Originally, the department had offered 96 vends, up from 94 in 2020-2021, but it didn’t receive any bid for 16 vends.“For the 16 leftover vends, the tendering process will begin on March 22 and the bids will be opened on March 30,” said the official.To curb the menace of cartelisation and monopolistic practices, a single entity of firms/companies/individuals will be entitled to allotment of up to a maximum of 10 vends.“An analysis of the successful bidders revealed that no single entity got more than eight vends,” said the official.In the Chandigarh Excise Policy 2021-2022, the administration decided to keep the licence fee and excise duty on beer and wine unchanged. On the Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), the duty has been increased by 6%, which is expected to increase the prices of popular liquor brands by 10-12%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-excise-dept-earns-398-crore-in-liquor-vend-auction-101616182048119.html
20-03-2021||Other||SGPC member Kuldeep Tohra loses ₹1.5 crore to scamsters||Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member Kuldeep Kaur Tohra and her husband Harmel Singh Tohra, a former cabinet minister, lost ₹1.5 crore to cyber fraudsters, police said on Friday. Kuldeep Kaur is daughter of late Akali stalwart Gurcharan Singh Tohra. As per the complaint submitted by Kuldeep’s son Harinderpal Singh Tohra, she had got a phone call in 2017 and was told that shares of various companies in the name of her parents were lying unclaimed. “They asked details and assured that the shares worth several crores would be transferred to her account,” the complainant mentioned. The accused continued to dupe the couple for the next couple of years by taking security money and processing charges to release shares. As the couple discussed the issue with Harinderpal, he approached the police. He said the accused had asked his parents to deposit money in 13 different accounts, claiming that the process will be completed after taking approval from higher authorities as the monetary value of shares was quite high.Following the complaint, the police registered an FIR against 12 persons, four of whom have been identified as Sagar, Rahul Kumar of Bijnor, Manoj of Meerut, Chandani of New Delhi. The police have started investigation and have been taking details of the bank accounts to track the fraudsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-member-kuldeep-tohra-loses-1-5-crore-to-scamsters-101616181987443.html
20-03-2021||Bangalore||Blame game continues amid Covid-19 surge in Bengaluru||The curse of March has returned to haunt India's IT capital a year after the very first Covid-19 infection which was reported on March 8 last year in Bengaluru. The city seems to be witnessing a reverse in the decline of its Covid-19 cases and triggering the onset of a possible second wave of the deadly virus.For the first time in months, the total number of cases in Bengaluru crossed the four-figure mark as the IT hub recorded 1,037 cases and six fatalities in the last 24 hours on Thursday due to Covid-19. The spike takes the total number of active cases to 8,623 of the total 12,067 across the state.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city's civic body, on Friday morning, was quick to point the blame on common areas like party halls, gyms and swimming pools within large apartment complexes as one of the main reasons for the spike."According to our analysis, when people mingle here, cases spread. We are sending a proposal to the government to close these facilities," N Manjunath Prasad, the BBMP commissioner told reporters on Friday.He also hinted at the possibility of halving the seating capacities in cinema halls that was met with stiff resistance and denial by chief minister BS Yediyurappa.There have been at least two big-ticket Kannada movie releases in recent weeks during which people were seen dancing outside theatres with no semblance of any social distancing or wearing masks.Though Karnataka was one of the first states to implement a lockdown when there were barely any cases, it was also among the fastest to relax restrictions when the caseload was at its highest to allow resuming of economic activities and bringing in some much-needed revenues to the cash-starved state.This economic consideration has remained the biggest priority for Karnataka despite the sharp spike in cases over the last fortnight. The state government has also put the onus of containing the spread on the people while turning a blind eye on its own shortcomings like contact tracing, surveillance and preventing large gatherings across the state and its capital, Bengaluru.The government argues that it cannot do the job alone and requires active cooperation from its citizens. But the same government has refused to rein in large political gatherings and meets where masks and social distancing are rarely followed, let alone enforced, experts and activists said.One senior government official attributed the rise to people failing to maintain isolation requirements within the households."Contact tracing and tracking have been thrown in the wind. All this remains on paper but on the ground, very few of such protocols are being followed," said a private medical professional, requesting not to be named. He added that authorities have been working for over a year and fatigue factor appears to have set in. "We cannot take the same approach we took last year again," he said.According to government data, there are 4.46 contacts (primary and secondary) per patient across the state.But the data does not support the number of people in active quarantine.Multiple people who were infected do not recall the BBMP or any other agency getting in touch to get details of travel history or trace their contacts.Medical practitioners said that the government will take all precautions and follow the protocols of any Covid-19 positive person who has got any media attention. The practitioners were referring to a Shivamogga-based individual who was tested positive for the South African variant of the virus.While the government and the BBMP continue to blame the spike on people coming from neighbouring states like Maharashtra as "spreaders", it has so far refused to change its approach and bolster efforts into rectifying faltering contact tracing, surveillance, raising awareness nor enforcing safety protocols in public spaces, according to multiple people including medical practitioners.Bengaluru accounts for 8,623 active cases out of the total 12,067 across the state.CM Yediyurappa, his cabinet colleagues and officials have attributed the spike to the rise in cases in border districts. However, the four main border districts - Belagavi, Dakshina Kannada, Kalaburagi and Bidar - (referred to by the chief minister) account for 1,266 active cases.Karnataka was among the first to go in for a lockdown last March when there were barely any cases in the state but decided to relax restrictions when the number of positives was in the thousands. While Karnataka took pride in its efforts to keep the cases down till mid-2020, it rarely looked within for the exponential rise in the second half of last year.Karnataka has tried to double its vaccination effort as a measure to contain the spread. But technical glitches like the app crashing, inaccurate data gathering and other problems, have added to the challenges of the state government. Doctors said that there used to be several instances of names being repeated, the app not registering the vaccination that impacts the second dose, among other problems.The BBMP has denied any technical glitches, stating that the hospitals are responsible for data entry."We are seeing more cases but not a rise in serious cases," Dr HM Prasanna of Pristine Hospitals and president-elect of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/blame-game-continues-amid-covid-19-surge-in-bengaluru-101616181659885.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Key challenges of conducting SSC, HSC exams during the pandemic||The HSC (Class 12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, 2021; SSC (Class 10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20With nearly 33 lakh students appearing for the exams every year, the HSC (Class 12) and SSC (Class 10) exams are conducted across 9 divisions in Maharashtra every year. With the rising number of Covid-19 infections in the state and the resultant restrictions, parents and schools are now raising concerns about the conduct of these exams in the middle of all these challenges. The state government and the education department are working on an initiative titled #ParikshaKoTaiyar to make board exams smooth and safe for students. As part of the initiative, the state board is likely to announce certain guidelines on the conduct of exams this year. After talking to experts and various stakeholders including schools, students and parents, HT has arrived at some of the key concerns that need the attention of the government and the agencies to ensure that the exam process is smooth and stress-free for students.Provisions for students who cannot take their examsExperts have pointed out the need to have several options for students who might have to miss their exams due to various reasons such as catching the infection themselves, being put into quarantine, staying in containment zones where there are a high number of Covid-19 cases being some possible reasons. “During the IGCSE exams in the country that concluded recently, a student tested positive after having attempted the initial papers. The board thankfully had a provision in place and the child was marked based on an average drawn from the marks in the papers he attempted. The state board needs such a mechanism,” said an educationist who has been helping the government with suggestions regarding precautions to be taken. Teachers said that while isolating a child and allowing him/her to write the paper in a nearby centre away from the other kids is an option, the child’s mental health can take a toll during such a period and thus he/she should be allowed another chance at the exams.Overcrowding at the centresEvery year, a large number of parents assemble outside various schools and junior colleges across the state to drop their children off at the exam venue. Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board, said that such overcrowding has to be avoided this time. “A good solution to this can be allotted a child’s school as the exam centre and swapping supervisors from nearby schools to ensure free and fair exams. This way, parents won’t have to worry as the children can travel to their schools alone,” she added.Anticipating rescheduling/cancellationsWhile the state board has scheduled the HSC and SSC exams in April and May, the government needs to have a backup plan, in case there is a further spike in the cases and the exams have to be rescheduled or cancelled. To begin with, the state government needs to ensure that such possibilities are communicated to the Central agencies like the National Testing Agency (NTA) which conducts the JEE and NEET exams for Class 12 students. “While the state can change its schedule if need be and grant concessions to students depending on the situation, timetables of national level entrance exams like JEE and NEET have already been set. Similarly, other boards like CBSE and ICSE also have their exams planned. The state government should have excellent coordination with the Centre and the various exam bodies to ensure that state kids do not lag in their counterparts from other states and boards,” said a member of the government-appointed committee on the condition of anonymity.Travel restrictionsA large number of students aspiring for their board exams especially in a city like Mumbai travel by train and other public transport like buses to reach their exam centres. The state board should communicate with authorities like railways and the BEST to ensure that students can travel seamlessly during exams. Some experts also suggested tweaking office hours for the period of exams to reduce congestion on roads during the exams. “Especially for Class 12 students whose colleges are far from home, travelling during the pandemic can cause anxiety, as they have not taken a train or a bus for the last one year. Parents are also worried about this and we hope that the government allows parents and students to travel on the trains and buses throughout the day during the exams,” said Madhura Kale, a parent from Malad.Last-minute centre cancellationsIn case a few centres from the list of pre-decided centres by the board get cancelled, the board needs to have a backup option for more. “For instance, if an area is declared as a containment zone, there might be two-three centres in the zone. Where will 200-300 students from these centres go at the last minute? These provisions need to be made in advance by increasing the number of centres,” said an official from the department.Sanitisation and safety protocolsIn addition to the challenges involved in ensuring social distancing and hygiene at the exam venues, experts are worried about the anxieties associated with wearing a mask throughout the exam. “Students cannot write three-hour-long papers with masks on, at all times. Some concessions need to be made along with ensuring the safety of students at the same time. Similarly, they should be allowed to take a water break and toilet breaks as and when needed,” said a teacher.Education department extends support to children with special needsExtending support to children with special needs (CWSN) who are set to write their Class 10 and 12 board exams this year, the education department has urged people to volunteer as writers. Interested volunteers can register themselves at https://www.research.net/r/readerwriterbank by March 31. The state board has also announced a list of counsellors who will man helplines for CWSN in the month of April and May when SSC and HSC exams are scheduled. Each of the 9 board divisions has a dedicated helpline where students can call and get their issues resolved. “During these tough times, it is important to ensure that CWSN does not suffer if they fail to get a writer or a centre not favourable. Officials should ensure that children get the necessary help and that no child is deprived of the opportunities he/she deserves,” states the circular issued by the state board recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-key-challenges-of-conducting-ssc-hsc-exams-during-the-pandemic-101616181867569.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||HC bars hike in school fees during pandemic in Punjab, Haryana||The Punjab and Haryana high court has barred schools from collecting enhanced fees for the academic session 2020-2021 from the students in Punjab and Haryana in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak and pandemic-induced lockdown. The high court bench of Chief Justice RS Jha and Justice Arun Palli on Friday adopted an order passed by the Supreme Court in February in respect of Rajasthan schools. Multiple lawyers associated with the case confirmed the development. However, detailed order is awaited. The order was passed in a petition pending before the HC since last year on the issue of charging of fee during Covid-19 outbreak in both the states. The fee collection matter of Chandigarh schools is being adjudicated separately. As per the apex court’s order passed on February 8, the management/school can collect fees for the academic year 2019-2020 as well as 2020-2021 from the students, equivalent to fees amount notified for the academic year 2019- 2020, in six monthly instalments commencing from March 5, 2021 and ending on August 5, 2021. However, the apex court order does not bar collection of increased fee for the academic year 2021-2022. The schools have been asked not to debar any student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of non-payment of fees, arrears, including the instalments and further not to withhold the results of the examinations of any student. The apex court had also said that where the parents have difficulty in remitting the fee, they can approach school authorities, who will consider such cases “sympathetically”. The SC had also directed that in respect of classes 10 and 12 exams, the school managements would not withhold the name of any student on the ground of non-payment of fees. All outstanding dues towards unit cost payable to respective unaided schools by the government should be settled within one month or by March 31, the apex court had directed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-bars-hike-in-school-fees-during-pandemic-in-punjab-haryana-101616181811044.html

After a virtual meeting with the Prime Minister on Wednesday, UT administrator VP Singh Bandore had directed the health department to ramp up testing and also told police to ensure strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour. Meanwhile, UT adviser Manoj Parida had ruled out any “knee-jerk reaction”, such as night curfew.Compulsory testing of those without masks in MohaliMohali city continues to report bulk of the cases in the district, with 203 surfacing on Friday. The district’s total has climbed to 22,912, with number of active cases at 1,868 (8.2%).

Meanwhile, with 62 patients being discharged on Friday, the number of those recovered climbed to 20,636, though recovery rate has slipped to 90%. Acting tough on violators, the Mohali administration on Friday decided that people found without masks in public places will have to undergo compulsory testing for Covid-19 besides paying ₹500 fine. Deputy commissioner Girish Daylan said that 62 such people were challaned at the busy Phase 3B2 market on Friday.

He said even shopkeepers have been warned of action if they do not direct their customers to follow the norms. The state government had on Thursday extended the night curfew in Mohali by two hours. The curfew is being imposed from 9pm to 5am, said Dayalan. Apart from movement for essential and emergency services throughout the night, home delivery of food will be allowed till 10pm. Employees of private establishments involving night duties will also be allowed to move on the production of ID cards issued by their companies. Three govt schoolkids among those positive in P’kula Three students of a government school in Pinjore are among 166 people tested positive in Panchkula district.The total has reached 11,740, with 618 (5.3%) cases active, up from 124 at the beginning of the month. The cases have been on the rise since March 1, in what local health officials are calling the “second wave” of the pandemic. While 10,973 (93.5%) patients have been cured, 149 have died.The government urban polyclinic centre in Pinjore had randomly tested 174 government school students on Thursday, whose reports came on Friday. The three found positive are students of Class 9. They were home quarantined after being picked up from the morning assembly. Random testing of other schoolchildren is also being done, said officials. Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja in an order reiterated that wearing of masks is mandatory in public places and any violation will invite ₹500 fine. The order also specified that non-payment of the fine will lead to the registration of a case under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. The DC has designated clock education officers of Pinjore, Barwala, Raipur Rani and Morni along with sub-inspectors, inspector, chief inspector and station supervisor of Haryana Roadways as the officers for implementing the order. The DC also held a meeting with representatives of various religious, social and non-governmental organisations and appealed to them for active contribution towards the vaccination drive. It has been decided to organise mega camps every Monday and Tuesday for senior citizens and comorbid people across 49 government and private vaccination centres in the district. Of 1.35 lakh senior citizens, 35,000 have been vaccinated so far, and the administration targets to cover the remaining by the end of this month. Elderly man dies soon after getting jabbed in PinjoreA senior citizen died within minutes of getting the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in Pinjore on Friday. The health authorities said the preliminary postmortem reported stated heart attack as the cause of death. The deceased, 71, was a resident of Model Town in Pinjore.

20-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Power firms get notice over Sanjay Raut’s flight trips||Registrar of Companies (ROC) has slapped notices on MSEB Holding Company Limited (MSEBHCL) and Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (Mahagenco), asking them to clarify about the expenditure incurred for the number of air trips of energy minister Nitin Raut by chartered flights last year. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has criticised Raut for allegedly high expenditure on his official bungalow too.Raut has rubbished the allegations saying the expenditure incurred for the renovation of the bungalow — Parnakuti — was from the funds allocated to the public works department. He also said the air trips were well within the rulebook of the power companies, and the trips were for official works as a minister and chairman of these companies.ROC has, on March 5, sought clarification from the two power companies for their spending on Raut’s air trips. According to information obtained under Right To Information (RTI) Act by Ravikumar Vemulakonda, MSEBHCL paid ₹14.45 lakh for two trips and Mahagenco paid ₹29.10 lakh for three trips by Raut between Mumbai, Delhi, Aurangbad and Hyderabad during lockdown last year. Vemulakonda, based on the RTI reply, lodged a complaint with ROC for action against the companies. In view of this, ROC issued a notice signed by assistant company registrar, stating, “You (two power companies) are directed to furnish your comments/clarification on each of the allegations made in the complaint with documentary evidence within 10 days. On failing to respond, penal action will be taken as contemplated under Companies Act, 2013 against companies and its directors.” Maharashtra BJP’s media head Vishwas Pathak alleged that Raut has spent huge amount on renovation of his official bungalow at Malabar Hill as well as his office at Mantralaya. “The state government has been disconnecting the power supply of farmers and poor people for the non-payment of bills. The state government has been citing financial crisis faced by the power companies for the disconnection, but on the other hand, the minister has been spending lavishly on his bungalow and office,” he said. Pathak also alleged that the minister spent more than ₹1 crore on his air trips, though two companies gave the information about ₹43 lakh borne by them, while two others have refused to reveal the payments. Dinesh Waghmare, principal secretary, energy department, said the four power companies have received the ROC notices and they have been replying to them accordingly. “MSEBHCL has already replied while Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company will comply with it in next two days. There is nothing wrong in these companies footing the bills of air travel for the minister, who is chairman of the companies. The entities have been formed under the Companies Act like any other private company, and have every right to bear such bills of the air travel of their chairman,” he said.Raut said, “I was operated upon for heart ailment in February and had three trips from Nagpur to Mumbai by road. My doctor strictly warned me to avoid it, saying it could prove to be fatal. After it, I travelled by chartered flights for cabinet meetings and important meetings of the power companies as their chairman. As the chairman of the company, I can use flight made available by them, and for it, there is no need to have permission by the chief minister. Power supply is an essential service and it was our duty to ensure uninterrupted supply of the power during lockdown, when commercial flights were not in operations” he said.While speaking about the expenditure on bungalow, Raut said, “The expenditure done by the public works department on my bungalow is as per set rules and earmarked budget for the official accommodations of ministers. The renovation work has not been completed even 15 months after the swearing-in because of the Covid-19 lockdown. I had been living in a rented house in Worli for months. Only three rooms of the bungalow have been completed so far. The BJP should also question the expenditure done on the bungalow in possession of the Leader of Opposition (Devendra Fadnavis) and who borne the expenditure.”Box Raut says no to the post of speakerWhile the speculations are rife that energy minister Nitin Raut could be made Assembly speaker and replaced as minister by Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole by the party leadership, Raut said he was not interested in any such shuffle.“I had said no to accept the post of Assembly after formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in November 2019. It was only after that, I was on the list of two Congress ministers who took oath on November 28 in the first phase. I am not aware of any reshuffle in state cabinet. Final decisions are taken by party leadership,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-power-firms-get-notice-over-sanjay-raut-s-flight-trips-101616181807512.html

So far, the highest number of cases reported in a single day was 2,877 on Thursday, this week, and before that on October 7 when the city reported 2,848 Covid-19 cases. Mumbai also reported 10 deaths due to Covid-19 on Friday, taking the toll to 11,569, and a case fatality rate of 3.2%. So far, Mumbai has reported a total of 3,55,914 cases of which 18,850 are active as of Friday.Addressing yet another peak in the Covid-19 cases in the city, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday decided to intensify Covid-19 testing in the city from the present 25,000 to 50,000 tests and accelerate vaccination. At a meeting with heads of all hospitals in the city on Friday afternoon via teleconferencing, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal gave the administration various instructions on the management of Covid-19 patients, hospital bed management and vaccination.BMC will now carry out rapid antigen testing before entry at all crowded public places, such as malls, supermarkets, municipal markets. Citizens will be allowed to enter the premises only if they test negative. BMC will also conduct rapid antigen tests of inbound passengers of long-distance commute at railway stations, and bus depots.Mumbai on Thursday conducted 24,542 Covid-19 tests, with a positivity rate of 12.4%. On Wednesday, 23,402 tests were conducted with a single day positivity rate of 12.2%.Chahal on Friday directed the administration to accelerate immunisation by vaccinating 45 lakh citizens in 45 days, at the rate of one lakh citizens per day. Each private hospital is required to vaccinate 1,000 beneficiaries per day. BMC has also appealed to the Central government for permission to increase the number of private hospitals carrying out vaccination in the city from the present 59 to 80.In a statement issued on Friday, BMC said, “Around 59 private hospitals act as vaccination centres in the city at present. Despite this, these 59 hospitals can vaccinate around 4,000 beneficiaries per day. Each private hospital has been directed to take efforts to vaccinate up to 1,000 beneficiaries per day.”Considering the lifestyle of Mumbaiites and working hours, BMC has asked private hospitals to examine if they can operate between 9am and 9pm every day, and if possible operate the centres 24*7. Hospitals have also been directed to activate all Covid-19 beds as per the number of beds that were available at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak. Presently, there are 12,738 beds for serious moderate and complicated Covid-19 patients, 720 beds for mild or asymptomatic patients, 1,527 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 961 ventilator beds, and 8,352 beds with oxygen points.On Friday, 42,740 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 34,313 were given their first dose, and 8,427 were given their second dose.

A total of 373,189 senior citizens have been vaccinated so far, 55320 citizens above age 45 years have been vaccinated so far. There are 92 active vaccination centres in Mumbai.In the BMC statement issued on Friday, Chahal said, “Although the mortality rate is lower than the previous period, vaccination is important to reduce the overall mortality rate to zero, and reduce the severity of the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-3-063-new-cases-bmc-to-intensify-vaccination-101616181567575.html

The data is being shared with DM of other states including Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.The TTE boarded the Pushpak Express from Lucknow railway station and alighted the train at Bhopal station on March 16. Later, he boarded the same outstation train the next day and travelled back to Lucknow from Bhopal. He fell sick soon after.The TTE was then sent to Badshahnagar railway hospital in Lucknow where he and his wife tested positive.“The TTE and his wife tested positive. We have also conducted tests of five other people who were his close contact. List of passengers travelling on board the train has been provided to the DM.” said Pankaj Kumar Singh, chief public relation officer, North Eastern Railway.Railway authorities have also started thermal screening and testing of their personnel travelling onboard outstation trains.“We are setting up booths and are testing our personnel as well.” said a senior railway official.The Brihanmumbai Corporation (BMC) conducts thermal screenings on railway terminus of passengers arriving in the city from Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Goa and Rajasthan.

20-03-2021||Mumbai||Last year’s experience will guide us better this time in Dharavi: Mumbai civic body official||After a gap of six months, Dharavi—Asia’s largest slum, is again witnessing a surge in cases, due to the second pandemic wave. To curb the spread, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to conduct rigorous testing, contact tracing and isolation. The rise in cases has raised quite a concern among the slum dwellers, most of those are migrants from neighbouring states who returned to the city with the relaxation of the lockdown. The volunteers who have been working since March 2020, are ‘overwhelmed and exhausted.Dharavi spreads over a 2.5 sq km area which has a population density of 227,136 per sq km. The overly populated slum consists of small rooms measuring 100 sq ft that houses seven-eight people. With its history as a breeding ground for dis­eases, on April 1, 2020, when the area recorded its first Covid-19 positive case, it threatened to become a super-spreader for Mumbai’s two crore population.However, after months of fighting, Dharavi won the war against the virus. Till March 19, it had registered 4,357 cases, far fewer than its neighbouring areas, Dadar (5,383) and Mahim (5,294). Its average daily cases came down from 43 in May 2020 to six in January 2021. Dharavi had not reported new cases only four times in January, this year – January 22, 26, 27 and 31 – and on February 2. It was also believed that herd immunity contributed to decreasing of the cases.But with the start of the second wave, Dharavi has again come into the spotlight. On Thursday, Dharavi reported 30 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily rise since last September. On Friday, it recorded 29 new cases.In a meeting held at the headquarters of BMC on Friday, several guidelines and instructions have been issued. Most importantly, the focus has been paid to rigorous testing. Officials claim their experience of last year will help them to fight better this year.At present, daily, BMC is conducting around 500 tests in Dharavi, which will now be increased to 1,000 to identify the carriers at the earliest. “For one infected person, we have been instructed to test 22 of his/her close contacts. Along with this, we will conduct rampant testing in crowded places and the factories,” said Kiran Dighavkar, ward officer of G-North that covers Dharavi.Almost 70% of the patients are asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, as per BMC.BMC is also in the process to start a vaccination centre in Dharavi to inoculate the elderly above 60 years and the public with comorbidities above 45 years. “We are trying to bring the facility close to the public’s door for faster vaccination,” he added. Private doctors will be responsible for the vaccination.At present, Dharavi has 300 institutional quarantine centres where hotels, lodges, schools, stadiums among others are converted into isolation centres. BMC has plans to add 100 more centres in the initial phase. “Earlier, we were sending a few patients to BKC jumbo but now, we have decided to increase the institutional quarantine centres as a precautionary measure if the cases increase further,” said Dighavkar.In October 2020, BMC along with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) released a data of serosurvey conducted in R-North, M-West and F-North wards of Mumbai. The report revealed seroprevalence in 45% of the slum of the wards. But Dharavi wasn’t added to it.When asked about it, “There was a belief that Dharavi had attained herd immunity considering the infection rate slowed down. But now, it has been proved wrong, otherwise, cases wouldn’t have increased. There is a need to do a serosurvey in Dharavi as well to gauge the spread of the virus,” said a senior officer. Last year when the national lockdown was declared hundreds of migrants who reside in Dharavi lost their livelihood and went to their natives. With the relaxation of the lockdown in September, they came back to Mumbai with a new hope. But with the rise in cases, the slum dwellers are getting concerned about losing their jobs again. To them, it seems like a ‘Deja Vu.Priya Sudha, 31 lives in a small 10*10 sq feet chawl in Dharavi with her three children, in-laws and husband. She works as a domestic maid in Shivajinagar. Last year, when the lockdown was declared, she lost her job along with her husband who worked at a tea stall. With no option in hand, she had to go back with her children to her native in Tamil Nadu in June.“It was impossible for us to feed so many people without a job. So, I went to my native with my children while my husband remained in Dharavi with his parents. I came back in December and started working again,” said Subha.As cases are increasing in Dharavi, she fears that her employer may fire her. “My employer who is diabetic knows that I stay in Dharavi, so they are quite concerned. Already many employers who have additional rooms are keeping their maids in-house to avoid any possible chance of infection from outside travel,” she said.Volunteers who are responsible for close contact tracing of infected patients are overwhelmed. They have been working since March 2020, when the first Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai.“After a lot of hard work, we were able to control the spread in the city. We thought it was over and I would be able to hug my children without worrying. But now again, I am sleeping in a separate room as I don’t want them to contract the infection from me,” said Sunita Gaikwad, who has been working as a volunteer in association with BMC. “It all seems like the last year when the pandemic started,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/last-year-s-experience-will-guide-us-better-this-time-in-dharavi-mumbai-civic-body-official-101616181148628.html

20-03-2021||Chandigarh||In March, only 732 fined for not wearing masks in Chandigarh||Despite a spike in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in the city, the drive against people not wearing masks seems to have slowed down as only 732 people have been challaned in March so far.With markets, malls and educational institutes opening, residents continue to move about in public places without the mandatory protective gear. But despite this, the police drive to challan those not wearing masks has lost its pace: in January, 2,578 challans were issued, which dipped to 1,368 in February and 732 in March.As per data available with the Chandigarh Police, the maximum number of challans were issued in July (5,929), followed by December (4,597).“Awareness campaigns and challaning drives made people comply with the rules. We have been continuing with the drive all through, but now we will intensify challaning. Our focus would be on crowded places like markets and tourist spots,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, UT.Fine fails to act as deterrentSince June last year, to date, the police have collected ₹1.28 crore as fine for not wearing masks. Police had collected ₹66.67 lakh till November 2020 from 14,357 violators. The challan for not wearing a mask was ₹500 till November, after which it was raised to ₹1,000 in December.From December till March, the police had collected ₹61.36 lakh as fine from 9,276 violators.Administrator directs police to intensify challaningActing on complaints pouring in of people moving around without masks and violating social distancing, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has directed the director general of police, Sanjay Baniwal, to intensify challaning in public places, eating houses and markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-march-only-732-fined-for-not-wearing-masks-in-chandigarh-101616181030672.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Panel pushes for shorter route from Chandigarh to airport||Reviving hopes for a shorter alternative route from the city to the Chandigarh International Airport, the parliamentary standing committee has asked the ministry of home affairs to take up the issue with the civil aviation and defence ministries on priority basis.Currently, residents have to take a 14.5-km detour through Mohali to reach the airport. The committee in its latest meeting with the UT administration had inquired about the progress made in the approach road to the airport.The administration informed the committee that earlier road distance from Tribune Chowk to the airport was 2.71 km. Now, the existing route from Tribune Chowk to the airport was 14.52 km through Punjab (Mohali), which was causing difficulty to the residents of Chandigarh as they have to cover more distance and spend more time to reach the Airport.Administration further informed, to cut short this road distance, certain options were proposed / deliberated, from time to time. One of the options was to connect the old and new terminal through an underpass below the existing runway.In the Chandigarh Master Plan (CMP) 2031, another proposal of road connectivity to the airport was given from Sector 48 (Purv Marg) through Jagatpura village, which will be approximately 4.7 km from Tribune chowk, thereby reducing the distance by about 10km from Tribune Chowk.For this proposal, land acquisition may be required in Punjab, so this needs to be done by the Punjab Government, the administration informed the committee.The Committee noted that the existing route from Tribune Chowk to the Chandigarh International Airport was causing unnecessary inconvenience to the residents of Chandigarh as they had to cover more distance and spend more time to reach the airport.Punjab had earlier junked underpassThe UT administration’s proposal to construct a tunnel for an alternative shorter route to the airport in Mohali was junked in the Northern Zonal Council meeting held in September 2019.The administration was pitching for the Centre’s help and contributions from Haryana and Punjab to construct the ₹1,200-crore underground tunnel connecting Chandigarh directly to the new airport terminal in Mohali.The proposed route was to cut down the distance for people commuting to the airport from Chandigarh and Panchkula by 10km. But both Haryana and Punjab hadn’t supported the proposal. This was also not agreed upon by the Air Force authorities.Committee recommendationsThe committee has recommended that the MHA may take up the matter with the ministries of civil aviation and defence on priority basis to connect the old and new terminals through an underpass below the existing runway to make it convenient for the people travelling through the airport.Alternatively, the committee has recommended that the MHA may coordinate with the government of Punjab for making provision of approximately 4.7-km road through Jagatpura village, which will reduce the distance to the airport by about 10 km, and will save the people coming from the city a lot of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panel-pushes-for-shorter-route-from-chandigarh-to-airport-101616180847483.html

The consortium included Corporation Bank (now Union Bank), State Bank of Hyderabad (now State Bank of India), Punjab National Bank, Punjab & Sindh Bank, UCO Bank, Syndicate Bank, Central Bank of India, Karur Vyasya Bank and JM Financial ARC.Searches at the premises of the accused and firm were conducted in Kangra, which led to recovery of incriminating documents, said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cbi-books-indian-technometal-company-for-alleged-555-cr-fraud-101616180787607.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Cong demands CBI probe into Mandi MP’s death; govt awaits Delhi Police’s report||After leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri raised a point of order during the budget session to demand a CBI probe into Mandi member of parliament Ram Swaroop Sharma’s death, the chief minister on Thursday said the government will take steps to have the death probed once the Delhi Police completes its investigation.CM Jai Ram Thakur said the Delhi Police had registered a case and collected evidence from the spot. “In such a situation, we should not be hasty,” he said, condemning speculations on Sharma’s death, particularly on social media. He said the social media posts on Sharma’s death were ‘unfortunate’. “Such comments have perturbed the family, people close to him and party members have raised concern,” he said. Calling Sharma’s death a huge loss to the state, Thakur said, “The family is in shock. I have met them, and they said Sharma was not keeping well and had been undergoing treatment for certain ailments.”The CM said ill-health seems to be the reason behind Sharma’s death. He said Sharma had gone for treatment to Kayakalp Institute of Naturopathy at Palampur but had lost a lot of weight.He said Sharma’s death should not be politicised. “We should not jump to conclusions and patiently wait for the investigation and postmortem report.” Earlier, Agnihotri, who had raised a point of order soon after the question hour, had said, “No suicide note has been recovered and people are surprised as to how a person who took the Covid-19 vaccine jab four days ago can take such an extreme step.” He said when the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput can be investigated, then why an MP’s suicide cannot be probed. “Sharma represented 17 lakh people of Himachal in the Lok Sabha. People have the right to know what led him to take such an extreme step . Sharma was a very popular leader,” Agnihotri said.“When his son and the people of the state are seeking an investigation, one should be initiated,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj said, “The CM and Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh have met the family. If the need arises and the family wishes, the government will demand a CBI inquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-demands-cbi-probe-into-mandi-mp-s-death-govt-awaits-delhi-police-s-report-101616180427627.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai housing societies reluctant on imposing restrictions||Despite the surge in Covid-19 cases, the cooperative housing societies in Mumbai are not imposing restrictions as they did a year ago when the pandemic had just started.The office-bearers of the housing society say that since there is no lockdown, imposing restrictions is not possible, in such circumstances.This, even though, Mumbai on Friday recorded 3,063 cases, which is the highest one-day spike, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.Last year societies across Mumbai had barred maids from entering the buildings, disallowed residents from moving out of their houses freely, arranged essential items for them within the society premises and had also curtailed the delivery persons from entering. “The situation, a year back was different as people were scared of the virus. Today there is no such fear and residents will resist any restrictions,” said Dhawal Shah, chairman, Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Citizens’ Association. Also, he said, since the elections of the housing societies would probably be held later in this year, many office bearers would not like to agonise the society members, who are the voters.Ashok Gardens society at Sewri which has 542 apartments is adopting a wait and watch policy. “We have a backup plan ready. We are asking the residents to be cautious of this situation and they are cooperating very well,” said Captain Prakash Correa, secretary of the society. “We agree that complacency has set in all across, but one needs to realise that the managing committees are imposing curbs for the benefit of their members,” he added. While many residents initially adhered to the rules last year, there was resistance after some months, resulting in friction in many societies. The problem was the entry of maids, which grabbed headlines and managing committees were reluctant to allow them, forcing the state government to intervene.State minister for cooperation Balasaheb Patil said managing committees of housing societies should not impose arbitrary curbs on their residents. “People are moving out of their homes and there is movement all around. The societies should not impose their restrictions on them,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-mumbai-housing-societies-reluctant-on-imposing-restrictions-101616180367416.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Lockdown an option, says Maharashtra CM||A day after Maharashtra clocked its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said lockdown was an option before the government, but he expected more cooperation and Covid-appropriate behaviour from people. Thackeray, who was on a tour of Nandurbar district on Friday, appealed to people to get vaccinated without any apprehension or fear. He also said the Centre has assured enough vaccine stock to the state. With the Covid cases increasing daily, the state is not looking at a lockdown at this stage and will set up micro-containment zones in areas where the number of cases is higher. “The threat of coronavirus has increased again. It surpassed the peak that we touched in September. One option is lockdown, but I am expecting cooperation from people, like they did during the previous lockdown… At many places, people have started to wear masks,” the CM said while speaking to reporters in Dhadgaon, Nandurbar district. Even as the Covid-19 cases have shot up rapidly over the past few weeks, Thackeray said they have not been informed by the Centre about a mutation in the virus strain. “We had [Covid-19] cases with foreign strain, but the number was limited. However, we have asked the Centre if currently there is any different genome spreading [in Maharashtra]. But so far, we have not got any information. They have not confirmed to us if it is a different strain,” Thackeray said. Health secretary Pradeep Vyas was accompanying Thackeray as he took review of the Covid and vaccination situation in the interior areas of the predominantly tribal district. In an apparent response to Union minister Prakash Javadekar, who claimed that the state government has mismanaged its vaccination drive, Thackeray, without naming the minister, said, “There is some misleading information that [vaccine] stock is lying around, but it is not so. It is kept based on the timetable for the next few days.” While speaking in the north Maharashtra district, Thackeray appealed to people to get inoculated. He added that now the people have some “shield” to defend themselves against the coronavirus unlike last year. “I appeal to people, who are eligible, to get vaccinated on their own… if there is any fear in taking the vaccine, it should be removed. Even after taking the shot, we need to follow Covid-appropriate behavior of masking, sanitising and social distancing. The Centre has assured us that there will not be any shortfall in availability of vaccine doses. We have stock enough for the next five to seven days, and then we expect to get another batch of vaccines,” he said. He added that there have been some Covid-19 cases where people have been infected after vaccination. However, the vaccine reduces the intensity of the virus and doesn’t become fatal, he said, stressing on the importance of getting vaccinated. Thackeray also directed district officials to give all facilities to people in the interior parts of Nandurbar. “Urban areas have the medical facilities, but it is important that people in the rural and interior areas get proper facilities,” Thackeray said after a review of the situation in the district. Nandurbar added 424 new cases on Friday and had 2,442 active cases in the district. The chief minister also directed authorities to prepare a tourism development plan for Tornamal, a hill station located in the Satpura range in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lockdown-an-option-says-maharashtra-cm-101616179707349.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Year after virus outbreak, HP’s patient zero struggles to get life back on track||A year after contracting the novel coronavirus infection, Himachal’s patient zero is still struggling to get life back on track. Early in 2020, the man had been working as a chef in Singapore when the virus swept across the world consuming lives and jobs in its wake. The man, who lost his job, returned home on March 18 and became one the two first positive cases in Himachal Pradesh on March 20, 2020. A native of Lunj village in Shahpur sub-division, the 33-year-old was discharged from the hospital on March 29, 2020 after recovery. However, life seemed to turn on its head once he returned home — he and his family were ostracised by the village people, nobody would talk to them and shopkeepers refused to sell them their wares. The situation became so grave that the administration had to intervene. “Today, I am jobless. Efforts to find a new job have not yielded any results. Now, I am trying to build my life bit-by-bit by starting a new catering business,” said the former Covid patient, who recently welcomed his son. Upset by the harsh treatment meted out to him by the community, he has chosen to work away from home. Ask him if people still discriminate against his family, he says things have normalised. “People do jeer at me, but I have stopped taking this seriously,” he says, adding that the reason he faced ostracisation was that people had panicked in those early days of the outbreak as not much was known about the virus and misinformation abound. “Hopefully, things will get back to normal. This pandemic will be over, and I will get a new job,” he says. Resurgence of Covid cases Virus cases that had begun to reduce at the beginning of the year have witnessed resurgence in the hill-state. The surge began in the last week of February. Himachal has recorded 1,743 new infections till March 18, a rise of over 57% as compared to February when 1,109 cases were reported in the state.

20-03-2021||Lucknow||UP has over 20% of India’s old vehicles||More than 20% of India’s total old vehicles that may qualify for the Centre’s newly unveiled scrappage policy are in Uttar Pradesh alone, people dealing with the issue in the transport department here revealed.The policy seeks to offer incentives to people who opt to get their personal/private vehicles older than 20 years or commercial vehicles older than 15 years scrapped. “In UP alone, there are more than 21 lakh such vehicles which is around 20% of the total 1 crore such vehicles identified in the entire country even as more than 50 lakh more such vehicles in UP will become eligible for the policy after five years,” a senior transport department official said.The Central government on Thursday rolled out the vehicle scrappage policy that was first announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech in a bid to give a push to the automobile industry as well as reduce pollution on roads.As per the new policy, commercial vehicles will be de-registered after 15 years and private or personal vehicles will be de-registered after 20 years, if found unfit or they fail to get a fresh registration certificate or in case of a failure to renew the registration certificate. The policy, at the same time, also offers several incentives and discounts for replacing old vehicles with new ones.Under the current rules, all personal and commercial vehicles are registered for 15 and 10 years, respectively, and have to seek registration after every five years thereafter.The transport department’s latest report, accessed by HT, shows that there are more than 21.23 lakh non-transport (personal/private) and transport (commercial vehicles) that are older than 20 years and 15 years respectively.Of them, around 19.20 lakh are personal/private vehicles alone. Commercial vehicles in this category constitute only a little more than 2.35 lakh.The report further shows that the largest number of personal vehicles that are older than 20 years are registered in Lucknow (about 3.23 lakh) only. The other UP cities with a sizeable number of such vehicles are Kanpur (1.87 lakh), Varanasi (1.32 lakh), Aligarh (95,600), Ghaziabad (80,000) and Prayagraj (75,500). The number of commercial vehicles older than 15 years is also the highest in Lucknow at 14,200 followed by Kanpur (11,200), Prayagraj (10,300) and Varanasi (10,100). Another data available with the department reveals the total number of personal/private vehicles (as on December 31, 2020) that had completed 15 years of age from the date of their first registration and needed fresh registration for next five years stood at around 50 lakh.“This only means that all these 50 lakh vehicles also will become eligible for the voluntary or compulsory scrappage policy five years from now,” the official said.The state government, he said, may soon issue a notification as a follow-up to the Centre’s announcement of the vehicle scrappage policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-has-over-20-of-india-s-old-vehicles-101616179586651.html
20-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dharavi reports 29 new cases on Friday||In tow with the trend of a spurt in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Dharavi on Friday recorded 29 new cases. On Thursday, it had recorded 30 new Covid-19 cases in a single day, for the first time since September. The total number of cases in Dharavi now stands at 4,357. However, there are 72 active cases in the slum-pocket in south Mumbai, and a total of 316 deaths have been reported so far.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now decided to start a vaccination centre in Dharavi from Monday, aiming to vaccinate 1,000 beneficiaries per day. It will be started at the Urban Health Centre inside the slum, with five booths, each with a capacity to vaccinate 200 people per day. It will cater to senior citizens and citizens above the age of 45 years who have co-morbidities.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward with jurisdiction over Dharavi said, “Around 1.75 lakh residents of Dharavi qualify as beneficiaries as per data collected by BMC during its My Family My Responsibility Drive. Booths will be equipped with walk-in registration facilities. Many residents of Dharavi are not aware of how to register for a vaccine shot, or if they qualify. So, the BMC will help them in all these aspects.”Also, non-governmental organisations are being roped in to set up booths at various places in Dharavi to help with the registration process. BMC has asked private medical practitioners from the Mahim Dadar Medical Practitioners Association to help with medical certificates to those with comorbidities, above age 45 years.Dighavkar said, “After the My Family My Responsibility survey, BMC has data of whom all have comorbidities, so we will be making their medical certificates.”Commenting on the spurt in cases in the G/North ward, Dighavkar said, “Though the number of cases is rising in Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi due to proactive testing and screening, we are detecting cases at an early stage for treatment. As per data, 70% of the cases are asymptomatic. Casualties are very low.”In January G/North ward recorded a total of eight deaths, while Dharavi reported zero deaths in January. In February G/North ward reported six deaths and Dharavi reported two. In March so far, the G/North ward has reported two deaths, of which, one is from Dharavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-dharavi-reports-29-new-cases-on-friday-101616179527285.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Parking contractor managing vehicle-lifting gang arrested in Ludhiana||The crime investigating agency (CIA) staff-1 of Ludhiana police claim to have busted an inter-state gang of vehicle lifters with the arrest of a local parking lot contractor, Mickey Sahani.According to police, Mickey hid stolen vehicles at the parking lots managed by his staff and later sold them off using fake documents.His accomplice, Amanpreet Singh, alias Aman, 36, of Karnail Singh Nagar, Pakhowal Road, has also been arrested. An engineering graduate, Amanpreet claims to be working as a teacher.Their two accomplices, Rohin of Delhi and Laddi of Jalandhar, are at large. Sharing details of the arrest, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said following the two men’s arrest on Thursday, 16 four-wheelers were recovered from their possession. These include three Toyota Fortuner SUVs, two Hyundai Verna sedans, and once each Innova Crysta, Toyota Etios, Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire, Maruti Suzuki Alto, Volkswagen Vento, Maruti Suzuki Swift, Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Renault Duster, Hyundai Creta, Hyundai i10 and Chevrolet Optra.Stole vehicles from Delhi, J&KThe police chief said the accused used to steal vehicles from Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir with the help of their gang members and brought them to Ludhiana. They did not target vehicles in Ludhiana to avoid being caught.“They would approach scrap dealers for registration certificates (RCs) and number plates of damaged vehicles. Laddi of Jalandhar used to forge the engine and chassis numbers of stolen vehicles, and replace their number plates. These would then be sold to unwary customers,” said the commissioner, adding that through this modus operandi, they had been making quick money for over a year.“Police had recently initiated a drive against vehicles parked for over a week at parking lots. Such vehicles were noticed by the police during special checking. But, Mickey tried to mislead the police that the vehicles were parked only recently,” the police official added.Amanpreet is already facing a burglary case lodged at Sarabha Nagar police station, while Mickey was in January booked by the Division Number 2 police for overcharging patients and their relatives at the Civil Hospital parking lot. While his two employees were caught, he had managed to escape. More important information is expected from the accused during questioning. A hunt is on for their absconding accomplices, including some scrap dealers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/parking-contractor-managing-vehicle-lifting-gang-arrested-in-ludhiana-101616179407373.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||HP devising schemes to tackle drought-like situation: Govt||The Himachal Pradesh government is devising a strategy to tackle the drought-like situation arising in the state, which is likely to adversely impact water supply and irrigation schemes, this was said during the budget session of the state Assembly on Friday. Jal Shakti Minister Mahender Singh Thakur said more tubes wells and bore wells will be dug in the state to offset the water scarcity. The government had banned boring of wells and tube wells last year due to decline in the water table. Thakur was replying to a private member’s resolution brought by BJP legislator Ramesh Dhawala. He said a meeting had been convened on March 23 to take of stock of the situation and around 400 schemes were in the pipeline. He said water harvesting tanks were being constructed in 155 sub-divisions. He urged all 68 MLAs to build small rain harvesting tanks in their respective areas and said the department will foot the bill. Expressing concern over the rise in average temperature in the state, Thakur said Himachal’s temperature had increased by 1.62°C in five years. “There has been a 19% decrease in glaciers due to the increasing temperatures and if glaciers continue to melt at the same speed, Himachal may also face a tragedy like Uttarakhand in future,” he said while advocating snow harvesting and construction of rain-water harvesting structures in the plains and medium elevation areas to replenish the groundwater levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-devising-schemes-to-tackle-drought-like-situation-govt-101616179047084.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Psychotropic drugs nexus operating from Ludhiana, Meerut busted; 15 held||In a major haul of psychotropic drugs, the Ludhiana police have seized 67 lakh intoxicating tablets, capsules, injections and syrups with 15 arrests from Ludhiana and Meerut, spanning over 18 days. Having an MRP of ₹18 crore, these medicines were meant to be sold in the illegal drug market for three times their price, said commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.The inter-state opioid racket was unravelled following the arrest of Anoop Kumar Sharma, of Chandar Nagar, Ludhiana, and Hemant of Bampur, Uttar Pradesh, who were held with intoxicating tablets in Ludhiana on March 1. Anoop, along with five others, was found to be operating the racket from a rented accommodation in Chhawni Mohalla, owned by former BJP councillor Satish Nagar. While Nagar has been named in the March 1 FIR, he has not been arrested yet.“Anoop’s interrogation unveiled a chain of supply of psychotropic drugs from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Police teams, led by joint commissioner of police (JCP, City) Deepak Pareek, traced the chain to Jaan Saifi, who used to procure drugs from Farjaan Sethi, Mohammad Sadiq and Surya Prakash, alias Chuttan, in huge quantities,” said commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal.While Saifi, Suraj and Mohammad are from Meerut, Farjaan is from Kotwali, Uttar Pradesh (UP).“Acting on disclosures made by these four men, an illegal godown of psychotropic drugs was raided at Partapur in Meerut district in the presence of drug control officials. This led to huge seizure of 66,99,719 intoxicating tablets, capsules, injections and syrups worth ₹18 crore,” he added.This further helped the police uncover the role of money transfer agents and courier suppliers, who actively facilitated the psychotropic drug trade. Bank accounts, created especially for money transactions for the drug consignments, have been frozen, the top cop said.Those arrested for operating the racket in Ludhiana with Anoop have been identified as Babul of Kundanpuri, Karamjeet Singh, alias Prince, of Haibowal, Kulwinder Kumar, alias Babbu, of Civil City, Kuldeep Kumar, alias Bijli, and Kamaljeet, alias Kamal, of New Vishnupuri Ludhiana.“Others involved in the nexus are Loveleen Sharma of Chandar Nagar, Harjeet Singh of Kundanpuri, Sumit Kumar of Guru Nanakpura, and Gagandeep of Jagatpuri, who have also been arrested,” Agarwal said.The accused will be produced in court on Saturday. Following the unearthing of the network, the commissioner of police has recommended the DGP disc for the police personnel involved in the operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/psychotropic-drugs-nexus-operating-from-ludhiana-meerut-busted-15-held-101616178927281.html

Thereafter, patrolling parties took rounds of the city to ensure no shop or eatery was open. Some shopkeepers found operating beyond the permissible hours at Haibowal, Dandi Swami Road and Humbran Road were asked to down shutters and issued a warning.Commuters moving about the roads claimed they were not aware about the curfew getting extended, while others said they were out for essentials or medicines.As it was the first day of the extended night curfew, police let the violators go after a warning. People commuting to the railway station or bus stand to pick/drop their relatives and three-wheelers ferrying passengers were also allowed to proceed.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 3) Sameer Verma said special checkpoints were installed at major points and crossroads of the city to warn people loitering aimlessly.

Although the school is run by the Maharashtra government, the municipal corporation is responsible for only distribution among students, he clarified.Several loaded bags of cattle fodder were checked by the concerned authorities, with one of the bags having ‘Nutri Rich Pashu Aahar’ (nutritious animal fodder) written on it.The mid-day meal scheme is a school meal program designed to improve the nutritional standing of school-age children across the country. As per the scheme, free lunches are supplied on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government-aided, local body, education guarantee scheme, and alternate innovative education centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/govt-school-in-pune-receives-cattle-fodder-instead-of-mid-day-meal-101616178209495.html
20-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh govt school teachers want exams to go online||Amid rising Covid-19 cases, the UT education department has asked government schools in the city to continue with the ongoing exams and classes even as teachers are against it. The teachers are demanding that the exams should be shifted online, especially since the neighbour Punjab has already closed its schools till March 31.Currently, exams are being held for students of Classes 9 and 11 while students of Classes 10 and 12 are being called to school for offline classes. As per the datesheet released by the UT education department, the exams for Classes 9 and 11 will go on till March 31. This has left teachers in UT schools worried. A teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “Some teachers have tested positive at the government schools in Khudda Jassu, Sector 20 and Sector 12, and yet theses schools have not been closed. Testing should be carried out in these schools and the remaining exams and classes must be shifted online for the safety of students as well as teachers.” President of the UT Cadre of Educational Employees Union, Swarn Singh Kamboj said he has written to UT director school education (DSE) to look into the matter. “We are not demanding that schools should be closed, however, the remaining exams can be switched to the online mode thus reducing the interaction between students and teachers.”DSE Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We will close the schools if we receive instructions from higher officials. Right now, we are following all protocols that have been put in place to ensure that social distancing is maintained. In case, any student is unfit to come to school, then their exams are taken online.”Covid testing starts in schoolsTeams of the UT health department are visiting government schools and conducting Covid tests as per directions by the UT administration. Government schools in Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Sector 46, Burail and Palsora were tested on Saturday. As per health officials, a total of 254 tests were conducted and one teacher from the government school in Makhanajra tested positive in the Rapid Antigen Test while the rest were negative. Officials said that exams aren’t being conducted here. When asked what was done after this case was identified, UT education secretary SS Gill remained unavailable for comments. Three schools a day will be tested in the coming days including the government schools in Sector 20, 44, 21, 52, Dhanas, Maloya, Khuda Alisher and Khuda Jassu.

20-03-2021||Delhi||Man lynched for snatching, police arrest 2||A 20-year-old man was tied up by some factory workers and beaten to death after he was caught while snatching a mobile phone in outer Delhi’s Narela, police said after arresting two of the alleged killers on Thursday.The victim’s body was then thrown in a canal, investigators added.“There were four-five men involved in the killing. We have arrested two suspects and are on the lookout for the others,” said Rajeev Ranjan, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north district).The alleged lynching comes close on the heels of a similar incident in north Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi, in which two men were beaten to death by a group of people on suspicion of being thieves. In the Azadpur case, police have arrested some of the killers, but have also registered cases of theft against the dead men.In the Narela lynching case, however, the police are seeking legal opinion on whether they should file a case against the victim, Mohammad Sajjad. It is learnt that the police have not moved to register a case against Sajjad since the man from who the mobile phone was allegedly stolen has not demanded any police action in the case.Sajjad lived with his mother in the JJ Colony in Bawana and worked odd jobs to earn his living. The police said so far they have not found any previous criminal records against him.According to investigators, the alleged lynching took place on March 8, when Sajjad and his three friends were allegedly walking along the Bawana Canal and spotted some factory workers taking a bath in the canal. The four men allegedly snatched the mobile phone of one of those workers, identified as Bablu Khiladi, who was waiting outside the canal.Khiladi’s cries for help alerted the other workers who immediately rushed to the spot. And though his friends managed to escape with the stolen mobile phone, Sajjad was caught by the workers and initially thrashed at the spot.The men kept beating Sajjad and asking him to return the stolen phone.Unable to recover the phone from him, the men then took Sajjad to a factory in Narela Industrial Area where they were employed. Here, the police said, they tied up Sajjad and thrashed him again till he died. The alleged killers then dumped his body in Haiderpur Canal, with his limbs still bound.“Sajjad’s friends, meanwhile, visited his mother and handed over the stolen mobile phone to her and informed her that her son had been caught by some people while snatching the phone,” the DCP said.Sajjad’s mother subsequently approached the Narela police to register a missing complaint, but neither did she tell the police the circumstances in which he disappeared, nor did she hand over the phone to the investigators.Meanwhile, on March 11, Sajjad’s body was recovered from the Haiderpur Canal, under the jurisdiction of KN Katju Marg police station. The police checked the records of missing persons and identified the body as that of Sajjad“When Sajjad’s mother got to know that her son was dead, she produced the phone before the police, told them about the circumstances of her son’s disappearance and mentioned the role of his three friends who had managed to escape,” the DCP said. By this time, Sajjad’s three friends allegedly involved in the snatching crime with him, had fled.But the police began looking out for the factory workers suspected to have lynched Sajjad. The five workers, however, too had by then fled Delhi.On Thursday, the police arrested two of the alleged killers, Bablu Khiladi and Rajkumar Prasad. Khiladi, allegedly the prime suspect, was the man whose phone was snatched, the police said. The two men have been booked for murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-lynched-for-trying-to-snatch-mobile-in-narela-police-arrest-two-101616177127440.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Caution in short supply at crowded Sarojini Nagar||Pramod Sharma (58) had demarcated the waiting area outside his shop in Sarojini Nagar in June last year, when the Delhi government allowed markets to reopen after months of lockdown that had been necessitated to contain the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the city.“We allowed only five customers at a time inside the shop, after checking their temperature using a thermal scanner. We had to take strict measures then as everyone was scared and cases were on the rise,” said Sharma.Though, Covid-19 cases are witnessing an uptick in the city again, Sharma believes things are different now. “Things are different now. We no longer have those restrictions in place, but we don’t allow customers inside without masks,” he said.This is the situation throughout Sarojini Nagar market, one of Delhi’s popular shopping destinations, as footfall is inching close to pre-Covid times with each passing day. The rise in Covid-19 cases has forced market associations to seek help from district to manage the crowd and ensure social distancing. On Wednesday, one of the traders’ associations in the market wrote to the district administration requesting deployment of additional civil defence volunteers to ensure social distancing.Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar mini market traders’ association, said, “The rush in the market is increasing despite a rise in Covid-19 cases. We can only request customers to follow norms, but government authorities can take measures to ensure preventive measures are followed by everyone.”On Thursday, civil defence volunteers were spotted randomly screening some shoppers at the entry point.“It is impossible to screen everyone entering the market, as the footfall is very high. But our teams are advising people to wear masks and maintain social distancing, which itself is a challenge here,” said a civil defence volunteer. Market associations complain that shoppers had started throwing caution to the wind, with some sometimes not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly.He said that last, year civil defence volunteers and Delhi Police officials used to screen people using thermal scanners at the four entry points.“But post-Diwali, these measures were discontinued. We have requested the administration to restart the screening immediately,” he said.A senior New Delhi district administration official said, “It is not possible to stop people from entering the market or screen everyone. Our teams are taking action against those who refuse to follow the rules.”On Thursday afternoon, the lanes in the market were packed with people. One of them, Aruna Kumar (40), a shopper, said that she takes all necessary precautions while venturing out. “I wasn’t expecting such a rush in the market during the afternoon hours. I had some important work, else I would not have come here.”Surjeet Singh Arora, president of Sarojini Nagar Traders Association, said the main problem is street vendors, “The main problem is of street vendors. Their number is increasing and there is no check on them. There are hawkers who move around the entire market.”Officials from the district administration claimed that only authorised vendors are allowed in the market. Street vendors, on the other hand, said that they have no other place to go. “Last few months have been difficult for us. We have always worked here. Where will we go?” said Kamlesh, a street vendor.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the police booth at Sarojini Nagar market is being used to make regular announcements asking people to follow social distancing and wear masks at all times when they are in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-year-after-lockdown-social-distancing-a-myth-at-sarojini-nagar-101616177128127.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||WhatsApp photo helps cops rescue trafficked 12-yr-old||The WhatsApp display picture put up by a kidnapper, trying to convince the mother of a 12-year-old abducted and girl to not inform the police, was what eventually led to the cracking of the case and rescue of the child. The child had been kidnapped to be pushed into prostitution, investigators said.The girl, who was kidnapped from south-west Delhi’s Kapashera on January 21, was beaten, burnt with cigarettes, and raped by men — some of who knew she was a minor — before she was rescued on Tuesday.The police till Thursday had arrested two men and two women who kidnapped and sold the minor and are probing if the gang trafficked more children, said Urvija Goel, deputy commissioner of police (west).On Friday, the police arrested Robin, a 21-year-old man from Sonepat, who allegedly offered the girl a piece of birthday cake laced with sedatives, said DCP Goel.The rescue and arrests were made by officers of Rajouri Garden police station while they were working to recover children gone missing. The local police in Kapashera registered a kidnapping case soon after her disappearance but failed to make any headway in the case.On Friday, the Delhi Police top brass acted against the station house officer (SHO) of Kapashera, transferring him to the police lines. “There was negligence in the probe...there was lapse in supervision. The police did search for the girl, but there were certain shortcomings,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west).An investigator, involved in the rescue of the child, said that when Rajouri Garden police contacted the girl’s mother in a bid to trace her about a month ago, it was learnt that the kidnappers were in touch with her. They were trying to bribe her so that she stopped pursuing the case of her daughter’s disappearance. However, the mother did not want money. She just wanted her daughter back. “The kidnappers would call from different numbers and then switch them off,” the officer said .But one of the callers slipped up. She put up her image as the display picture on WhatsApp. “The girl’s mother recollected that the woman in the picture was someone who lived in her area. She brought it to our notice,” said the officer.The police were able to identify the woman as a local, Ayesha. That clue was enough for the police to identify and arrest her contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whatsapp-display-picture-helped-rescue-12-year-old-abducted-girl-101616177068324.html
20-03-2021||Delhi||Number of house sparrows rising in Delhi, say birders||Nearly a decade after the humble house sparrow was adopted as the state bird of Delhi, to replenish the dwindling population of a bird that once was as ubiquitous as the rock pigeons are these days in the national capital, there has been a slight improvement in numbers, bird experts said.However, in the absence of a count to ascertain how healthy their population is, experts caution that Delhi still has a long way to go before sparrows become the often seen neighbourhood visitor of yore.Surya Prakash, a zoologist at the School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said compared to the sparrow’s fast depleting count around the year 2012, when numbers had fell by about 60-70% (only an estimate), its numbers are now “improving”, if one goes by sightings, and that’s good news as Delhi gets ready to mark yet another World Sparrow Day on Saturday (March 20).“The count of sparrows is looking good. Over the past few years, there has not been a drastic drop in their numbers. Around 2012, we had met then chief minister Sheila Dikshit to raise the issue as their numbers had gone down by 60-70%. Since then, people started becoming more aware of the sparrow’s disappearance and that awareness has helped,” Prakash said.In 2012, while dubbing the sparrow the state bird, the Delhi government had also launched a campaign called “Rise of Sparrows” to conserve the house sparrow, among other birds.Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said efforts made to restore the population of house sparrow has yielded results.“In the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, we have made a conservatory for sparrows, providing nesting facilities; and last year, we spotted nearly 80 sparrows in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park in a single day, so the situation currently is promising. DDA biodiversity parks have not only provided nesting spaces for sparrows, but have also created natural ecological niches, which enable a large population of Delhi’s state bird,” Khudsar said.Experts said fossil evidence suggest that house sparrows have been human dependent for a long time and are usually found around human habitations. However, large-scale urbanisation led to their numbers reducing gradually. Multistoried buildings with glass panels for windows, concreted parking spaces and lack of ventilation spots for nesting have led to sparrows disappearing.Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society, said rampant urbanisation resulted in fewer nesting spaces. The reduction in green spaces over the years also hampered their population.“Sparrow chicks need soft-bodied insects, because they require a diet rich in protein. So, when we eat into green spaces, we are also reducing the population of insects, which essentially breaks the food chain.

20-03-2021||Lucknow||Zero tolerance for crime gave positive results in four years: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday hit back at the Opposition, especially the previous Samajwadi Party regime, over its charge of a “deteriorating” law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh.He asserted that his government’s zero-tolerance policy towards crime and criminals gave positive results in the past four years.“The result of the zero-tolerance policy has been that when compared to the figures of 2016-2017, there has been a fall of 65.72 % in cases of dacoity; 66.15 % in loot; 19.80 % in murder and 45.43 % in rape in UP,” he said at a press conference on the completion of four years of his government.Claiming that the perception of the state had changed during the past four years and it had emerged as the best destination for investments, Adityanath said it had been possible because of his government’s “performance on all fronts”, especially law and order.“While earlier no one wanted to come to the state because of a sense of insecurity, there is no fear now. Our government has also taken strict action against professional criminals, mafia elements and others harming peace, and this has also set a norm in the country,” he said.“To the government, a criminal is a criminal and it is also said that he does not belong to any caste or community,” he said.Talking about his government’s performance on implementation of the central government schemes, Yogi said: “UP figured nowhere earlier in performance of implementation of central schemes. The state used to take the 25th to 26th rung. Now, in most of the central schemes, UP is number one, be it PM housing scheme (urban and rural), Swachh Bharat Mission, Ujjawala (cooking gas scheme), Jan Dhan, Swanidhi, Kisan Samman Nidhi, or Saubhagya (power) scheme. The previous government did not take interest and derive benefits for the state from the central schemes. Had they done so, the story of the state would have had been different already.”About the health sector, Yogi Adityanath said: “UP was the worst performer in the health sector. But we scripted a turnaround story in the sector, so much so that while the Uttar Pradesh government’s Covid-19 management was praised at the national level, the World Health Organisation (WHO) also appreciated it. We controlled Covid, we also controlled encephalitis, a scourge for decades in eastern UP. We brought down encephalitis cases by 75% and reduced encephalitis deaths by 95%”.Talking about infrastructure, Yogi said: “Before our government came in, there were only two expressways in the state, now there will be five more functional soon. Before we came in, there was not a single operational metro train in the state. We began metro in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida. Kanpur and Agra have metro construction work while soon work will begin for metro-lite in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, and Jhansi. Country’s first waterway began between Varanasi and Haldia in the river Ganga. Till 2017, there were only two airports in the state, now Kushinagar international airport is almost ready, and Asia’s biggest airport is coming up at Jewar. Work on 13 new airports is in progress.”The chief minister talked about infrastructure, law and order, agriculture and farmers’ welfare, rural development, urban development, cow protection, tourism, religious tourism (saying that UP had once again become number one on this count), industrial development, MSMEs, labour issues, education, medical health, road connectivity, air connectivity, women welfare, pensions, etc.Senior members of his cabinet, including deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and BJP state chief Swantantra Dev Singh were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/zero-tolerance-for-crime-gave-positive-results-in-four-years-yogi-101616176766214.html

20-03-2021||Pune||Pune district’s Covid deaths rise by 145 after reporting double-digit numbers for a week||Even as the central team has stated that Maharashtra is at the beginning of a second Covid-19 wave as of mid-March, the district is already reporting double-digit deaths due to the infection for the past one week.From March 11 to March 18, Pune reported 2,830 new Covid cases and 145 deaths due to the infection which takes the case fatality rate to 0.6 per cent, as per the district health office.On March 18, as many as 31 deaths were reported, while on March 17 it was 15, 12 deaths were reported on March 16, 15 deaths on March 15, 25 on March 14, 16 deaths on March 13 and March 12 and 15 Covid-related deaths on March 11, according to the district health office.The case fatality was about 2.4 per cent September 2020, which is being considered the peak of the first wave in the district. However, even though the current case fatality rate may seem low the absolute numbers are rising steadily.Although the administration has been claiming that most new cases are mild or asymptomatic and so out of the 30,129 active cases, 21,345 are isolated at home.Divisional commissioner Sourabh Rao had said in an earlier press conference, “Most new cases coming up are with milder symptoms or are family contacts of the index patient.” However, the surge seen in mid-February is now leading to more cases and in proportion more deaths.Meanwhile, the data discrepancy in the reports of the state health department and the district health office continues. As of March 18, as per the district health office, Pune district had reported 9,486 deaths due to Covid while on the same date the state health department showed 8,210 deaths. There is a difference of 1,276 deaths in the Pune district as per both reports.The issue has been repeatedly raised by the local authorities and the state officials too. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said, “We have raised this issue with the local authorities as it is their responsibility to ensure that the national Covid portal is updated with every discharged case and death with details including names for authenticity. However, due to the paucity in staff, the local authorities in Pune have not been able to update the Covid portal.”“The state health report is prepared on the basis of the information put up on the portal. However, the data is regularly reconciled every 15 days or 30 days and so the updated numbers should come out soon in the state reports as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-s-covid-deaths-rise-by-145-after-reporting-double-digit-numbers-for-a-week-101616169324891.html

The police arrested him from the Nihal Singh Wala area.The accused told police that the elder victim and her mother used to blackmail him for money and he was already in depression as he lost money in the fishery business.Jagatpreet Singh, SP (D), said, “The accused has made claims of illicit relationship with the Amandeep and blackmailing during investigation. We are investigating, but initially there is no proof of these claims.”Amandeep Kaur, 24, and Kamalpreet Kaur, 18, were shot in the head and neck at point-blank range with a .32-bore revolver at Manuke Gill village in the district on Thursday evening. Gurvir abandoned them and fled in his Maruti Alto car.

20-03-2021||World||Joe Biden is on his heels amid a migrant surge at Mexico border||Somehow, they didn’t see it coming.Within weeks of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, the Biden administration had reversed many of the most maligned Trump-era immigration policies, including deporting children seeking asylum who arrived alone at the US-Mexico border and forcing migrants to wait in Mexico as they made their case to stay in the United States.While the administration was working on immigration legislation to address long-term problems, it didn’t have an on-the-ground plan to manage a surge of migrants. Career immigration officials had warned there could be a surge after the presidential election and the news that the Trump policies, widely viewed as cruel, were being reversed.Now officials are scrambling to build up capacity to care for some 14,000 migrants now in federal custody — and more likely on the way — and the administration finds itself on its heels in the face of criticism that it should have been better prepared to deal with a predictable predicament.“They should have forecasted for space (for young migrants) more quickly,” said Ronald Vitiello, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and chief of Border Patrol who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations. “And I think in hindsight, maybe they should have waited until they had additional shelter space before they changed the policies.”The situation at the southern border is complex.Since Biden’s inauguration, the US has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials. There were 18,945 family members and 9,297 unaccompanied children encountered in February — an increase of 168% and 63%, respectively, from the month before, according to the Pew Research Center. That creates an enormous logistical challenge because children, in particular, require higher standards of care and coordination across agencies.Still, the encounters of both unaccompanied minors and families are lower than they were at various points during the Trump administration, including in spring 2019. That May, authorities encountered more than 55,000 migrant children, including 11,500 unaccompanied minors, and about 84,500 migrants traveling in family units.Career immigration officials, overwhelmed by the earlier surges, have long warned the flow of migrants to the border could ramp up again.Migrant children are sent from border holding cells to other government facilities until they are released to a sponsor. That process was slowed considerably by a Trump administration policy of “enhanced vetting,” in which details were sent to immigration officials and some sponsors wound up getting arrested, prompting some to fear picking up children over worries of being deported. Biden has reversed that policy, so immigration officials hope the process will speed up now.Biden administration officials have repeatedly laid blame for the current situation on the previous administration, arguing that Biden inherited a mess resulting from President Donald Trump's undermining and weakening of the immigration system.The White House also points to Biden’s decision to deploy the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known for helping communities in the aftermath of a natural disaster, to support efforts to process the growing number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border.Biden and others have pushed back on the notion that what's happening now is a “crisis.”“We will have, I believe, by next month enough of those beds to take care of these children who have no place to go,” Biden said in a recent ABC News interview, when asked whether his administration should have anticipated the surge in young unaccompanied migrants as well as families and adults. He added, “Let’s get something straight though. The vast majority of people crossing the border are being sent back ... immediately sent back.”Adam Isacson, an analyst at the human rights advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America, said Republicans’ insistence that there is a “crisis” at the border is overwrought, but that the surge in migrants was predictable.He called it a perfect storm of factors: hurricanes that hit Central America last fall; the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic; typical seasonal migration patterns; the thousands of Central American migrants already stuck at the border for months; and the persistent scourge of gang violence afflicting Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.Isacson said the Biden administration may have been “two or three weeks” slow in preparing for the increase in unaccompanied young migrants and the subsequent housing crunch after announcing in early February it would stop deporting unaccompanied youths.But Isacson added that the bottleneck was also affected by the lack of cooperation by the Trump administration with the Biden transition.The Biden administration announced on Feb. 2 it would no longer uphold the Trump administration policy of automatically deporting unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. Two weeks later, the White House announced plans to admit 25,000 asylum-seekers to the US who had been forced to remain in Mexico.In subsequent weeks, the number of young migrants crossing without adults skyrocketed. Both Customs and Border Protection, and Health and Human Services officials have struggled to house the influx of children. Immigration officials say the number of adult migrants and families trying to enter the US illegally also has surged.Border patrol officials had encountered more than 29,000 unaccompanied minors since Oct. 1, nearly the same number of youths taken into custody for all of the previous budget year, administration officials say.“Getting capacity up to deal with the unaccompanied minors is critical, but the numbers just don’t bear out to pointing to a crisis,” Isacson said.That hasn’t stopped Republicans -- including Trump and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California -- from pillorying Biden.“It’s more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,” said McCarthy, who led a delegation of a dozen fellow House Republicans to El Paso, Texas, on Monday.Biden is also facing criticism from Republicans that his administration has sent mixed messages.Critics have focused on public comments from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who earlier this month said the administration's message to migrants was “don’t come now” and a slip by Roberta Jacobson, the White House's lead adviser on the border, who said in Spanish during a recent briefing the “border is not closed,” before correcting herself.The president and other administration officials in recent days have stepped up efforts to urge migrants not to come. Embassies in Northern Triangle countries are airing public service announcements underscoring the dangers of making the trek north.Eric Hershberg, director of the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, said Biden's team faces a powerful counter-narrative as it attempts to persuade desperate Central Americans to stay put: chatter on social media from migrants who successfully made it across the border and smugglers who insist that now is the ideal time.Hershberg cites a Honduran friend's reaction to US warnings that migrants could face danger on the journey: "You know, you don’t need to go with such uncertainty. You can just stay here and know that you’ll be raped or killed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-is-on-his-heels-amid-a-migrant-surge-at-mexico-border-101616261662020.html
20-03-2021||World||US to place some migrant families in hotels in move away from detention centres||Some migrant families arriving in the United States will be housed in hotels under a new program managed by non-profit organizations, according to a person familiar with the plans, a move away from for-profit detention centers that have been criticized by Democrats and health experts.Endeavors, a San Antonio-based organization, will oversee what it calls "family reception sites" at hotels in Texas and Arizona, the person said. The organization, in partnership with other non-profits, will initially provide about 1,400 beds in seven different hotels for families deemed vulnerable when caught at the border.The plan was first reported by Axios on Saturday.The opening of the reception centers would mark a significant shift by the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, away from the detention of migrant families in for-profit facilities.In January, Biden issued an order directing the Justice Department not to renew its contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. However, the order did not address immigration jails run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-place-some-migrant-families-in-hotels-in-move-away-from-detention-centres-101616257280538.html
20-03-2021||World||US ties with Russia, China sink as Biden toes tough lines||US relations with its two biggest geo-political rivals are facing severe tests as President Joe Biden tries to assert America's place in the world and distinguish himself from his predecessor.Airing myriad complaints, the Biden administration took an extraordinarily tough line with China and Russia this past week. Public spats between the countries erupted as Biden characterized Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “killer” and his top national security aides excoriated China for a litany of issues.Moscow and Beijing both fired back, setting the stage for months, if not more, of escalating tensions that are unlikely to be resolved without intense discussions at the leadership level and major concessions from all sides.Biden himself kicked off the latest round of recrimination in a television interview in which he sought to draw clear differences between his Russia policies and those of former President Donald Trump. who was accused of being soft on Putin. Just 24 hours later, Biden's top diplomat and national security adviser blasted Chinese officials in face-to-face talks.Although Biden's strong comments about Putin reflected a shift from Trump's often conciliatory approach to the Kremlin, the harsh criticism directed at China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan in many ways mirrored the previous administration's hard line toward Beijing.The contrasting styles suggested that Biden is intent on reversing years of perceived U.S. weakness toward Russia while rejecting Trump's 2020 campaign allegations that he's not tough enough on China.In taking a strong line on Russia, Biden has said the days of the U.S. “rolling over” to Putin are done. And, in the interview with ABC broadcast on Wednesday, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” Russia responded by recalling its ambassador in Washington for consultations.Putin then shot back by pointing to the U.S. history of slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II in an “it-takes-one-to-know-one” response.As that was unfolding, on Thursday in Alaska, China's top two diplomats reacted in similar fashion to criticism from Blinken and Sullivan about Beijing's human rights record in the western Xinjiang region and Tibet and its aggressive actions in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.Communist Party foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for condemning China while at the same time grappling with its own internal issues, including violence against Asian Americans and other people of color and political unrest following the 2020 presidential election.Blinken and Sullivan took umbrage at those comments and replied that the U.S. was not perfect but sought to openly and honestly address such matters. Sullivan said Americans' willingness to confront their shortcomings was the “secret sauce” of U.S. success.And, they sought to reframe U.S.-China relations in the context of the Biden administration's resolve to correct those issues, strengthen the U.S. economy and improve ties with democratic allies in Asia such as Australia, Japan and South Korea.Blinken, having just finished a trip to Japan and South Korea with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, made clear to the Chinese that the U.S. is aligned with its allies.“I have to tell you, what I’m hearing is very different from what you described,” he told Wang and Yang. “I’m hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we’re re-engaged with our allies and partners. I’m also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government has taken.”Blinken appears to have impressed his boss. “I’m very proud of the secretary of state,” Biden said after the testy talks in Anchorage.A similar effort with allies is underway in Europe with respect to Russia.Blinken will leave Monday for Brussels for talks with NATO and European Union officials designed to repair strains caused by Trump's largely transactional diplomacy. Trump's bluster, threats of trade wars and intense demands that Europe pay more for its defense angered many, particularly in the continent's two major powers: France and Germany.That trip is aimed at underscoring the Biden administration’s "determination to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and reinvigorate our ties with allies through NATO” with an eye toward challenges posed by both Russia and China, the State Department said.Russia’s relations with the United States and the European Union already had plunged to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, meddling in elections, hacking attacks and, most recently, the jailing of Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny after his poisoning, which he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities rejected the accusations.Then, the U.S. national intelligence director’s office released a report finding that Putin authorized influence operations to help Trump’s reelection bid. The Biden administration warned that Russia would face sanctions soon over its attempt to influence the election and the widespread SolarWinds hacks.“(Putin) will pay a price,” Biden said in the ABC interview when asked about the declassified report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ties-with-russia-china-sink-as-biden-toes-tough-lines-101616257504050.html

20-03-2021||World||'Assumption of being walking sex objects': Asian women say shootings point to relentless, racist tropes||For Christine Liwag Dixon and others, the bloodshed in Georgia — six Asian women among the dead, allegedly killed by a man who blamed his “sexual addiction” — was a new and horrible chapter in the shameful history of Asian women being reduced to sex objects.“I’ve had people either assume that I’m a sex worker or assume that, as a Filipino woman, I will do anything for money because they assume that I’m poor,” said Dixon, a freelance writer and musician in New York City. “I had an old boss who offered me money for sex once.”Tuesday’s rampage at three Atlanta-area massage businesses prompted Asian American women to share stories of being sexually harassed or demeaned. They say they’ve often had to tolerate racist and misogynistic men who cling to a narrative that Asian women are exotic and submissive.Elaine Kim, who is Korean American and a professor emeritus in Asian American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, recalled being crassly harassed by white young men while she was in high school. Later in life, one of her white students made sexualizing comments about the Asian women in her class and lurked outside their apartments.Kim was reminded of these moments when she heard that the man accused in the Atlanta-area shootings had said he had acted because his targets tempted him.“I think it’s likely that the killer not only had a sex addiction but also an addiction to fantasies about Asian women as sex objects,” she said.Two of the Georgia massage businesses had been repeatedly targeted in prostitution investigations in the past 10 years, according to police records. The documents show that 12 people had been arrested on prostitution charges, but none since 2013.The suspect in the shootings, a 21-year-old white man, considered the women inside the spas “sources of temptation,” police said.Grace Pai, a director of organizing at Chicago’s Asian Americans Advancing Justice branch, called that characterization of the attacks “a real slap in the face to anyone who identifies as an Asian American woman.”“We know exactly what this racialized misogyny looks like,” Pai said. “And to think that someone targeted three Asian-owned businesses that were staffed by Asian American women … and didn’t have race or gender in mind is just absurd.”Framing the women who were killed as “sources of temptation” places blame on the women as the ones “who were there to tempt the shooter, who is merely the victim of temptation,” said Catherine Ceniza Choy, a University of California, Berkeley, professor of ethnic studies and a Filipino American woman. She said this scenario echoes a long-running stereotype that Asian women are immoral and hypersexual.“That may be the way the alleged shooter and killer thinks of it, that you can compartmentalize race in this box and sex addiction in a separate box. But it doesn’t work that way,” Choy said. “These things are intertwined, and race is central to this conversation.”Stereotypes of Asian women as “dragon ladies” or sexually available partners have been around for centuries. From the moment Asian women began to migrate to the U.S., they were the targets of hypersexualization, said Ellen Wu, a history professor at Indiana University.The Page Act of 1875 prohibited women coming to the U.S. from anywhere for “immoral purposes,” but the law was largely enforced against Chinese women.“As early as the 1870s, white Americans were already making this association, this assumption of Asian women being walking sex objects,” Wu said.Asian lives are seen as “interchangeable and disposable,” she said. “They are objectified, seen as less than human. That helps us understand violence toward Asian women like we saw this week.”U.S. military deployments in Asia also played a role, according to Kim. She said the military has long fueled sex trafficking there, starting after the Spanish-American War, when traffickers and brothel owners in the Philippines bought and sold women and girls to meet the demands of U.S. soldiers.During the Vietnam War, women from Thailand and many other Asian countries were used for sex by U.S. soldiers at various “rest and recreation” spots. The bodies and perceived submissiveness of Asian women were eroticized and hypersexualized, Kim said, and eventually these racist stereotypes were brought back to the United States.In American culture, Asian woman have been fetishized as submissive, hypersexual and exotic, said Christine Bacareza Balance, an Asian American studies professor at Cornell University and a Filipina woman.A prime example is the wildly popular 1887 novel, “Madame Chrysanthème,” a French narrative, translated into English, in which Japanese women are referred to as “playthings” and “China ornaments.” More recently, an Asian woman has generally been portrayed in films as either “a manipulative, dragon lady temptress or the submissive, innocent ‘lotus blossom’ meant to please a man,” Balance said.Choy, the ethnic studies professor at Berkeley, said Tuesday’s shootings and subsequent efforts to remove race from the conversation is yet another example of the denial of the racism and sexism Asian and Asian American women face.“In American society, Asian Americans are not seen and listened to,” she said. “We are seen in specific ways at times, as model minorities, as projections of white, male fantasy, but we are not seen as full-fledged Americans. We are not seen as full human beings. It’s a kind of erasure and dehumanization.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-women-say-shootings-point-to-relentless-racist-tropes-101616253745189.html
20-03-2021||World||Month-long lockdown imposed in parts of France amid frustration and fatigue||Nearly a third of French people entered a month-long lockdown on Saturday with many expressing fatigue and confusion over the latest set of restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus.The government announced the new measures on Thursday after a jump in Covid-19 cases in Paris and parts of northern France.The new restrictions are less severe than those in place during the lockdowns of spring and November 2020, raising concerns that they may not be effective.   "I hope it's going to end quite quickly, although I have questions on how efficient the measures are," Kasia Gluc, 57, a graphic editor said on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris.There was frustration among so-called non-essential shop owners forced to close down.Stores allowed to stay open include those selling food, books, flowers and chocolate as well as hairdressers and shoemakers, but not clothes, furniture and beauty shops, according to a list released on Friday evening.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said a total of 90,000 shops would need to close down, defended the list of stores that could remain open, notably those selling chocolate and flowers just two weeks ahead of Easter."I do not at all say that this is ideal, but each time it is done with a simple logic: guarantee the health of the French people while preserving economic activity and shops as much as possible," he told France Inter radio.People can leave home as often as they want within 30 km (19 miles), under certain conditions, provided they fill in a declaration, the interior ministry said. Prime Minister Jean Castex on Thursday had only referred to a radius of 10 km."We have to have a permission slip but compared to previous lockdowns we're still a lot more free to go out. So are we locked down? Yes and no," Antonin Le Marechal, 21, said.The government, which has avoided using the word lockdown to describe the latest restrictions, argues the measures are needed to relieve pressure on intensive care units which are close to overflowing.A large number of Parisians left the city before the restrictions came into force at midnight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/monthlong-lockdown-imposed-in-parts-of-france-amid-frustration-and-fatigue-101616254962775.html
20-03-2021||World||Pakistan court condemns 2 men to death in highway rape case||A Pakistani court sentenced two men to death on Saturday for the gang rape of a woman in front of her children last year alongside a motorway in the eastern city of Lahore, a prosecutor said.Hafiz Asghar said the verdict in the closely watched, six-month trial of Abid Malhi and his accomplice Shafqat Ali was issued inside the prison where it was held in Lahore. Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta also sentenced the men to 14 years imprisonment, time that must be served before any executions can take place, he added. Appeals or commutations are likely.According to the prosecutor and police, Malhi and Ali found the woman waiting for help after her car ran out of fuel. She had locked the car doors but the attackers broke a window and dragged her outside where they raped her at gunpoint in front of her terrified children. The men also stole money, jewellery, and bank cards before fleeing.They were tracked down via mobile phone data, Asghar added, and arrested days after the incident. DNA samples taken from the crime scene matched theirs. The survivor identified the two men during the hearing, and Ali confessed to the crime before a magistrate.The crime had drawn widespread condemnation on social media, with some activists demanding that those involved be hanged in public, and has been closely followed on Pakistani television. Human rights activists have urged the government to introduce harsh new penalties for rapists. The case was handled by an anti-terrorism court for expediency.Malhi and Ali did not hire lawyers, and their state-appointed attorneys were not available for comment following the verdict.Gang rape is rare in Pakistan, although sexual harassment and violence against women is not uncommon. Nearly 1,000 women are killed in Pakistan each year in so-called “honor killings” for allegedly violating conservative norms on love and marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-court-condemns-2-men-to-death-in-highway-rape-case-101616253758800.html

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who had AstraZeneca's vaccination on Friday, tweeted "Let's keep going".Israel is the leader in vaccinating its population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Chile, then the United Kingdom - and investors are watching closely to see which economies show the first signs of recovery.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here Britain's government has said it is aiming to give at least one shot to everyone over 50 by mid-April, and to every adult by the end of July. Over that period, it has plans to ease lockdown restrictions, with shops, pubs and restaurants preparing to re-open next month."The vaccine is a national success story and our way out of this pandemic," said Hancock.By comparison, more than 20% of the US population has received at least one dose, and less than a 10th of the EU population.The European Union - where there are growing worries of another wave of infections - is pushing to get vaccines back on track after at least 13 countries temporarily suspended the use of the AstraZeneca shot last week over safety concerns.Also Read: UK inoculates over half of its adult population.

20-03-2021||World||Fallout from riot, coronavirus leaves toxic mood on Capitol Hill||The mood is so bad at the US Capitol that a Democratic congressman recently let an elevator pass him by rather than ride with Republican colleagues who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s election.Republicans say it’s Democrats who just need to get over it — move on from the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, end the Covid-19 restrictions and make an effort toward bipartisanship.Not yet 100 days into the new Congress, the legislative branch has become an increasingly toxic and unsettled place, with lawmakers frustrated by the work-from-home limits imposed by the coronavirus and suspicious of each other after the Jan. 6 riot over Donald Trump's presidency.Particularly in the House, which remains partly shuttered by the pandemic and where lawmakers heard gunshots ring out during the siege, trust is low, settled facts about the riot are apparently up for debate and wary, exhausted members are unsure how or when the “People's House” will return to normal.One newer congresswoman said it’s “heartbreaking” to see what has become of the institution she cherished, in the country she has taken an oath to defend from enemies foreign and domestic.“You know, I do sometimes just close my eyes and, like, picture this place in the way that it used to be, and how welcoming it was,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., first elected in 2018.An immigrant from Somalia, she said she draws on the coping skills she learned as a child in wartime to enter the razor-wire fenced Capitol, now with armed members of the National Guard, to "try to pretend that that's not what it is.”The first months of the year have laid bare the scars from the historic, unprecedented events. The fallout extends far beyond the broken windows and gouged walls of the Capitol to the loss that comes from the absence of usual routines and visitors that were the daily hum of democracy. With virtual meetings and socially distanced votes, lawmakers have fewer opportunities to talk to each other, share ideas and ease fears in the aftermath of the riot.“The mood is toxic,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill. “I mean, it really sucks to be in the minority, but it’s really worse when there’s just such a high partisan temperature.”It came to a pressure point this past week when a dozen Republicans voted against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to law enforcers who defended the Capitol, in part because the resolution mentioned the “insurrectionists” who attacked the “temple" of American democracy. Democrats were stunned.Despite the charged atmosphere, the House is forging ahead with Biden’s agenda, the Democratic majority ushering the $1.9 trillion virus relief bill into law without support from a single Republican. The tensions are delaying, but not stalling, fast action on voting rights, gun background checks and other legislative priorities, but leaving the potential for bipartisanship with Biden an open question.One certainty is that the last president has left an indelible mark on the legislative branch.Trump’s brand of politics is reshaping the Republican Party as lawmakers mimic his style. GOP lawmakers mostly play down the insurrection as simply a “protest,” even as 300 people have been charged in the attack. Republicans dismiss the House coronavirus restrictions, despite public health guidelines urging vaccinations, mask-wearing and social distance to prevent another surge.Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that at events he attended back home few people wear masks anymore and “the attitude is it’s time to get back to normal, get back to freedom.”Leadership sets a tone, and California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the top Republican in the House, tried to suggest at a recent news conference that the GOP challenges to Biden’s victory were not intended to change the election outcome — despite Trump urging his supporters “fight like hell” on Jan. 6 as lawmakers were certifying the 2020 election results.Five people died as a result of the attack at the Capitol, including a woman shot by police and a police officer who succumbed later from injuries.Dozens of lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and two elected officials, both Republicans, have died from Covid-19, one just before his Jan. 3 swearing-in.The GOP leader has sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a letter saying the House should resume normal operations now that 75% of lawmakers are vaccinated.Pelosi responded Friday that the goal is “100%” compliance with vaccinations and social distancing guidelines.One problem in resuming fully in-person operations at the Capitol is the lack of vaccinations for thousands of staff to the 435 House members. So far only two doses have been available for each House office, officials said. Six more doses are expected to be added as soon as next week.The Senate, with 100 members, largely resumed its operations last spring.For now, House proxy voting that was put in place to lessen lawmakers’ health risks of traveling to Washington will persist. Visitors are still off-limits at the Capitol.“There are moments when I’m very excited and very happy, some really great things are happening,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the House Rules Committee chairman who skipped the elevator when he saw it was carrying Republicans who challenged the presidential vote.But he said he was bothered by lawmakers who "try to somehow claim that, you know, this was an act of patriotic people coming to disagree? Give me a break.”It’s clear that Democrats are more emotionally spent than House Republicans, who bolstered their ranks in the last election despite Trump's loss. Their gains narrowed the path to regaining House control in 2022.One Trump-aligned Republican lawmaker, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, has started gumming up Democrats' floor operations by demanding roll calls on routine legislation, testing lawmakers' patience as already lengthy House proceedings drag into late-night sessions. In February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments because of her lengthy history of outrageous social media posts and other actions.While security fencing is set to be removed from the Capitol, metal detectors remain stationed outside the House chamber after some Republican lawmakers pledged to bring their firearms onto the House floor.Trust is low.“Do you think?” said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., among those who voted against the police medals. “Look at the metal detectors here — we have to get squeegeed.”Rep. Steve Palazzo, R-Miss., acknowledged, “There might be some relationship building that needs to take place.”Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., said she has spent sleepless nights replaying the January attack scenes in her mind.She said she is hoping for some assurances from her Republican colleagues that they're all committed to the same goal of “upholding our democracy.”“If we want to get back to normal," she said, "we have to be better than we are.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fallout-from-riot-coronavirus-leaves-toxic-mood-on-capitol-hill-101616244416704.html

20-03-2021||World||Erdogan ousts Central-Bank head, installs interest-rate ally||Two days after a bigger-than-expected increase in interest rates, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan removed the country’s third central-bank governor in less than two years, and replaced him with an advocate of lower rates.Erdogan fired Governor Naci Agbal, who was appointed in November, and gave the job to Sahap Kavcioglu, according to a decree published after midnight on Saturday in the Official Gazette. Agbal’s abrupt removal comes on the heels of a 200 basis-point interest-rate hike by the central bank on Thursday, double what was expected in a Bloomberg survey.Agbal took the job as Turkey’s top banker after weeks of declines in the lira and raised the benchmark one-week repo rate by a cumulative 875 basis points since, boosting the central bank’s damaged credibility among investors. Erdogan, who backs an unconventional theory that high rates cause inflation, has for years frequently chastised the central bank when he thought it was setting borrowing costs too high.“We worked courageously for price stability,” Agbal said, according to HaberturkTV. “I hope permanent price-stability target can be achieved one day.”Kavcioglu is a professor of banking at Marmara University in Istanbul and a columnist at the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper. The paper criticized the monetary authority’s latest interest-rate increase on its front page on Friday, saying the decision “turned a deaf ear” to Turkey’s 83 million people, would hurt economic growth and primarily benefits “London-based owners of hot money.”Interest RatesIn a column published by Yeni Safak on February 9, Kavcioglu said it was “saddening” to see columnists, bankers and business organizations in Turkey seeking economic stability in high interest rates at a time when other countries had negative rates.“The central bank shouldn’t insist on high interest rates,” he wrote. “When interest rates in the world are close to zero, raising interest rates here won’t solve our economic problems. To the contrary, it’ll deepen them in the period ahead.”He also seconded Erdogan’s unorthodox theory on the relationship between interest rates and inflation, saying that raising interest rates would “indirectly open the way to increasing inflation.” Most central bankers and economists around the world believe the opposite to be true, and would argue for raising interest rates to try and control excessive inflation.“The key question is how quickly Governor Kavcioglu will try to reverse cumulative 875 basis-points hikes his predecessor delivered since November” said Piotr Matys, an emerging-market strategist at Rabobank. “It is reasonable to assume that he may reverse the most recent 200 basis-points hike as soon as the next meeting of the central bank. Such a decision would not be approved by the market due to prevailing inflationary risks.”Growth PushKavcioglu takes over after the pace of inflation accelerated for a fifth month in February to nearly 16%. The currency has taken one of the worst hits among peers from climbing US Treasury yields, slumping more than 7% since mid-February and adding to calls for Agbal to backstop the market with higher rates.Despite the recent decline, the lira strengthened around 18% under Agbal’s brief tenure, as expectations grew that he’d return to more orthodox monetary policies and resist political pressure for lower borrowing costs.The government’s growth push in 2020 saw the currency weaken by 20% against the dollar, keeping consumer inflation in double digits for the entire year. But the economy eked out an expansion of 1.8% despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns, and grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter, faster than all other Group of 20 nations except China.Turkey should abandon tight monetary policy and focus on supporting investment, exports and employment that contribute to growth, Kavcigolu said in a recent column. “We’ve got to give up on interest-rate increases and bring borrowing costs, which directly impact investment and production costs, to reasonable levels,” he wrote in Yeni Safak on March 9.Reserves PolicyKavcioglu, who’s also a former lawmaker for the ruling AK Party, defended reserve policies executed from 2018 to 2020, when Turkey began spending its foreign-currency reserves to try and prop up the lira in times of volatility. It also borrowed tens of billions of dollars through swap agreements with commercial lenders.Turkey’s total gross reserves, including gold and reserves held by the central bank on behalf of commercial lenders, dropped 20% last year until Agbal’s appointment to $85.2 billion, while net foreign-exchange reserves fell by more than half to $19.6 billion.The use of the central bank’s foreign-exchange coffers at the time helped to rein in inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate, Kavcigolu said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists estimate the interventions exceeded $100 billion last year alone.“Given that Turkey’s FX reserves have been already depleted and cannot be used to support the lira, it would be prudent to assume that a set of measures that may not be market friendly could be announced to offset possible interest rate cuts,” Matys said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-ousts-central-bank-head-installs-interest-rate-ally-101616245387831.html

It likewise asks questions such as whether pioneers should confront more, less, or similar amount of scrutiny as other accounts and if it's alright for the platform to boycott a president or prime minister in action.The Verge reported that Twitter's present standards for world leaders were set in October 2019, but a lot has occurred from that point forward.In January 2021, Twitter prohibited the then-US President Donald Trump for his tweets encouraging the Capitol crowd. The ban followed a long time of the platform attempting to sort out some way to manage him and other world pioneers from Venezuela and Brazil tweeting deception about Covid-19.The company also says it will consult "human rights experts, civil society organizations, and academics" from all over the world.

The book titled ‘Hospital by the Hill’ is a project by Simon Says, a Hampshire child bereavement support charity, which tells the story of a young person coping with the loss of their mother, who had been working in a hospital on the frontline of the global health crisis."If you are reading this book, it's because you've lost your parent or a loved one, and while I wish I was able to hug you right now, I hope this story is able to provide you comfort in knowing that you're not alone," the Duke of Sussex wrote, as per CNN.Harry lost his mother to a car crash in Paris in 1997 when he was 12 years old. Diana, the Princess of Wales, died in the accident alongside her partner, Dodi Fayed, and driver, Henri Paul, while being chased by paparazzi on motorcycles. Harry reportedly wrote that Diana’s death left “a huge hole inside of me” but that it was eventually filled with “love and support”."We all cope with loss in a different way, but when a parent goes to heaven, I was told their spirit, their love and the memories of them do not. They are always with you and you can hold onto them forever. I find this to be true," he added, reported CNN.The book, written by Chris Connaughton and illustrated by Fay Troote, is being given to bereaved children and young people as part of the UK’s national day of reflection, a government initiative to mark the anniversary of the country’s first Covid-19 lockdown next week. On the book’s official website, Connaughton noted that writing about death is hard and talking about it can be even harder.“Whoever you are thinking about, I hope this story helps make some of the hard and horrible stuff a bit easier,” the author added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princess-diana-s-death-left-a-huge-hole-inside-me-says-prince-harry-101616243792112.html
20-03-2021||World||EU threatens AstraZeneca with export ban if it fails to deliver 'promised amount of vaccines' to the bloc||The European Union’s (EU) executive arm is increasing its pressure on pharmaceutical companies to speed up their vaccine delivery to the continent as virus numbers are rising again in many member countries.The European Commission said Saturday that AstraZeneca in particular could face export bans to countries outside the EU if it didn’t quickly deliver the promised amount of vaccines to the 27-nation bloc.“We have the possibility to ban planned exports,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday.“This is a message to AstraZeneca: You fulfill your part of the deal toward Europe before you start to deliver to other countries,” von der Leyen said in an interview with German media group Funke.Von der Leyen said the contract between the EU and AstraZeneca clearly regulates how much vaccines the EU gets from AstraZeneca’s plants inside the EU and in Britain.However, von der Leyen added, “we didn’t get anything from the Brits while we are delivering vaccines to them.”She said the commission had sent a “formal reminder” to AstraZeneca regarding this issue.AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine is one of three vaccines that’s approved in the EU. However, its usage has been overshadowed by several problems, including a slow start, recurring delivery problems and a temporary ban for several days earlier this week in many of the bloc’s member countries after reports of blood clots in some recipients of the vaccine.Most countries in the EU resumed giving shots of AstraZeneca again Friday as infection numbers were spiking again across the continent and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, too, is seen as critical to ending the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-threatens-astrazeneca-with-export-ban-if-it-fails-to-deliver-promised-amount-of-vaccines-to-the-bloc-101616240644145.html

The talks opened with tense and extended exchanges over human rights before television cameras, before they retreated behind closed doors.The Xinhua report did not provide any details on the climate change working group, other than to say both countries were committed to enhancing communication and cooperation in the field.It also said the the two sides discussed adjusting Covid-19 travel and visa policies and reciprocal arrangements for vaccination of their diplomats.While the report said both countries agreed to hold talks on consular missions and journalists, it did not mention the previous disputes.The U.S. ordered the closing of the Chinese consulate in Houston last year, and China responded by closing he U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu.Chinese journalists in the U.S. and foreign journalists working for U.S. media in China are now being granted only three-month stays, adding uncertainty to their work, though those stays have been generally renewed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-will-discuss-climate-other-issues-with-us-101616240811019.html

The state news agency said that the attack, which took place at 6:05 a.m. local time, caused a fire that was later controlled with no impact on oil supplies or derivatives.This month, Saudi Arabia intercepted a barrage of drones targeting its oil infrastructure. The development pushed oil prices to above $70 a barrel for the first time since January 2020.Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia rarely claim lives or cause extensive damage but their frequency has increased in recent months, creating unease in the Gulf, a region key to global oil production and transit.Al-Jubeir also said Saudi Arabia’s position toward normalization with Israel remains subject to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia may be on the way to normalizing ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missiles-in-aramco-attacks-were-made-in-iran-saudi-arabia-101616237281095.html
20-03-2021||World||Denmark reports two cases of blood clots after administering AstraZeneca shot||Denmark on Saturday reported two cases of hospital staff with blood clots and cerebral haemorrhage after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination.The Capital Region of Denmark, the authority that runs public hospitals in Copenhagen, said that one of the hospital staff had died and both had received the AstraZeneca vaccine less than 14 days before getting ill.The Danish medicines agency confirmed it had received two 'serious reports', without giving further details.There were no details of when the hospital staff got ill.Some countries including Germany and France this week reversed their decision to temporarily pause use of the AstraZeneca vaccine after reports of cases of rare brain blood clots sent scientists and governments scrambling to determine any link.Denmark, which put use of the vaccine on hold on March 11, has not yet resumed use.The European Union's drug watchdog said on Thursday it is still convinced the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks following an investigation into reports of blood clots that prompted more than a dozen nations to suspend its use.European Medicines Agency (EMA) director Emer Cooke said on Thursday the watchdog could not definitively rule out a link between blood clot incidents and the vaccine in its investigation into 30 cases of a rare blood clotting condition.But she said the "clear" conclusion of the review was that the benefits in protecting people from the risk of death or hospitalisation outweighs the possible risks. The issue deserves further analysis, the EMA said.AstraZeneca, which developed the shot with Oxford University, has said a review covering more than 17 million people who had received its shots in the EU and Britain had found no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-reports-two-cases-of-blood-clots-after-administering-astrazeneca-shot-101616235881795.html
20-03-2021||World||Launch of spacecraft for debris removal demo using magnets postponed | All you need to know||The demonstration mission to test new technology developed by Astroscale, an orbital debris removal company, to clean up space junk was postponed on Saturday. The Japanese company had planned the launch of its spacecraft ELSA-d on a Soyuz-2.1a rocket, operated by GK Launch Services, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.While there has been no formal announcement from Astroscale regarding the next launch date, Russia’s state news agency RIA reported that the Soyuz-2.1a rocket will now be launched at 6.07am GMT (11.37am IST) on Sunday. Roscosmos space agency Director General Dmitry Rogozin said that the postponement decision was made after a voltage spike ahead of the planned launch, according to RIA.Thousands of tons of debris, composed of defunct satellites, rocket bodies and parts of old satellites, pose risk to functional satellites, the International Space Station, and future missions. According to the latest figures provided by ESA's Space Debris Office in Germany, more than 9,200 tonnes of debris is present above the Earth’s atmosphere. It includes around 34,000 objects greater than 10 cm in size and an estimated 900,000 objects between 1-10 cm.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in its January report that at least 26,000 pieces of space junk that are the size of a softball or larger could destroy a satellite on impact. It further warned that over 500,000 pieces of debris are the size of a marble, big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites, and over “100 million the size of a grain of salt that could puncture a spacesuit.”“Moreover, the growing volume of orbital debris threatens the loss of important space-based applications used in daily life, such as weather forecasting, telecommunications, and global positioning systems that are dependent on a stable space environment,” the Nasa report had said.The launch of the ELSA-d mission, licensed by the UK Space Agency, will mark the world’s first commercial mission to demonstrate the core technologies necessary for docking and removal of space debris. However, the technology, which relies on a magnetic docking plate, targets the removal of satellites yet to be launched. While the technology currently being tested doesn’t address the issue of debris already present in space, Astroscale is working with JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, on its first debris removal demonstration project.“This landmark mission will also enable better-informed policy developments and drive the business case for on-orbit services such as end-of-life and active debris removal,” Nobu Okada, Astroscale Founder and CEO, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/launch-of-astroscale-spacecraft-for-debris-removal-demo-using-magnets-postponed-101616234956710.html

He is self-isolating at home, the health minister also tweeted.PM Imran Khan has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self isolating at homeThis comes two days after Khan received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. "Prime Minister Imran Khan was vaccinated today. On the occasion, he appealed to the nation to ensure full implementation of SOPs in view of the third wave of the pandemic," his office tweeted on March 18.According to local media reports, Khan was at Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa for an inauguration event at Malakand University on March 19. He also visited the Swat Motorway to inaugurate the Swat Expressway Tunnels.Along with many countries in the world, Pakistan is also witnessing a sharp rise in the daily Covid-19 cases while the vaccination drive is underway. The country has total of 623,135 confirmed cases, according to numbers published on Dawn's website, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers. The death toll stands at 13,799.On Thursday, Pakistan imposed lockdowns in areas that are worst affected by the pandemic. All markets, shopping malls, offices, and restaurants have been ordered to remain closed. However, grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies, bakeries, meat and milk shops are exempted from the restrictions.On Wednesday, the South Asian nation received the second batch of 500,000 Sinopharm vaccines sent by China for its vaccination program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-tests-positive-for-covid19-101616233460250.html
20-03-2021||World||AstraZeneca exports can be banned if bloc not supplied first: EU chief||EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday threatened to halt exports of AstraZeneca vaccines if the bloc did not receive its deliveries first, in a worsening row over delayed shipments that has caused international tensions."We have the option of banning a planned export. That's the message to AstraZeneca: you fulfil your contract with Europe first before you start delivering to other countries," von der Leyen said in an interview with Germany's Funke media group.The warning comes as the European Union struggles to speed up its Covid-19 inoculation campaign, just as many member states are battling rising infection rates that have forced renewed restrictions.Von der Leyen said Anglo-Swedish pharma giant AstraZeneca had delivered only 30 percent of the 90 million vaccine doses it had promised for the first quarter of the year.The company has blamed production delays at its EU plants, but European officials are furious that AstraZeneca has been able to deliver its UK contract in full while falling short on the continent.European Commission president von der Leyen had on Wednesday already threatened to invoke emergency powers to block European exports of Covid-19 vaccines to ensure "reciprocity" with other suppliers."All options are on the table," the former German defence minister said, adding that the vaccine situation would be addressed among EU leaders at talks next week.The EU has already set up special oversight of vaccine exports in which manufacturers contracted to supply Europe must declare if they intend to export doses outside the bloc.Most of the EU's worry is over Britain, where the inoculation campaign has progressed at a much faster pace than in continental Europe.Brussels has accused London of operating a de facto export ban to achieve its vaccine success, a claim furiously denied by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government.The EU's export ban mechanism must first be triggered in an individual member state and then be approved by the European Commission before it can be enforced.The mechanism has so far only been applied once, with Italy blocking the export of a 250,000 dose shipment of AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia, citing "persistent shortage" and "delays in supply".Not all EU members support export bans, which could upset global supply chains, and countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have urged caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-exports-can-be-banned-if-bloc-not-supplied-first-eu-chief-101616233310911.html
20-03-2021||World||Afghan president Ashraf Ghani appoints 2 ministers, angers ruling partner||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has made two key Cabinet changes, evoking a strong response Saturday from powerful governing partner Abdullah Abdullah amid increasing pressure from the US to reach a peace agreement with the Taliban.In May 2020, Ghani and political rival Abdullah signed a power-sharing agreement, two months after both declared themselves the winner of the September 2019 presidential election. Under the deal, Ghani remained president of the war-torn nation while Abdullah was named head of the country's National Reconciliation Council, which has the authority to handle and approve all affairs related to Afghanistan’s peace process. Abdullah would also be able to appoint half of Ghani’s Cabinet and issue executive orders.On Friday, the National Security Council issued decrees on behalf of Ghani in which he dismissed Interior Minister Masoud Andarabi and appointed Hayatullah Hayat as caretaker minister. In recent years, Hayat has served as governor of southern Kandahar province.Army Chief of Staff Gen. Yasin Zia was appointed acting defense minister, replacing Asadullah Khalid.There was little explanation for the changes, but the moves angered Abdullah. “This decision is against the interests of the country in the current situation and is unacceptable,” he said in a statement released Saturday.The changes come as a May 1 deadline nears for the withdrawal of US troops and America has increased pressure on both the national government and the Taliban to end decades-old fighting.The Cabinet changes could be a sign that Ghani is pushing back against the US and opposition’s increasing support for an interim administration. Ghani’s critics have accused him of clinging to power. He says he will leave office only through elections.The statement from Abdullah’s office said the decision to remove Andarabi came “without consultation, without justifiable reason or reasons, was hastily (made) and in opposition to a political agreement between the two parties.”The new appointments come as Afghanistan experiences a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings and other violence as peace negotiations in Qatar between Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government stall.The Islamic State group’s local affiliate has claimed responsibility for some of the violence, but many attacks go unclaimed, with the Afghan government putting the blame on the Taliban. The insurgents have denied responsibility for most of the attacks.On Thursday, Russia hosted the first of three international conferences aimed at jump-starting the peace process ahead of the May 1 deadline for the final withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.The Taliban warned Washington on Friday against defying the deadline, promising a “reaction” if it does, which could mean increased attacks by the insurgent group.The talks in Qatar between the Afghan government and the Taliban have stalled, but Russia voiced hope that the talks in Moscow could help reinvigorate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-ashraf-ghani-appoints-2-ministers-angers-ruling-partner-101616233109615.html

It did not report any items falling from shelves or any immediate damage.The quake could be felt in Tokyo about 400 km south of the epicentre.NHK warned the public against coming anywhere near the shore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/magnitude-7-2-quake-hits-northern-japan-1-metre-tsunami-report-101616232993032.html
20-03-2021||World||Twitter to establish legal entity in Turkey, comply with 'controversial' law||Twitter has announced it will establish a legal entity in Turkey in order to continue operating in the country, which passed a controversial social media law last year.In a statement Friday, the social media company said it had reviewed the amended internet law and made the decision to comply with, it but promised to continue “defending open, public conversation and ensuring our service is available to people everywhere.”Turkey slapped advertising bans on Twitter, Periscope and Pinterest in January. Those bans were the next step in a series of measures to force social media companies to maintain legal representatives in Turkey to manage content complaints.Companies with more than 1 million users that refuse to designate an official representative are subjected to fines, followed by advertising bans. The next penalty would be bandwidth reductions that would make their platforms too slow to use.Human rights and media freedom groups say the law amounts to censorship and violates the rights to privacy and access to information.Under the law, local representatives of social media companies are responsible for answering individual requests to take down content violating privacy and personal rights within 48 hours or to provide grounds for rejection. The company would be held liable for damages if the content is not removed or blocked within 24 hours.The law also requires social media data to be stored in Turkey, raising concerns in a country where the government has a track record of clamping down on free speech.“We remain committed to protecting the voices and data of people in Turkey who use Twitter. We will continue to be transparent about how we handle requests from government and law enforcement,” Twitter said.Turkey’s legal demands for content removal make up 31 percent of all requests globally, according to Twitter. The country has made some 45,800 demands and Twitter says it complied with about a third.The government insists the legislation is needed to combat cybercrime and to protect the rights of Turkish social media users.According to the Freedom of Expression Association, as of October 2020, more than 450,000 domains, 120,000 links and 42,000 tweets were blocked in Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-establish-legal-entity-in-turkey-comply-with-controversial-law-101616231068946.html
20-03-2021||World||'Should've already finished with this': As Covid-19 vaccinations lag, Italy's elderly pay a price||One year ago, Bergamo’s state-of-the-art Pope John XXIII Hospital verged on collapse as doctors struggled to treat 600 patients, with 100 of them in intensive care. Army trucks ferried the dead from the city’s overtaxed crematorium in images now seared into the collective pandemic memory.The picture is much improved now: The hospital is treating fewer than 200 virus patients, just one quarter of whom require intensive care.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here But still unchanged as Italy’s death rate pushes upward once again is that the victims remain predominantly elderly, with inoculation drives stumbling in the country and elsewhere in Europe.“No, this thing, alas, I was not able to protect the elderly, to make clear how important it would be to protect the elderly,’’ said Dr. Luca Lorini, head of intensive care at the hospital named for the mid-20th century pope born in Bergamo. “If I have 10 elderly people over 80 and they get COVID, in their age group, eight out of 10 die.”That was true in the first horrifying wave and remained “absolutely the same” in subsequent spikes, he said.Promises to vaccinate all Italians over 80 all by the end of March have fallen woefully short, amid well-documented interruptions of vaccine supplies and organizational shortfalls. Just a third of Italy’s 7.3 million doses administered so far have gone to that age group, with more than half of those who carry memories of World War II still awaiting their first jab.“We should have already finished with this,” Lorini told The Associated Press.Italy's new premier, Mario Draghi, pledged during a visit to Bergamo on Thursday that the vaccine campaign would be accelerated. His remarks came as he inaugurated a park to honor Italy's over 104,000 dead. Through early March, two-thirds of those deaths have been among those over 80.“We are here to promise our elderly that it will never happen again that fragile people are not adequately helped and protected. Only like this will we respect those who have left us,” Draghi said on the anniversary of the first army convoy carrying the virus dead from Bergamo.Italy can hope to see its future by looking to Britain, the first country in Europe to authorize widespread vaccinations. More than 38% of the U.K. population has been inoculated since early December, starting with those over 70, health care workers and staff of care homes.Britain, which leads Europe in virus deaths, has seen the percentage of fatalities among those over 75 diminish from 75% of the total before the vaccination campaign to 64% in the week ending March 5. Deaths across Britain have dropped from an average of 128 a day in the most recent seven-day period, from a high of 1,248 in the week ended Jan. 20 -- also thanks to lockdown measures.Along with health care workers, Spain, France and Italy prioritized vaccinating residents of nursing homes, by far the single hardest-hit population in the spring surge. They account for nearly a third of the dead in Italy’s first wave, and a third of France’s pandemic death toll of nearly 91,100.In France, Covid-19 infections and deaths in care homes have been steadily trending downward as the numbers of vaccinated has climbed, with 85% having received at least one shot. Early signs are that the proportion of ICU patients aged 75 and older has also started to decline since February, with nearly half in this age group at least partially vaccinated. The improved picture for residents of care homes comes despite a renewed worsening of France’s outbreak.Spain has seen a huge drop in infections and deaths in nursing homes, following the first phase of its vaccination program, with a significant decline in deaths.In Italy, where vaccinations of nursing home residents got under way in January, compared with mid-February for other elderly, lower infection rates in nursing homes have been declared “an early success.”“We cannot count it as a victory, absolutely not, of the vaccine strategy,” Dr. Giovanni Rezza, director of infectious diseases at the Health Ministry, acknowledged recently.Rezza said Friday that they aim to double the 200,000 daily vaccinations now that the AstraZeneca shot is being used again. Its use was suspended briefly after reports of blood clots in some recipients of the vaccine, even though international health agencies urged governments to press ahead with the shot, saying the benefits outweighed the risks.With Italy’s infection rate up for the seventh straight week propelled by the fast-moving U.K. variant, more than 2.5 million Italians over 80 are awaiting their shots. What’s worse, many still have no indication when they might get them.Luca Fusco founded a group to remember the dead and advocate for justice in their memory after his father died of Covid-19 on March 11, 2020.His mother, who celebrated her 83rd birthday on the anniversary of her husband’s death, still hasn’t received an appointment to be vaccinated more than a month after submitting a request. Fusco said that was true for most of the several hundred elderly in their small town near Bergamo, noting they were being required to travel 30 miles (20 kilometers) to get each shot, a burden for many.Italy’s aim is to vaccinate 80% of the population by September, and Draghi has appointed an army general to relaunch the campaign. Fusco said his group, “Noi Denunceremo,” (“We Will Denounce”) will act as a watchdog on the issue.“Draghi said that by September, we will all be vaccinated. Perfect,’’ Fusco said. “We have taken note of it. If this is not true, we will make our voices heard ... and we will ask Draghi for explanations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shouldve-already-finished-with-this-as-covid-19-vaccinations-lag-italy-s-elderly-pay-a-price-101616231409766.html

A police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder.Further protests followed, fuelled by anger over government plans to tighten the law on demonstrations.The group of lawmakers, including Conservative Member of Parliament Steve Baker, and Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said that protest should not be a criminal offence."We call on you to expressly exempt protests from restrictions on gatherings," they said in the letter, which was organised by campaign groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch.The interior ministry, known as the Home Office, said in response that the Covid-19 stay at home order remains in place until March 29, and once it ends protests can resume subject to agreed social-distancing measures."While we are still in a pandemic we continue to urge people to avoid mass gatherings, in line with wider coronavirus restrictions," a spokeswoman said.Police said that a significant operation will be in place in London to engage with people breaching Covid-19 regulations, adding that any protesters will be encouraged to return home or could face fines or arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-60-lawmakers-call-for-england-to-allow-protests-during-lockdown-101616231345266.html

The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.Experts who testified before the Congressional subcommittee were Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and Former Director of Policy Planning at the US Department of State; Randall G. Schriver; chairman of the Project 2049 Institute and Former Assistant Secretary of Defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs; and Nadege Rolland Senior Fellow for Political and Security Affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research.During the hearing, Bera noted that the US and China will get more competitive in the future. However, the US desire is not to have a direct confrontation and to use the rule of law as a foundation for a strategy in the Indo-Pacific.Congressman Stave Chabot, Ranking Member of Subcommittee and Co-Chair of the House India Caucus, queried from Schriver on how the US should partner with India for maintenance of international order in the region.In response, Schriver said he is optimistic about the US-India relations which have grown under all administrations especially in defence during the Obama administration. India and the US have a shared understanding of threats including from China and Pakistan, which is a close ally of China, he said.Shriver said that India can be a strong partner in Indian Ocean Region and can deter the Chinese from openly operating in the Indian Ocean. Schriver also welcomed the ongoing visit of defence secretary Lloyd Austin to India. Congressman Andy Barr, member House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Financial Services Committee called for partnership in the region to offer alternatives to Chinese technology especially in communications.In her intervention, Congresswoman Kathy Manning supported for the US to undertake immigration reform to attract more talent including through removal of country caps in H-1B visas and liberalised student visas in STEM areas.Hass said that the United States should collaborate with its partners to offer high-quality, sustainable infrastructure as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, possibly through a regional fund involving Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and European countries.“While India is an important partner, it is unlikely to become a formal ally. It wants to avoid a breakdown in its relations with China and will zealously guard its strategic autonomy while it focuses on managing its fraught relationship with Pakistan, its domestic development, and its border with China,” Hass said.Hass said that the announcement that the United States will work with members of the Quad to provide one billion COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asian nations is an innovative development and hopefully a preview of more to come.Applauding last week’s meeting of the Quad at the Presidential level, Schriver this week’s two plus two meetings with Japan and Korea, and Secretary Austin’s follow-on travel to India are also positive steps. The continued recognition of China as a strategic competitor and the need to partner with like-minded countries to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific set the appropriate vision, he said.Rolland told lawmakers that there is no “Indo-Pacific” in Beijing’s conception. The region is in fact included as part of China’s “periphery.”Here too, the term itself is very telling about the Chinese perspective: China is at the center and at the top of a 360-degree peripheral zone that expands over both the continental and maritime domains. Left unclear are the exact geographic extent of this “periphery” and the kind of future the Chinese party-state hopes to see for it, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-and-experts-support-historic-quad-leadership-summit-101616226839547.html
20-03-2021||World||Ex-Chinese officials see areas for co-operation after Alaska mess||After the first high-level US-China talks during the Biden administration ended with no agreements, some top former officials in Beijing still saw potential areas of cooperation to move the relationship forward.Speaking during the government-sponsored China Development Forum, top figures including a former vice foreign minister, a senior military adviser and a prominent academic on US-China relations all outlined areas the world’s biggest economies could work together even while expressing concern about the discussions in Alaska.US and Chinese officials traded barbs over two days of talks that ended on Friday in Anchorage, with no apparent progress over the numerous sources of tension between the two sides, including tariffs and human rights in Xinjiang to Hong Kong and cybersecurity. They left with no immediate plans for more talks.At the conference on Saturday organized by a unit of the State Council in Beijing, speakers from China called for pragmatic solutions to areas that affected both countries. Those included forming rules on emerging technology, people-to-people exchanges, coordination on monetary policy and reducing the risk of a military confrontation.Yao Yunzhu, senior adviser to the China Association of Military Sciences and a retired major general of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, said that the Anchorage talks illustrated the two sides cannot depend on “strategic trust” to prevent military conflicts.It is “paramount” that the nations take steps to improve military-related crisis-management regimes, including updating the codes of behavior governing close encounters, she said.Yao said China and the US should work together to set standards for emerging technologies such as space, cyber and artificial intelligence, especially on how they’re used by the military. “Excluding each other from this process will bring about grave consequences,” she said.‘Difficult Patch’Former Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying said that relations between the two countries are “in a difficult patch of sharp decline,” and she criticized the US “habit” of interfering in China’s internal affairs.“The Chinese side finds the wrong moves on the US side incomprehensible and unacceptable,” said Fu, who is currently chairperson for the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “The US have raised lots of opinions and arguments about China’s internal affairs. It seems that they know more about China than us -- they can do a better job in managing China.”Rebuilding the relationship would require the US to undo the damage caused by the Trump administration’s actions against China and for Washington to show Beijing greater understanding, said panelist Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies and director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.“The meeting this time doesn’t show this is the case because the US doesn’t show any sign of eradicating the toxicity from the Trump administration,” nor does it display any respect toward China, said Wu, who advises China’s Foreign Ministry.The conference also featured remarks from former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, both of whom attended online. American speakers said potential areas for cooperation included climate change and help for poorer nations.In his speech recorded before the Alaska talks, Kissinger said ties between the US and China would require both sides to make “ever more intensive efforts” to work together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchinese-officials-see-areas-for-co-operation-after-alaska-mess-101616226436807.html

The shooting took place in the Saleh Pat area of the city of Sukkur.Mirani said Lalwani was associated with the local Royal News? television station and a newspaper but that it wasn't immediately clear if he was killed because of his “professional duties."“We are looking into all aspects of the matter, collecting evidence from the scene and recording statements from witnesses to pinpoint the cause of the offense,” he said.The officer said witnesses saw a single gunman open fire on Lalwani but that other assailants could have been involved.The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the incident and demanded the culprits be brought to justice.“Police in Sindh province must waste no time investigating the killing of journalist Ajay Lalwani and apprehending those responsible,” said Steven Butler, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “It’s critical that the investigation be led by officers who are able to maintain public confidence, given the long history of tensions between local journalists and the police in Sukkur.”Ifran Ali Samo, Sukkur’s senior superintendent of police, announced the formation of a team to investigate the killing.Pakistan has long been a deadly country for journalists. In 2020, it ranked ninth on CPJ’s annual Global Impunity Index, which assesses countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go free, with 15 unsolved murders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-shot-dead-while-getting-haircut-says-police-101616225014988.html

20-03-2021||World||International pressure on Myanmar generals grows as two more killed in gunfire||Opponents of Myanmar's coup protested again on Saturday as international pressure on the military junta to halt its repression of pro-democracy supporters increased, with Asian neighbours joining Western countries in condemning lethal force.Two people were killed when soldiers opened fire overnight in the northern ruby-mining town of Mogok, the Myanmar Now news portal reported. That took the death toll since the Feb. 1 coup to 237, according to a tally by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.The bloodshed has not quelled the anger over the ouster of the elected government and the detention of its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, though some protest organisers say they have had to adapt their tactics."We protest where there are no police or military, then when we hear they're coming, we disperse quickly," campaigner Kyaw Min Htike told Reuters from Dawei in the south before he and others staged a brief rally outside the town centre."I don't want to lose a single one of my comrades but we'll protest any way we can until our revolution prevails."Dozens of protesters gathered in the second city of Mandalay, pictures from the Voice of Myanmar news portal showed. A similar number in the northeastern town of Kyaukme held up signs calling for outside intervention to end the violence.A small group held up a protest flag in Hpa-an in the east, social media images showed.There were no reports of violence.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday condemned what he denounced as the military's continuing brutal violence. A "firm, unified international response" was urgently needed, his spokesman quoted him as saying.U.N. rapporteur Tom Andrews called for sanctions in response to what he called the generals' ruthless attacks on the people. "The world must respond by cutting their access to money and weapons. Now," he wrote on Twitter.The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation condemning the coup, and lawmakers decried the increasingly harsh tactics against the demonstrators.Authorities have tightened restrictions on internet services, making information increasingly difficult to verify, and have clamped down on private media.Ambassadors of Western countries condemned as "immoral and indefensible" the violence in the Hlaing Tharyar industrial district of the commercial capital Yangon, where dozens were killed over several days after Chinese-owned garment factories were torched last weekend."Internet blackouts and suppression of the media will not hide the military's abhorrent actions," they said in a statement on Friday.ASIAN ANGERAsian neighbours, who have for years stuck to a code of not criticising each other's internal problems, have also been speaking out to urge an end to the violence.Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in some of the strongest comments yet by a regional leader, said he would ask Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to call an urgent meeting."Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately so that there are no more victims," Jokowi said in a virtual address.Backing Indonesia's call for a meeting, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said he was appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians."We in Malaysia, and the larger ASEAN community, cannot afford to see our brotherly nation of Myanmar become so destabilised at the hands of a selected few, who seek to promote their own vested interests," he said.Philippine foreign minister Teodoro Locsin said that ASEAN had to act. Singapore has also spoken out against the violence and the coup that triggered it, calling for the release of Suu Kyi.But the military has shown no sign of being swayed and has defended its takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that was under strict military rule from a 1962 coup until the generals began democratic reforms a decade ago.The junta says a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was fraudulent and its claims were ignored by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election but not set a date.Suu Kyi, 75, faces accusations of bribery and other crimes that could see her banned from politics and jailed if convicted.Her lawyer says the charges are trumped up. The Nobel peace laureate, who has campaigned for democracy in Myanmar for three decades, is being held at an undisclosed location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-pressure-on-myanmar-generals-grows-as-two-more-killed-in-gunfire-101616214997798.html

20-03-2021||World||Maninder Sidhu named as Canadian Parliamentary secretary||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named 36-year-old Indo-Canadian Maninder Sidhu, a first-term Parliament member, as a parliamentary secretary to international development minister Karina Gould.Sidhu, who was elected to the House of Commons for the first time in October 2019 from Brampton East, tweeted his appreciation for the appointment, saying he was “excited and truly honoured.” He replaces another Indo-Canadian lawmaker Kamal Khera, who resigned in January after it emerged that she had travelled to the US during the Christmas break even as the government warned against non-essential travel outside the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Sidhu, a Sikh with roots in Punjab, is an alumnus of the University of Waterloo. He is married and has two daughters. Sidhu ran a customs brokerage business before he entered politics.Sidhu’s appointment was part of a reshuffle that has led to the induction of new appointees and changes in some portfolios of the 38 parliamentary secretaries. There are also three Indo-Canadians in Trudeau’s Cabinet including defence minister Harjit Sajjan. Anita Anand is the public services and procurement minister. Bardish Chagger is the diversity and inclusion and youth minister.“Parliamentary secretaries support ministers to deliver real, positive results for Canadians. I am confident that this team’s dedication, skills, and experience will help us continue to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic, keep Canadians safe and supported, and build a more resilient Canada for everyone,” Trudeau said in a statement.Parliamentary secretaries form a link between ministries and Parliament. They also help with legislative business.Arif Virani is the other Indian-origin parliamentary secretary in the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maninder-sidhu-names-as-canadian-parliamentary-secretary-101616224893152.html
20-03-2021||World||A New Year dawns in Iran, but the country's crises remain the same||The Persian New Year, Nowruz, begins on the first day of spring and celebrates all things new. But as families across Iran hurried to greet the fresh start — eating copious crisp herbs, scrubbing their homes and buying new clothes — it was clear just how little the country had changed.A year into the coronavirus pandemic that has devastated Iran, killing over 61,500 people — the highest death toll in the Middle East — the nation is far from out of the woods. And although Iranians had welcomed the election of President Joe Biden with a profound sigh of relief after the Trump administration’s economic pressure campaign, the sanctions that have throttled the country for three years remain in place.“I was counting down the seconds to see the end of this year,” said Hashem Sanjar, a 33-year-old food delivery worker with a bachelor’s degree in accounting. “But I worry about next year.”Once again, Nowruz, a joyous two-week celebration rooted in gatherings — at homes, in parks and squares — will be stifled by the pandemic. Gone from Tehran’s streets are the performers dressed as “Hajji Firuz,” the ancient folk figure who dances, sings and bangs tambourines to ring in the holiday. Gone too are the usual piles of old furniture, which families can no longer afford to throw out for the new year.A nightly curfew in the capital forbids residents from venturing out after 9pm. Health officials are pleading with the public to stay home. And the government has banned travel to cities hardest-hit by the virus.Still, authorities will allow families to travel to the Caspian Sea and other vacation spots with lower infection rates, a bid to boost Iran’s slumping retail sales. Before the pandemic, domestic travel revenue accounted for an estimated $1.2 billion over the holiday. Police warned of heavy traffic from Tehran to the northern coast as residents hit the road.Last year as Nowruz approached, the country of 83 million had become a global epicenter of the coronavirus. The virus coursed across Iran as heads of shrines called on pilgrims to keep coming and authorities dismissed alarm over rising deaths. Desperate to salvage its ailing economy, the government resisted a nationwide lockdown, further spreading the disease.Now, the pain of the pandemic runs too deep to deny. The virus has touched all aspects of daily life, infecting some 1.78 million people, overwhelming hospitals, filling vast cemeteries and pummelling an economy already reeling from US sanctions.Iran’s economy shrank 5% last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Over 1 million people lost their jobs in 2020, reported the Interior Ministry. Inflation has soared to nearly 50% compared to 10% in 2018, before then-President Donald Trump withdrew from Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers and re-imposed sanctions. The prices of basic goods, including Nowruz staples like spiced nuts and clothes, have doubled or tripled.Casual laborers bear the brunt of the fallout. The poverty rate has surged to 55%. The government’s $40 stipends for poor families have failed to plug the gap.Payman Fadavi, a 48-year-old electronics shop owner in a Tehran mall, said he faces financial ruin.“The virus led to economic problems for the whole world, but in Iran it is worse, we are experiencing sanctions along with coronavirus,” he said, adding the pandemic forced him to fire most of his staff. “I think I have to close the store soon.”Rasul Hamdi, a 38-year-old cleaner, struggles because clients “wouldn’t let me come and clean their homes out of fear of the virus.” The outbreak has altered his life in other ways, as people around him fell ill. Now, all his next-door neighbors are gone — a whole family dead from Covid-19.Amid the misery, and despite the chilling rain, signs of life were returning to Tehran ahead of the holiday.Through pandemics, wars and disasters, the ancient Zoroastrian festival of Nowruz, or “New Day” in Farsi, has been celebrated continuously for over 3,000 years, predating the region’s Muslim conquest. Some 300 million people in Iran and beyond gather around tables replete with ancient symbols of renewal, prosperity and luck: green wheat sprouts, apples, gold coins and oranges or goldfish in bowls of water.This week, throngs of mask-clad shoppers packed the metro and jockeyed to buy last-minute gifts and sweets at Tehran's storied Grand Bazaar. In the northern Tajrish Square, vendors hawked candles and flowers, calling out wishes for a joyous new year. Even as the infection rates have dropped from peaks reached last fall, the crowded scenes pointed to pandemic fatigue and public intransigence rather than national recovery, especially as Iran’s vaccine rollout lags.Still waiting for big shipments from COVAX, the global initiative to provide doses to low- and middle-income countries, Iran so far has inoculated only several thousand health care and front-line workers. Around a hundred people continue to die of Covid-19 each day, according to government statistics. Daily infection counts have hovered at around 8,000 since the discovery of a fast-spreading variant earlier this year.Many in Iran find the seasonal symbols on their Nowruz tables in increasingly short supply. Hopes for a rapid return to the nuclear deal are dimming as the Biden administration, grappling with congressional opposition, a litany of higher priorities and pressure to wring more concessions from Iran, refuses to lift sanctions. The US insists that Iran come back into compliance with the nuclear accord first.As Iran's frustration deepens, the country is hurtling toward a different sort of renewal — a presidential election in mid-June. Disappointment with continued sanctions under relative moderate President Hassan Rouhani could play a critical role in the vote, said Behnam Maleki, a Tehran-based economist. Rouhani, who is term-limited from running again, faces strong opposition from hard-liners, narrowing the window for a diplomatic breakthrough with the USBut on Saturday at 1:07 p.m., the exact moment of the spring equinox, Iranian families will pay little heed to their country's mounting crises. Over hearty meals, they will embrace and kiss, hoping for better times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-year-dawns-in-iran-but-the-country-s-crises-remain-the-same-101616222932216.html
20-03-2021||World||Trudeau says ‘arbitrary’ detention of Canadians threatens China’s ties with West||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned Beijing that the arbitrary detention of two Canadians and the lack of transparency over their trial threatens China’s relations with Western nations. “Their arbitrary detention is completely unacceptable, as is the lack of transparency around these court proceedings,” he said at a daily media briefing on Friday.Businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were arrested in China days after a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, was detained in Vancouver in December 2018 for possible deportation to the US with relation to a case of alleged defrauding of a bank to sidestep sanctions against Iran. Spavor faced a trial in a Beijing court on Friday on charges of espionage and Kovrig’s hearing is scheduled for Monday.“China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians. It is about the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in,” said Trudeau. He referred to the “lack of transparency” with regard to the court proceedings in China and added that made it “extremely difficult to make judgments around whether or not the trial was fair.” Canadian diplomats were not granted access to the trial, nor were other Western envoys, 10 of whom from eight countries joined them outside the courthouse in solidarity.On Wednesday, Canadian foreign minister Marc Garneau said the detentions of the two Michaels were “arbitrary”. He added the government was “deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings.”In a reaction posted on the website of the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa on Friday, an unnamed spokesperson described Garneau’s statement as “fact-distorting” and expressed China’s “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to it.“We urge the Canadian side to earnestly respect China’s judicial sovereignty and stop making irresponsible remarks and interfering in China’s handling of cases in accordance with law in any form. It is imperative for the Canadian side to immediately correct its mistakes and release Meng Wanzhou and ensure her safe return to China,” the embassy said.It also indicated the link to the detention of Meng, though China has, in the past, denied the connection, accusing Canada of being “hypocritical and arrogant”. “When it comes to arbitrary detention, Ms Meng Wanzhou has been arbitrarily detained for over two years despite the fact that she hasn’t violated any Canadian law. This is arbitrary detention in every sense of the term,” the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-says-arbitrary-detention-of-canadians-threatens-china-s-ties-with-west-101616222732605.html
20-03-2021||World||UN says no international staff left in North Korea||A UN spokesman said the world body in North Korea has been left with no international staff, who are now working remotely.Despite claiming to be coronavirus free, North Korea has sealed off its borders as part of stringent anti-pandemic measures that also involved the departure of diplomats and foreign nationals.Earlier this week, the last remaining two international UN staffers, both with the World Food Program, reportedly left Pyongyang.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Friday in New York that the UN office remains open and functioning, and continues to work remotely for the benefit of the people of North Korea along with local staff.Dujarric said that after more than a year in North Korea, UN international staff had traveled home to visit their families and they are expected to return to Pyongyang as soon as the pandemic-related border closure is lifted for UN employees.Dujarric said that WFP operations will be handled by local staff in Pyongyang and international staff working remotely.Several U.N. agencies including WFP, WHO and UNICEF have offices in North Korea. But it's not clear how soon their international employees can return.Experts question North Korea's claim of zero cases. North Korea, whose public health care system remains in shambles, would be at risk of a humanitarian crisis if there is a major outbreak.An international health group established to promote global access to coronavirus vaccines said last month that North Korea could potentially receive 1.9 million doses of vaccines manufactured in India during the first half of the year. North Korea has about 26 million people.“The UN is working with the government in support of a COVAX vaccination campaign and hopes it will provide an opportunity for staff to return and to scale up our support,” Dujarric said.The pandemic border shutdown that has sharply shrunk North Korea’s external trade is a major blow to its fragile economy, along with U.N. sanctions and crops-killing natural disasters last year.“The strict Covid prevention measures have impacted humanitarian operations in (North Korea), causing reduced operational capacity, stock out of essential humanitarian supplies, and delayed delivery of humanitarian program,” Dujarric said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-no-international-staff-left-in-north-korea-101616220993839.html

Other executives who may also take the stand include those in charge of combating fraud on the App Store, facilitating payments, game development, marketing, and developer relations, according to a tentative list of Apple’s witnesses submitted to the court.“We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store,” the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. “By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.”The executives are expected testify live in person and Cook is scheduled for a total of 2 hours and 10 minutes, combining direct examination, cross examination, and re-direct examination. Federighi is listed at a total of 3 hours and 10 minutes, while Schiller, who runs the App Store, will be available for 11 hours, according to the list.Epic’s witness list includes many of its senior executives, including CEO Tim Sweeney. The list also includes three notable former Apple executives as third-party witnesses: Scott Forstall, former head of iOS software engineering, Ron Okamoto, ex-head of developer relations, and Phillip Shoemaker, who ran app review.Apple and Epic are nearing a trial after Epic sued over the removal of its hit game Fortnite from the App Store. Apple removed the game for circumventing its in-app-purchase rules. Apple countersued Epic involving the game maker’s income from not using its in-app-purchase system, which charges a 30% fee per transaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apples-cook-other-senior-leaders-to-testify-in-fortnite-trial-101616218646037.html

The country did not provide any reason for the withdrawal, but last year officials in Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AK) said that the government had been considering pulling out of the accord. After the country's withdrawal, family, labour and social policies minister Zehra Zumrat said on Twitter, “The guarantee of women’s rights is the current regulations in our bylaws, primarily our Constitution. Our judicial system is dynamic and strong enough to implement new regulations as needed.”What is the Istanbul convention?The Istanbul convention is a human rights treaty which was opened for signature on May 11, 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey. The treaty, of which 44 countries and the European Union is a part, came into force on August 1, 2014. The convention, the first legally- binding instrument, creates a framework to combat violence against women which includes physical violence, psychological violence, stalking, sexual violence, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced abortion and sexual harassment as well.What have Erdogan’s critics said?The Opposition CHP party has criticised Erdogan for the move. Gokce Gokcen, deputy chairman of the CHP, tweeted that abandoning the treaty meant "keeping women second class citizens and letting them be killed."Critics of Erdogan’s decision have said that the withdrawal from the pact would not only reduce Turkey’s chances to join the European Union but would also increase violence against women in the country, as per a report in Reuters. Turkey has remained a candidate to join the European Union since 2005. On the other hand, World Health Organisation's (WHO) data showed that 38 per cent of women in Turkey are subject to violence from a partner in their lifetime, Reuters added in its report.Is Turkey the first country to take this step?No, other countries have also taken similar steps with regards to the convention. In 2018, Bulgaria adopted a proposal to ratify the convention but was postponed after widespread backlash. In 2020, Slovakia rejected the convention and pulled out of it. In 2020, both Poland and Hungary also said that they would withdraw from the treaty.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-the-european-treaty-on-violence-against-women-which-erdogan-quit-101616219317616.html
20-03-2021||World||US is ‘fundamentally at odds’ with China, says top American diplomat||The United States and China are “fundamentally at odds”, American Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday after the conclusion of two days of talks, he and National Secretary Adviser Jake Sullivan, held with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska.Blinken also said the Chinese were “defensive” when the US side confronted them with “concerns” about Muslim-majority Xinjiang province, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan.Blinken and Sullivan met China’s Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi, who is the top Chinese diplomat and State Councilor Wang Yi over Thursday and Friday in a first high-level meeting between the two countries after President Joe Biden took office.The meetings were expected to be contentious as they took place in the shadow of the first sanctions recently imposed by the Biden administration on China over Hong Kong.But fireworks started early during the opening remarks, usually an occasion for perfunctory diplomatic homilies. Blinken set the tone, bluntly raising US “concerns” over Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan. Yang led the Chinese pushback with a long criticism of the US on democratic values and human rights.Asked about the dust-up in Anchorage, President Biden told reporters, “I’m very proud of the secretary of state.”In launching a frontal attack on the Chinese during the opening remarks, Blinken, a close foreign policy aide to Biden going back decades, took a risk, not anticipating Director Yang’s long rebuke going way over two minutes allotted to every speaker by mutual consent. Blinken and Sullivan retaliated by allowing themselves, as hosts, a second round of remarks. And they used that additional time for more plain-speaking. Blinken warned the Chinese against betting against the US and Sullivan chided them for their lack of confidence in dealing with criticism. The American side dug in on that theme in remarks, wrapping up the meet. “We certainly know and knew going in that there are a number of areas where we are fundamentally at odds, including China’s actions in Xinjiang, with regard to Hong Kong, Tibet, increasingly Taiwan, as well as actions that it’s taken in cyberspace,” Blinken told reporters.The top American diplomat had raised these issues in his opening remarks on Thursday that had infuriated the Chinese. Blinken doubled down on it in his Friday remarks and also challenged the Chinese to grow up, in regard to criticism, building on Sullivan’s taunt from the Thursday dust-up.“A confident country is able to look hard at its own shortcomings and constantly seek to improve,” Sullivan had said.But the Americans also underscored areas of cooperation with China going forward. “On Iran, on North Korea, on Afghanistan, on climate, our interests intersect,” Blinken said, adding, and highlighting in the same breath the differences.“On economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-is-fundamentally-at-odds-with-china-says-top-american-diplomat-101616219072428.html
20-03-2021||World||Spa shootings could be first test of Georgia hate crimes law||The murder case against a white man charged with shooting and killing six women of Asian descent and two other people at Atlanta-area massage businesses this week could become the first big test for Georgia’s new hate crimes law.Robert Aaron Long, 21, told police that the attacks Tuesday at two spas in Atlanta and another massage business near suburban Woodstock were not racially motivated and claimed to have a sex addiction. Authorities said he apparently lashed out at what he saw as sources of temptation but were still investigating his motive.Because most of the victims were women of Asian descent, there's skepticism of that explanation and public clamoring for hate crime charges, especially among the Asian American community, which has faced rising numbers of attacks since the coronavirus pandemic took hold.But, like many states, the Georgia law enacted last summer does not provide for a standalone hate crime, instead allowing an additional penalty when a person is convicted of another crime.“It's not something you get arrested for. It's a sentence enhancer,” said Pete Skandalakis, a former prosecutor and executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia.The law says an additional penalty can be applied for certain crimes if they are motivated by a victim's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, or mental or physical disability. Even before the law passed amid the national reckoning over racial injustice, the pandemic had largely paused court cases, so Skandalakis said he doesn’t believe the rule has been used yet.A hate crime charge can be included in an indictment or added at some point before trial. If a jury convicts the defendant of the underlying crime, prosecutors can present evidence for a hate crime sentencing enhancement. Defense attorneys can present their own evidence, and the jury deliberates again. If jurors find it's a hate crime, there is a mandatory enhancement of at least two years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 for a felony.The federal government and some other states go further with laws that criminalize bias-motivated violence without requiring a conviction on an underlying crime.The U.S. Department of Justice could choose to bring federal hate crime charges independently of the state prosecutions. Federal investigators have not yet uncovered evidence to prove Long targeted the victims because of their race, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The officials had direct knowledge of the investigation but were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.In Georgia, the minimum sentence for murder is life in prison, with or without the possibility of parole after 30 years. Prosecutors also can seek the death penalty if the killing meets certain requirements.Long has been charged with eight counts of murder, and it will be up to Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to decide whether to pursue the hate crime enhancement.Wallace said in a statement that she can't answer specific questions about the case but that she is “acutely aware of the feelings of terror being experienced in the Asian-American community.” A representative for Willis did not respond to requests for comment.Given that someone convicted of multiple murders is unlikely to be released from prison, an argument could be made that it's not worth the effort, time and expense to pursue a hate crime designation that carries a relatively small additional penalty.But Republican state Rep. Chuck Efstration, who sponsored the legislation, said it's not just about the punishment.“It is important that the law calls things what they are,” he said. “It’s important for victims, and it’s important for society.”And the law needs to be used to give it teeth, said state Sen. Michelle Au, a Democrat who is Chinese American.Au believes there has been some resistance nationwide to charge attacks against Asian Americans as hate crimes because they are seen as “model minorities,” a stereotype that they are hard-working, educated and free of societal problems. She said she heard from many constituents in the last year that Asian Americans — and people of Chinese descent in particular — were suffering from bias because the coronavirus had emerged in China and then-President Donald Trump used racial terms to describe it.“People feel like they’re getting gaslighted because they see it happen every day,” she said. “They feel very clearly that it is racially motivated, but it’s not pegged or labeled that way. And people feel frustrated by that lack of visibility and that aspect being ignored.”In addition to sending a message to the community, it's important for the new law to be used for legal reasons, Georgia State University law professor Tanya Washington said. While police have said it's too soon to tell whether the spa shootings qualify as a hate crime, she said it seems obvious the violence was motivated by bias given the people and businesses targeted.“Unless we test it with cases like this one, we won't have a body of law around how do you prove bias motivated the behavior,” she said.The Georgia law also mandates collecting and reporting data on hate crimes investigated by law enforcement, which allows tracking and proper allocation of resources, Washington said.Georgia was one of only four states without a hate crimes law when lawmakers quickly passed it last year in the wake of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and national protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was pursued and fatally shot while running near coastal Brunswick in February 2020. Three white men were charged with murder after video of the killing emerged months later.Georgia’s Supreme Court had overturned an earlier hate crimes statute in 2004, saying it was too broad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spa-shootings-could-be-first-test-of-georgia-hate-crimes-law-101616216795359.html

He cited rising geopolitical tensions that threaten to hurt global economic growth and financial stability as the major reasons for better cooperation.On monetary policy, it’s also very important for the two sides to work closely, he said, adding they should coordinate if any further stimulus package is planned since inflation is coming back faster and stronger than expected.Other areas of collaboration include global trade, governance issues and the digital economy, he said.Zhu, who was also previously deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, is currently the chairman of the National Institution of Financial Research at Tsinghua University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-should-cooperate-on-supply-chains-ex-imf-official-101616215626847.html
20-03-2021||World||Critics of Brazil's president Bolsonaro being targeted by security law||Police in Brazil are starting to employ a dictatorship-era national security law against critics of President Jair Bolsonaro, while lawyers and activists rally to provide them with legal help and accuse the government of trying to silence dissent.On Friday, demonstrators challenged police in the capital by parading with anti-Bolsonaro signs a day after four protesters were detained. They had called the president “genocidal” for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and displayed a cartoon depicting him next to a Nazi swastika. Officers took no action Friday as about 40 people protested for an hour.The national security law, which dates from 1983, near the end of the country's military dictatorship, makes it a crime to harm the heads of the three branches of government or expose them to danger. The vague measure has recently been used to detain or investigate Bolsonaro critics.Geography teacher Katia Garcia said she showed up in front of the president's office Friday because the arrests had inspired her.“They were jailed because the description ‘genocidal’ suits our president very well,” Garcia said, wearing a face mask and face shield. “He has contributed to our health care system collapsing, for the lack of vaccines. Police can’t silence us.”There have been previous news-making charges against prominent critics of the president, including a newspaper columnist, a political cartoonist and a popular YouTube star, but the law is increasingly being employed against ordinary citizens. Courts haven't upheld any of the arrests so far, but lawyers are expressing alarm that the tactic is becoming commonplace.Both demonstrations in Brasilia called for Bolsonaro’s impeachment due to his administration’s alleged failings in the pandemic, which has caused almost 290,000 deaths in Brazil. The country has reported nearly 3,000 deaths each day this week.On several instances, the president has complained that he is being unfairly vilified, most recently Thursday night during a live Facebook broadcast.“They call me a dictator. I want you to point at one thing I did in two years and two months that was autocratic,” he said while complaining about a newspaper column that used the word genocidal to describe him.Brasilia police said Thursday that the four detained protesters violated the national security law “as they showed a Swastika in association to the symbol of the president of the Republic.” But Brazil’s federal police force, which decides whether cases brought by local police deserve to go ahead in national security crimes, dismissed the case and released three of the four demonstrators. One was held on an outstanding warrant from a previous case.Federal police have conducted more than 80 investigations under the security law during Bolsonaro's first two years, and more than 10 in the first 45 days of 2021, according to the newspaper O Globo. The yearly average before the conservative leader took office was 11.The cases appear to almost entirely target Bolsonaro’s critics, human rights organizations and activists say.One case last year involved a sociologist and a businessman who paid for two billboards that insulted Bolsonaro by saying he wasn't worth a gnawed piece of fruit. That investigation was requested by Justice Minister André Mendonça, who called it a crime against the president’s reputation. It was dismissed in October.On Friday night, unsuccessful presidential candidate Ciro Gomes said the federal police are investigating him for calling the president “a thief” in a radio interview in November. The request for the probe was signed by Bolsonaro himself, Gomes said on his social media channels.“I don't particularly care about this act against me, but I think it is serious that Bolsonaro tries to intimidate opponents and adversaries,” the left-leaning Gomes said.On Monday, police invoked the national security law to force Felipe Neto, a popular YouTuber, to give testimony after he referred to Bolsonaro as "genocidal" in one of his broadcasts. Federal police dismissed the case two days later amid a public outcry.Neto, who was named by Time magazine lasts year as one of the world's 100 most influential people, was also targeted in November with allegations of corrupting minors. Those charges were also dropped.“From the start, I knew that this attempt at intimidation was not aimed at scaring me. It was to scare the Brazilian people,” Neto told The Associated Press by phone.“I have means to defend myself, but most teachers, journalists and members of civil society do not,” added Neto, who this week set up a legal defense fund to help anyone who faces similar charges for criticizing Bolsonaro and needs an attorney.O Globo said in an editorial Friday that the spirit of the national security law runs counter to Brazil’s constitution in the promotion of civil liberties.“The national security law should be revoked and replaced by a more modern tool that is capable of reconciliating the protection of the rule of law and the respect to individual rights,” the newspaper said. “Among those are the full — and essential — freedom of speech.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critics-of-brazil-s-president-bolsonaro-being-targeted-by-security-law-101616215328644.html

20-03-2021||World||2 journalists detained as Myanmar junta clamps down on press||Two more journalists were detained in Myanmar on Friday, part of the junta’s intensifying efforts to choke off information about resistance to last month’s coup.Mizzima News reported that one of its former reporters, Than Htike Aung, and Aung Thura, a journalist from the BBC’s Burmese-language service, were detained by men who appeared to be plainclothes security agents outside a court in the capital of Naypyitaw.The journalists were covering legal proceedings against Win Htein, a detained senior official from the National League for Democracy, the party that ran the country before the takeover.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. In the face of persistent strikes and protests against the takeover, the junta has responded with an increasingly violent crackdown and efforts to severely limit the information reaching the outside world. Security forces have fired on crowds, killing hundreds, internet access has been severely restricted, private newspapers have been barred from publishing, and protesters, journalists and politicians have been arrested in large numbers.About 40 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, with roughly half still in detention, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press.The increasingly brutal measures taken by the junta drew condemnation from a group of ambassadors from Western countries Friday as well as unusually strong rebukes from leaders in Indonesia and Malaysia.A statement from the BBC said it is “extremely concerned” that Aung Thura had been taken away by unidentified men.“The BBC takes the safety of all its staff in Myanmar very seriously and we are doing everything we can to find Aung Thura,” the organization said, adding that he was an accredited journalist with many years of reporting experience. It called on the authorities “to help locate him and confirm that he is safe.”The reporters were taken into custody a day after Kyi Toe, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy, was arrested, according to a Facebook post by Phyo Zeya Thaw, a party official.Kyi Toe had been a major source of information in the early days following the Feb. 1 coup, after the ousted civilian government's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior officials were detained. The takeover came the same day that newly elected lawmakers were supposed to take take their seats in Parliament.Amid a crackdown on the press, no privately owned newspapers were published this past week for the first time in eight years, following bans and voluntary suspensions. The military government also has banned at least five local news organizations from disseminating information on any platform, but its orders were mostly ignored.Restrictions on the internet have also been in place since shortly after the coup, including a blockage of mobile internet access. Broadband Wi-Fi service remains available, though spotty.Despite a crackdown that has killed more than 200 demonstrators so far, protesters were back in the streets Friday morning in several cities and towns. Some rallies proceeded without violence, but in Aungban town in eastern Shan state, online Tachileik News Agency reported that at least seven people were injured when security forces sought to break up their march using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition.Eleven News, a major media group in Myanmar, reported on Twitter that seven people had been killed in Aungban, but that death toll could not immediately be confirmed, though photos of at least one of the victims were posted on social media.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners reported that as of Thursday, it had verified 224 killings linked to the coup’s aftermath, more than half of them in Yangon, the biggest city. It said 2,258 people have been arrested or charged, with 1,938 still detained or evading arrest.Andrew Kirkwood, the acting U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, said those killed included at least 15 children, some as young as 14. ”Many people were shot in the head by snipers during peaceful demonstrations," he said in a video briefing to U.N. correspondents in New York.Kirkwood said security forces arrested at least 2,400 people — a slightly higher number than was reported by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.“The vast majority of these people are held incommunicado still, and there are increasing reports of sexually based violence against them,” he said.A group of ambassadors from Western countries called the violence “immoral and indefensible” in a statement Friday.“Internet blackouts and the suppression of the media will not hide the military’s abhorrent actions,” read the statement from ambassadors to Myanmar from the European Union, several EU countries, Britain and the United States.Myanmar's neighbors had been more tentative in their response. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo issued a strong statement on Friday, urging a halt to violence and asking other regional leaders to hold a summit on the crisis.“Indonesia urges that the use of violence in Myanmar be stopped immediately to avoid more victims. The safety and welfare of the people must be a top priority,” Widodo said in a televised address. “Indonesia also urges dialogue and reconciliation to be carried out immediately to restore democracy, peace and stability in Myanmar."Malaysia’s Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin supported Widodo's call for an ASEAN summit, saying he was “appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians, which has resulted in a high number of deaths and injuries, as well as suffering across the nation.”“The military leadership in Myanmar is strongly urged to change its course, and choose a path towards peaceful solutions,” said Muhyiddin. “We in Malaysia, and the larger ASEAN community, cannot afford to see our brotherly nation of Myanmar become so destabilized at the hands of a selected few, who seek to promote their own vested interests."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-journalists-detained-as-myanmar-junta-clamps-down-on-press-101616202941131.html

After a five-day trial, the jurors in Texas ordered Apple to pay a running royalty, which is generally dependent on the level of sales or usage.Apple said it was disappointed with the ruling and would appeal.“Cases like this, brought by companies that don’t make or sell any products, stifle innovation and ultimately harm consumers,” the company said in an emailed statement.The lawsuit was originally filed in 2015, but Apple challenged the validity of the patent at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. A U.S. appeals court last year reversed the board’s decision that certain patent claims were invalid, thus reviving the case for trial.U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap last week also adopted a magistrate’s recommendation denying Apple’s request to find the patent invalid.Google and its YouTube service won a patent trial lodged by Personalized Media in November over different patents.A case against Netflix is pending in New York.The case is Personalized Media Communications LLC v.

20-03-2021||World||Modi and Austin discuss Indo-Pacific, defence ties||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed bilateral, regional and global issues on Friday, reflecting efforts by the two sides to bolster cooperation as the Biden administration moves to counter an increasingly aggressive China.Austin flew into India on the final leg of a three-nation tour that has already taken him to Japan and Korea, and is the first senior leader of the new US administration to make an in-person visit to the country. After meeting Modi, Austin also held talks with national security adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval.He arrived in New Delhi hours after a meeting between the foreign ministers and NSAs of US and China in Alaska got off to a bumpy start, with testy exchanges between the two sides in full view of the media. US secretary of state Antony Blinken alluded to China’s aggressive actions when he said a world in which “might makes right” would be “far more violent and unstable”.Modi tweeted after his meeting with Austin that “India and [the] US are committed to our strategic partnership that is a force for global good”. He added that he had conveyed his best wishes to US President Joe Biden.The discussions between Modi and Austin covered bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava tweeted. He described the India-US relationship as a “strategic partnership of global siggnificance”.Modi outlined his vision for the strategic partnership between the two countries and emphasised the key role of defence cooperation in bilateral ties. Austin reiterated the US administration’s continued commitment to strengthening defence ties and expressed a desire to enhance the strategic partnership for peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, according to an Indian government statement.The Prime Minister also said the “warm and close relationship” between the two sides is “rooted in shared values of democracy, pluralism and commitment to a rules-based order”.A US readout said Austin commended India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific and growing engagement with like-minded partners across the region to promote shared goals.“The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to promote a free and open regional order. Both sides exchanged perspectives on shared challenges confronting the region and committed to further strengthen their broad ranging and robust defence cooperation,” the readout said.In a tweet posted shortly after his arrival, Austin said: “The breadth of cooperation between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defense partnership, as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh, who will hold talks with Austin on Saturday, welcomed his US counterpart in a tweet: “Your visit to India is definitely going to further deepen the cooperation and partnership between India and the United States. Looking forward to our meeting tomorrow.”Austin was received at Palam airport by senior Indian military officials and American diplomats. He is also the first US leader to visit India after the first leaders’ summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on March 12, when the four countries committed themselves to working for a free and open Indo-Pacific.The people cited above said measures to boost the India-US strategic partnership, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, the India-China standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the situation in Afghanistan and the sales of US weapons systems are expected to figure in the talks between the two sides on Saturday.Among the defence deals expected to be discussed is India’s plan to acquire 30 armed drones at an estimated cost of more than $3 billion.However, ahead of Austin’s visit, senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote a letter to the defence secretary and urged him to take up with Indian leaders the issue of India acquiring the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, as well as democracy and human rights issues.The US has imposed sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for purchasing the S-400 system. India inked a deal with Russia in 2018 to buy five S-400 air systems and deliveries are expected to begin this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/modi-and-austin-discuss-indo-pacific-defence-ties-101616205741543.html

20-03-2021||World||Judge won't move trial in Floyd's death; 13th juror picked||A judge said Friday he won’t delay or move the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in George Floyd’s death over concerns that a $27 million settlement for Floyd’s family could taint the jury pool, but he’ll allow limited evidence from a 2019 arrest.Jury selection in the trial of Derek Chauvin will stretch into a third week after attorneys seated just one additional juror Friday. The 13th juror picked is a woman who said she’d seen only clips of the video of Floyd’s arrest and needs to learn more about what happened beforehand.Late Friday, the court said up to 16 jurors would be chosen. An earlier court order in November had said as many as four alternates would be picked, but once Chauvin’s trial was separated from the trial of three other former officers charged in Floyd’s death, the court had said only two alternates would be chosen for this case.Seven jurors had been picked last week when the Minneapolis City Council announced it had unanimously approved the massive payout to settle a civil rights lawsuit over Floyd’s death. Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, subsequently sought to halt or move the trial, saying the settlement timing was deeply disturbing and jeopardized Chauvin’s chance for a fair trial. Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter.But Cahill, who called the timing “unfortunate,” said he believed a delay would do nothing to stem the problem of pretrial publicity, and that there’s no place in Minnesota untouched by that publicity.The judge handed the defense a victory by ruling that the jury can hear evidence from Floyd’s 2019 arrest, but only information possibly pertaining to the cause of his death in 2020. He acknowledged several similarities between the two encounters, including that Floyd swallowed drugs after police confronted him.The judge previously said the earlier arrest could not be admitted, but he reconsidered after drugs were found in January in a second search of the police SUV that the four officers attempted to put Floyd in last year. The defense argues that Floyd’s drug use contributed to his death.Cahill said he'd allow medical evidence of Floyd's physical reactions, such as his dangerously high blood pressure when he was examined by a paramedic in 2019, and a short clip of an officer’s body camera video. He said Floyd’s “emotional behavior,” such as calling out to his mother, won’t be admitted.But Cahill said he doesn’t plan to allow the testimony of a forensic psychiatrist for the prosecution. Floyd said he had claustrophobia and resisted getting into the squad car before the fatal encounter last year, and the state wanted Dr. Sarah Vinson to testify that his actions were consistent with a normal person experiencing severe stress, as opposed to faking or resisting arrest.The judge said he would reconsider allowing her as a rebuttal witness if the defense somehow opens the door, but allowing her to testify could usher in all of the evidence from Floyd’s 2019 arrest."Clearly there is a cause of death issue here, and it is highly contested,” Cahill said, noting that both arrests involved Floyd's cardiac problems and ingesting drugs.The county medical examiner classified Floyd’s death as a homicide in an initial summary that said he “had a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by police.” Floyd was declared dead at a hospital 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) from where he was restrained.The full report said he died of “cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” A summary report listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use under “other significant conditions” but not under “cause of death.”The earlier arrest lends more weight to the defense plan to argue that Floyd put his life in danger by swallowing drugs again and that, combined with his health problems, caused his death, said Ted Sampsell-Jones, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law.“Jurors are not supposed to be influenced by that sort of thing, but they are human,” Sampsell-Jones said.Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee on his neck for about nine minutes while he was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn’t breathe. Floyd’s death, captured on a widely seen bystander video, set off weeks of sometimes violent protests across the country and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.The 13 jurors seated through Friday are split by race: Seven are white, four are Black and two are multiracial, according to the court.It's unclear which jurors would be alternates. Legal experts said it's almost always the last people chosen, but the court said that wouldn’t necessarily be the case for Chauvin’s jury. Spokesman Kyle Christopherson said alternates could be chosen “many different ways,” but declined to give details.“You can see in this case why (Cahill) might want to do something different, like draw numbers from a hat,” said Sampsell-Jones. He said the judge needs all jurors to pay attention and wouldn't want anyone to learn they are alternates through the media.The woman picked Friday — a white woman in her 50s — said she's never seen police officers use more force with Black people or minorities than with white people, and that there's nothing to fear from police if people cooperate and comply with commands. She stopped short of saying an uncooperative person deserves to be harmed.“If you’re not listening to what the commands are, obviously something else needs to happen to resolve the situation,” she said of officers’ actions. “I don’t know how far the steps need to go.”Several potential jurors were dismissed Friday, including a college student who attended protests that called for Chauvin and the other officers to be fired and charged, and one man who said he’d have a hard time believing testimony of Minneapolis police officers, because he believes they might try to cover up something.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-won-t-move-trial-in-floyd-s-death-13th-juror-picked-101616197073946.html
20-03-2021||World||Mexico launches crackdown on migrant smuggling||In a rare show of force Friday, Mexico sent hundreds of immigration agents, police and National Guard officers marching through the streets of the capital of the southern state of Chiapas to launch an operation to crack down on migrant smuggling.The parade Friday in the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez came one day after Mexico announced it was banning entry for nonessential travel on its southern border with Guatemala to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The restrictions went into effect Friday.Mexico will deploy checkpoints and drones and station officers along the Suchiate River, which marks part of the border, to deter irregular entry. The crackdown is especially aimed at people travelling with minors.“The Mexican government will carry out ... operations on the southern border to protect the rights and safety of migrant minors from several Central American nations who are used by criminal networks as a passport to reach northern Mexico,” Mexico’s National Immigration Institute said in a statement.The institute said that since the beginning of the year, 4,180 minors, both accompanied and unaccompanied, had been found in Mexico without proper travel documents. Most came from Central America.The institute said adults traveling with the minors said “guides” had advised them having children along would make it easier to enter Mexico and the U.S.The institute said detentions actually began Thursday, when three freight trucks were stopped at a roadside inspection checkpoint near Tuxtla Gutierrez and a total of 329 Central American migrants were found crowded inside the vehicles.The institute said 114 of the migrants were unaccompanied children, five were members of one family. Most were from Guatemala, and the remainder were from Honduras.Mexico staged similar but smaller shows of force last year to discourage migrant caravans from trying to enter from Central America.On Thursday, the United States said it would send 2.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to Mexico, where officials said Friday that the shipment would include 2.7 million doses but were coy about whether the two events were related.Mexican officials struggled to explain why the measure was announced now, more than a year after the start of the pandemic.Mexico’s assistant health secretary, Hugo López-Gatell, acknowledged Thursday that the decision was triggered by the increasing number of migrants entering from Central America.“There was a verifiable increase in local inflows, particularly from Central America,” López-Gatell said when asked about the timing.Mexico and the United States long ago imposed similar restrictions on Mexico’s northern border. But Mexico had previously been unwilling to impose them on the southern border or most flights entering Mexico.The restrictions coincide with a huge uptick in the number of Central American migrants reaching the U.S border through Mexico. The number of migrants attempting to cross the U.S. border has been growing since April, with the 100,441 reported last month the highest level since March 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-launches-crackdown-on-migrant-smuggling-101616199086010.html

The eruption followed thousands of small earthquakes that have occurred in the area in the recent weeks and occurred near Fagradalsfjall which is a mountain on the Reykjanes Peninsula, located around 30 km south-west of the capital, according to a report in Reuters. IMO said that the eruption posed no immediate danger to people or infrastructure.A volcanic eruption started this evening at 20:45 near Fagradalsfjall in Geldingadalur. The eruption is considered small at this stage and the eruptive fissure is app. 500 m long. The magma area is app. 1km2. Lava fountains are small. #eruption #ReykjanesSeveral photos shared on social media showed smoke rising from the lava streams which are glowing brightly thus resulting in a bright red night sky. The meteorological office also warned people falling rocks and boulders as well as landslides. However, the eruption is not expected to release much ash or smoke.Our photographer @artbicnick caught this stunning image of the eruption. Despite its appearance, this #eruption poses little harm to us here in #Iceland. pic.twitter.com/7MqsZWmlV6Earthquakes in IcelandThe eruption followed an earthquake of 3.1 magnitude on the Richter scale. More than 40,000 earthquakes have been recorded on the peninsula in the past four weeks, which was being considered as an indication by scientists that a volcanic eruption might take place soon. Iceland is prone to earthquakes as it is located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates which make it a hotspot as the two plates continuously move in the opposite direction.The eruption in 2010The 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruptions in the country halted approximately 900,000 flights across Europe and caused significant damage to infrastructure in the country. The eruptions were a series of volcanic events with small volcanic eruptions for a long period of time. They started in April 2020 for a period of six days and then continued for several months. Just during the initial six days, the ash from the volcanic eruption covered large areas of Northern Europe because of which about 20 countries closed their airspace. affecting approximately 10 million travellers. Although, the Fagradalsfjall eruption is not expected to be like the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption, according to the IMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-weeks-of-seismic-activity-volcano-erupts-near-iceland-s-capital-reykjavik-101616202992751.html

20-03-2021||World||Biden, Harris offer solace, denounce racism in Atlanta visit||President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris offered solace to Asian Americans and denounced the scourge of racism at times hidden “in plain sight” as they visited Atlanta on Friday, just days after a white gunman killed eight people, most of them Asian American women.Addressing the nation after a roughly 80-minute meeting with Asian American state legislators and other leaders, Biden said it was “heart-wrenching” to listen to their stories of the fear among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders amid what he called a “skyrocketing spike” of harassment and violence against them.“We have to change our hearts," he said. "Hate can have no safe harbor in America.”Biden called on all Americans to stand up to bigotry when they see it, adding: “Our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit.”“They’ve been attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed; they’ve been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed," Biden said of Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic.The president also called the shootings an example of a “public health crisis of gun violence in this country,” as his administration has come under scrutiny from some in his own party for not moving as swiftly as promised on reforming the nation's gun laws.Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to hold national office, said that while the motive of the shooter remains under investigation, these facts are clear: Six of the eight killed were of Asian descent and seven of them were women.“Racism is real in America. And it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too,” she said. “The president and I will not be silent. We will not stand by. We will always speak out against violence, hate crimes and discrimination, wherever and whenever it occurs.”She added that everyone has “the right to be recognized as an American. Not as the other, not as them. But as us.”Before leaving Washington, Biden declared his support for the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, a bill that would strengthen the government’s reporting and response to hate crimes and provide resources to Asian American communities.Georgia state Rep. Marvin Lim, who was among a group of Asian American leaders who met with Biden and Harris in Atlanta, said the group "didn’t really talk about hate crime sentencing and all of these things there’s been a lot of discussion around.“We really talked about the grief people are feeling, the fear people are feeling, the possible responses to that,” Lim said. “The discussion felt very affirming."State Sen. Michelle Au, a Chinese American Democrat who represents parts of Atlanta’s northern suburbs, was moved by the presence of Harris, saying: “Not only that she was there listening to us, but that she also understood these issues in a very intimate way, that in some ways you can’t teach, that you can’t teach that sort of lived experience. So we felt that she was going to be an incredible advocate on our behalf in the White House.”Their trip was planned before the shooting, as part of a victory lap aimed at selling the benefits of pandemic relief legislation. But Biden and Harris instead spent much of their visit consoling a community whose growing voting power helped secure their victory in Georgia and beyond.Activists have seen a rise of racist attacks. Nearly 3,800 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since March 2020.Biden and Harris both implicitly criticized former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus.”“For the last year we’ve had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian Americans,” said Harris, “people with the biggest pulpits, spreading this kind of hate.”"We’ve always known words have consequences," Biden said. "It is the ‘coronavirus.’ Full stop.”In his first primetime address to the nation as president last Thursday — five days before the Atlanta killings at three metro-area massage businesses — Biden called attacks on Asian Americans “un-American.”Biden also used the visit to tour the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he received a briefing on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic and delivered a pep talk to the agency’s scientists.“We owe you a gigantic debt of gratitude and we will for a long, long, long time,” Biden said, adding that under his administration "science is back” driving policy to combat the virus.Though the originally planned political event to tout the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill has been delayed, Biden still met with Georgia voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, Democrats’ likely 2022 candidate for governor, as Republicans in the state legislature push several proposals to make it harder to vote in the state.“The battle for the right to vote is never, ever over,” Biden said. “It’s not over here in this state of Georgia. So we’re gonna fight again."He also met with newly minted Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.As the fastest-growing racial demographic in the U.S. electorate, Asian Americans are gaining political influence across the country. In California, two Korean American Republican women made history with their congressional victories. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, typically dominated by Democrats, has its largest roster ever, including Asian American and Pacific Islander members and others who represent significant numbers of Asian Americans.“We’re becoming increasingly more visible and active in the political ecosystem,” said Au, a Democrat who represents part of the growing, diversifying suburbs north of Atlanta. Yet, Au said, “What I’ve heard personally, and what I have felt, is that people sometimes don’t tend to listen to us.”Au said a White House spotlight, especially amid tragedy, is welcomed by a community often overshadowed in national conversations about diversity. She noted Trump and other Republicans merely brushed off charges of racism when they dubbed the coronavirus the “China virus” because of its origins.“To have them talk about it in this way, so publicly, and to say AAPI, or to note that our communities are going through difficult times, is huge,” Au said.As he boarded Air Force One on Friday morning, Biden, who was wearing a mask, stumbled several times up the stairs to the aircraft, before saluting the military officer who greeted him on the tarmac. Jean-Pierre said Biden was “doing 100% fine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-offer-solace-denounce-racism-in-atlanta-visit-101616197138050.html

20-03-2021||World||Covid-19 outbreak leads to partial closure of Trump's Mar-a-Lago||Former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, has been partially closed after staff members tested positive for the coronavirus.That's according to several people, including one familiar with club operations, who said Mar-a-Lago had “partially closed” a section of the club and quarantined some of its workers “out of an abundance of caution.” The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation by name.An email sent to members said that service had been temporarily suspended in the club’s dining room and at its beach club because some staff members had recently tested positive. It said the club had undertaken “all appropriate response measures,” including sanitizing affected areas," and that banquet and event services remain open.“The health and safety of our members and staff is our highest priority,” it read.The Florida Department of Health did not immediately respond to a phone call and email.Trump moved to Mar-a-Lago after leaving Washington in January, and has spent the weeks since then laying low, golfing, dining with friends, meeting with Republican party leaders and plotting his political future as he considers running again in 2024.Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19 last fall and has since been vaccinated against the virus.Mar-a-Lago was the site of his first known exposure more than a year ago. A senior Brazilian official tested positive last year after spending time at Mar-a-Lago, where he posed for a photo next to Trump and attended a family birthday party.The Trump White House was hit with several subsequent outbreaks after it flouted virus precautions by resisting mask-wearing and continuing to hold large events.The club in Palm Beach has been a flurry of activity in recent weeks, hosting events and fundraisers, including one to benefit rescue dogs. Trump unexpectedly dropped by the event last week.In January, Palm Beach County issued a warning to Mar-a-Lago’s management after a New Year’s Eve party that violated an ordinance requiring employees and guests to wear masks. Video of the party posted online by Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., showed that few of the 500 guests wore masks as they crowded the dance floor while rapper Vanilla Ice, Beach Boys co-founder Mike Love and singer Taylor Dayne performed. The club was told future violations would result in fines of $15,000.The former president was not present at the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-outbreak-leads-to-partial-closure-of-trump-s-maralago-101616197235212.html

Taken from the Coast Guard helicopter. The southern end of the lava flow is about 2.6 km from Suðurstrandarvegur. According to initial information, the fissure is about 200 m long. pic.twitter.com/BBqe8WicyS"Volcanic eruption has begun in Fagradalsfjall. Flight colour code is red but very little turbulence is seen on seismometers," Iceland's Meteorological Office, which monitors seismic activity, wrote on Twitter.Volcanic eruption has begun in Fagradalsfjall. Flight color code is red but very little turbulence is seen on seismometers.Police and coast guard officials raced to the scene late Friday, but the public has been advised to stay away from the area.The Krysuvik volcanic system, which does not have a central volcano, is located south of Mount Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland.Nýtt myndskeið af eldgosinu í Geldingardal, tekið úr þyrlu Landhelgisgæslunnar. #Eldgos #Reykjanes pic.twitter.com/GAVzPKYxnT"The first notification was received by the Meteorological Office at 2140 GMT. The eruption was confirmed through webcams and satellite images," the institute said on its website.While Iceland's Keflavik International Airport and the small fishing port of Grindavik are only just a few kilometres away, the area is uninhabited and the eruption was not expected to present any danger.Volcanic eruptions in the region are known as effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily out of the ground, as opposed to explosive ones which spew ash clouds high into the sky.The Krysuvik volcanic system has been inactive for the past 900 years, according to the Meteorological Office, while the last eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula dates back almost 800 years, to 1240.But the region has been under increased surveillance for several weeks after a 5.7-magnitude earthquake was registered on February 24 near Mount Keilir on the outskirts of Reykjavik.That quake has since been followed by an unusual number of smaller tremors -- more than 50,000, the highest number since digital recordings began in 1991.The seismic activity has since moved several kilometres southwest, concentrating around Mount Fagradalsfjall, where magma was detected just one kilometre under the Earth's surface in recent days.Land of fire and iceIceland has 32 volcanic systems currently considered active, the highest number in Europe. The country has had an eruption every five years on average.The vast island near the Arctic Circle straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a crack on the ocean floor separating the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates.The shifting of these plates is in part responsible for Iceland's intense volcanic activity.The most recent eruption was at Holuhraun, beginning in August 2014 and ending in February 2015, in the Bardarbunga volcanic system in an uninhabited area in the centre of the island.That eruption did not cause any major disruptions outside the immediate vicinity.But in 2010, an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week with the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights worldwide and leaving some 10 million passengers stranded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reykjaviks-night-sky-lights-up-as-volcano-in-fagradalsfjall-erupts-101616196286925.html

20-03-2021||World||US and Chinese officials trade barbs at first Biden-era high-level meeting||The United States and China exchanged sharp words and rebukes on democracy, human rights, foreign policy and other issues on Thursday, at the first high-level meeting of their officials under the Biden administration that laid bare the underlying strains and tensions in their relationship.The United States accused China of using “economic coercion” and the Chinese responded by charging the Americans with persuading other countries to “launch attacks on China”. Their differences stretched across an entire gamut of issues - and even words. The Americans spoke of a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, a phrase that binds, among other things, the Quad, which came up for a mention by the Americans. The Chinese went with “Asia-Pacific”, their preferred name for the region.US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan are meeting China’s director of the office of the central commission for foreign affairs Yang Jiechi and state councillor Wang Yi over two days in Anchorage, Alaska starting on Thursday for a highly anticipated first meeting of senior officials after President Joe Biden took office.While the American officials timed their remarks to around two minutes each, as agreed, the Chinese, specially Director Yang, went way over - over 17 minutes, with translation - which forced Blinken and Sullivan to come back for an unscheduled additional round of testy remarks. The Chinese said they found the US “condescending” and the Americans accused the Chinese of “grandstanding” for the domestic audience.The meeting was expected to be contentious as it came just two days after the Biden administration announced its first sanction against China, over Hong Kong. But fireworks started early.Blinken set the tone saying bluntly in his opening remarks that the United Sates expects to discuss, among other things, “our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber-attacks on the United States, and economic coercion toward our allies. Each of these actions threatens the rules-based order that maintains global stability”.He added that relations between the two countries will be “competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, adversarial where it must be”.Sullivan, speaking next, reinforced that message, saying, “Secretary Blinken laid out many of the areas of concern, from economic and military coercion to assaults on basic values, which we’ll discuss with you today and in the days ahead. We’ll do so frankly, directly and with clarity.”Yang hit back in a long harangue. He started with a quick summary of the Communist regime’s achievements, which included, “strategic gains” in the fight against Covid-19 and “full victory” in eradicating poverty. But he soon changed gear and when on the attack.“With Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan, they are an inalienable part of China’s territory. China is firmly opposed to US interference in China’s internal affairs. We have expressed our staunch opposition to such interference, and we will take firm actions in response,” Yang said, and went on to question the US on its record on democracy and human rights at home and foreign policy abroad.“The challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated,” he said. “They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter. It did not come up only recently.” Some news outlets quoted him as saying Black Americans had been “slaughtered”, but the transcript of the remarks released by the US state department did not reflect it.Many Americans, he said, have “little confidence” in US democracy and went on to claim China had its own form of democracy. The United States “has its style – United States-style democracy – and China has the Chinese-style democracy,” he said.State councilor Wang Yi kept his remarks short but was no less direct in pushing back against the US. “China urges the US side to fully abandon the hegemonic practice of willfully interfering in China’s internal affairs,” he said. Wang’s remarks should have ended the opening portion of the two-day meet.But the US side wanted to respond. And Blinken started, prefacing his remarks, “given your extended remarks, permit me, please, to add just a few of my own before we get down to work.” He told the Chinese officials that in his prior consultations with allies and partners he had heard “deep concern about some of the actions your government has taken”. He ended with a quote used by Biden before, at his meeting with Xi Jinping years ago: “It’s never a good bet to bet against America, and it’s true today.”Sullivan chided the Chinese on their oversensitivity to criticism, saying, “A confident country is able to look hard at its own shortcomings and constantly seek to improve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-and-chinese-officials-trade-barbs-at-first-biden-era-high-level-meeting-101616178748635.html

20-03-2021||World||Red surge in the South China Sea: The battle that could define who wins the war||Through global history, as States and power systems have vied with each other to expand their footprint, they have fought and won and lost, not always on land—but often on water. Fast forward to 2021, nothing much has changed, for a key site of contest between the United States (US) and its allies on one hand, and China on the other, is South China Sea.To be sure, the bustling sea bordering China on the south is not the only flashpoint in the ongoing standoff between a largely democratic Western alliance and an increasingly aggressive authoritarian China. Significant battles are raging on other fronts too—such as in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, where the West is decidedly seeking to counter Beijing’s repressive push; in Taiwan, which the West is battling to protect from a looming Chinese military swoop; over Xinjiang, the Uighur-dominated Chinese province that the US feels is a prime example of Chinese persecution of minorities; and over Tibet, which, Western governments have historically felt, deserves at least more autonomy from Beijing’s control.But in recent years, much of the focus of the US-China standoff has been on escalating activities in and around South China Sea.The geography and significanceIn a world where the fortunes of powerful countries depend hugely on maritime trade, South China Sea’s location and span make it among the most vital geostrategic water bodies in Asia. Covering an area of nearly 3.5 million square kilometres, South China Sea is home to the continent’s most crucial shipping lanes. It is immensely resourceful for the fishing industry, while key sections of it lie on vast oil reserves. It is also peppered with archipelagoes, which Beijing has increasing been trying to dominate.Also Read | China rebukes LinkedIn for failing to control political content: ReportA look at some numbers tells us how significant South China Sea is for its stakeholders.Take trade. The global conflict tracker of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) shows that the total amount of trade that passed through the shipping lanes of South China Sea in 2016 was a whopping $3.37 trillion dollars—and that was a good five years back, it would be higher more recently (right up to pre-pandemic times).The Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) runs a Beijing-focused China Power Project. It says China exported goods worth $874 billion in 2016, which is, by itself, higher than the combined exports of the next four countries on the list put together—South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. To put that into context, China accounted for 26% of all exports through South China Sea that year. The math looks similar when it comes to imports through the sea’s waters in 2016, with China accounting for imports worth $598 billion—which was a significant 18% of the total imports that passed through South China Sea that year. Again, China’s total imports were higher than the combined imports of Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. The findings also show that 39% of China’s total trade in 2016 passed through South China Sea. In fact, as the same report points out, 64% of China’s total maritime trade that year passed through South China Sea.Moving on from trade in general to shipments of strategic importance, it’s worth revisiting a report published on November 2, 2017 by the US Energy Information Administration. According to the EIA report, South China Sea is a crucial route for the trade of LNG, and in 2016, almost 40% of global LNG trade, or about 4.7 trillion cubic feet, passed through the sea lanes.In fact, South China Sea is a major trade route for Malaysia and Qatar. The two LNG exporters together accounted for over 60% of total LNG volumes traded through the South China Sea in 2016. Also, the four LNG importers with the largest volumes passing through the South China Sea are Japan, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. They collectively account for 94% of total LNG volumes that passed through the South China Sea in 2016. Japan is the world’s largest LNG importer, and more than half of all of Japan’s LNG imports in 2016 were shipped via the South China Sea.The CFR report cited earlier on goes on to reveal that there are an estimated 11 billion barrels of untapped oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas right under South China Sea, which is exactly why so many countries in the neighbourhood are clamouring to be heard and make their presence felt—China, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.The emerging battle These immense economic benefits associated with South China Sea explains why it has historically been a hotbed of territorial wrangles, and, more importantly, why the US and its allies are trying to ensure that China doesn’t end up muscling out smaller countries in the neighbourhood in its bid to assert itself as the continent’s rising power.Also Read | China says ‘strong smell of gunpowder’ sensed in US talksThat China’s defence apparatus is steadily turning small islands into de facto military bases is nowadays the worst-kept secret of South China Sea. In fact, Beijing recently made it known to the world—and especially to its critics in the West—that it is going to carry out a series of wide-ranging military drills in South China Sea for an unusually lengthy month-long spell. China’s military has even made it known according to news reports that other military vessels should ideally stay away from the area throughout March.It is, therefore, no surprise if the US Navy conducts several rounds of “freedom of navigation operations” in the South China Sea, and in alliance with the navies of other countries that also object to China’s growing aggression and military showboating. Germany, for example, has announced that it would send across a frigate to sail through the South China Sea later this month as a powerful message to China. It would mark the first time in 19 years that a German naval vessel will pass through the disputed sea—and it comes at a time when Washington is looking up to its allies to ramp up pressure on Beijing.Freedom of navigation operations, popularly known as FONOPs, are not new—it was during the Barack Obama years that Pentagon had emphatically carried out FONOPs in the South China Sea as many as six times, repeatedly sending across a message to Beijing that what it thinks is its backyard is not exclusively so.With territorial fights over the control of Spratly Islands and Paracel Islands; Beijing’s policy to militarise gigantic sections of the South China Sea and assert its command over islands peppering the area; Washington’s decision to make the US Navy exercise its right to the freedom of navigation in the sea; China’s decision to seek to deter American naval presence in the region; US calls for the international community to take note of Chinese militarisation of the region; heated exchanges between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan—the South China Sea has been consistently making headlines in a fast escalating geopolitical contest.The nine-dash line and territorial disputes China’s cartographic initiative in South China Sea, which is the basis for its expansive geopolitical posture, is unilateral. Interestingly, although it’s popularly referred to as the nine-dash line, the demarcation was originally named 11-dash line by the Chinese back in 1947. Five years later, China tweaked the map to let the Gulf of Tonkien stay out of its territorial ring—thereby dropping two dashes from the map that eventually made it the nine-dash line. Historians and analysts write that China decided to concede control over the waters of the Gulf of Tonkien as part of the deal with its then-ally, Communist Vietnam. In 2010, China marginally extended the demarcation to its east to include a part of the East China Sea, thereby adding a tenth dash to the controversial map.Also Read | China to open first trial of Canadians held on ‘spy’ charges for over 2 yearsCountries in the area that have vehemently protested China’s overambitious territorial claims since then are the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. They neither formally recognise the so-called nine-dash line nor do they approve of China’s attempt to militarise the waters of the South China Sea.A close look at the area in and around the South China Sea gives us a clear picture of the damaging impact that the nine-dash line has had on stability in the region. Interestingly, the most prominent disputes that today define the instability in the South China Sea all involve different sets of claimant countries, although the nature of the wrangles is fundamentally the same.China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have conflicting claims wholly or partly over the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands, the Scarborough Shoal, Vereker Banks and Macclesfield Bank. The same countries—in various combinations—have contesting claims over other less-known islands, banks and reefs in that zone.The maritime boundary to the north of the island of Borneo, which is divided among Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, is another area of contention. China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines have contrasting claims over that disputed zone.The maritime boundary along the coast of Vietnam is also enmeshed in a territorial dispute, with the Vietnamese government, Taiwan and China making contesting claims. An equally contentious zone is the maritime border near the Natuna Islands, which has seen China, Indonesia and Taiwan vying for a final say.There are several other maritime boundaries that are deeply disputed—such as the contested demarcations near Palawan and Luzon in the Philippines; the Malaysian state of Sabah in northern part of Borneo; and numerous small islands peppering the Luzon Strait. Territorial rights to these small but geopolitically sensitive islands are contested variously by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.Of salami slicing and a board game From China’s point of view, defending the South China Sea is essential because much of the country’s fortunes rely heavily on it. But the Xi Jinping administration and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) seem to have long forgotten that there’s a fine line between defending one’s interests in one’s vicinity, and snuffing out other legitimate claimants in the neighbourhood.Many analysts often refer to China’s subtle acts of hegemonic aggression in the South China Sea as what is called “salami slicing”—meaning, Beijing doesn’t carry out spectacular swoops on new areas, but instead expands its territorial footprint little by little so that the aggression is spread out over time and largely goes unnoticed. What today seems like Beijing today gnawing away at areas could, years and decades down the line, add up to something too big to reverse without intervention.Other analysts see a cultural connection to the way China is tactfully spreading its wings in the South China Sea. A sporting connection, to be more precise. A strategic board game called Go is hugely popular among the Chinese and historians say it dates back by at least 2,500 years. It’s a two-player game in which the contenders have to surround more territory on the board than that cornered by the opponent. Well, that sounds eerily similar to the South China Sea story, doesn’t it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/red-surge-in-the-south-china-sea-the-battle-that-could-define-who-wins-the-war-101616159963862.html
20-03-2021||India||Varsity students plan two-day class boycott||The students’ body at Ashoka University on Saturday announced a “two-day boycott of classes” next week to protest the resignation of two professors, Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Arvind Subramanian, even as more academics -- including former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan -- weighed in and expressed their support for Mehta and his departure on fears that he could be a “political liability” for the university on account of his strong political views.In a statement released on Saturday, the Ashoka Student Government demanded “public acknowledgement by the founders” of Mehta’s statement about “political liability” and an assurance that he will be “given a public unconditional offer letter”; an open meeting between the founders and the students’ body; and the “divesting of administrative powers and roles from the founders” to the “elected representatives of faculty, students, and administration”. The statement added that the students would protest till these demands were met, and added that if they were not “met by Tuesday” (March 23), the students would “organise a separate movement demanding that the Vice-Chancellor resign”.The university and the founders have so far not offered their version of events.During a townhall with students on Thursday, VC Sarkar rejected allegations that Mehta was asked to resign due to his role as a government critic. “I spoke to Pratap and tried to persuade him multiple times not to leave Ashoka and to withdraw his resignation,” she said.News of Mehta’s exit broke on Thursday — he resigned on March 15 — and caused a stir among students and faculty of the university, and the academic community across India and overseas. “After a meeting with Founders it has become abundantly clear to me that my association with the University may be considered a political liability. My public writing in support of a politic that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university. In the interests of the University, I resign,” he said in his resignation letter.Faculty members also wrote to V-C Malabika Sarkar saying that Mehta’s exit would set a “chilling precedent”. Sheldon Pollock, a Sanskrit scholar who is closely associated with Ashoka University, also issued a statement on Thursday expressing his solidarity with Mehta.On Friday morning, his colleague and former chief economic adviser Subramanian resigned saying he was “devastated” by Mehta’s resignation, and it reflected the university’s inability to protect “academic freedom and expression”.Late on Friday, around 150 academics from overseas universities wrote an open letter terming Mehta’s exit as a “dangerous attack on academic freedom”.In the letter, addressed to Ashoka trustees, administration, and the faculty, the academics express their “distress” over Mehta’s resignation under “political pressure”. “A prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom, he had become a target for his writings. It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” it read.The signatories included Homi K Bhabha, Anne F Rothenberg, professor of humanities at Harvard University; Erwin Chemerinsky, dean at the University of California Berkeley School of Law; Rogers Smith, Partha Chatterjee of Columbia University; Faisal Devji, professor of Indian history, University of Oxford; and Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School.The university alumni council on Friday held a meeting to discuss the future course of action in order to “protect the academic freedom in the university”.On Saturday, Rajan weighed in on LinkedIn. He wrote that “free speech” is the soul of a great university and by “compromising on it, the founders (of Ashoka) have bartered away its soul”. “The reality is that professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments,” he added.HT learns that on Friday, some of the founders met Mehta and sought his return. Ashoka University did not respond to queries, saying a statement on the matter will be issued soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varsity-students-plan-two-day-class-boycott-101616263988388.html
20-03-2021||India||Fire breaks out in tent at Singhu border: Farmers' union||A fire broke out in a tent at Delhi's Singhu border where farmers have been protesting the Centre's three agri laws, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha claimed on Saturday.Sukhwinder Singh, a protester, said the incident took place around 10 am near an under-construction flyover where the tent was put up.However, there was no official word about the incident from the police or the fire department.The tent was completely burnt, said the Morcha, which is heading the agitation.A man was also injured while trying to extinguish the blaze. The incident took place after a cylinder caught fire, the SKM claimed.There were around 10 to 12 people inside the tent when the blaze broke out. Five mobile phones, 20 mattresses, 20 chairs and dry ration was destroyed, it said, adding that a fire tender from Kundali doused the fire.Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Punjab's Patiala district who is taking part in the agitation, said a man named Rajwant Singh was injured in the incident."The fire broke out when we were making tea. Rajwant was injured while dousing the fire. There were 12 to 13 people in the tent. We will make our new tent tomorrow," Dilpreet said.Hundreds of farmers are camping at Delh's borders points at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri since November demanding that the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws and make a new one that would ensure legal guarantee on the MSP.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fire-breaks-out-in-tent-at-singhu-border-farmers-union-101616260903373.html
20-03-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan says laxity shown by people behind spike in daily case||Holding the laxity shown by people as the reason behind the recent surge in coronavirus cases, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday urged them not to let their guard down against the infection unless the situation may turn “dangerous”.“With vaccines available now, people feel they should not wear masks. Maximum people hang their masks around their neck, some keep it in their pocket and some do not use it at all,” the minister said here on Saturday evening.Covid-19 cases have again started rising at some places in the country for the past some time and the laxity shown by people towards the infection is the basic reason behind it, Vardhan said, adding that the situation may turn “dangerous”.“If we do not follow Covid appropriate behavior, then coronavirus will go away slowly from the country and the world,” he said.“I want to appeal to people of the country that they should not let the Covid appropriate behavior get weakened at any cost. Maintaining social distancing, wearing masks properly and washing hands with soap probably are the biggest tools to win the fight against Covid-19,” said Vardhan.Vardhan also said there was no need for vaccination for all while asserting that the two vaccines developed in the country are completely safe and effective.The vaccination drive should also be turned into a mass movement, he said, adding that the vaccines are available at 50,000 government and private health facilities in the country.He said the priority groups have been set after keeping in the mind the scientific criteria and studying the behavior of Covid-19.“You know that the behavior of Covid virus is dynamic and the vaccination process is also dynamic. Under this dynamic process, the criteria will be expanded as and when time requires,” he said.Asserting that saving lives is a priority for the government, the minister said ₹35,000 crores had been earmarked in the Union Budget for the Covid-19 vaccination.He expressed concern over the rise in cases in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula.Vardhan also inaugurated a national resource centre for oral health care of children and elderly, an advanced PET-CT facility, 384 slice dual source CT scan and a refractive surgery suite at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-says-laxity-shown-by-people-behind-spike-in-daily-case-101616259562451.html
20-03-2021||India||Digital platforms promote transparency, corruption-free atmosphere: Prakash Javadekar||Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar on Saturday pitched digital platforms as a medium to promote transparency and introduce corruption-free atmosphere in governance. He reiterated that the new guidelines by the government for over the top (OTT) and social media platforms are an attempt to provide a level playing field for various digital platforms."Through these guidelines on OTT, we have tried to bring about transparency and provide level playing field to various media platforms, be it electronic, print or digital media. It is just for fair-facilitation for self-regulation and not intended for controlling the OTT platforms,” the Union minister said while addressing a digital media conclave in Mumbai.Javadekar’s remark comes in the backdrop of new rules notified by the government last month that will govern online content. This includes allowing users to dispute action against them by social media intermediaries like Facebook and Twitter, and setting up a three-tier self-regulatory framework for OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, and online news media entities.The Supreme Court, however, had earlier this month stated that the rules “do not have teeth” and asked the Centre to consider legislation that could also provide for “prosecution”.Pointing to the role played by digital media in facilitating the government’s functioning during the Covid-19 pandemic, Javadekar said that more than 50 cabinet meetings were held virtually ensuring that there weren't any delays in decision making, according to an I&B ministry statement.The minister also spoke about the role played by digital platforms in economic transactions. He said that more than 13 lakh crore rupees were transferred to 35 crore people through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) mode under various welfare schemes of the central government. "More than 12.30 crore farmers received money in their accounts directly, without any leakage of funds," he said at the event, according to the I&B ministry statement."It (digital mode of payment) has now become our way of life, as even a vegetable vendor keeps a QR code to facilitate digital payment," the minister said, citing the example of DIKSHA Platform (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) to highlight the importance of digital education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-platforms-promote-transparency-corruption-free-atmosphere-prakash-javadekar-101616260183844.html

20-03-2021||India||Raised human rights issues, says US defence secretary. A strong rebuttal follows||US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, the first senior member of the Biden administration to visit India, said on Saturday he had raised issues of human rights of the country’s minorities with members of the Indian cabinet as “partners need to be able to have those kinds of discussions”.Austin, the first African-American to hold the post of US defence secretary, made the remarks while responding to a question during a media briefing on whether he had raised the issue of human rights of India’s minorities during his interactions with Indian interlocutors.Indian officials, however, said there was no specific discussion with Austin on human rights in India at his meetings with defence minister Rajnath Singh or external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Human rights and values were discussed as shared strengths of the two countries, senior Indian officials said.Austin said human rights and values are important to both sides, and the US will lead with these values. Jaishankar agreed and emphasised that a strong India-US relationship was important for both countries and the rest of the world, people aware of the conversation between the ministers said.The only specific discussion on these issues pertained to minorities and women in Afghanistan, the officials said.Austin acknowledged he had discussed with defence minister Rajnath Singh the issue of India’s acquisition of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, which faces potential sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Austin, however, said the sanctions were not “on the table” as India is yet to acquire the weapon system.He also said the US never considered that “India and China were on the threshold of war” during their ongoing standoff in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Asked specifically if he had raised the violation of human rights of India’s minorities as the first member of the Biden administration to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Austin replied that he “did not have an opportunity to talk with him [Modi]” about the issue during their meeting on Friday.“Having said that, I did have a conversation with other members of the cabinet on this issue. I think we have to remember that India is our partner and a partner whose partnership we value, and I think partners need to be able to have those kinds of discussions. And certainly, we feel comfortable in doing that, and you can have those discussions in a very meaningful way and still make progress,” Austin said.Prior to his arrival in India, US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Bob Menendez wrote a letter to Austin, asking him to raise concerns about India “trending away” from shared democratic values, including the Indian government’s handling of the farmers’ protest and a crackdown on journalists and critics, and the S-400 deal with Russia.Responding to a question on Menendez’s letter, Austin said, “You’ve heard President [Joe] Biden say that... human rights and the rule of law [are] important to the United States of America. We always lead with our values and as a democracy, that’s pretty important to us. And again, India is a democratic country and you treasure your values as well. So, there are a number of things that we can and will work on together.”Austin evaded a direct reply to a question on whether the S-400 deal would pose a problem for the India-US relationship and only said sanctions were not on the table as the weapon system had not been delivered to India.India has defended its $5.4-billion deal with Russia for five S-400 systems, the first of which is expected to be delivered by September. The US has already imposed sanctions on its NATO ally Turkey for a similar deal.Austin said, “We have countries that we work with from time to time that have Soviet or... Russian equipment that they’ve acquired over the years and we certainly urge all our allies and our partners to move away from Soviet or Russian equipment... and really avoid any kind of acquisition that would trigger sanctions on our behalf.”“There’s been no delivery of an S-400 system and so that conversation, that issue of sanctions is not one that’s been discussed but we did address with the minister of defence the issue of the S-400,” he added.Austin dismissed a question on whether a war between India and China was imminent, and said India and the US could work with like-minded countries to check Chinese aggression in the region.“On the first part of the question, the answer is no. To my knowledge, we’ve never considered that India and China were on the threshold of war,” he said.The US, he said, is working with like-minded countries such as India, Australia, and Japan to maintain freedom of navigation, promote peace and stability, and “ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region”. Working with these countries with shared interests is “the way you check any aggression in any region,” he added.Austin was equally dismissive of a question on reports about US troops staying on in Afghanistan till November, several months after the deadline for their withdrawal in May under a deal with the Taliban. He said, “You know I am a pretty prominent guy in those discussions typically, and to my knowledge the president has not made a decision or made any announcements on when he will decide to remove the troops.”“As you know, there is a rigorous process that’s ongoing as the president really works his way through making that decision and no decisions have been made, no decisions on length of stay or troop numbers have been made to this point,” Austin stated.He said his discussions with defence minister Rajnath Singh covered a wide range of topics, including equipment, information-sharing, and additional opportunities for logistics support. “We consider India to be a great partner and... there’s just a lot of opportunity there to strengthen that partnership and to do some additional things to make sure that we’re promoting peace and stability in the region and providing for a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” he said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Austin’s hour-long meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar focused on the strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar spoke on India’s current security challenges and the discussions also covered the changing scenario in Europe and West Asia.The situation in Afghanistan was addressed in detail and Austin and Jaishankar exchanged their assessments of the ground situation and the peace process, the people said. They also discussed the concerns and interests of regional powers.While highlighting the commonalities and convergences in India-US ties, Jaishankar said the relationship was unique for the breadth and intensity of cooperation in numerous domains, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raised-human-rights-issues-with-indian-ministers-us-defense-secretary-101616256996248.html

20-03-2021||India||Farmers seek withdrawal of par panel's recommendation to implement 1 agri law||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday sought the withdrawal of a parliamentary panel's recommendation asking the Centre to implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, one of the three agri laws against which the farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders for over 100 days.The SKM, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers' union leading the farmers' agitation, alleged that the ECAA allows "unlimited private hoarding and black marketing".Their remarks comes after a parliamentary panel asked the government to implement in "letter and spirit" the ECAA. This panel also has members from opposition parties including Congress, TMC and AAP. These parties have been demanding repeal of all three farm laws enacted by the Centre recently."It must not escape attention that the ECAA makes a wholly anti-poor recommendation that food, which is the most essential item for the survival of human beings, should be removed from the list of EC."It allows unlimited private hoarding and black marketing. It will lead to the winding up of the PDS facilities and structures," the SKM said in a statement.It added that the implementation of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act will "expose 75 crore beneficiaries to open market purchase of food requirements, promoting Corporate and MNCs in food markets".In its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on March 19, the Standing Committee on Food chaired by TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay recommended the government to "implement the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 in letter and spirit, and without let or hindrances so that the farmers and other stakeholders of farming sector in this country receive the benefits intended under the said Act".The SKM said, "It is entirely disgraceful that many parties which have been claiming support to farmers agitation for repeal of three farm laws have voted for the implementation of the ECAA."This exposes a wider consensus amongst these parties on these laws. We appeal to the committee to withdraw these recommendations," it said.The farmers' body has called "Bharat Bandh" on March 26.The Morcha, which held a meeting on Saturday, also decided that on 22 March, meetings of public organizations will be held at the district level across the country.It was decided that during the 'Bharat Bandh' on March 26, all services except emergency services will be inactive from 6 am to 6 pm, and road and rail transport will be blocked, the SKM said.It said on March 28, copies of three agricultural laws will be burnt in 'Holika Dahan' and on April 5, farmers will 'gherao' offices of Food Corporation of India across the country from 11 am to 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-seek-withdrawal-of-par-panel-s-recommendation-to-implement-1-agri-law-101616254714127.html
20-03-2021||India||NIA takes over Mansukh Hiran death case||The Centre on Saturday suo motu handed over the probe into Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The central agency has been probing the explosives-laden SUV which was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. The NIA will take over the case from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which has been investigating the possible murder of Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to the Scorpio that was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks, and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis, outside their Antilia residence in Mumbai on February 25. NIA officials will take over case files, including the post mortem report of Hiran, after re-registering the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the ATS on March 7 against unknown persons for the charge of murder. The NIA arrested suspended police officer Sachin Vaze on March 13 for purportedly planting the explosives in the SUV. The ATS has also questioned Vaze over his role in Hiran’s death after it came to light, through Hiran’s wife’s statement, that the two knew each other. The ATS on Saturday sought Vaze’s custody in the murder investigation but the NIA special court scheduled the hearing to March 25 when his custody with the NIA ends. Also read: ‘Bring CIA and KGB too’ - Sena on transfer of Mansukh Hiran death probe to NIAThe ministry of home affairs (MHA) used its power under Section 8 of the NIA Act, which says that any connected offence related to a scheduled offence already under investigation, in which the suspect is the same, can also be taken over by the central anti-terror agency. The ATS approached the special NIA court on Saturday seeking Vaze’s custody, but the court scheduled the hearing to March 25, when Vaze’s NIA custody ends. After Hiran’s body washed up ashore at a creek in Thane district on March 5, Hiran’s wife, Vimla (43), gave a statement to the ATS which led them to file a murder case against unknown persons. Vimla told the ATS that she suspected that Vaze, who knew Hiran well, was involved in his death. Vaze was also the lead investigator in the explosives case before it was briefly handed over to the ATS. The NIA took charge of the case on March 9. “The NIA has the information that Vaze had even called Hiran for questioning when he was the Investigating Officer (IO) of the SUV case. We are trying to establish the chain of events after that,” an NIA official said on condition of anonymity. Vaze had borrowed the SUV, that was found parked outside Antilia, in November 2020 and returned it to Hiran on February 5. Hiran had later reported the car as stolen on February 18, a day after he had met Vaze outside the police headquarters near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). Vaze, who was attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was suspended after Vimla’s allegations became the centre of a political storm between the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his arrest while the House was in session. On March 13, a Thane district and sessions court denied Vaze’s anticipatory bail plea and said that his custodial interrogation in Hiran’s murder investigation was “necessary”. The NIA has identified Vaze’s co-conspirators in a bomb conspiracy case and some arrests are likely to happen after all the evidence is gathered, officials said. The NIA team on Friday reconstructed the crime scene at Carmichael Road where the Ambanis live and the Scorpio was found parked. The probe agency is also examining several suspects and witnesses that include Mumbai police officers and some private persons, said an officer, who did not want to be named. HT had reported that NIA’s investigations revealed that Vaze had planned the explosive conspiracy with some other players. Political reactions BJP leader Kirit Somaiya on Saturday said in a press conference that the party is happy that the NIA is looking at both the cases now and that the chief minister cannot save Vaze any longer. The BJP, including leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, has been alleging that Shiv Sena – a party that Vaze had joined when he had retired from the force in 2007 till he was reinstated in 2020 – had been protecting Vaze’s involvement in the case. The claim has been repeatedly refuted by the party, including CM Uddhav Thackeray who had said that the investigation will be conducted in a free and fair manner, and anyone found guilty would be punished. However, editorials in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana had criticized the NIA for taking over the explosives investigation. He said, “I recently spoke with the family of Mansukh Hiran and they are satisfied with the investigation. Antilia and Mansukh Hiran murder is one case that will now be investigated by a single agency. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray tried to save Vaze by separating both the investigation,” Somaiya said. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that the NIA taking over the probe into Hiran’s death was not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra government. “There was no need for the NIA to take up the probe into the explosives-laden SUV and Mansukh Hiran case. The Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and Mumbai police were capable of investigating them,” Raut said in Nashik.“However, the Centre is looking for opportunities to see how the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government can be put in a spot. You can bring the CIA or the KGB... It makes no difference. It is not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,” he said. Investigations continue Earlier this week, the NIA had recovered the original number plate of the Scorpio from a Mercedes Benz purportedly being used by Vaze, 6-7 other number plates; a set of clothes which Vaze had apparently changed after the SUV was dropped at Carmichael Road around 2.20 am on February 25; ₹5.75 lakh cash and a currency counting machine apart from kerosene oil suspected to have been used to burn the oversized kurta worn by the suspect. Forensic officials on Friday said that the NIA team made Vaze walk on paths marked with start and end points, while two forensic teams took pictures and made a video for a gait analysis. The images will be fed in a computerised system along with parameters like height, weight and width of the person which will be compared to the video from a CCTV grab that emerged last week that showed a man in what seemed to be a PPE kit or a long kurta, with his face covered, walking on Carmichael Road when the SUV was parked. An NIA team visited Vaze’s house on Saturday afternoon for over two hours. Also, the deputy commissioner of police, ATS, Rajkumar Shinde visited the Thane ATS office in Wagle estate for an investigation. A team comprising three NIA officials accompanied by local police also visited Vaze’s Saket Complex residence in Thane. “The team reached the house at 12:30 pm on Saturday and was there till almost 2:30 pm.

20-03-2021||India||Northeastern region will become torch bearer of new India: Jitendra Singh||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday said the northeastern states will become the torchbearer of new India as the country prepares to celebrate the 75th year of its Independence in 2022.Addressing a seminar organised by Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), he said in the post-Covid era, India's Economic Resurgence will not be complete unless it takes care of the vast unexplored potential and resources of the northeastern region.Singh, the Minister of State for the Development of North East Region (DoNER), said it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who gave the vision 'Act East' soon after assuming power in 2014, thus imparting a new push to the approach and focus to relations with the neighbouring countries, which was earlier known as Look East Policy.Addressing the seminar 'Act East Policy: Enhancing Trade Infrastructure and Connectivity in the North Eastern Region' organised by ICRIER, he said the northeast will be the new engine of growth for new India.Ever since Modi took over as prime minister, he has accorded a special priority to the development of the northeastern region of India, Singh said.He said this also assumes importance because if India has to successfully engage with the countries across the eastern borders, it must have a strong basis in areas proximal to eastern borders which comprise the northeastern states.With its geographical position and rich natural as well as agro-climatic resources, Singh said access to the growing ASEAN market is essential for optimum utilization of trade and business opportunities.He recalled how with the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indo-Bangladesh agreement was successfully accomplished resulting in the exchange of enclaves, facilitating easier and cost-effective access to Bangladesh and other regions.On the issue of connectivity, Singh said it includes both international as well as internal connectivity with dimensions of intra-regional connectivity and inter-regional connectivity.About international connectivity, the DoNER minister mentioned the Agartala-Akhaura rail link between India and Bangladesh, intermodal transport linkages and inland waterways through Bangladesh, Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project and the Trilateral Highway Project connecting the northeast with Myanmar and Thailand, according to a statement.Singh said the government's focus on Act East, which led to the development of the northeast region and completion of an array of projects like grandest of bridges, improving inland water transport, airports, rail and roads networks, has changed the narrative of news emanating from the northeastern region in the past few years.India's pre-emptive response to Covid-19 and outreach towards other nations has enhanced bonding and trust with its neighbours r reliance in times of crisis, he added."Witnessing our commitment and continuous efforts towards the development of the northeastern region, ASEAN countries are now looking at strengthening trade ties with the region," Singh said.He said the 'Act East Policy' announced in November 2014 is the upgrade of the 'Look East Policy' which was promulgated in 1992.It aims at promoting economic cooperation, cultural ties and develop a strategic relationship with countries in the Indo-pacific region with a proactive and pragmatic approach and thereby improving the economic development of the northeastern region which is a gateway to southeast Asia, the statement said.The policy has been continuously evolving since the early 1990s and involves intensive and continuous engagement with southeast Asian countries in the field of connectivity, trade, culture, defence and people-to-people contact at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels.Nisha Taneja, Professor at ICRIER, highlighted the importance of enhancing trade infrastructure and connectivity in the northeastern region through a research study led by her, it said.The study states that 96 of the northeastern region shares its borders with other countries."ICRIER has undertaken a first of its kind comprehensive on-ground study across the entire northeastern region to assess the availability and quality of infrastructure at all 38 land customs stations and Integrated Check Posts in the region, the statement said.The webinar was joined among others by Pramod Bhasin, chairman, ICRIER, and Rajat Kathuria, Director & Chief Executive, ICRIER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeastern-region-will-become-torch-bearer-of-new-india-jitendra-singh-101616253379090.html

The manifesto, which was released on Saturday, promised ₹3,000 welfare pension, implementation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s pet minimum income guarantee scheme and special legislation to protect age-old traditions of Sabarimala hill temple.Another interesting promise is of ₹2,000 monthly pension to homemakers and housewives ageing 40-60 years. The ruling Left Democratic Front has also promised pension to homemakers in its manifesto. Amid the heat of the ensuing polls, opposition parties have also raked up the emotional Sabarimala issue and it figured prominently in the manifesto. Releasing the manifesto, state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said it was prepared after several rounds of consultations with a cross-section of people and experts under the leadership of senior leader Shashi Tharoor. Also read: Ministry of happiness, focus on NYAY - UDF releases manifesto for Kerala pollsIt also promised setting up a ministry of happiness to ensure the wellbeing of people and bill-less hospitals across the state. “It is an integrated manifesto aiming to take the state to the next level.

20-03-2021||India||Param Bir Singh alleges Deshmukh asked Vaze to extort ₹100 cr; minister denies||Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Saturday rubbished the allegations of extortion made by Param Bir Singh, who was recently removed as the Mumbai police commissioner over alleged mishandling of a bomb scare case near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence. Deshmukh said that the former Mumbai top cop is trying to save himself."When it is getting clear that he was involved in Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case as well as in the case of Mansukh Hiran's death and there are possibilities of him getting exposed, the former police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me to save himself from further legal action," according to a rough translation of Deshmukh's tweet posted in Marathi.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said in other tweets that investigations are underway in these cases.Also Watch: NIA recreates crime scene, arrested Mumbai cop made to walk near AntiliaDeshmukh's party is one of the constituents of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance. The Shiv Sena and Congress are the other two.His reaction comes after some reports claimed that Singh wrote to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleging that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze - a suspended policeman who has been arrested in connection with the case - to collect ₹100 crore from various establishments in Mumbai. The bomb scare case is being handled by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The reports also said that Singh marked a copy of the letter to Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Union home ministry.Deshmukh's reaction is in stark contrast with Sena's stand, which defended Singh saying his transfer did not make him a criminal, and alleged a "particular lobby in Delhi" was upset with him as the TRP scam came to light during his tenure.Also Read: Spotlight on Deshmukh as Vaze case strains tiesOn Wednesday, Singh was replaced by Hemant Nagrale. On Thursday, Deshmukh, who belongs to the NCP, told reporters that a few officers from Mumbai Police has committed “serious and unpardonable mistakes” that had come to light in the preliminary inquiry in the bomb scare case, and that Singh’s transfer was not “routine”.Sena leader Sanjay Raut earlier defended Vaze, arrested by the NIA on March 13, for his role in the explosives-laden SUV parked outside Antilia, Ambani’s residence, on February 25.The strain in the MVA was highlighted by the Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, who said such contradictory statements would further damage the image of the government.The NIA, meanwhile, also took over the probe into the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran. His body was found in a Thane creek on March 5, days after the explosives-laden SUV was found parked outside Antilia.The SUV was in possession of Hiran. Earlier, the Maharashtra ATS was investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-rubbishes-param-bir-singh-s-extortion-claims-101616248976454.html
20-03-2021||India||Centre delists works on Vizag coffee plantations from NREGP, tribal farmers in lurch||A recent decision of the Central government to delist works related to coffee plantations from permissible activities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP) has left more than one lakh tribal farmers in forest areas of Paderu and Araku in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam district in a lurch.The Union ministry of rural development conveyed the same to the Andhra Pradesh government in September, stating that the MGNREGP would no more applicable to works taken up in the coffee plantations in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam, where the famed “Araku coffee” is produced.“The decision was taken following a recommendation made by the Coffee Board of India in April 2020. They contend that coffee plantation is not a perennial crop like other horticulture crops like mango. Secondly, coffee is also a commercial crop. Hence, it cannot come under the MGNREGP,” Andhra Pradesh commissioner of panchayat raj and rural development M Girija Shankar said.He said the state government had already written twice to the Union ministry to reconsider its decision. “Our chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, too, wrote a similar letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our MPs, too, represented the matter with the Centre, but we fail to understand why the Centre is refusing to concede our request,” Girija Shankar said.The Andhra Pradesh government has been promoting the raising of coffee plantation under MGNREGP since 2009-10, as an area-specific work in the Scheduled V areas (tribal pockets) of the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district.“Only wage component tasks, such as pitting, planting and intercultural operations, are taken up under the MGNREGP and the material component is being met by the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) and the Coffee Board. Funds are directly paid to the beneficiary bank accounts,” the commissioner said, adding that the total wage component under the project was around ₹32,000 per acre.According to Dr Salijamala Venkateswar, project officer of ITDA, Paderu, the Centre had permitted coffee plantation works in Visakhapatnam as a special project. Normally, MGNREGP doesn’t cover agriculture labour but covers manual labour under horticulture, sericulture, plantation and farm forestry.“It was basically aimed at preventing the tribal people from undertaking shifting cultivation that destroys forest areas and providing them with a sustained livelihood. Since they have very small landholding – from half-acre to a maximum of two acres, payment of wages under the MGNREGP would go a long way to improve their living standards,” Venkateshwar said.He said under this programme, each tribal farmer was getting an average of ₹245 per day, there were 81 person-days during a year. “On average, each tribal used to get ₹20-25,000 per year towards wages under the project. Now, they are deprived of the same,” he said.According to the ITDA official, the Coffee Board decided to delist the Araku coffee plantation works from the MGNREGP as it was under pressure from other coffee-growing states like Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to include their coffee plantations, too, under the project.“However, there is a fundamental difference between Andhra Pradesh coffee growers and other states. In our state, it is grown exclusively by tribals for their livelihood, whereas in other states they are grown in coffee estates in lakhs of acres,” Venkateshwar said.The state government represented to the Centre that as coffee plantations in Paderu and Araku areas provide sustainable income resources to primitive tribal households, their activity may be permitted under the MGNREGP. “We pointed out that when the project is applicable for rubber plantations in Kerala, it could be applied to coffee plantations in Araku as well,” Girija Shankar said.As per the MGNREGP guidelines, any plant that is perennial in nature and suitable to the agro-climatic conditions can be brought under the scheme. “Coffee plantation too was taken up as an area-specific work in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam district where the altitude and climatic conditions favour it,” he said.Stating that the coffee plantation was a game-changer in the tribal areas, the commissioner said delisting it from MGNREGP would adversely impact the livelihood of vulnerable tribals. “Since, as per Land Transfer Regulation Act 1 of 1970, the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals is banned, there is no scope for coffee cultivation by non-tribals in this area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-delists-works-on-vizag-coffee-plantations-from-nregp-tribal-farmers-in-lurch-101616247875036.html

He later moved to Bengaluru to pursue his college education and joined the National College.Hosabale then took literature and obtained his masters in English Literature from Bengaluru University.He joined RSS in 1968 and then the student organisation ABVP in 1972.Hosabale was imprisoned for more than a year under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during the fight to restore democracy against Emergency imposed by former prime minister the late Indira Gandhi.Hosabale, then a youth activist then, is said to be the first to inform the likes of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, S N Mishra and Madhu Dandavate about the imposition of the Emergency while they were at a meeting in Bengaluru on the morning of June 26, 1975.He became a full-time worker of ABVP in 1978 and then went on to become its national organising secretary for 15 years with his headquarters being Mumbai.Hosabale played an active role in setting up the Youth Development Centre at Guwahati, Assam and the World Organisation of Student and Youth (WOSY).The founding editor of 'Aseema', a Kannada monthly, he became Sah-Baudhik Pramukh (second in command of the intellectual wing of RSS) in 2004.Fluent in Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil and Sanskrit, Hosabale is said to have keen interest in literature. He had also termed football as symbol of global oneness.Interestingly, Hosabale was elected as the Sarkaryavah at the ABPS held in his home state Karnataka.Though ABPS is held at different places annually, every third year it is held at RSS headquarters in Nagpur for the election of Sarkaryavah, but it was shifted to Bengaluru this time in the wake of surging Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra.According to sources, Hosabale has cordial relations with the top brass of the BJP and the government including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and is the apt person for the job for having proper coordination.They also said his vast experience in ABVP, the youth wing and in the North East will help the organisation grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dattatreya-hosabale-the-second-kannadiga-to-occupy-no-2-position-in-rss-after-h-v-seshadri-101616242462377.html

Speaking at a special briefing after holding talks with defence minister Rajnath Singh, Austin said the US will continue to work with "like-minded countries" to ensure to right things are done to maintain peace.He was responding to a question about the standoff in Ladakh between the two countries, especially after the Galwan Valley clash in which both Indian and Chinese soldiers were killed in June last year."We are working with India, Australia and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure that freedom of navigation is maintained, and to keep the Indo-Pacific region free and open. There are a lot of capabilities in these countries," said Austin."Working with like-minded countries which have shared interest is the only way to check any aggression and we look forward to continue to do that in the future," he added.Also Watch: Austin honours Indian martyrs, meets Rajnath SinghAustin further said that the US has a lot of common things with Quad countries like India and Australia in terms of defence perspective and President Joe Biden's administration will continue to build on that.Austin's visit to India is first by a top member of Biden's administration. His visit follows a meeting last week between leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States, which together make up the four Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad.The Quad is seen as a counterweight to China, who critics say is flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait and along its northern border with India.China has called the Quad an attempt to contain its ambitions.Earlier on Saturday, Austin met with defence minister Rajnath Singh where the two leaders agreed to deepen defense cooperation, intelligence sharing and logistics.“India is an increasingly important partner in rapidly shifting international dynamics. I reaffirm our commitment to a comprehensive forward-looking defense partnership with India as a central pillar of our approach to the Indo-Pacific region,” Austin said.Singh said that the talks were focused on “expanding military-to-military engagement”.Austin arrived in New Delhi on Friday and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-considered-india-and-china-are-on-verge-of-war-us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-101616239948077.html

CPI leader and Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam criticised the technocrat, saying it spoke volumes about the direction in which the BJP was taking the country. The images circulated widely on the social media showed the voters receiving Sreedharan washing and touching his feet. In one picture, a voter was seen kneeling before him, while another visual showed women touching his feet. Asked about the controversy, Sreedharan said the images were clicked when he was being welcomed in a traditional Indian way. Slamming his critics, the 88-year-old candidate said, "It is our Indian tradition. What is wrong with it? They were expressing their respect. They were not worshipping (me)." Attacking Sreedharan, Viswam alleged that the technocrat "glorified" the act of washing his feet. "He is saying it is Indian tradition. This is an example of the direction in which the BJP is taking our country, the political system and democratic values," he told reporters. The CPI leader said India had looked at Sreedharan as "a torchbearer of modern technology", but he changed after entering into the "prison of the politics of the BJP and RSS". Launching his campaign earlier this week, Sreedharan had said BJP is fighting the polls on the plank of development. Sitting MLA Shafi Parambil of the Congress and CPI(M)'s C P Pramod are his main rivals in the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metroman-comes-under-attack-from-left-over-images-of-voters-washing-his-feet-101616238864062.html
20-03-2021||India||CEC hopeful concept of remote voting will see the light of day by next LS polls||Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora Saturday expressed hope the concept of remote voting will see "the light of day" by the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, and said that a pilot project could begin in the next two-three months.Addressing an event here, he said, the EC had early this year started a research project for enabling remote voting, in consultation with IIT Madras and eminent technologists from IITs and other leading institutions.Over the last few months, a dedicated team has been working hard for giving shape to this project, he said, adding the concept would hopefully "see the light of day" by 2024 Lok Sabha elections.The first pilot project could be rolled out in the next "two to three months", the CEC said.It needs to be underscored that the project is neither aimed at internet-based voting nor does it imply voting from home, he observed.For the Commission, transparency and confidentiality of voting has always been a guiding consideration in ensuring free, fair and credible elections, he said, adding the Commission will soon be giving shape to the final model of such voting, after due deliberation on various options.This will entail some process changes as well, he said, adding there will be wider consultations with political parties and other stakeholders.Explaining the "blockchain" technology involved in the project, former Senior Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena had earlier said the concept is a "two-way electronic voting system in a controlled environment on white-listed IP devices on dedicated Internet lines enabled with biometric devices and a web camera".Saxena, however, had made it clear that voters will have to reach a designated venue during a pre-decided period of time to be able to use this facility.It does not mean voting from home, Saxena had said.On the issue of Commission's proposal to allow eligible overseas Indian voters use one-way electronically transferred postal ballots to cast vote, Arora said after the elections to five assemblies are over, the poll panel would hold a seminar with all stakeholders as suggested by the government.He expressed hope that the concept would materialise in the next six months or a year.At present, non-resident Indians can vote in the constituency in which their place of residence, as mentioned in the passport, is located.Some time ago, the Commission began to look for options to enable NRIs to vote from overseas after it received several requests for expanding their voting options.At the event, Bhartruhari Mahtab (BJD), Supriya Sule (NCP) and Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) were given the 'Sansad Maha Ratna Award' for their sustained qualitative overall performance in the 16th Lok Sabha.Twelve Parliamentarians including the Chairman of a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture were given the Sansad Ratna Awards.The awards were instituted in 2010 by a Chennai-based NGO Prime Point Foundation, and the eMagazine PreSense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cec-hopeful-concept-of-remote-voting-will-see-the-light-of-day-by-next-ls-polls-101616238315934.html
20-03-2021||India||Youth leaders from Kashmir join People’s Conference||Several youth leaders from Kashmir including a close associate of jailed Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youth leader Waheed ur Rehman Parra joined the People’s Conference (PC) on Saturday, said PC spokesman Adnan Ashraf.After Arif Amin, Faizan Ellahi, Amaan Zargar and Riyaz Wani joined the party at his Srinagar residence, PC president Sajjad Lone said the youth bolster the belief that change will dawn one day and that the youth will script that change.“While the youthfulness inspires all of us, I feel sad that our youth have been saddled with disempowerment. The youth of today is taking over a legacy which is mired in political disempowerment. We are handing over a very depleted and disempowered J&K and I feel sad that unlike youths in other states enjoying their youthfulness, the youth in J&K have to get together to empower their people and get back their basic rights which have been snatched away”, Lone said.People’s Conference is part of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a front of some mainstream political parties chiefly active in the Kashmir valley. The group has resolved to a political fight to restore Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood and special status enshrined in Article 370, which was abrogated by the Parliament in August 2019. Centre says Article 370 was discriminatory and coming in the way of Jammu and Kashmir’s development.Arif Amin, a prominent youth leader from Pulwama said that they have always been looking for an opportunity to work for the vision of the People’s Conference and its leader Sajad Gani Lone.“We assure that we will work hard to reach out to the people and strengthen the party at the grassroots level and ensure that the ideological and developmental discourse of the party is spread across the youth,” said Amin.Amin is a close associate of the PDP youth president, Waheed-ur- Rehman Parra, who played a key role in drawing youth towards the PDP. Parra is currently in jail after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him earlier this year. Though he was bailed by a special NIA court, police detained him in another case.PC leaders said in coming days, more prominent leaders from Kashmir will join the People’s Conference. Few days ago, former PDP patron and former MP Muzaffar Baig joined the PC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youth-leaders-from-south-kashmir-join-people-s-conference-101616237134008.html
20-03-2021||India||Mafia only industry running in Bengal: Modi||Kolkata: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday targeted West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, saying when the nation is moving towards a single-window project clearance system to boost industrialisation, the state has introduced a similar mafia-run system.He did not name Abhishek Banerjee but referred to him as bhaipo (nephew in Bengali). “Bengal, too, has a single window system. It is the bhaipo window. Nothing happens in Bengal without passing through this window. A lot of old industries have shut down because of this. The only industry running is the mafia industry,” he said at an election rally at Kharagpur. “Even children know who is behind the illegal mining of sand from the Subarnarekha river. When BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] comes to power, Bengal will have the rule of law. “Modi alleged Mamata Banerjee has taken away the right to vote. “The world watched how she destroyed your rights during the 2018 panchayat election.” He said the police and administration must remember that nothing is bigger than democracy. “Do not be afraid. Bengal will see real progress. It needs a double engine government to push it forward. It can happen only when the BJP is in power at the state and the Centre.”Abhishek Banerjee, who addressed a Trinamool Congress (TMC) rally at Daspur in the same district less than an hour later, hit back. “Since the Prime Minister is talking of development under a double engine government, he should explain how much progress Uttar Pradesh has seen. We have only seen minor girls being gang-raped and youths being murdered,” Abhishek Banerjee said.“While announcing demonetisation [in 2016], Modi said he will seize all black money in 50 days. He failed to do it in five years. Now, he is talking of developing Bengal in five years. He will not achieve it in 500 years.”He challenged Modi to speak in Bengali for two minutes without using a teleprompter. “I will speak in Hindi without any script or technology for one hour. Let us have this contest anytime, anywhere.” At his second rally at Sabang in West Midnapore district, Abhishek Banerjee threw the language challenge to all BJP national leaders. He added he is ready to go to any BJP-ruled state to face it.Earlier in his 25-minute speech, Modi said voters have given opportunities to many parties over the last 70 years. “Give us five years. Bless us just once. Give us the opportunity to serve you. We will make up for everything that went wrong in 70 years. We will take Bengal to a new path of development,” he said.“...the BJP is indebted to West Bengal. BJP was born out of the Jan Sangh, which was founded by Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. The values and cultures of Asutosh Mookerjee and his son, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, are in the DNA of the BJP.”He told the gathering that they depended on Mamata Banerjee, but she betrayed their trust and shattered dreams. “Now you see her making new promises,” said Modi. “Didi [Mamata Banerjee], people give you 10 years. You gave them 10 years of misrule and corruption. In Bengal, the cut money system must end.” He said last night, WhatsApp, Instagram etc went down for 50-55 minutes. “People got worried. In Bengal, development stopped 50-55 years ago. Didi’s track record only shows appeasement of some and deprivation of others.”Modi called TMC the school of cruelty. “The syllabus includes syndicate and cut money. People are trained in anarchy. Our country has a new national education policy after 35 years. The entire nation is praising it. It wants to change the education system to suit the demands of the 21st century. It stresses on local language even in technical education, medicine and management. But Didi is opposed to this as well. She is not bothered about the future of youths.”Referring to the TMC’s slogan, khela hobe (let’s play) Modi said, “West Bengal is saying the game will end now and development will begin. People are asking what happened to the money the Centre sent to Bengal. Didi, do not give credit to Modi if you do not want to but why deprive the poor?”The BJP has fielded Bengali actor Hiranmoy Chattopadhyay from the Kharagpur Sadar seat. Dilip Ghosh, the party’s state president, won the seat in 2016. The BJP lost it in the 2019 by-election after Ghosh was elected as a Parliament member.Polls in West Bengal are being held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mafia-only-industry-running-in-bengal-modi-101616234133690.html
20-03-2021||India||US-India resolve to elevate defence ties as China shadow looms||India and the US on Saturday discussed ways to elevate their security ties against the backdrop of China’s growing assertiveness, with US defense secretary Lloyd Austin saying the defence partnership with India is a priority of the Biden-Harris administration.The two sides also agreed to enhance cooperation between the Indian military and the US Indo-Pacific, Central and Africa Commands, defence minister Rajnath Singh told a joint media interaction after his meeting with Austin, the first top leader of the Biden administration to visit the country.Austin, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval shortly after arriving in New Delhi on Friday, characterised the India-US relationship as a “stronghold of a free and open Indo-Pacific”.Though both Singh and Austin made no reference to China in their statements to the media, the two sides are understood to have discussed the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), China’s actions across the region, and the situation in Afghanistan.Austin flew into India on the last leg of a three-nation visit that included Japan and South Korea, and China’s coercion and aggression figured in the US defense secretary’s discussions in the earlier stops of his tour. He arrived in India hours after the foreign ministers and NSAs of the US and China clashed publicly at a meeting in Alaska.Pointing to the shared values and converging strategic interests of the US and India, Austin said: “We discussed opportunities to elevate the US-India major defence partnership, which is a priority of the Biden-Harris administration, and we’ll do that through regional security cooperation and military-to-military interactions and defence trade.”Singh said: “The recent leaders’ summit of India, US, Japan and Australia under the Quad framework emphasised our resolve to maintain a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.”He added, “We reviewed the wide gamut of bilateral and multilateral exercises and agreed to pursue enhanced cooperation with the US Indo-Pacific Command, Central Command and African Command.”On the US side, defence ties with India are currently the responsibility of the Hawaii-based Indo-Pacific Command. The decision to enhance cooperation with the Florida-based Central Command and the Germany-based Africa Command is being seen as a significant outcome of Saturday’s meeting. The US Central Command’s area of responsibility includes Pakistan and Afghanistan.The US designated India a “major defence partner” in 2016, allowing the country to have wider access to a range of military and dual-use technologies. The two sides have also signed what are known as “foundational” defence and security agreements, such as the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA).Singh said he and Austin discussed steps to realise the full potential of the foundational agreements, and expanding military-to-military engagement across services, information-sharing, cooperation in emerging sectors of defence, and mutual logistics support.The two sides also discussed the need to enhance capacity to address non-traditional challenges such as oil spills, environmental disasters, drug trafficking, and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, he added.Singh invited the US industry to take advantage of India’s liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) policies in defence. “We both agreed that there are opportunities for collaboration in the defence industry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-discuss-ways-to-elevate-defence-ties-101616233713627.html
20-03-2021||India||Hosabale is RSS’s new general secretary||New Delhi: Dattatreya Hosabale, 67, was on Saturday named as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s new general secretary replacing Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi. The appointment was announced at the ongoing meeting of Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, the RSS’s highest decision-making body, in Bengaluru.Hosabale was RSS’s joint general secretary since 2009. In 2018, a section of the cadre pushed for a younger and more articulate Hosable to replace Joshi, 73, who had held RSS’s second-in-command position for three terms. Joshi went on to complete his fourth term. Hosabale’s elevation comes ahead of RSS’s centenary celebrations that will begin in 2024. Even as RSS’s footprint has grown across the country, the ideological fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in an expansion mode. It has set a target of opening at least one shakha or unit in every mandal, or a cluster of 10-12 villages, ahead of its 100-year celebrations.Hosbale, who is known for his organising and planning skills, made a mark within the organisation during his stint with RSS’s students’ wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).He has been given the new crucial position keeping in view the expansion plans and also for the ease with which he balances the Sangh’s ideological position with political pragmatism, said people aware of the reasons for his elevation.“His ability to straddle the Sangh and the BJP are well known and will be put to good use as the Sangh prepares for its expansion as well as acts as a guiding force for the BJP that will also face a test in 2024 [general elections],” said an RSS functionary, requesting anonymity.A second functionary said a larger section of RSS volunteers is under 50. Hosable, who is younger than Joshi, is expected to have a better understanding of the “aspirations and the changed thought process” of the cadre, the functionary added. “While there is no question of diluting the Sangh’s ideology, there is a need to be more inclusive. It was Dattaji who articulated the Sangh’s view on controversial issues such as homosexuality.”In 2016, Hosable said the Sangh does not consider homosexuality a crime. He added it does not need to be punished but treated as a psychological case. Hosable has also said gay marriages amount to institutionalisation of homosexuality and should be prohibited. Popularly known as Datta ji, Hosable is from Karnataka’s Shivamogga. He joined RSS in 1968 and became a full-time ABVP worker in 1978. He served as ABVP’s general secretary for 15 years in Mumbai.Hosable, who has a degree in English literature, was imprisoned for over a year during the state of emergency in the 1970s. Fluent in Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil, and Sanskrit, Hosbale played a role in setting up the Youth Development Centre in Guwahati, Assam, and World Organisation of Students and Youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hosabale-is-rss-s-new-general-secretary-101616231193375.html

20-03-2021||India||Mizoram can't remain indifferent to sufferings of Myanmarese refugees fleeing coup: CM to Centre||Urging the Centre to review its order to four Myanmar-bordering northeastern states including Mizoram to prevent illegal immigration from the neighbouring country and ensure expeditious deportation, Chief Minister Zoramthanga has asserted that the people of his state, who share ethnic ties with the refugees from Chin communities, can't remain indifferent to their plight.The Mizo National Front (MNF) chief, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 18, requested him to personally intervene in the matter to provide asylum to the political refugees on humanitarian grounds, an official at the Chief Minister's Office said on Saturday.He said the MHA's March 10 advisory to Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur was not acceptable to his state.Though the MNF is a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), it does not have an alliance with the saffron party in the state."This (MHA advisory) is not acceptable to Mizoram. I understand that there are certain foreign policy issues where India needs to proceed cautiously. However, we cannot ignore this humanitarian crisis," Zoramthanga said in the letter, a copy of which is available with the PTI.He said the areas in Myanmar bordering Mizoram are inhabited by Chin communities who share ethnic ties and have had close contact with the people of the state even before India was independent.Zoramthanga said a human catastrophe of gigantic proportions is happening in Myanmar and innocent citizens are being killed by the military, which is supposed to protect them.Every day, terrified Myanmarese people are struggling to cross over into Mizoram in search of shelter and protection, he said."Therefore, Mizoram cannot just remain indifferent to their sufferings. India cannot turn a blind eye to this humanitarian crisis unfolding right in front of us in our own backyard," the letter read.Zoramthanga said that India, as the world's largest democracy and Myanmar's immediate neighbour, must act in this matter.Meanwhile, Mizoram Rajya Sabha member K Vanlalvena told PTI that the number of Myanmarese refugees taking shelter in the northeastern state has soared to over 1,000.An officer in the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID), however, said that as per official records, a total of 547 Myanmarese have entered Mizoram since the coup on February 1.He said that the actual number may be higher as many Mizoram residents have accommodated Myanmarese refugees without informing the authorities.Myanmarese people fleeing the coup have taken shelter in eight districts and most of them are being handled by local NGOs, he said.Several outfits, including the state's apex student body Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP), are raising money to support the refugees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-can-t-remain-indifferent-to-sufferings-of-myanmarese-refugees-fleeing-coup-cm-to-centre-101616229759042.html

Johnson will be arriving in India on April 26.It is learnt from reliable sources that Johnson's visit to Chennai has been finalised and his schedule for Tamil Nadu is being worked on. It is also learnt that very soon advance teams from the UK will reach Chennai.Recently, addressing the International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (ICDRI 2021), Johnson had lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in areas such as renewable energy in the global fight against climate change."We have a shared vision for a sustainable future for our nations and the global community - and I very much look forward to discussing this and many other issues with Prime Minister Modi on my upcoming visit to India," Johnson said on Wednesday.There is no official announcement on the date of his visit to India and the contours of the visit are still being worked out.The British Prime Minister had cancelled his planned India visit earlier this year due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. He was invited to take part in the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.He recently announced that Britain would "tilt" its focus towards the Indo-Pacific region as part of its integrated review of government policy for the coming years.India is a high priority for the UK. This is borne by the fact that India will be the first country to be visited by Johnson after Britain's exit from the European Union, a source familiar with developments said.UK is hosting the G7 summit in June where Prime Minister Modi is a special invitee.

This led to a fire in the S5 coach of the New Delhi-Dehradun Shatabdi Special. The incident happened on March 13 near Raiwala in Uttarakhand.Section 167 of the Railways Act specifies that anyone found smoking in a compartment despite prohibition or objection from a co-passenger is liable for a fine of up to ₹100.Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in a meeting with Railway Board members and general managers of zones asked them to take proactive steps towards sensitising passengers against smoking in trains and also urged that erring passengers need to be deterred from causing risks to others by smoking in trains."The railways will crackdown on smoking in trains. The fire most likely started in one of the toilets and initial investigations revealed that the fire was in all probability caused by simmering cigarettes/ beedi thrown in the dustbin. The continuous air flow in a fast moving train would have fanned it."We are contemplating severe penalties. In some cases, even arrests can be made for causing damage to public railway property and risking the lives of others to deter irresponsible and errant persons," a senior officer said.The official refused to come on record as the investigation into the incident is still underway.The fire, the officer said was so damaging that the interior of the toilet was completely charred and the floor was cracked.Officers said that a passenger has also provided a written statement to the four- member probe team stating that the smoke detector in coach went off when the fire started."A bigger tragedy was averted by the swift response of the train crew as the coach was detached soon."But we can't let the guard down. So much effort has been made to prevent such incidents. Irresponsible passengers can not be allowed to risk the lives of others," DJ Narain, Spokesperson, Railways, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shatabdi-fire-probe-railways-mulls-severe-penalty-for-smoking-in-trains-if-it-leads-to-property-damage-101616228138309.html
20-03-2021||India||Covid vaccine should be able to give protection for 8-10 months: AIIMS director||The Covid-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said on Saturday.He also said that no major side-effect of the vaccine has been recorded.“The Covid-19 vaccine should be able to give good protection from the infection for eight to ten months and maybe, even more,” Guleria said at an event organised by the IPS (Central) Association.He said the biggest reason for the surge in cases is that people feel the pandemic is over and they are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour."There are multiple reasons for the surge, but the main reason is that there is change in people's attitude and they feel coronavirus is over. People should still restrict non-essential travel for some more time," the official asserted.NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul said the chain of transmission has to be stopped and for that vaccine is one tool but another is containment and surveillance strategy."Not following Covid-19 behaviour and laxity is major reason for the surge," he said.Responding to a question on vaccinating more people, Paul said the issue is vaccines are limited and that is why, prioritisation has been done."If we had unlimited supply, we would open the vaccination for everyone. That is the reason, not everyone, is getting vaccinated. Most countries in the world are not able to go beyond priority group because of this reason," he said.The NITI Aayog member also said that the highest mortality was seen among people with co-morbidities and older age groups."These people must not delay taking the vaccine. So the message is that they need it more than others. That is the reason they have been prioritised for getting the Covid-19 vaccine," he said.Talking about the effectiveness of the available Covid-19 vaccines, Covaxin and Covishield, Guleria said, "If we look at the two vaccines, they produce equal antibodies and are very robust. We should take the vaccine available to us because both are equally effective in terms of efficacy and long-term protection.”Over four crore people in the country have been vaccinated against the disease till now. Under the current phase of the inoculation drive, people above 60 years of age and those in the 45-59 years age bracket with co-morbidities, are being vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-should-be-able-to-give-protection-for-8-10-months-aiims-director-101616228607895.html
20-03-2021||India||Home ministry hands over Mansukh Hiran murder probe to NIA||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Saturday handed over the Mansukh Hiran murder probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Till now, the case was being investigated by Maharashtra Police's Anti-terrorism Squad (ATS).The probe was handed over the central investigation agency under section 8 of the NIA Act which says that any connecting offence related to scheduled offence already under investigation can also be taken over by it. The NIA will re-register the Mumbai police FIR in the murder case and take over case file as well as the post-mortem report.Hiran was found dead on March 5 and his body was recovered from Kalwa Creek, hours after his family reported him missing.

20-03-2021||India||Rajnath says talks with Austin 'fruitful', US defence secretary calls India 'important partner'||US Defence secretary Lloyd J Austin III met his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh in New Delhi on Saturday and discussed strengthening and elevating defence ties between the two countries. Singh told reporters India is committed to further strengthen its robust defence partnership with the US.After talks concluded, Singh told news agency PTI he urged the US defence equipment manufacturing industry to make good use of the liberalised foreign direct investment (FDI) policies in the defence sector.“I invited the US defence industry to take advantage of India's liberalised FDI policies in the defence sector,” PTI said quoting Singh.Austin reiterated Singh’s words on strengthening ties, stating that his visit was primarily to convey the Biden-Harris administration’s message about the commitment to America’s allies and partners.India was designated as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ by the United States in 2016."I am happy to say that we had comprehensive and fruitful talks with Secretary Austin and his delegation. We are determined to realise full potential of comprehensive global strategic partnership. Talks focussed on wide-ranging defence cooperation, expanding military to military engagement, info sharing and cooperation in emerging areas of defence and mutual logistics support," Rajnath Singh said."We also reviewed many bilateral and multilateral exercises and we agreed for increased cooperation between the Indian military, US Indo-Pacific command, Centre Command and Africa Command. We've signed LEMOA, COMCASA & BECA agreements & we've agreed to realise their full potential," his statement read."India is an increasingly important partner in rapidly shifting international dynamics. I reaffirm our commitment to a comprehensive forward-looking defense partnership with India as a central pillar of our approach to the Indo-Pacific region," Austin said."Our relationship is a stronghold of free & open Indo-Pacific region. PM Modi stated India stands for freedom of navigation & freedom of overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce in adherence to international law. This reaffirms our shared vision for regional security," his statement read.The two countries have signed three important defence and security pacts in the past few years. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), signed in 2016, allows both nations militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, which can be later reimbursed. The COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement), inked in 2018 after the first 2+2 dialogue, allows ‘interoperability’ between the two militaries through the transfer of communication security equipment from the US to India. The BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement, signed in October last year, grants real-time access to American geospatial intelligence. These three pacts together form the bedrock of defence cooperation between India and the US.Austin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday. Before meeting Singh, he visited the National War Memorial to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony.Austin landed in Delhi on Friday and is on a three-day visit to India, which will end on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-says-talks-with-austin-fruitful-us-defence-secretary-calls-india-important-partner-101616227356446.html
20-03-2021||India||Mehta ‘was all but forced to quit under pressure’, academics say in open letter||A group of academics from American, Canadian, and British universities has written an open letter saying they are distressed to learn of Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s resignation “under political pressure” from Ashoka University. “It seems that Ashoka’s Trustees, who should have treated defending him [Mehta] as their institutional duty, instead all but forced his resignation,” said the letter to the trustees, administrators, and faculty of Ashoka University.The letter called Mehta a “prominent critic of the current Indian government and defender of academic freedom” and added he had become a target for his writings. It cited Mehta’s resignation letter in which he said his “public writing in support of a politics that tries to honour constitutional values of freedom and equal respect for all citizens is perceived to carry risks for the university.”Mehta, a political commentator, resigned from the university on March 16. Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India, put in his papers as a professor at the university two days later citing the circumstances involving Mehta’s resignation, which he said devastated him. “...someone [Mehta] of such integrity and eminence, who embodied the vision underlying Ashoka, felt compelled to leave is troubling. That even Ashoka—with its private status and backing by private capital—can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom is ominously disturbing. Above all, that the University’s commitment to fight for and sustain the Ashoka vision is now open to question makes it difficult for me to continue being part of Ashoka,” said Subramanian, who joined Ashoka University as an economics professor in July 2020 two years after he stepped down as the chief economic advisor. In a separate statement, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan called free speech the soul of a great university and added “by compromising on it, the founders of Ashoka University have bartered away its soul”. “Ashoka’s founders should have realised that their mission was indeed not to take political sides but to continue to protect the right of people like Pratap Bhanu Mehta to speak, for in doing so, they were enabling Ashoka to make its greatest contribution to India’s wellbeing –– identifying what is wrong and encouraging us all to remedy it,” he wrote on LinkedIn.Rajan also referred to Subramanian’s departure. He added both his and Mehta’s resignation letters suggest the founders of the university have succumbed to outside pressure to get rid of “a troublesome critic.“ “The reality is that Professor Mehta is a thorn in the side of the establishment. He is no ordinary thorn because he skewers those in government and in high offices like the Supreme Court with vivid prose and thought-provoking arguments. It is not that he has much sympathy for the opposition either,” Rajan said.He called Mehta an equal opportunity critic just as how a true academic should be. In their letter, the academics expressed solidarity with Mehta and reaffirmed the importance of the values that he has always practiced. “In political life, these are free argument, tolerance, and a democratic spirit of equal citizenship. In the university, they are free inquiry, candor, and a rigorous distinction between the demands of intellectual honesty and the pressure of politicians, funders, or ideological animus,” the open letter said. “These values come under assault whenever a scholar is punished for the content of public speech. When that speech is in defense of precisely these values, the assault is especially shameful.”The academics underlined the university must be a home for fearless inquiry and criticism. “We support Pratap Bhanu Mehta in his practice of the highest values of intellectual inquiry and public life.”The signatories to the letter include Bruce Ackerman, Yale University, Sana Aiyar, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Danielle Allen, Harvard University, Sunil Amrith, Yale University, and Kwame Anthony Appiah, New York University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehta-was-all-but-forced-to-quit-under-pressure-academics-say-in-open-letter-101616225853091.html

20-03-2021||India||Dattatreya Hosabale becomes RSS general secretary, replacing Bhaiyyaji Joshi||Dattatreya Hosabale has become the new general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), replacing Bhaiyyaji Joshi. The RSS confirmed the development on its Twitter handle on Saturday. The election took place at the two-day meeting of RSS's highest decision-making body, Akhila Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, in Bengaluru.बेंगलुरु : संघ की अखिल भारतीय प्रतिनिधि सभा में सरकार्यवाह पद के लिए श्री दत्तात्रेय होसबाले जी निर्वाचित हुए। वे 2009 से सह सरकार्यवाह का दायित्व निर्वहन कर रहे थे। pic.twitter.com/wEVwGCDaWD73-year-old Bhaiyyaji Joshi became the general secretary in 2009 and completed four terms of three years each. Dattatreya Hosabale is around 65 years old and hails from a family of RSS activists in Karnataka. He joined the RSS in 1968 and, in 1978, became a full-time organiser. In 2004, he became the second in command of the intellectual wing of the RSS.During the Emergency, Dattatreya was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) and was imprisoned for 16 months.Recently at a book release programme of the Sangh, Hosabale said there is only one "DNA in Bharat and that is Hindu". "In the Sangh, Hindu is a "rashtravachak" word. There is one DNA in Bharat and the name of that DNA is Hindu. Hindutva has an identity and those terming themselves secular have propagated it as communal, despite the fact that it is a diverse idea," he said.The annual conclave of the RSS is being held in Bengaluru and not in Nagpur because of the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra.Though Joshi's term has been extended several times in the past, this time it was not feasible because of his age and also because of the upcoming 2024 general elections and the centenary celebrations of the Sangh in 2025.RSS joint general secretary Manmohan Vaidya on Friday said there is a growing curiosity about RSS among the public. "All may not join the Sangh, but they are ready and eager to work with Sangh. The way to engage and involve such people in building a better society along with expanding and planning Sangh work in the next 3 years will be discussed at the ABPS this time," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dattatreya-hosabale-becomes-rss-general-secretary-101616223454040.html

20-03-2021||India||US to give India access to better technologies to meet Indo-Pacific challenge||The Joe Biden administration will provide India access to better capabilities and technologies to enforce the rule of international law in Indo-Pacific, people aware of the development said after US defence secretary Lloyd Austin’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has described the Indo-US strategic partnership “a force for global good”.The top US defence official landed in New Delhi on Friday evening as part of the Biden administration’s efforts to forge an alliance of countries seeking to push back against China’s assertiveness in the region. He met Prime Minister Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval soon after. Austin is scheduled to meet defence minister Rajnath Singh later on Saturday.“Great meeting with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval last night,” Austin tweeted on Saturday morning. “The breadth of collaboration between our two nations reflects the significance of our major defence partnership as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region.”Great meeting with National Security Advisor Doval last night. The breadth of collaboration between our two nations reflects the significance of our Major Defense Partnership as we work together to address the most pressing challenges facing the Indo-Pacific region. pic.twitter.com/DoMZiJDiF1It is understood that the two-hour-long meeting between Secretary Austin and NSA Doval was very positive with both leaders exchanging notes on the security environment in Asia and beyond.“It is in American interest that there is a favourable balance of power in Asia in face of a militarily assertive China. Washington needs to join hands with countries like India whose territorial integrity is being challenged by Beijing,” said a former Indian foreign secretary.Austin’s meetings in New Delhi are a strong contrast to the one held by his two colleagues, US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with their Chinese counterparts in Alaska’s Anchorage. After the first round, both sides publicly skewered each other’s policies in front of TV cameras.It is quite evident from the readouts of the US-China meeting between top diplomats of the two countries that Beijing will continue to assert its growing power all across the globe with what it called the Chinese style of democracy and push back against the US and its allies on all fronts.Secretary Austin’s meeting with PM Modi and NSA Doval has laid the firm foundation for the two countries to enforce international law in the Indo-Pacific bilaterally and through the Quad platform.The leaders of the United States, India, Australia and Japan, who met under the aegis of a grouping known as Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad held their first summit last week pledged to work together for a free and open Indo-Pacific and to cooperate on maritime and cybersecurity in the face of challenges from China.India and China have been locked in a standoff at multiple locations in the East Ladakh region since May last year after aggressive maneuvres by Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army. The two sides have pulled out troops from the friction points around Pangong Tso but have been unable to move forward in other areas.While no defence deals are expected out of Secretary Austin’s meeting with defence minister Rajnath Singh, the formal meeting will help the visiting dignitary understand Indian future hardware requirements particularly in light of the increasing maritime domain awareness and reaction capabilities in the Indo-Pacific. As of now, the new Joe Biden administration is reviewing US weapon supplies to its partners and the hardware pipeline is set to resume after Secretary Austin returns to Washington.On top of this agenda are 30 weaponised Predator drones to Indian tri-services and six more P8I anti-submarine warfare and surveillance aircraft apart from the possible transfer of technology to make heavier and more powerful engines for twin-engine fighter being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization under “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative. The Indian Navy is already using two unarmed Predator drones for surveillance of the Indian Ocean and beyond to understand and adapt to the technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-give-india-access-to-better-technologies-amid-china-s-assertion-101616217512188.html

20-03-2021||India||Tigress in Odisha to return to MP after failure of translocation exercise||More than two and a half years after a tigress was brought from Madhya Pradesh to Odisha under India’s first interstate relocation exercise for tigers, the big cat will be sent back, signalling the failure of the exercise, following allegations of mishandling of the animal by Odisha’s forest department, said officials.Odisha chief wildlife warden Shashi Paul said a team comprising a veterinary doctor, a senior forest official, and 5 to 6 auxiliary staff from Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh will reach Satkosia on Saturday to take back tigress ‘Sundari’, who was brought from the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in June 2018 and released into Satkosia Tiger Reserve in Odisha’s Angul district.Paul said the team will examine Sundari’s health and then shift her to the Ghorela Rewilding Centre in Kanha National Park in the next 3 to 4 days. “If the tigress is found fit for the transportation, it would be translocated in the next 3 to 4 days,” he said.Sundari was shifted to a special enclosure in Satkosia tiger reserve after it killed a 45-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man living inside the reserve in September 2018, triggering violence by locals who burnt the forest department’s boats and beat house. Mahabir, the first tiger relocated from a tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh in June 2018 died due to metal snares laid by poachers that caused deep wounds on its neck.In December 2019, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) asked the Odisha government to send Sundari back from Satkosia, accusing the state forest and wildlife department of messing up the monitoring and management of the relocated tigress by not following the standard operating procedure.In December last year, MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote to Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik alleging that Sundari lost its natural instinct and behaviour due to improper handling in Odisha.“A team sent to Odisha to take back the tigress found that Sundari has lost its wild nature due to prolonged confinement and presence of humans around her. If it is released into the wild again, it would be dangerous for the animal as well as humans. Therefore, I request you to ensure proper care of the tigress until we have prepared fully to take it back and shift it to Ghorela centre,” Chouhan wrote to Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tigress-in-odisha-to-return-to-mp-after-failure-of-translocation-exercise-101616213852384.html
20-03-2021||India||Inter-state job racket busted in Odisha, 5 arrested||Odisha police claim to have busted an inter-state racket that was cheating youth by promising non-existent jobs in Tata industries in return for money with the arrest of five persons from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, said police officials. Angul superintendent of police Jagmohan Meena said the job racket spanned Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Bihar and lured unemployed youth into paying up to ₹8 lakh in the hope of employment in respectable engineering companies. A 62-year-old man and his 29-year-old son were among those arrested while they were in the process of circulating fake recruitment forms to aspirants.The job fraud first came to the notice of police last month when 59-year-old Pranabandhu Jena of Angul district alleged that in 2018, a man known as Mishra took ₹ 450,000/- in cash from him with the promise to engage his son at TATA Industries, Jamshedpur. However, he could not provide any job to his son. When Jena asked Mishra for a refund, he returned only about ₹80,000 in three instalments while threatening and abusing him. Operating since 2018, the accused are believed to have cheated scores of people.In December last year, Odisha police arrested former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy for his alleged involvement in defrauding around 100 youths of Ganjam district in the name of providing jobs in Tata Motors. Panigrahy, who is still behind bars, allegedly took up to ₹10 lakh from each of the aspirants.Two days ago, a conman posing as the director of Bloomberg TV channel was arrested in Bhubaneswar for allegedly cheating a youth of ₹1.3 lakh on the pretext of giving him a job. Odisha’s unemployment rate has increased by 10.7 percentage points, rising to 23.8% in Apr 2020, according to a survey conducted by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/interstate-job-racket-busted-in-odisha-5-arrested-101616210731758.html

20-03-2021||India||2nd wave of Covid-19: These states shut schools once again as cases rise||A year after classrooms were shifted to the online space because of the outbreak of Covid-19, the situation remains the same in many states as physical classes are being suspended once again in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic.Most education institutions suspended physical classes in March 2020 around the time when the nationwide lockdown was announced. After a gap of six months, the Centre allowed states to take a decision on the resumption of physical classes in September. Reviewing the ground situation, states resumed offline classes only if parents give the consent to send their wards to the schools. The process of reopening spanned from September to January, but as cases in India started surging in February, authorities are choosing to suspend physical classes. This comes at a time when students are all set to appear for their annual exams, board exams etc.List of states which have already closed schoolsPunjabTill March 31, all educational institutions of Punjab will remain closed. Only medical and nursing colleges will remain open. The worst-affected districts of the state are Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Mohali, Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar and Moga. On Friday, Punjab reported 2,490 infections.PondicherryAll schools for classes 1 to 8 in this Union territory will remain closed between March 22 and May 31.GujaratThe Gujarat government this week has asked all schools in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Vadodara, Surat, Bhavnagar, Gandhinagar, Jamnagar and Junagadh to switch to only online classes till April 10. Tuition classes in the cities have also been closed till April 10.MaharashtraSchools in districts that are under lockdown and restrictions are shut, according to local lockdown rules. Schools, colleges in Pune are closed till March 31. All schools, hostels, colleges in the Palghar district have been closed till further order. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has asked all schools under its jurisdiction to switch to online platforms.How schools/hostels are becoming Covid-19 hotspotsResidential schools in many states have reported a cluster outbreak of the infection in the past month. Though schools have been allowed to reopen hostels after thorough sanitising and ensuring that all Covid-19 guidelines are being followed, sharing of common space is being seen as the reason behind the outbreaks. Many cases are asymptomatic as well, making it difficult to track.Such cluster outbreaks were reported when schools reopened for the first time after a lockdown in September, October. But the situation was brought under control in November as overall cases came down in November-December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-2nd-peak-these-states-are-shutting-schools-once-again-as-cases-rise-101616206015134.html
20-03-2021||India||Govt wants WhatsApp privacy policy blocked||The Union government on Friday urged the Delhi high court to restrain WhatsApp from implementing its new privacy policy, contending the rules were vague, failed to protect user data from being shared with third parties, and did not guarantee deletion of all data once users withdrew their consent.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet was told by the Centre in an affidavit that though the rules framed in 2011 under the Information Technology Act prohibits sharing of information with third parties, WhatsApp has stated that data and information will be freely shared with and received by other companies owned by Facebook.It said that no details were given about the third parties with whom the information will be shared, and submitted that since the contract of a user is only with WhatsApp, all other Facebook companies are “third parties” and any sharing of data between them amounts to a violation.The matter will be heard on April 20.“WhatsApp has stated that data and information will be freely shared with and received from other Facebook companies. Since the contract of the user is only with WhatsApp, all other Facebook companies are ‘third parties’ and any inter-sharing of data obtained by it will amount to violation of the restriction on further disclosure,” it added.The controversy relates to the company’s decision in January to enforce a new privacy policy that will allow it to share some data about users’ interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook, and that accepting these terms were mandatory in order to use the service.WhatsApp was under fire by critics who said users will now not have an option but to consent to the sharing if they want to keep using the application. The company pushed back the roll-out of the policy to May 15 but reiterated in February that it will go ahead with its decision. This came despite the government writing a letter, asking the company to abandon its plans.In its affidavit, the government also told the court that the new privacy policy does not provide the opportunity to review or amend the full information submitted by a user, pointing out that the changes allowed to be made are limited to the name, picture, mobile number and “about” information.“The privacy policy is completely silent on correction/ amendment of information. It appears to provide an option to further manage, change, limit or delete your information of the policy, but upon close perusal, it is apparent that this ability is limited to a user’s profile name, picture, mobile number and the about information. For the policy to be compliant with the Rules, it must allow the users to exercise this option for all kinds of data collected by WhatsApp which are mentioned in the policy. The impugned privacy policy thus fails to fulfil these obligations,” the affidavit said.WhatsApp did not respond to requests for a comment.The Centre’s response came on a plea by Seema Singh through advocate Meghan, challenging the new WhatsApp privacy policy. The plea sought directions to the authorities to provide an option to opt out of sharing data with Facebook.Reacting to the Union government’s response, advocate Meghan said: “The three rights prayed before the court to be declared authoritatively have not been talked about in the counter affidavit.” The three were the right to seek confirmation, access and rectification; to objection, restriction and portability of the data; and to be forgotten as part of Article 21 and the intrinsic to the right to privacy.He also said the government has not proposed any measure to protect user privacy in the interim. “The mechanism to protect the citizen’s privacy in the interim has also not been heeded in the counter affidavit,” she added.The Centre cited the 2011 IT Act rules to contend that the updated privacy policy fails to specify the types of “sensitive personal” data being collected, and with whom the information was being shared.The government said that, in accordance with law, WhatsApp is required to explain the types of “personal” and “sensitive personal” information, but WhatsApp has used general terms to enlist the kinds of data collected, and made no distinction between “personal” data or “sensitive personal” data.According to the 2011 rules, there are eight categories of information that qualify as sensitive personal data, including user passwords, financial instrument and transaction information, and biometrics information.On January 15, a law student, Chaitanya Rohilla, too challenged the new privacy policy. WhatsApp initially made it mandatory for the users to accept the conditions by February 8.The Delhi high court, while hearing Rohilla’s plea, on January 18 observed that WhatsApp is a private application, and it was not mandatory for people to not download it if they had problems with its privacy policy.Experts welcome the government’s stand and said it was a unique decision. “WhatsApp updated privacy policy, from the perspective of a user, is a chaotic indication to disaster. It is stripping an individual from his right to privacy. Till now, the information was being shared only with the Facebook Group of companies, but now the data will also be shared with third parties and entities whom you have never had a relationship,” said advocate Pavan Duggal.“It is heartening to see the stand of the government because normally, they don’t take such stands. But here the contraventions are so deliberate and intentional, that the government has no choice to take this stand because it has to protect the privacy of the citizens. Also the government can take action against WhatsApp under the new IT rules brought on February 25,” he added.A WhatsApp spokesperson reiterated that the update in question "doesn't expand" company's ability to share data with Facebook. “As we said in January when this matter was first raised: we wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-wants-whatsapp-privacy-policy-blocked-101616199308268.html
20-03-2021||India||A woman pilot to join MiG-29 squadron after Bison, Sukhoi, Rafale||The Indian Air Force (IAF) is set to assign one of its women fighter pilots to a MiG-29 squadron for the first time, the fourth type of fighter aircraft women in the force will fly, people familiar with the development said on Thursday.The IAF’s women pilots are already operating the MiG-21 Bison, Sukhoi-30 and Rafale, the people said. The force began inducting women as fighter pilots five years ago, a turning point in the armed forces.“Pilots are assigned to fighter squadrons according to laid-down norms. It has nothing to do with gender,” said a senior official cited above.Last year, the IAF assigned Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh to its first Rafale squadron based in Ambala. Ten women have been commissioned as fighter pilots after the experimental scheme for their induction into the IAF’s combat stream was introduced in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history. Most of them started off with the MiG-21.“There is no difference in the performance of male or female fighter pilots. They are military professionals trained to carry out specific roles,” said a second official. In the last decade, the IAF’s MiG-29s were upgraded with new avionics, weapons, radar and helmet mounted displays. The upgrade involved overhauling the fighter’s airframe and equipping it with an in-flight refueling system to expand its range.There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament last month. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost threefold over the last six years. The Indian Navy this year deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years, with the service focusing on steadily opening more roles to them. India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and fleet tanker INS Shakti are the warships that have been assigned their first women crews since the late 1990s. In a short-lived experiment, women from the navy’s logistics and medical branches were deployed on fleet tanker INS Jyoti in 1997.“More roles being opened to women in the military is natural progression. We are inching towards having women serving in every branch of the armed forces,” Wing Commander Anupama Joshi (retd), from the first batch of women officers commissioned into the IAF in the early 1990s, said on March 8, Women’s Day. The military has progressively opened more roles to women over recent years.The army will soon open the doors of its aviation wing to women officers. Until now, women officers were only carrying out ground duties in army aviation.The army’s aviation wing operates helicopters. The first batch of women officers will commence training to become pilots in July 2021. They will join front-line flying duties on completion of training in July 2022.Last September, the navy announced that two women officers selected for the helicopter stream were set to become the first women in the navy’s history to operate from flight decks of warships and stay on board the vessels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-woman-pilot-to-join-mig-29-squadron-after-bison-sukhoi-rafale-101616194349618.html

20-03-2021||India||Relief for Naidu as HC stays CID probe in Amaravati land case||Hyderabad The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Friday ordered a stay on a probe into a case by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) against former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu and former minister P Narayana in the alleged Amaravati land case. On Thursday, both the leaders had filed separate petitions in the court, seeking quashing of the March 12 FIR in which Naidu has been named as accused no. 1 and Narayana as accused no. 2. The case pertains to pooling of land for the development of the state’s new capital Amaravati in 2015. The CID had served notices to Naidu and Narayana, asking them to appear before the designated officer on March 23 and March 22, respectively, for probe in the case. The agency also threatened to arrest them if they did not cooperate in the investigation process. Appearing on behalf of Naidu, senior Supreme Court advocate Siddharth Luthra argued that the government order to acquire lands assigned to Dalit farmers was issued under AP Capital Region Development Act as part of land pooling for the construction of the capital.“Sections 166 (public servant disobeying the law) and 167 (public servant framing incorrect document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) invoked by the CID to book cases against Naidu are not applicable in the present case. Secondly, the government order was issued as part of the land acquisition procedure and was ratified by the then chief minister 35 days later. How can the CID say that it was issued on the instructions of Naidu?” he argued. The counsel for Naidu also pointed out that the FIR had failed to mention from where the government had allegedly forcibly taken the land belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) and who had lodged a complaint in this regard. Former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas, who argued on behalf of Narayana, said the case was politically-motivated. “The government order was issued following a proposal by the then Guntur collector based on the representation given by the Dalit farmers. How can the cases be registered under the SC/ST Atrocities Act when the order was meant to provide benefits to the Dalits?” he said. The two counsels for the petitioners urged the court to give a direction to the CID not to go ahead with any measures, including probe and arrests in the case. Justice Roy asked the investigating agency to produce prima facie evidence against Naidu and Narayana. In response, the counsel for CID, Jasti Nagabhushanam said no details could be revealed at this stage and further probe was required to prove the charges against the accused. After hearing the arguments, the high court granted the stay on the probe until further orders. Welcoming the stay order, TDP politburo member and spokesperson Varla Ramaiah said: “The court’s stay order once again showed show the Jagan regime was bent on filing motivated cases to seek revenge against Naidu.” YSRCP general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy said Naidu should face the investigation and come out clean, if he had not committed any crime, instead of obtaining stay orders from the court. “In every case against him, Naidu is surviving by obtaining stay orders. He does not have the guts to face the investigation and prove that he is not guilty,” Reddy said. The FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint by YSRCP MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, who represents Mangalagiri assembly constituency which is part of Amaravati, on February 24. Besides 166 and 167, Naidu was booked under sections 120 B (conspiracy) and 217 (public servant disobeying law with intent to save a person from punishment or property from forfeiture) of IPC.The TDP chief was also booked under SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Section 7 of the AP assigned land (Prevention of Transfer) Act, 1977.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relief-for-naidu-as-hc-stays-cid-probe-in-amaravati-land-case-101616179347203.html
20-03-2021||India||Andhra plans ordinance route to meet govt expenditure||Hyderabad Instead of presenting the full budget, the Andhra Pradesh government is likely to take the ordinance route to seek a vote-on-account for the initial few months of the financial year 2021-22 to meet the government expenditure, citing the impending by-poll to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat on April 17 as reason. If this happens, it will be the second year in a row that the state has had to resort to the ordinance route. It is mandatory for the state assembly to approve the annual budget for the upcoming financial year and ensure passage of the Appropriation Bill before the closure of the current financial year on March 31. With barely two weeks left, the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP government is yet to take any decision on the budget session of the state assembly.“We have not yet taken a call on the budget session of the assembly but it is unlikely that the session will be held under present circumstances (before the by-poll),” senior YSRCP leader and government chief whip in the state assembly G Srikanth Reddy said. He added that holding the session before the election would cause inconvenience not only to the government but also the opposition parties. “We are also insisting on the completion of the elections to the zilla parishad and mandal parishad (block parishad) at the earliest. Amidst the elections, it may not be possible to hold a full-fledged budget session,” he said. The only option left before the Jagan government is to promulgate an ordinance through the Governor under Article 213 (1) of the Constitution of India for the adoption of a vote-on-account budget for appropriation of money and release of approximate budgetary allocations for at least three months. An Appropriation Bill gives power to the government to withdraw funds from the Consolidated Fund of India for meeting the expenses during the financial year. Without the passage of this bill in the assembly, the state government will not be able to withdraw any money from the exchequer from April 1 for the implementation of various welfare programmes and payment of salaries to the state employees. The state cabinet is expected to meet next week to adopt a draft ordinance to pass the vote-on-account for the first three months of the new financial year and get it approved by Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichanan. “Instead of rushing through the budget, we can have a full session at a later date and the budget can be passed after a thorough discussion in the House,” the chief whip said. Last year too, the Jagan government was unable to convene the budget session in early March as it was planning to hold the same in the last week after the completion of elections to urban and rural local bodies. The state election commission, however, deferred polls in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and before the government could decide anything, the Union government declared a nationwide lockdown. Subsequently, the government promulgated an ordinance for the vote-on-account for three months. In the second week of June, it held a short two-day session to adopt the budget. The Governor later addressed the joint session of the assembly and council through video-conferencing mode.However, the appropriation bill, which was passed by the assembly, was withheld in the legislative council. Two weeks later, the bill was deemed to have been passed and the Governor gave his assent to the same. In Telangana, the budget session for the upcoming financial year began on March 15. The government tabled the budget on Thursday and is now preparing for a debate on the same from Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-plans-ordinance-route-to-meet-govt-expenditure-101616179346615.html
20-03-2021||India||LDF offers ‘pension’ for homemakers||Thiruvananthapuram: The ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala released on Friday its manifesto for the April 6 assembly elections, promising a payment for homemakers, creation of 4 million jobs and a ₹5,000-crore coastal area development package. Releasing the manifesto at the Communist Party of India (Marxist) headquarters in the state capital, the party’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said a “pension” would be given to all housewives, but did not elaborate.He also promised an increase in the social security pension paid to the beneficiaries from ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 in phases. “Educational and health sector will be ramped up to meet international standards and 40 lakh (4 MILLION) new job opportunities will be created in the next five years,” he said, adding that infrastructural development will be given special emphasis. Other promises in the manifesto include a ₹5,000-crore coastal area development package to protect the shores from erosion, increasing the minimum support price for rubber to ₹250 per kg, building 1.5 lakh houses for the homeless and attaining self-sufficiency in production of eggs, milk and vegetables.Vijayaraghavan claimed that the “biggest achievement” of the Pinarayi Vijayan government was providing a “corruption-free” regime, and asserted that the state government took all measures to protect secular and democratic ideals of the country. “We are sure about the next five years. All poll surveys have also indicated this,” he said. He further claimed that among the 600 promises made in the 2016 manifesto, 580 have been fulfilled. He, however, refused to comment on the contentious Sabarimala issue. During the three-month long annual pilgrimage season in 2018, the state witnessed large-scale violence and five shutdowns when the state government tried to enforce the Supreme Court verdict annulling a decades-old bar on the entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50 into the Sabarimala temple. After the protests, revision petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, which were referred to a nine-member Constitution bench. The Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front, however, termed the manifesto a bundle of unfinished tasks and empty promises. “Development took a back seat in five years. Only families of communist leaders prospered and wives of many got plum posts defying all norms. Youngsters are still protesting before the state secretariat against back door entry in government services,” said UDF convener and senior Congress leader M M Hassan. He added that the UDF manifesto will be released in a couple of days. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, who is the convener of the manifesto committee for the party, has toured the state extensively to ascertain the key issues facing the local residents.Elections to the 140-member Kerala assembly in 14 districts will be held in a single phase on April 6. The counting of votes will be held on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ldf-offers-pension-for-homemakers-101616179286634.html
20-03-2021||India||Search begins for 4 tigers of Ranthambore reserve||Jaipur: The Ranathambore Tiger Reserve administration has started an intensive search for at least four missing tigers, not sighted for the past year, even as Tiger Watch, whose volunteers track and monitor tigers in the reserve said on Twitter that the number was actually higher, at seven. In a major setback to tiger conservation in Rajasthan, four tigers including two sub-adults have been reported missing from RTR in Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, officials admitted .When a tiger is missing for such a long period of time, it is very likely that it has died, experts said with the possible causes being infighting, poisning by villages upset at losing cattle to the big cats, or even poaching. The RTR administration has not sighted 11-year-old tiger, T-64, tigress T-73 (9-years-old), and her two sub-adult cubs for the past year. The forest department is making efforts to trace them. The officials said the last movement of the tigers were in the non-tourism zone and that they were last camera trapped in March 2020. The two sub-adults were from the second litter of T-73. RTR Field Director, TC Verma said, “We have written to nearby forest divisions, and Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh to look for and inform us if the tigers are cited.”RTR’s 76 tigers including 21 cubs and sub-adults live in an area of 1,334 square kms, making it third most congested habitats for the big cats in India after Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The ‘Status of Tigers in India-2018’ report said that Rajasthan has witnessed an increase of tiger population by 115% in the last 12 years. “The tigers were last seen in Darra, Kundra, Badlav and Jakhra area of RTR, where currently Tigress-103 (four-year-old) and male young tigers T-112-113 are moving. There are possibilities that they are pushed out by them, or died in territorial fight,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.In the past 10 years, over 26 big cats have gone missing from RTR. Till date, none of these tigers have been found. Retired forest services official Sunanyan Sharma said that overcrowding of the reserve is part of the problem and added that the only solution for effective tiger conservation is relocation, after developing the habitat. Dharmendra Khandal of Tiger Watch said all four tigers going missing was a serious issue. “Human threat to big cats cannot be ruled out. Territorial fights among tigers is normal but all these were in prime age and not old,” he said. Khandal blamed the lack of monitoring for such occurrences and suggested that a new protocol be put in place for a fortnight review of tiger’s status and location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-begins-for-4-tigers-of-ranthambore-reserve-101616179107201.html
20-03-2021||India||CBI files charge sheet against four officials for ‘bribe-for-relief’ racket||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday filed a charge sheet against four officers for allegedly running a “bribe-for-relief” racket within the agency.The accused officers were identified as Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs), RK Sangwan and RK Rishi, inspector Kapil Dhankad and stenographer Sameer Kumar Singh. While Singh was arrested on Thursday and sent to judicial custody, the other three officers were arrested in January.The agency has said that the accused officers were leaking confidential information to companies under investigation for bank frauds since 2018.According to the FIR, reviewed by HT, the four officers, along with two advocates and some other accused were “compromising the integrity of the investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”.“Details of the investigation of many other cases, including confidential notes and directions, have been communicated by (Sameer Kumar) Singh to Sangwan and Rishi on pecuniary considerations to protect the interests of the accused,” the FIR stated. The agency has also identified bribes worth ₹55 lakh paid to Rishi ( ₹30 lakh) and Dhankad ( ₹25 lakh).The two DSPs facilitated the bribes by leaking the information to the companies under investigation, said an officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.“The leak of sensitive case-related information like raids, status of investigation, filing of charge sheet, etc., helps accused persons in destroying the evidence. There is a possibility that more officers are involved in the scandal as CBI investigations are monitored at various levels and documents are usually kept in respective branches. It is to be seen how Singh was leaking the documents without anyone’s knowledge,” a CBI officer had told HT in January.The accused persons’ legal representatives could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-four-officials-for-bribe-for-relief-racket-101616179106530.html

The cities/states where CBI teams carried out these checks on Friday include Shillong, Agartala, Tezpur, Guwahati, Imphal, Port Blair, Agra, Singrauli, Goa, Meerut, Allahabad, Gorakhpur; Ahmadabad, Jammu, Hardwar, Naya Raipur, Ahmadabad, Gandhi Nagar, Chandigarh, Coimbatore, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Bikaner, Vishakhapatnam and Cochin etc. The departments/organisations covered under the surprise checks include – Food Corporation of India, Railways; Andaman Public Works Department; Ordinance Factory; North Coal Fields Ltd.; Indian Oil Corporation; Defence Estate Office; Inland Container Depot (ICD); Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology; CPWD (Central Public Works Department), Military Engineering Service, Rourkela Steel Plant etc, Joshi said He added that the documents and records obtained in Joint Surprise Checks are being scrutinized for further necessary action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-conducts-joint-surprise-checks-in-25-states-on-30-central-departments-101616178687219.html
20-03-2021||India||Superspreader events like weddings behind new Covid surge: Govt panel||Superspreader events such as weddings appear to have driven the resurgence of Covid-19 in India, according to preliminary assessments by the Union government that has also found people becoming less careful in recent months when the outbreak had receded to its lowest levels after the virus first emerged in India.On Friday, India recorded more than 40,000 cases – the highest since late November. This number is close to four times the roughly 11,000 being recorded on an average every day in the second week of February.“That (role of superspreader events) is what it looks like, as people have become lax in their behaviour. We must understand that there is still a large section of population that is vulnerable, especially in villages. We cannot afford to lower our guard at this stage, and should avoid mass gatherings as it can become superspreading events,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“Also, testing, especially RT-PCR testing has to increase in districts that are reporting high positivity rate,” he added.State authorities in Punjab said they had found at least 30 super-spreader instances, where more than 10 cases were recorded from a single event.State’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, said exact details about these events were not available but cited some instances: a wedding in a family from Amritsar in Delhi, which led to 20 infections from 38 who were tested; a funeral in Mohali, in which eight of 18 tested were positive, and an office of the Punjab government in Chandigarh where nearly 70 of 132 employees tested were found infected.“In around 75-80% of the cases, patients were found asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. Contact tracing, after one person from the event was found, led to detection in these functions,” said the nodal officer, who asked not to be named.Doctors in Delhi also blame weddings, social outings and get-togethers for the current surge in cases.“I have personally seen several cases where groups of people got the infection at a wedding. There are cases where five to six people in one group who travel for a destination wedding get it. Then, there are kitty parties where four to five people have contracted the infection. We need to change our behaviour, there is no other way to control the spread of the infection. These events are not a necessity and should be avoided,” said Dr Surajit Chaterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care, said, “There was euphoria among people when the number of infections in the city went down as does in any viral infection naturally. With over 50% of the population exposed to the infection, the transmission slowed down. But, people gathering for events such as weddings led to an increase. This is exactly what happened after Dussera and Diwali.”He said he has seen super-spreading events where thirty to forty people at a wedding party contracted the infection.Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been established to spreads through droplets and as aerosolised. So, whenever people eat in groups and pull down their mask, the risk of contracting the infection is very high. Plus, air-conditioned environments are the worst as the virus can remain airborne for 3 to 16 hours if there isn’t proper ventilation.“Festivals and wedding are a hotbed for infections as people tend to forget to take precautions. I know of instances where 40 to 50 people in a wedding got the infection,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max healthcare.A large gathering of people in a funeral turned into a superspreading event in a south Indian state recently, when 33 people got infected after attending a funeral in Karimnagar district of Telangana on February 18.“The mass infection was due to people not following of Covid-19 guidelines such as social distancing and wearing masks,” said G Srinivas Rao, director of health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/superspreader-events-like-weddings-behind-new-covid-surge-govt-panel-101616177606318.html
20-03-2021||India||Scale up climate crisis finance commitments: Sitharaman to advanced economies||Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday called on advanced economies to honour their climate change financing commitments, saying that their obligation to mobilise 100 billion dollars a year to fulfil the needs of developing countries is “meager” and remained largely “unfulfilled”.The minister was speaking at the concluding session of the International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure when she said: “Multilateral negotiations and multilateral institutions have played a critical role in climate change finance-related matters. The Paris Agreement also recognizes the pivotal role that finance plays in being conscious about the resilient nature of infrastructure we need to build.”She added: “I think the resources being given to developing countries is something on which discussion has happened. For developed countries, it underlines their continued obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These commitments will have to be honoured.”The minister further said: “The much discussed commitment of 100 billion dollars a year is something which advanced economies will have to recognise. According to observers and also people who watch developing countries struggle to keep their commitments on the Paris Agreement, finance is an issue, 100 billion a year is a meagre amount. The commitment is meagre and needs to be ramped up. This 100 billion dollar a year commitment is not even close to being fulfilled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fm-to-advanced-economies-scale-up-climate-crisis-finance-commitments-101616176946238.html

20-03-2021||India||Gold smuggling case: Kerala police book ED for ‘forcing’ accused to name Vijayan||The Kerala police on Friday filed a complaint against officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for allegedly forcing Swapna Suresh, main accused in sensational gold smuggling case, to give a statement against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, an unusual move for a police department, but understandable in the context of the coming assembly elections.The FIR said ED officials questioned Suresh on August 13 and 14 last year and allegedly forced to her to give a statement implicating the chief minister. The case has been registered under sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 192 (fabricating false evidence), 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence) of the Indian Penal Code. A senior ED official, who asked not to be named said the latest move is aimed at intimidating the agency’s officials and that ED will seek legal remedies.The state’s ruling Left Democratic Front government has maintained that the investigation is coloured by politics, but the main opposition in Kerala, the Congress-led United Democratic Front has said that the police case itself is aimed at diverting attention from burning issues.The case surfaced in last July after 30kg gold was seized from a consignment sent in diplomatic baggage in UAE consulate in the state capital. Later, several people, including chief minister’s principal secretary M Sivasankar, a senior IAS officer, were arrested for helping the accused; Suresh was labelled the mastermind behind the plan.Last month, the customs department filed an affidavit in Kerala high court quoting Suresh’s statement under the Section 164 of the Indian penal code in which she alleged that the CM, three of his ministers and Speaker were aware of smuggling activities through the consulate. Later, the state attorney general sent a show-cause notice to the customs commissioner asking why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him.In November, a video clip purported to be of Swapna Suresh was leaked from the jail where she is housed, in which she alleged that she was under tremendous pressure to take the name of many ministers and the CM. Later, two women police officers who escorted her also claimed that they were witness to ED officials forcing her to name important personalities including the CM.“I heard a senior ED official named Radhakrishnan promised Swapna Suresh that she would be made an approver in the case if she named the CM. He also forced her to say the money recovered from her locker was handed over to her by Sivasankar,” one of the women civil police officers wrote in a statement to the crime branch. K Radhakrishnan is the ED assistant director in Kochi investigating the case.But the ED denied these claims.HT has not independently verified the authenticity of the video.On March 4, the crime branch sought legal opinion and got the nod to book ED officials. In the First Information Report (FIR), the crime branch said it has clinching evidence against ED officials.“We will examine our legal options. If needed, we might even go to the court against such a move,” an ED official said, requesting anonymity.The Congress and the BJP said the move by the state government is aimed at diverting attention and weaken the case. “The ruling CPI(M) is cornered from all sides in smuggling case and Sabarimala issue. The case is a diversionary tactic,” said state Congress chief Mullappally Ramachandran.“The nervous CM is intimidating officials of the central agencies. It will not work,” said state BJP chief K Surendran.But CPI(M) state acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the state won’t allow free run of the central agencies to discredit the government in the midst of the polls. “We will tell people about their nefarious designs,” he said. Kerala goes to the polls on April 6 and the results will be announced on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-police-book-ed-for-forcing-accused-to-name-cm-vijayan-101616173765658.html
20-03-2021||India||3 states face risk of being next Covid-19 hot spots||With the Covid-19 outbreak in Maharashtra already spiralling to near-record levels in recent days, three states—Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh – appear to face the immediate risk of becoming the next hot spots of the disease, with a high growth rate of cases and rising positivity rates, according to an HT analysis.To identify the new hot spots of the outbreak, HT analysed data from India’s 20 most populous regions, looking for three factors—a rising positivity rate, a high growth rate of daily cases, and low tests per million residents—that have marked all hot spots globally.HT also analysed the change in the seven-day average of daily new cases at the district level based on data compiled by How India Lives. Statistics at both the district and state levels show that western regions of the country have a seen a higher surge in cases than eastern regions.Unsurprisingly, the statistics in Maharashtra, the state which has been reporting a massive increase in new infections in the past week, are alarming.The seven-day average of positivity rate in the state went from 7% for the week ending February 16 to 16.4% for the week ending March 17. In fact, the state has nearly four times the positivity rate of any other state in the list. The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases, also known as case trajectory, in the state grew 426% in the last 30 days—the second highest among the states analysed.Three emerging hotspotsPunjab emerged as the state with some of the most worrying overall numbers, highlighting how the state may be far from seeing the worst of the outbreak. The daily case trajectory in the state grew 531% in the last 30 days (the highest in the country), while its weekly average positivity rate went up 4.7 percentage points in the same time period, the second-highest increase in India only after Maharashtra.Haryana saw the third-highest rate of increase in case rate in the country after Punjab and Maharashtra—398% rise in case rate in the past 30 days. The state also saw its average positivity rate go up 2.2 percentage points.In Madhya Pradesh, the daily case rate went up 277%, while the average positivity rate rose 3.3 percentage points. Another problematic statistic for the state, however, was its testing rate—in the past week, the state conducted 191 tests per million per day, one of the lowest in the country.Positivity rateIn 19 of the 20 states analysed, the Covid-19 positivity rate—the proportion of people testing positive to those tested—was found rising in the last month. The seven-day average of positivity rate across India rose by 1.4 percentage points in the past 30 days—from 1.7% for week ending February 16 to 3.1% in the past week.So far, the four states mentioned above—Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana—are the only regions where the positivity rate rose higher than the national average of 1.4 percentage points. A majority of the regions saw a very marginal increase in positivity rates in the past 30 days.Kerala was the only state that saw its positivity rate improve—it dropped 3.8 percentage points, from 7.1% in mid-February to 3.3% in the last seven days.Resurgence of casesThe seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across India has risen 140% in the past 30 days (from 11,235 cases a day for week ending on February 16 to 26,991 a day on March 17)—a statistic that reflects the start of the second wave of infections.Other than the four states mentioned above, the case rate is rising at worrying levels in Andhra Pradesh (276% higher in the past 30 days), Delhi (225%) and Gujarat (224%).At the other end of spectrum lie Kerala, Bihar and Odisha—their the seven-day average of cases dropped 63%, 25% and 9% respectively. These were the only three states where the case trajectory receded in the past month.Rising case rate, by districtThe 707 districts (with 11 districts of Delhi merged as one) for which this data is compiled by How India Lives can be broadly divided into three categories on the basis of how their seven-day average of daily new cases has changed in the past month. This average was zero for about a quarter of districts (162) on both February 16 and March 17. For a similar number of districts (182 in all), the average of daily new cases either remained the same or saw a decline. However, a majority of districts (363) saw an increase. Seventy-seven of these 363 districts registered an increase from zero average daily cases a month ago.Consolidated, time-series data on testing at the district-level was not available.The share of districts that saw the most increase from non-zero cases (above 385%) among total districts of the state is the highest in Punjab, Maharashtra , Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. In these states, 82%, 58%, 36%, 31%, and 16% of the districts respectively were of the category that can be classified among those that saw the most increase nationally in the daily average of new cases.The states with the highest share of districts that had zero average new cases a month ago and had the same average on March 17 are Goa and all the north-eastern states. Among large states, it is the eastern states of Jharkhand and Odisha that have a higher share of districts in this category than the rest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-states-face-risk-of-being-next-hot-spots-101616092276289.html
20-03-2021||Today's||The evolution of Delhi’s governance structure||By introducing an amendment bill to the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, the Centre has clearly indicated that it wants to assert its authority over the Delhi government in its day-to-day functioning. Once the bill is passed and becomes law, the Delhi government will have to seek the concurrence of the Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) for all its executive actions. This will also redefine the powers of Delhi’s legislative assembly.Expectedly, Delhi’s chief minister (CM), Arvind Kejriwal, and the Congress have strongly criticised this move, with former finance (and home) minister, P Chidambaram, saying that the city government will be reduced to the level of a municipality. There is no doubt that the autonomy the Kejriwal government enjoyed since the Supreme Court (SC) judgment of July 4, 2018, will be curbed if the bill is passed. The SC, then, effectively reduced the powers of L-G to that of state governors, who act on the advice of the elected government — except on three reserved subjects of police, public order and land, where L-G has discretion. It was because of this limited discretion that SC was careful to say L-G was not the governor, but “an Administrator in a limited sense”. The court further ruled that L-G should not routinely sit in judgment on decisions taken by the elected government.Those arguing for greater political accountability in the running of the city will be upset by the bill as, in this case, the elected component is being shortchanged. There is, no doubt, politics behind the decision, but that alone does not explain the move. It is useful to see how the system functioned since elected governments came into play with the 1993 assembly elections. Till Kejriwal decided not to seek L-G’s approval, all governments sought L-G’s approval on specific policies and important decisions. This was because, while Article 239AA of the Constitution said that L-G shall act on “aid and advice” of the elected government, it also allowed for L-G to refer to the president any matter where there was a difference of opinion with a minister. Under the rules of business of the Government of India, the minister concerned exercises the power of the president; in this case, it is the home minister. Pending a decision, if the matter was urgent, L-G could go ahead and take action. This provision was taken to mean that L-G must be aware of the actions of the elected government before their execution, and, therefore, L-G’s prior approval was taken. Kejriwal successfully challenged this logic in SC after being rebuffed by the Delhi High Court.Chidambaram’s criticism has validity but as home minister, with a Congress CM in Delhi, he did rule on matters when L-G and CM had differences, most famously in case of the flyover on Outer Ring Road at Vasant Vihar. My own limited experience of working in the Delhi government has been that L-G routinely went along with the government’s decisions, unless these were egregious, or there were strong personal reasons.Going beyond the immediate, there are two key issues.One, large countries, especially those with a federal/quasi-federal polity, have great difficulty in allowing their capital cities to function as regular provinces. Washington DC’s residents got the right to vote in presidential elections only in 1961. Their only representative in the House of Representatives is a delegate-at-large who has no voting rights. They have no representation in the Senate. And remember, this is a country which was founded on the concept of “No Taxation without Representation”. The city has an elected mayor and a 13-member elected council, but while they can propose the city’s budget, the Congress approves it.There is occasionally a desultory demand to convert DC into a state but this has never been seriously considered. Canberra is another federally-run capital, with an elected legislative assembly and a CM, such as Delhi. However, they essentially deal with health, education and the environment. The assembly is competent to make laws, but these can be superseded by the national parliament. According to the official website, the mayor of London “has a duty to set out plans and policies for London covering transport, planning and development, housing, economic development and regeneration, culture health inequalities and a range of environmental issues including climate change and air quality”. However, the mayor does prepare the budget for these activities as well as for the police and fire brigade. The 25-member elected Greater London Assembly can only overturn the mayor’s budget by a two-third majority. It also scrutinises the mayor’s proposal and has a monthly question hour at which the mayor, transport and police commissioner explain their actions.Right from the time Delhi was created as a Chief Commissioner’s Province by the British, the Centre has controlled the police, land and law and order. In independent India, Delhi went from a part C State to a Union Territory, with a Metropolitan Council (1967) and later an assembly (1993), but it has been the chief commissioner (later L-G) who has been its administrator under the Constitution, with only the 2018 SC decision that allowed the elected government to function autonomously on all but three subjects. The present amendment restores the older position. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government tried twice, but failed to give Delhi statehood, or even additional powers, though it was a key party promise. Non-Bharatiya Janata Party ministers vehemently opposed the idea as they said it would be incongruous for a national government to function in a territory where it did not have control.The second question is how to better manage our cities. Most state capitals and major cities have state government-run development authorities that have taken over considerable municipal functions. Sometimes, there are separate bodies for water supply and sewage directly under the state government. Unlike London, no Indian municipality has any authority over the police. Most importantly, it is the state government-appointed municipal commissioners who are the chief executives of municipal bodies, with the mayors basically performing the role of speaker of the elected bodies. Delhi’s position is more complicated, with four municipal corporations functioning under the home ministry, with some role for the housing and urban affairs ministry and the Delhi government. The Cantonment Board functions under the defence ministry. Both the Delhi government and the municipal bodies have similar responsibilities — running schools, hospitals, giving old age pensions and so on. The central government-controlled Delhi Development Authority manages all land matters, including land use. This confusing organisational structure does lead to lack of a unified, coherent planning and execution process, quite visible to the plain eye. Cities, as engines of economic growth, need clearer lines of command and accountability.To close with Chidambaram, he chose to go with the CM Sheila Dikshit, overruling L-G Tejinder Khanna on the elevated road issue. The road, once completed, caused more havoc than before, as L-G predicted. Much later, a parallel elevated road had to be constructed at considerably extra cost. Every car needs a brake, but it must be applied wisely.Shakti Sinha is a retired Indian Administrative Service Officer who served in the Delhi government, and is the author of Vajpayee: The Years that Changed IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-evolution-of-delhi-s-governance-structure-101616244278281.html
20-03-2021||Today's||Lifting the morale of citizens is key to economic recovery||By the time the pandemic fades into memory, millions of Indians would have been infected and hundreds of thousands killed. But not a single citizen will remain unaffected. Each of us would have, with some degree of separation, lost a loved one, endured financial and social losses, and for a majority, suffered a decline in quality of life. Graduating students will encounter subdued hiring. Financing ventures will become harder. Social instability indicators such as domestic violence, road rage and crime have started shooting up. This pent-up stress, anxiety and fear will channelise themselves into low tolerance and increased anger, especially against the haves. While India has handled the battle against Covid-19 well, we face a much bigger challenge in terms of bringing back positivity into the ravaged social psyche. Morale, positive outlook and a sense of hope fuel economics, which reflects in the Gross Domestic Product. It is impossible for any organisation or nation to achieve its full potential when the mood is despondent. Entrepreneurship and innovation are a state of mind and, without the foundation of high morale, it is impossible to leverage concrete resource outlays. India needs to address the morale and mental state of our citizens on a war-footing for a faster recovery. This is easy to understand at an individual level. A sad person cannot, just biologically, engage in any productive activity. We are driven by chemicals in the brain that propel us to achieve our goals. The capitalist who seeks to enlarge her empire, the soldier who dies for the glory of the battalion, the athlete who strives against excruciating pain for national pride or the employee who achieves the “ownership mindset” — all need the right chemicals firing in their brain. A downcast person, far from being productive, even stops caring about his physical well-being. The behaviour of a sad and a depressed person is similar because the same chemicals cause these emotional states. Extrapolating the individual to a family, a company and the nation explains why the state of mind of the nation and its economic recovery are existentially interlinked. This is a daunting challenge, primarily because mental health has remained largely ignored, though it is the largest national medical burden. The understanding of the subject is so rudimentary that most corporates believe band aids such as yoga, a few counselling sessions or company-sponsored offsites are enough to solve the problem. That’s about as useful as giving an aspirin to an acute heart patient. This situation, however, presents a unique opportunity for corporate India. Indian corporates have always contributed towards health care in the form of the mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative. Apart from hundreds of hospitals run by corporates, many of them have occupied a mindspace in the niches of health. But the mental health space lies open and unoccupied.There are three categories of stakeholders when it comes to mental health. First, the government — for which it is imperative that the citizen’s morale is uplifted. Second, corporates — whose success depends on the engagement levels of their employees. And finally, the pharma companies, because it is only an optimistic and concerned individual who will care about her own and her family’s health. All pharma companies (not just those who manufacture psychiatric drugs) are, therefore, invested in building a positive mental state among their potential customers. More Indians, especially the young, will be affected by mental health than any other disease. This is an opportunity for all three stakeholders — for the government to amend CSR rules to channel more resources to mental health; for conglomerates to invest and occupy this mindspace; and for the Indian pharma industry to take a global lead in the domain of preventive interventions. Most armies of the world follow a version of the British Defence Doctrine that lays down Ten Principles of War, the first of which is “Selection and Maintenance of Aim”. If the national aim is to achieve quick economic recovery, then we need to remember that the second of the Ten Principles is “Maintenance of Morale”, without which no war, including the one against Covid-19, can be won.

20-03-2021||Today's||Engaging the world on Indian democracy||I’m prepared to bet the emotions that are almost impossible to hide are hurt and pain. They show on your face, reflect in your tone and colour the language of your response. That’s equally true of the most humble citizen as it is of the grandest panjandrum of State. For us Indians, however, there’s a further twist. We crave praise from the West. Their compliments thrill us whilst their criticism deeply wounds.So, Nobel Prizes and Booker Awards mean more than any Sahitya Akademi honour. Oxbridge, Harvard and Yale carry greater weight than St Stephen’s, Presidency and St Xavier’s. And look how proud we are of Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella and Indra Nooyi. In comparison, we hardly mention Narayana Murthy or Azim Premji.Let me be honest and admit it’s the “phoren” stamp that makes things special. This is why appreciation of our democracy from Freedom House, V-Dem and the Economist Intelligence Unit is intoxicating. When they admonish, we bristle.This, I would say, is the best explanation for the external affairs minister, S Jaishankar’s unseemly, if uncharacteristic, outburst. Terming their criticism “hypocrisy”, he called these highly respected institutions “self-appointed custodians of the world” who “invent their rules (and) their parameters” and claimed they “pass their judgments and then make it look as if it is some kind of global exercise”. But that’s not all. He pointedly added they “find it very difficult to stomach that somebody in India is not looking for their approval”.Now, the hurt is self-evident and I shall deftly circumvent the name-calling, but who is the “somebody in India not looking for their approval”? Perhaps, there could be such a person meditating on a Himalayan mountain top or far away deep in an Andaman forest, but I doubt if there’s any individual of that description in the government.Indeed, how could there be when every improvement in India’s ease of doing business ranking is trumpeted by South Block? When groups of ministers meet for months and produce 97-page documents on how to influence the western press and public opinion? Or when the information and broadcasting ministry creates an Index Monitoring Cell to improve India’s ranking in the World Press Freedom Index? And, remember, Mr Jaishankar was part of the group that sought to “neutralise” what it calls “false narratives” and “negative coverage” of the government on international news platforms. Is this “not looking for approval” or desperate for it?In May 2015, The Economist did a special report and cover story to mark the Prime Minister (PM)’s first year in office. The front page headline was “India’s one-man band”. Adam Roberts, its correspondent, was given an unprecedented 90-minute interview. He described Mr Modi as “thoughtful, sincere and well-briefed” and predicted the PM could become “a truly transformative force”. The government was thrilled to bits. Ministers tripped over themselves drawing attention to the magazine. At the time, the foreign minister was foreign secretary. I wonder if his stomach found this praise indigestible?Let me make a further point. Criticism of India’s degraded democracy is neither unproven nor unwarranted. But if Mr Jaishankar wants to test for himself, here’s a simple suggestion. To assess how his government treats Muslims, he could lean across the Cabinet table and have a word with his colleague, Giriraj Singh. If the minister wants evidence of how intolerant Indian governments are of dissent, a quiet word with a junior judge in Delhi would suffice. Dharmender Rana could easily explain why cases of sedition have increased 165% between 2016 and 2019. Incidentally, that figure comes from the government’s National Crime Records Bureau. It’s atmanirbhar.Just as Amnesty, The Washington Post and The Economist kept alive the flickering flame of Indian democracy during the dark days of the Emergency with their concern for our country, I hope V-Dem and Freedom House continue to remind our government of the commitments made in our Constitution, which it’s trying to wriggle out of.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/engaging-the-world-on-indian-democracy-101616243136931.html
20-03-2021||Today's||End the silence on the abuse of the male child||While problems faced by the girl child have been discussed, the abuse of the male child has been overlooked and unrecognised. National Crime Records Bureau statistics for 2018 recorded 21,605 child rapes, of which 204 were of boys. This, child rights activist Divya Vaishnava says, suggests that the issue is grossly under-reported.Boys suffer high levels of violence, including sexual abuse, which, in turn, makes them more prone to violence as they grow into adults. In the film Anatomy of Violence, based on the perpetrators of the 2012 Delhi gang rape, Deepa Mehta sensitively portrays the brutalisation suffered by the rapists during their formative years, so much so that they seemed, according to recorded testimonies, immune to the sufferings of the victim. In fact, one of them blames her for making them act the way they did.Boys are easier targets for predators in many ways as they are not as supervised or protected as girls are. There is considerable shame and stigma attached to abuse of the boy child — he is expected to be strong in a patriarchal society. Such a society deters the boy child from being given help; it is something he is left to deal with by himself.Film maker Insia Dariwala, who conducted an online survey of 160 men a few years ago, found that 71% of the respondents had been abused as children; and among those who had been abused, 84.9% said they had not told anyone about it due to notions of shame, guilt, fear and confusion. It is not just adults who are responsible for this abuse; in unsupervised situations, as in those of street children or children in slums, the perpetrators are often older children, says Indu Prakash Singh, who has done extensive work on the abuse of slum children. The male child who has suffered sexual abuse may end up with psychological problems, trauma, depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, and a tendency towards violence. We rarely speak of these issues, even though they have a bearing on male violence against women in later life. Patriarchy forces a male abuse survivor to keep quiet even in adulthood, for fear of being labelled as weak. The issue of abuse of the male child should be brought into the discourse and parents, teachers and the community should be more involved in addressing this. Boys should be taught about what constitutes abuse. Many young boys, especially those without parental or other adult supervision, don’t even understand that they have been sexually abused.When the MeToo movement opened up stories about women who had been abused but had kept quiet, it caused a backlash against men in power. Now boys, who have been abused or are at risk of being abused, need to hear from survivors about their stories, so that they can seek appropriate help in time. The government needs to focus on the issue. It is silence that emboldens the perpetrator. Boys have to be told by trusted adult figures that admitting to abuse is not a sign of weakness or taken to mean that they were complicit. It is time to end the silence on the abuse of the male child.
