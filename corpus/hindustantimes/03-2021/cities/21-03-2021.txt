Police said the woman was killed when she resisted to a robbery attempt by the men. The same morning, fifteen minutes before the murder, the two men had robbed two other women at gun point, while they were out for a morning walk in Rohini. The arrested men, police say, are previously involved in multiple cases of robberies, snatching, illegal possession of arms and thefts. Police have identified the two arrested men as Sameer alias Sahjad, 30, and Faizan, 25, both residents of Geeta Colony. While Sameer is involved in two cases, one each of robbery and snatching, Faizan has at least 25 criminal cases against him including robbery, snatching, and illegal use of firearms, police said. Joint commissioner of police (central range) Narendra Singh Bundela confirmed the arrests. On Saturday night some residents of the area also allegedly attacked the police team that had gone to Geeta Colony to arrest the suspects.Police have also booked some locals for attacking the police and obstructing police in their duty.An investigating officer, who wished not to be named, said the two incidents took place at a difference of just fifteen minutes. “On March 17, at 6.30 am, in Rohini sector-7, two women were robbed of their valuables and ornaments by two men on a bike. The same men, after fifteen minutes, around 6.45 am, reached New Aruna Nagar in Majnu Ka Tila and tried to rob 45-year-old Meena Tamang, a Nepalese origin woman who ran a tea stall there with her husband. It has been established that when Tamang resisted and tried to raise alarm, one of the men shot her on the left side of her chest and fled the spot. Tamang died before she could reach a hospital,” he said. The officer said, two separate cases, of robbery and of murder, were registered in Rohini and in Timarpur police station on that day. On Sunday, the CCTV footage of the robbery that took place in Rohini, on a busy main road, was also widely shared on social media. The video shows the two men stopping by two women walking on a main road. Both the men can be seeing getting off the bike and chasing the women to rob them of their valuables. The video also shows vehicles passing by but no one is seeing intervening to save the woman. “While probing the murder case of New Aruna Nagar, as our teams checked CCTV footages from the stretch, we were able to establish that the accused were using a black Yamaha bike. More than 100 CCTV footage for more than a 25 kilometer long stretch were then checked and it was found that the two suspects had fled after the murder through Kashmere Gate, Outer Ring Road, Sarai Kale Khan Road and went towards Akshardham. It was also found that the suspects involved in the Rohini robbery were also using a similar bike. Based on local enquiry and technical evidences, multiple police teams from Rohini, south district and north district managed to zero down on the suspects in West Laxmi Market, Geeta Colony and a raid was conducted in the area late on Saturday night and the two men were arrested,” the officer said. The officer said, during interrogation, both Faizan and Sameer confessed to have shot Tamang in New Aruna Nagar for resisting to robbery. They also accepted their involvement in robbing the two women in Rohini. The bike used in the crime has been recovered from them and their involvement in other cases is also being verified, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-arrested-for-killing-woman-in-geeta-colony-for-resisting-robbery-attempt-101616350125515.html

The suspect was travelling with his accomplices. Police have recovered the car, and seized it under the Motor Vehicle Act... We are trying to find more information about their operation. The liquor recovered from the vehicle was seized under the Excise Act, while the main suspect will be booked under relevant sections,” said the official.The police did not reveal any information about the main suspect, or the amount of liquor recovered from his car, claiming that “he is a part of a much larger and organised group involved in smuggling illicit substances”. All information will be shared once the gang is busted, and arrests are being made, the official added.The carjacking information came just days after an engineer in Greater Noida was robbed of his SUV at gunpoint by two men, while his wife and daughter were inside the vehicle. They were pushed out of the car 200 metre away from the crime stop, in Sector Omicron.The Noida police is cracking down on the consumption of alcohol in public and booking people for violating the rules. This is in the view of imposition of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) Section 144 in the district amid panchayat elections, coronavirus crisis, and upcoming festivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-detained-for-reporting-fake-car-theft-101616348925411.html

21-03-2021||Noida||GB Nagar forest dept to treat polluted stream in Surajpur wetlands||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department has said that it will treat the polluted stream that charges lake at Surajpur wetland through an alternative method, known as phytoremediation. It has also decided to ask the department concerned to ensure that “the stream is not polluted through illegal discharge of untreated effluents into it”.The storm water stream — Havelia drain — originates in Hapur districts and meets the Hindon River, while its tributary stream enters and recharges the lake in Surajpur reserve forest in Greater Noida, according to the officials. The small stream is now heavily polluted with excessive industrial and domestic effluents that are discharged into it, due to which the drain needs to be treated before it causes further impact on the lake, they added.The forest department will use phytoremediation to treat the polluted stream naturally. Phytoremediation is a natural method of treating the effluents by passing a drain through a pond or tank with certain aquatic plants in it, that filters the drain and increases the biochemical oxygen levels in the water. The aquatic plants used includes cattail, phragmites or common reed, sedges, and ipomoea carnea or besharam plant, experts said.“We will write to the department concerned to get the drain cleaned, but we would not rely on them completely. As an experiment, we will also use phytoremediation. The department is capable of setting up alternative ways of cleaning streams, and it will construct a small pond at the inlet of the stream and pass the drain though it to treat the effluents. The work will begin by next month,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Currently, the 60-hectare lake in Surajpur wetlands — city’s largest reserve forest — is excessively polluted and the water has turned black, it stinks, and is covered with foam, indicating the presence of industrial effluents in it. The divisional forest department is yet to test the toxicity levels of the lake and send the water samples to a lab to find out its quality or the number of effluents in it.The Surajpur wetlands is one of the three major birding hotspots in the district, with others being Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Dhanauri wetlands.CR Babu, professor emeritus, Delhi University, said, “Any alternate technology is better, as the conventional technologies like STP, RO among others are very expensive to build or to maintain. For one MLD of sewage treatment the cost is ₹5 crore, and the maintenance is in lakhs. While phytoremediation, floating island, constructed wetlands etc., are most widely used throughout the world, they work on the same principle of STP. It has a stabilising or oxidation tank or pond, a filtration chamber, and plants. The aquatic plants pump more oxygen to clean the water. The maximum cost for such alternative methods is around ₹10 lakh at the time of the construction and needs just one gardener to maintain it. They can be used for primary, secondary or tertiary treatment of industrial effluents too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-forest-dept-to-treat-polluted-stream-in-surajpur-wetlands-101616348865398.html

GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the health department is taking up more than 5,000 vaccination per day. “We have plans to improve and can also surpass our target. We held a meeting with different RWAs, apartment owners’ associations and NGOs, among others, and it was agreed that they will help us in taking up more registrations for vaccination,” the DM said. The online meeting was held on Sunday which also saw participation of senior police and district administration officials. “Apart from improving our vaccination coverage, the meeting also focussed on various measures to control spread of infection through self-regulation so that we can avoid enforcement. So, everyone agreed that they will take all precautions and more so in wake of Holi festival and also during the upcoming panchayat elections,” Suhas said. According to the portal figures, GB Nagar administered 105,644 doses while Ghaziabad consumed 107,881, including first and second doses, till Sunday afternoon. The figures included vaccine doses given to health-care and front-line workers, and senior citizens/ 45-plus having comorbid conditions. In Ghaziabad, officials said that the vaccination process at the rural centres needs to be beefed up as the coverage is just about 8-10%. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Saturday visited different vaccination centres in rural areas and directed that the primary health centres which are vaccinating 100-150 beneficiaries a day will now vaccinate 300 people per day starting Monday. “We have termed the measure ‘village vaccination drive’, and the target of 300 per day will be taken up for the next 15 days. Under this, apart from the health department teams, teams of the revenue department will also participate and ensure that people come out in large numbers to the vaccination centres. The teams will be supervised by additional district magistrates,” Pandey said. Under the plan, the workers as well as the best performing centres will also be rewarded. According to the official estimates, GB Nagar has about 260,792 beneficiaries while Ghaziabad has 373,920 persons under the category of senior citizens and people over 45 having comorbid conditions.

21-03-2021||Bhopal||‘Turned pandemic into opportunity’: Shivraj Singh Chouhan on past year’s experiences as CM||On completing one year of his third term, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh spoke to Hindustan Times about the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic revival and the revenue shortfall the state is facing. He also expressed confidence in BJP winning the West Bengal and Assam polls. Here are the excerpts from the interview.Q. In a few days, you would complete a year in office in your third term. You took charge when Covid-19 was spreading fast. How do you rate your first year?A. When I took charge, there was no minister with me and Covid was starting to spread fast. There was no one with me for one month. I ran the government alone. We made arrangements for Covid management, creating testing facility in the states, getting masks, PPE kits and making arrangement in hospitals. Another big challenge was that in March, the wheat harvest starts in MP. We have to prepare for procuring wheat and we bought 1.39 crore metric tonnes of wheat, which is even more than Punjab. During Covid, we provided work to all workers and ensured those crossing MP from other states get food and buses. On PM’s call, we turned the Covid-19 pandemic into an opportunity. Started ‘Amtanirbhar MP’ and began working on infrastructure, education, health, good governance and employment. We have done well on all schemes from road construction to providing drinking water to giving loans to street vendors in the last year.Q. You have been the CM for almost 15 years. What do you say about other tenures?A. In my first term, we worked for better roads and brought laws to ensure Public Service Delivery law, the first state to do so in India. In the second term, we promised 24-hour power when people were getting five to six hours of power, expanded the irrigation network from 7.5 lakh hectare to 45 lakh hectare and started river linking projects. In my third term, MP crossed all landmarks. We got nine awards for being the best agriculture state both by Manmohan Singh ji and Modi ji’s governments. We now have surplus agriculture produce. Still, a lot more has to be done on bringing investment.Q. In this year’s budget, the state proposed to borrow ₹2,00,000 crore. Do you plan to overcome this huge borrowing of 80 per cent of the plan size?A. This budget is to make MP Atmabirbhar. We had proposed CM rise schools for quality education that will have top-quality teachers, labs and playgrounds. In the health sector, we have proposed 13 new medical colleges and plan to improve community health sectors. For infrastructure, Narmada Expressway and Atal Expressway in Chambal would be developed to give an industrial fillip to the state. It is true, we will have to spend ₹2 lakh crore but this is within the Central government parameters. This money will help give further stimulus to the state’s economy and there is nothing unusual in this.Q. Despite your claims, MP has a very low per capita income and it is among the lowest-ranked states on health parameters.A. When I took charge, MP was a ‘Bimaru’ state and had ₹13,000 per capita income. Now it is 99,000 and this year we will cross ₹1,00,000. Our GDP will cross ₹10,000 lakh crore. We were a landlocked state and no industry came. Now, we have changed that. On the human index, we are on the lower side, we are not near the national average. In Atmabirbhar MP, we will work to reduce maternal mortality and neonatal mortality rates and bring it at par with the national average. Q. One impact of three farms laws seen in MP has been a fall in revenue of agriculture markets. How do you see the three farm laws?A. We reduced mandi tax by one-fourth, a reason for the fall in revenue. In MP, farmers have the freedom to sell outside or inside the mandis. The three farm laws benefit farmers in MP as they provide the freedom to sell. Contract farming has been there for many years and the government has just brought a law to regulate it. There is nothing wrong with this.Q. Protesting farmers are demanding a law to protect minimum support price (MSP). What is your view on MSP?A. There should be provisions to give farmers the right price for their produce. I think we need to think about alternate ways to ensure the right price. We can provide the right price through schemes such as Bhavanter, in which the government pays the difference between the MSP and the market price to farmers. If the market is buying at less than MSP, the government can pay. Bhavanter was a popular scheme but was discredited by vested interests and was scrapped by the last Congress government.Q. There have been accusations that minority groups are being targeted through the MP Religion of Freedom Law?A. There is no question of targeting. It is the same for all. If someone tries to lure someone through coercion, threat or any other wrong means, action would be taken. It is The law is not against any religion. People doing good work for communities can continue to work without any fear.Q. The Supreme Court has sought states’ views on removing the 50 per cent cap on reservation. What is your view?A. Many states have more than 50 per cent reservation, especially in the south. Some sections have been left behind and they are backward and poor and should get the benefit of reservation. The entire country should think about it and I think, there should be one policy across the country. We will study the SC order and will give you comments.Q. The second wave of Covid-19 has started and cases in MP are also rising at an alarming pace. What steps are being taken to control the spread?A. In mid-February, we had 141 new cases and we thought things were getting normal. Economy and social activities had increased and gatherings also resumed. But, in the past 15 days, cases have increased and the pace of spread has intensified. People are not so scared of Covid and are not wearing masks and are going to social programmes. We need to tell people about the seriousness of Covid again. That is why we have imposed a one-day lockdown in Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur as it would break the chain of infection. With night curfew, it would be a 36-hour lockdown. Strict mask-wearing enforcement would be resumed and action would be taken for social gatherings in violation of government norms. We would also increase vaccination to 2 lakh persons per day.Q. How do you rate BJP’s chances in West Bengal and Assam polls?A. I went to both the states and I am confident that the BJP wave is there in the two states. In West Bengal, there is a wave of change. The TMC has become a symbol of terror, murder and corruption and people are fed up. People are mad for Modi ji. Congress has damaged itself by having an alliance with Badruddin Ajmal while the BJP has brought an all-round development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/turned-pandemic-into-opportunity-shivraj-singh-chouhan-on-past-year-s-experiences-as-cm-101616348266219.html

The GMDA said that disputes have been cleared and barring a small patch, which was non-critical, it was ready to hand over the land. The transfer of Kherki Daula toll plaza was announced by union transport minister Nitin Gadkari in 2016 — following repeated demands from the Haryana government and local politicians — but on the condition that land would be made available free of cost by the state to the NHAI. Initially, the plan was to shift the toll plaza to Sehrawan near Manesar, but the plan was shelved after opposition from residents and environmentalists. Later, the state government identified over 30 acres at Panchgaon but this move was opposed by landowners, who approached the court for relief and the land transfer was delayed by almost three years. The letter written to NHAI by Sudhir Rajpal, the chief executive officer of GMDA, states,” This is with reference to NHAI letter number 1733 dated fourth December 2019, providing for 28 lanes toll plaza in land measuring 30.92 Acres at Panchgaon in district Gurugram. The forest clearance for the said land has been obtained from the principal conservator of forest Haryana Panchkula on 31/01/2020. GMDA had already offered 30.92 acres land to NHAI vide letter dated 16/12/2019 for the construction of toll plaza with 28 lanes for which design has been prepared by the consultant of NHAI.”“However, due to certain court restrictions, the site could not be physically handed over till now. Now, all the encumbrances on the site have been removed except for a non-critical patch of 0.40 acres. The land measuring 30.52 acres is now being offered to the NHAI for the establishment of a toll plaza at Panchgaon. You are requested to issue necessary directions to the local NHAI unit to take over possession of land for establishment of toll plaza at Panchgaon by shifting it from Kherki Daula,” it stated.The Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the highway concessionaire that took over the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway in 2014 has a concession agreement to collect toll till 2023.A senior NHAI official, on the condition of anonymity, said that the local project unit of the NHAI has not received any communication in this regard. “The GMDA must have written to the NHAI headquarters in this matter and the directions in this regard will come from there. We have not received any communication till now,” he said, adding that proposal for takeover of land will be analysed and necessary steps taken once the letter with necessary directions reaches the project implementation unit of Gurugram. He said that it would take around six months to build a new toll plaza at Panchgaon, depending on the transfer of land and directions from the headquarters. On March 5, union transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced that the Kherki Daula toll plaza would be shifted by August 15, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-offers-30-acres-in-panchgaon-for-shifting-kherki-daula-toll-plaza-101616347726081.html

21-03-2021||Gurugram||Plastic deposit machines remain non-functional since 2019 even as Gurugram works towards eliminating plastic||Two plastic and polythene deposit machines, set up to offer mobile recharge coupons and jute bags in exchange for plastic bottles and polythene bags, remain non-functional since a week of their launch in 2019, even as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s (MCG) pushes to make Gurugram a polythene-free city.A senior MCG official familiar with the matter said that they found plastic bottles filled with water and polythene bags containing items. “Outside the machine, we had written that only empty bottles and polythene bags needed to be inserted. It seems the public did not understand this concept, and hence, we have not revived the machines ever since,” said the official.The machines were launched in October 2019 at platform numbers 1 and 3 of the railway station in collaboration with an Indian multinational company. This was the first major step taken by the MCG, since its formation in 2008, towards reducing plastic use in the city.However, within a week since their launch, the machines malfunctioned and have not been revived since. “The machines were operational for less than a week. Miscreants had tried to insert stones and other types of objects, hoping to get coupons or jute bags free of cost. We also found lots of mud and heavy debris inside the machine when we opened them for inspection after receiving a complaint that they had stopped working,” the senior official cited above said.In the last six months, the MCG has carried out a major push to make the city plastic and polythene-free.The MCG has been working towards making four markets, Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1, Sector 46 market, Sector 4 market and Sector 23 market free of single-use plastic and polythene since last December.On February 27, the MCG banned the use of various types of plastic and polythene under the Haryana Non-Biodegradable garbage (Control) Act, 1988, setting up penalties up to ₹25,000.To supplement alternatives, the MCG launched opened a cloth bag bank in the Nai Basti area of Sector 8 last December and a steel utensil bank in Sector 10 earlier this month.“I am not aware of the plastic and polythene (reverse) vending machines at the railway station as these were opened before I was deputed in the city. However, the MCG is working on a similar project where such vending machines will be placed at various public places across the city, as part of our ongoing efforts to eradicate plastic and polythene,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), MCG.Kumar said that the matter is still under consideration and the MCG is currently engaged in its research and development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/plastic-deposit-machines-remain-non-functional-since-2019-even-as-gurugram-works-towards-eliminating-plastic-101616347666760.html
21-03-2021||Gurugram||Zero Waste Day on Mondays||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to observe Zero Waste Day every Monday, a release issued by the civic body on Sunday stated.MCG officials familiar with the matter said that the idea behind the move is to inculcate the habit of waste segregation among residents.On a Zero Waste Day, the MCG only lifts wet garbage from households while dry or mixed waste is lifted the following day.“Zero Waste Day is proving to be an important step to make citizens understand the importance of waste management. All citizens are being made aware of the segregation of waste into four primary categories, wet waste in a green dustbin, dry waste in a blue dustbin, sanitary and medical waste in a yellow dustbin and electronic waste in a grey dustbin. Only wet waste is picked on a zero-waste day, and we have decided to make it a permanent weekly feature,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), MCG.MCG held its first Zero Waste Day on December 25 last year. Initially, it was scheduled to be held on a monthly basis, but due to a positive response, the MCG decided to make it a fortnightly feature. Ahead of its 10th Zero Waste Day, the MCG decided to make it a weekly feature.“When one tonne of waste reaches a landfill, it produces 2.93 tonnes of greenhouse gases for a lifetime. Zero waste is a concept in which waste is responsibly managed in such a way that zero or minimal amount of waste reaches the landfill. This can be done when citizens analyse their waste, focus on reducing, reusing or recycling dry waste and segregate wet waste for converting them into compost,” said Kumar.The MCG, so far, has collected around 1,400 tonnes of wet waste in the nine zero-waste days conducted. All wet waste collected from residents is sent to the MCG’s fertilizer plant in Darbaripur.Kumar said that the plant has a capacity of processing 10 tonnes of wet waste per day and the MCG is in the process of installing more composting plants. He added that the MCG is also considering observing zero-waste days on a bi-weekly basis for increased waste segregation among citizens and eventually, stop sending garbage to the Bandhwari landfill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/zero-waste-day-on-mondays-101616347665493.html

21-03-2021||Pune||Three arrested in 2018 murder case acquitted based on DNA test||Three men who were in judicial custody for around three years for the murder of a man who went missing and was suspected to have been found after two days in August 2018 were acquitted by a court in Baramati. The main reason for the acquittal was that the body found in the case did not have a head and did not match the DNA of the parents of the man who was initially reported as missing. The order was issued by RR Rathi, additional sessions judge, Baramati while SB Ohol was the public prosecutor and advocate Milind Pawar was the defence lawyer. The missing man, suspected to have been found, was identified as Bhimashankar Anture, a resident of Loni Kalbhor who was reported missing by his family on August 19, 2018, a day after he left allegedly in search of a job. The three acquitted were identified as Keshav Sopan Kalbhor (38), Haridas Namdeo Shendge (34), Prashant Walchand Jagtap (26), according to the court order. The three were arrested in 2018 after a body without its head was found in the jurisdiction of Daund police station on August 23 of that year. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 201(destruction of evidence), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Daund police station against them. “During investigation, the police prepared a spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, obtained PM report, recorded the statements of the witnesses, sent the muddemal for chemical analysis, conducted the DNA analysis of the dead body with his alleged parents, obtained the CDR report of the accused and the deceased and on completion of investigation they found sufficient material against the accused, and so filed a charge ­sheet against the accused under the aforesaid sections,” reads a part of the order. The family members had identified the decapitated body based on the grown nail on one hand of the body and the undergarments worn by the man when last seen. Along with the parents’ identification, the police had submitted call records of deceased and the accused, 10 witness statements, panchanama of the vehicle, a motorbike, and the weapon, an axe, allegedly used in the crime. While the body was allegedly thrown in the Bhima river, the head was thrown in a canal in Boriandi, according to the police. The defence had asked for a DNA test to prove the identity. “The DNA of that dead body was examined with the DNA of Sumitra Kalappa Atnure and Kalappa Atnure, but on record, the DNA report exh.138 shows that Sumitra Kalappa Atnure and Kalappa Atnure are not the biological parents of that dead body,” reads a part of the order. The judge, therefore, ruled that the prosecution had “utterly failed” to prove the police case. The judge, therefore, acquitted them and has asked each of the three to pay ₹15,000 as surety and ₹15,000 as a personal bond in order to be released from prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-arrested-in-2018-murder-case-acquitted-based-on-dna-test-101616347548842.html
21-03-2021||Pune||PMC diverts ₹300 crore reserved for big projects towards ward-wise development works||In an attempt to draw political mileage in the upcoming civic body polls early next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has offered an opportunity to corporators ahead of elections to spend around ₹300 crore in ward-level development works. In two days, the general body meeting diverted big projects allocation of funds to around 800 small ward-wise development works. During the general body meeting on Thursday, which was the last for the financial year-2020-21, BJP ruled PMC passed fund diversion proposal of more than ₹300 crore to different ward level works. It includes cement concretization of lanes, asphalting of roads, material for open gymnasiums, development of ward level roads, drainage chamber repairing work, and public toilet repair works. Last year, the standing committee sanctioned a ₹7,390 crore budget for 2020-21 which was higher than the draft budget of ₹6,229 crore of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic this year, development works were hampered as the administration was fully concentrating on health service. The PMC, therefore, cut down the budget by 40 per cent on various development works except for health, water, drainage, and road development. Murlidhar Mohol, Pune mayor said, “Due to the Covid pandemic, most of the projects could not be completed and major work was hampered. As a result, the corporators did not get money to spend on their ward related development works. At the end of the financial year, it is not possible to spend all allocation of big projects. So, we took a decision to give (divert) the big project allocation to all corporators for ward-level development work.” According to a senior official, even if the general body meeting has passed a proposal of diversion of funds, it is not possible to float tenders and give work order of all these development works by March 31, 2021. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of House in PMC said, “We have taken a decision for the development of the city and to provide the necessary infrastructure to citizens. It was an important decision for the welfare of the city and its citizens. So, we took the decision and passed 196 proposals in two days.” Big project funds diversion In the last general body meeting, all party leaders passed diversion funds of major projects such as the High-Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR), Katraj-Kondwa road widening, Kothrud Kala Akadami, purchase of electronic buses on PPP model, Shivshursti, Kothrud Kala Akadami, renovation of Balgandharv Rangmandhir. Besides that, the general body meeting took a decision to divert the funds of more than five crores which was allocated to lay down the proper drainage system in Ambil-Odha flash flood-affected areas. In 2019, Katraj, Kondhwa, Sahakarnagar, Dhanakwadi faced a flash flood in which around 25 people died. The PMC had evacuated 3,500 people and shifted to nearby schools. Therefore, the administration proposed drainage work in Ambil Odha affected areas in Upper Indiranagar, Gururaj society, Treasure Park, Araneshwar, Gajanan Maharaj Math Mitra Mandal, Ambedkar Vashat, Dandekar Pul – Sinhagad road as well as the construction of a retaining wall along both sides of Ambil Odha. Vivek Velankar, civic activist said, “The PMC has forgotten a note which is mentioned in the budget book that diversion of funds will not entrain. After the diversion of more than ₹300 crore in the last few days, it has killed the purpose of the budget. Actually, the PMC should have to stop drafting a budget. It is really unfortunate that political parties which introduce fancy projects in their budget divert funds to very small ward level work at the last moment. Katraj-Kondwa road widening and HCMTR project is one of the major projects of the city. But all political party corporators divert funds keeping an eye on the upcoming civic polls. It is nothing but misusing taxpayers’ money.” Major diversions Name of project Allocation (in crore) HCMTR Road ₹100 rHCMTR land acquisition ₹1.45 Road development of HCMTR RS 8.55 Katraj-Kondwa road widening ₹12 Electronic Bus (GCC Mode) ₹64 Shivshrusti ₹23 Kothrud Kala Akadami ₹18 Renovation of Balgandharv Rangmandir ₹9.70||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-diverts-rs-300-crore-reserved-for-big-projects-towards-ward-wise-development-works-101616347547733.html

Patwardhan in his complaint filed before the consumer court had stated that he had invested an amount of ₹3 lakh each as a fixed deposit in two schemes for a period of three years with the DSK Brothers. The total amount promised to be returned to him after the completion of the deposit term was ₹8.55 lakh. On the completion of the fixed deposit term, DSK had issued a cheque of interest earnings to Patwardhan but immediately took back the instrument, the complaint stated. Patwardhan demanded that he be given back his invested amount including the interest, but the company did not pay any heed to his request. The commission passed an ex-parte order in the case. The forum in its order stated that the DSK brothers demonstrated a deficiency in service and did not return the deposit along with interest as promised to the investor. The company has shown unethical practice as it used the interest money for its own profit and did not refund the money to the investor as promised. The order specifically directed DSK to refund the interest on each of the two schemes since May 30, 2014, within 45 days of the receipt of the forum order. If the interest amount is not returned to the investor, then an interest rate of 16 per cent will be levied on an amount of ₹6 lakh. The forum also directed the company to refund ₹15,000 as additional expenses to the complainant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/consumer-forum-orders-dsk-to-return-share-to-investor-101616347547061.html

Former Pune mayor Mukta Tilak had agreed to build mid-block pedestrian crossings on 100 km of divided arterial streets to improve the safety of pedestrians while crossing mid-blocks in the city of Pune. “Safer and well-designed mid-block crossings are required for a pedestrian to cross the street at mid-block safely and conveniently. It helps in increasing the safety on the street for both pedestrians and other road users by reducing the detour length and pedestrians’ fatalities. It also improves traffic discipline as well as visibility of the street,” said Aditya Chawande, architect, who is working with the PMC on the pilot project. The Pune pedestrian policy also has the provision of providing mid-block crossings as per IRC 103:2012 which recommends having mid-block crossings for pedestrians at an interval of 80 metres to 150 metres as per the context. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has selected 12 divided arterial streets of Pune city having a varied edge for the project. The first phase of selected streets combined length is approximately 45 km of the total 100 km project package. Parisar with the support of AXA has developed the proposed typical design templates for the pedestrian mid-block crossings for Lal Bahadur Shastri road and presented it to the PMC and the NMT committee in a meeting held in December 2020 which was approved for pilot implementation. The proposed design has a total of four mid-block crossings of which two of at-grade and two of raised crossings are proposed. PMC engineers Lalit Bode, and deputy engineer Hemant Jagtap visited LBS road on March 19th for a final check before implementation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-approves-mid-block-crossings-on-lal-bahadur-shastri-road-101616347545290.html

21-03-2021||Other||School of Ram takes shape in cyberspace||A Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student has conceptualised and set up what he says maybe the first virtual school dedicated to spreading the ideals, values, and virtues of Lord Ram among the “youths and coming generations” through videos, lectures, and stories on social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsAppKnown as the School of Ram, this online platform is open to all and anyone may join it for free.“The purpose of the School of Ram is crystal clear. It will work for vyakti nirman (character building), family building and society building by spreading ideals of Lord Ram,” says Prince Tiwari, a BA second-year student at BHU.“Probably, this will be the first such virtual school which will take the ideals of Lord Ram and the universal form of the Ramayana and Ramakatha through social media to the common people,” he adds.Explaining the objective behind the virtual school, he says, “At present, disintegration of the family is becoming a common problem. Many people don’t obey their parents, they don’t care for them well. Many people ignore the elders. Family values are declining. In the absence of ideals and values in the family, its disintegration begins.” “The virtual School of Ram will try to stop this disintegration by spreading the ideals and values of Lord Shri Ram among the people, especially the younger generation, which is quite active on social media platforms. We will upload videos, lectures, and stories of Lord Ram on social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and also on WhatsApp so that the young generation may know about ideals and values of Lord Ram and take inspiration,” Tiwari explains. “Lord Ram is known as a highly obedient son, a caring and loving brother and an ideal husband. He is revered for his virtues, sacrifice, and values. Let us take inspiration from the character of Lord Ram. By living a nature-oriented life like Ram, the challenge of environmental degradation before the world today can be tackled,” Tiwari says. As it is completely online, this “school” has no building. From time to time, the virtual school will organise webinars. Besides, it will post content on Lord Ram daily. Prof Rajneesh Shukla, vice chancellor of the Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidhyalay, Wardha, will formally inaugurate the School of Ram on March 24. Vidya Bharati national secretary Avanish Bhatnagar will preside over the inaugural ceremony in which several other dignitaries will remain present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/school-of-ram-takes-shape-in-cyberspace-101616346585297.html

The chief minister was speaking at a farmers’ conference organised under the Mission Kisan Kalyan on the Government Agriculture School campus in Gorakhpur.He apprised farmers of the work done by the Modi government at the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party government (BJP) in the state in the interest of the cultivators.He asked farmers to be wary of vested interests and selfish elements who, he said, always misled the farmers and used them for their ulterior motives.“The same people are behind the conspiracy to mislead the peasants who, while in power, did not do anything for the welfare of farmers,” he said.“Such elements used them to make a fortune of their own but allowed farmers to languish in penury and debt,” Yogi Adityanath alleged. He also said those who misled the farmers had always been habitual liars.“These people spread the lie that farm land will be grabbed by contract farming. PM Modi has already made it clear that contract farming is just another option, not an obligation. The farmers have all the freedom to sell their produce anywhere to earn more profit from the market,” he said.“Can anyone tell whether a farmer’s land was grabbed by contract farming? In contract farming, no one can occupy the land of the farmer. The farmer is the owner of his land,” he said.He also allayed fears that mandis would be closed.“Not a single mandi was closed since June 2020, when the farm laws were brought, but a deliberate misinformation campaign has been run to misguide the farmer,” he said.“In fact, mandis were added under the “e-NAM” concept of One Nation One Market, while action is being taken to add over 1,000 more mandis,” he said.When the Opposition parties were in power they either closed or sold sugar mills, he alleged. By contrast, the BJP government set up new sugar mills in Pipraich and Munderwa in east UP, he said. On the other hand, the governments of the SP (Samajwadi Party) and the BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) sold or closed sugar mills of Kushinagar, Deoria and Maharajganj, the chief minister said.“The sugarcane farmers had thousands of crores of rupees of arrears while the current government has made a record payment of ₹1.27 lakh crore to them,” he said.Yogi also said the Central and the state government were of the definite view that “if the farmers are happy, then the village will be prosperous, and the prosperity of the village-farmer will pave the way for the prosperity of the country.”For the first time, the country got such a government in 2014 that did unprecedented work for the welfare of farmers and included them in the agenda of the country’s politics, he said.“Soil health test cards, payment of one and a half times the MSP, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and farmers’ loan waiver scheme — these are some of the landmark welfare endeavours for the farmers under the guidance of PM Modi,” he added.The farmers were also provided a security cover of ₹5 lakh under the Chief Minister’s Farmer Accident Insurance, while the pending irrigation projects were completed to increase the productivity of farming, he said.Last year, 68 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured at MSP (minimum support price) in Uttar Pradesh and ₹66,000 crore was paid directly into the accounts of the farmers. As many as 2.42 crore farmers in the state received more than ₹27,000 crore under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-asks-farmers-to-be-wary-of-selfish-elements-101616346465311.html

Nobody (in state government) has contacted me. And in any case even if they contact me, I am unavailable," Ribeiro told PTI when asked about Pawar's suggestion."I am 92 years old. Nobody goes around doing this work at the age of 92. If the inquiry is against the home minister of Maharashtra, then Mr Pawar should make it because he is the head of the (ruling) party," Ribeiro said.Ribeiro is a former Mumbai police commissioner, who eventually became the chief of Gujarat and Punjab police and was later named India's ambassador to Romania."Why should a retired police officer be asked to do this," he said.Earlier in the day, Pawar told reporters in Delhi that he would suggest Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to seek Ribeiros help to investigate the claims made by Singh.In a letter to Thackeray, Param Bir Singh alleged that Anil Deshmukh instructed suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze to collect ₹100 crore every month for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ribeiro-says-unavailable-asks-pawar-to-probe-singh-s-claims-101616345917152.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||After NCP meet, Jayant Patil says ‘Param Bir Singh's letter attempt to divert attention’||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Maharashtra president Jayant Patil on Sunday said that Param Bir Singh’s letter accusing state home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption is an attempt to divert attention from the probe in Mukesh Ambani security threat case.“The letter by Param Bir Singh is an afterthought and an attempt to divert the attention...Right now our focus is to find out the culprits in the Ambani bomb scare and Hiran death case,” Patil told reporters in Delhi.His remarks came after an urgent meeting of top party leaders convened by NCP’s national chief Sharad Pawar. Patil also ruled out speculations about the party’s plan to replace Deshmukh, saying “there’s no question of taking resignation of home minister.”Patil asserted that the state government has decided to conduct a fair probe in the bomb scare case. “We will reach the guilty even if they are officers in high positions,” he told reporters after the NCP meeting.The meeting was called a day after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who was recently shunted out, wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that Deshmukh told Sachin Vaze, the cop arrested in connection the security threat case, to collect ₹100 crore a month from restaurants and bars in Mumbai.Several opposition leaders including Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s (MNS’) Raj Thackeray demanded the state home minister’s resignation over the charges levelled against him. Deshmukh, meanwhile has denied the extortion claims and accused Singh of trying to save himself as his involvement in the bomb scare case was becoming evident. On Saturday, the minister said that he is filing a defamation case against the former top cop.Earlier in the day, Pawar had said that allegations against Deshmukh are serious and that it is the prerogative of the chief minister to take appropriate action.Following the uproar over the issue, all three constituents, Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Congress, of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state are expected to hold a series of meetings on Monday. They are likely to take a call on Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-ncp-meet-jayant-patil-says-param-bir-singh-s-letter-attempt-to-divert-attention-101616344639373.html

21-03-2021||Other||PTR uses multi-pronged strategy to reduce man-tiger conflicts||Lucknow: The Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR), which was hitherto known for man-tiger conflict, has finally managed to turn around the situation with awareness campaigns, electric fencing and ban on picking mushrooms found inside the forest and considered a delicacy. As per official data, 11 people died in tiger attacks in the area in the past three years. This is a considerable drop from over 26 recorded encounters between man and tiger in 2017 that resulted in 16 fatalities. All those killed were locals living in over 524 villages located within a distance of one kilometre from the PTR. Close to 4 lakh people are estimated to be living in these villages which are in very close proximity to the reserve. During its inception in 2013, around 20,000 people living inside the core forest areas were moved out, with little resistance, but no large-scale efforts were made to relocate people living near the buffer zone of the reserve. “In 2013 and before it, we were promised jobs as guides and other forest staff. We were told that our lives would improve because people from across the country would visit the reserve which would lead to development of the area,” said Khushnam Singh, former head of Darwal village in Puranpur area. “The authorities have forgotten us and left us to fight the tigers alone,” he complained. The man-animal conflict escalated so much in 2017 that just a few months after taking oath as the state’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath visited Pilibhit and held an emergency meeting with officials regarding the crisis. The man-animal conflict in the horseshoe shape reserve was caused by several factors. Sameer Zargar, who is a part of various environmental projects in Pilibhit, said that rise in tiger population, an almost negligible buffer zone and dependence of people in the villages on forest were the major reasons for the conflict. According to PTR officials, the number of adult tigers living in the reserve increased from 44 in 2017 to an estimated 68 in 2020. “The rise in tiger population puts a stress on the ecology of the forest reserve forcing the big cats to move outside of the buffer zone into fields nearby,” Zargar said. “The horse shoe shape of the reserve is also a disadvantage because two of its arms consist of narrow patch of forest which tigers easily cross over, unknowingly increasing possibility of conflict with humans,” he added. Ram Chandra, a farmer of Amaria area of Pilibhit was mauled to death by a tiger when he went near the forest to collect firewood. The place where the incident took place is located at the tip of one of the narrow forest stretches of the reserve. “My father left home in the afternoon to collect firewood but didn’t return. When we went close to the forest we found his mauled body near the field on the edge of the forest,” said Shiv Pratap, Ram’s eldest son. To mitigate the rising conflict, PTR officials applied a multi- pronged approach. As an immediate solution, it was decided to build an electric fence around the reserve where man-animal encounter was rampant. By July 2020, electric fencing of over 40-kilometre boundary was completed. “The work on electric fencing will continue. We are planning to extend the fence to 13 more kilometres this year,” said Naveen Khandelwal, deputy director, PTR. Besides fencing, the PTR and local district administration increased efforts to spread awareness about ways to avoid conflict with tigers in villages located near the reserve. “We regularly organise awareness camps in villages. We also urge people to not enter the reserve and take measures to prevent any encounter with tigers,” said the officer. “A major aspect of the drive is to encourage villagers to report tiger sighting near villages so that we can send experts to relocate the animal from there,” he added. The efforts have increased awareness among the villagers but done very little to dilute the animosity towards tigers caused due to fear. This was reflected in an incident in February 2020 when a group of locals surrounded and attacked a tiger who ventured out of the reserve. The tiger succumbed to the injuries. Over 50 people were booked in an FIR lodged about the incident. “Bagh ke saath to marne-maarne ka hi kanoon chalta hai. Agar hum bagh ko nahi marenge to vo hame mar dega, hamare bachcho ko, pashuon ko mar dega ( The law of killing or getting killed works with tigers. If we do not kill the tiger, it will kill us or our children or cattle) said Subhash Pal, relative of one of the accused in the tiger killing incident. Considering the threat to tigers from locals, the team in PTR focuses on safely relocating the tigers found living close to villages. The team has relocated four tigers living outside the reserve since 2018. These tigers were reported by villagers and were found to be living near villages. Forest officials first tried to move them back to the forest. After failing to do so, they decided to tranquilise and capture them. While none of the tigers were declared man-eater, at least two of them were known to have attacked humans. The tigers were moved to different zoos in UP. The local officials keep reviewing measures regularly to prevent conflict. This includes banning Katharua, a kind of mushroom which is found inside PTR and is considered a delicacy. When officials came to know that some locals entered the PTR illegally to harvest Katharua, they announced a ban on use and sale of the mushroom in the entire district in 2017. The ban exists till date. The last man -animal conflict that resulted in death of a woman took place in June 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ptr-uses-multi-pronged-strategy-to-reduce-man-tiger-conflicts-101616342804968.html

21-03-2021||Dehradun||‘Take strict Covid-19 measures during Mahakumbh’: Centre tells Uttarakhand govt||The central government has written to the Uttarakhand government strongly highlighting the need for stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during Mahakumbh, the world’s largest religious congregation. The development comes a day after chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that “nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure people’s faith will overcome the fear of the virus”. According to the statement issued by the Centre, Rajesh Bhushan, Union secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, on Sunday wrote to chief secretary Uttarakhand Om Prakash and highlighted the concerns raised by the high-level central team in its visit to Haridwar on March 16 and 17 on the need of stringent measures to control the spread of Covid-19 during Kumbh Mela. A high-level central team, led by the director National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), visited Haridwar on March 16 and 17 to review the medical and public health preparedness measures undertaken by the state for the ongoing Kumbh mela in Haridwar. The Union health secretary also observed that currently, more than 12 states in India have shown a surge in Covid-19 cases during the past few weeks, and pilgrims expected to visit Haridwar during the Kumbh mela could also be from these states. It has been noted that there is a potential for an upsurge in cases in the local population after the auspicious Shahi Snan (royal bath) during the Kumbh mela. Also read: 10-20 Kumbh pilgrims testing Covid-19 positive daily - CentreThe secretary also noted that as per the report of the central team, 10-20 pilgrims and 10-20 locals are being reported positive for Covid-19 every day. This positivity rate has the potential to rapidly turning to an upsurge in cases, given the expected large footfall during Kumbh, the statement added. The state has been informed that the daily testing numbers reported in Haridwar (50,000 Rapid Antigen Tests and 5,000 RTPCR tests) are not enough to effectively offset the huge pilgrim footfall. It has been advised that the current share of RTPCR tests be significantly increased as per the ICMR guidelines to ensure that the pilgrims and local population are appropriately tested. JC Pandey, public relations officer, state health department, said they are yet to receive the letter but assured that the department will take all appropriate action recommended by the central government in the case of Mahakumbh. The Mahakumbh event has the potential to become a super-spreader this time not just for Uttarakhand but for the whole of India. Covid-19 cases are witnessing a surge in many states and many people are coming to Haridwar in substantial numbers from these states. In the first Shahi Snan on March 11, over 3.3 million people visited Haridwar. In January, the central government had issued an SOP for Mahakumbh with strict guidelines like mandatory negative Covid-19 test report, following which the state government also issues guidelines for the mega event. Newly-appointed Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat, who visited Haridwar thrice after taking charge, has been repeatedly saying there won’t be unnecessary restrictions on the pilgrims. On March 13, Rawat had announced that negative Covid-19 reports are not necessary to participate in the upcoming ‘shahi snans’ during the mega event. On Saturday, the chief minister stated in Haridwar that all “unnecessary” restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic will be removed. He said that “faith is stronger than fear”. Uttarakhand has reported 98,311 Covid-19 cases so far, of which 14,525 cases are from the Haridwar district. At present, Haridwar has the highest active cases of all 13 districts in the state with 266 active infections of the total 756. Millions of pilgrims flock to Mahakumbh, especially on days of shahi snans (royal holy baths). The first one was on March 11 and the remaining three will fall on April 12, April 14 and April 27.

Seniors have the expectations that he should go to Mysuru and reside there to cover four to five districts," Yediyurappa told reporters at Sindhanur Taluk in Raichur district.The Chief Minister said Vijayendra would camp in Mysuru after the bypolls are over."If he works in five to six districts around Mysuru in a manner that we get at least 13 to 14 more seats, then we will get at least 135 to 140 seats (in the next assembly elections). This is our expectation," Yediyurappa added.Sources in the BJP said the area of focus this time is the Old Mysuru region including Ramanagara, Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and Kolar districts where BJP is weak.Ramanagara and Mandya districts are considered JD(S) citadel for being the Vokkaliga dominated area which the JD(S) first family of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda belongs to.The BJP, however, had managed to change the notion with the victory of Dr K C Narayana Gowda from the K R Pet Assembly constituency in Mandya during the December 2019 bypolls.Vijayendra had played a key role in turning the tables on the JD(S).On the other hand, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and Kolar are considered to be Congress bastions."We are very specifically eyeing on Mandya, Ramanagara, Kanakapura, Channapatna and Varuna assembly segments," a BJP leader told P T I.While JD(S) has a stronghold in Mandya, Ramanagara and Channapatna, Kanakapura and Varuna are Congress bastions.While H D Kumaraswamy and his wife Anitha are MLAs from Channapatna and Ramanagara respectively, Varuna and Kanakapura are represented by former chief minister Siddaramaiah's son Yathindra and Congress state chief D K Shivakumar.Varuna had been considered Siddaramaiah's fort as he had been contesting and winning from there.The BJP has plans to defeat the stalwart Congress and the JD(S) leaders, a party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-charts-out-bigger-role-for-son-vijayendra-in-bjp-101616339988998.html

There were 13,493 active cases across Karnataka then.“Citizens and the government should obey the advice of the Technical Advisory Committee. The virus equally harms all kinds of activities. The government is doing whatever it can. Strict restrictions are being avoided to ensure that there is no inconvenience for day to day activities of people and economy,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health & family welfare and medical education minister said on Sunday.Sudhakar said that he would request the chief minister to convene an all-party meeting on the issue.Several localities like Bellandur, Shanthala Nagar, HSR Layout among others have shown a sharp spike in Covid- 19 cases.There are 15 containment zones in Bengaluru, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body).Several parts of India have seen a surge in cases since March and states like Punjab have relapsed into reinstating restrictions to contain the spread of the disease. Karnataka has refused to bring back restrictions as the cash-starved state, like many others, is yet to recover from the impact of the lockdown last year.After witnessing a decline from November, Bengaluru and the rest of the state went about its daily activities with little concern about the virus that remained just as potent as it was when it struck the southern state in March last year.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had blamed people coming from neighbouring states like Kerala and Maharashtra and cited that as the main reason for the spike as the border districts recorded a sharp surge. There were 20 cases in Belagavi, 61 in Bidar, 54 in Dakshina Kannada, 41 in Kalaburagi, 70 in Mysuru and 38 in Tumakuru.The coastal district of Udupi recorded 170 new cases. Udupi is home to several large universities and has taken a decision to suspend physical classes on account of the surge.Though the state government has made Covid-19 negative certificates mandatory for people coming from Kerala and Maharashtra, there are few checks being conducted, according to locals.CM Yediyurappa has proposed to double the number of vaccinations from around 1.5 lakh to 3 lakh to help contain the spread.The state has so far vaccinated over 24.67 lakh people since January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-to-double-number-of-vaccinations-to-tackle-covid-19-surge-101616339745444.html

21-03-2021||Delhi||The enchanting flavours of Holi||The ancient festival of Holi brings with it the enchanting colours of spring that symbolise love, hope and joy. Equally present in the Holi spread, that showcases painstakingly made traditional delicacies that evoke beautiful nostalgia is the longing to revive the vibrant past. One’s reminded of big family gatherings, grandmothers singing folk Horis (semi-classical singing popular in the villages of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), the delicious scent of handmade sweets and snacks making children hungry, the vivid splashes of gulal sprinkling joy everywhere. “A unique Hori/Holi celebration was on Rang Paashi, traditionally supposed to be the first day of festivities, falling three days before Poornima, or Holi. This was a big evening in our home, when we hosted a Holi dinner for friends and family. Youngsters would put gulal ke tikke on the foreheads of their elders and hot gujiya and besan ke papdi were offered first as prasad and then to everyone,” says Anoothi Vishal, food historian and author. The papdis were different from dry, off the shelves papads. “They were made at home with great labour and care by kneading besan flour in mustard oil and then pounding it to aerate it, before rolling it out into thin discs and frying fresh. Besan ki papdi is a unique Mathur dish associated with Holi. The gujiya is also preferred hot, not cold, and made with just khoya, chironji and kishmish, no extra sugar or saffron coating,” says Vishal who has curated a week-long festival of traditional Holi specials from Old Delhi homes at Punjab Grill, Aerocity this year. She recalls how the dinner would always a big affair with a special meat kaliya and poori-kachori cooked to mark the festivities. “Chaat also featured in the traditional Holi spread because as per Ayurveda this cool spring time calls for pungent and fermented flavours to protect the body. We also had fermented kaanji-bada (moong pakori soaked in kaanji and left to ferment) that was drunk on Holi.” For historian-author Rana Safvi who grew up in Lucknow, gujias were the most exciting part of the celebrations. “The colours of Holi and the taste of gujias bring back many childhood memories for me. Regular UP gujias stuffed with lots of khoya, kishmish and nariyal were my favourite.” Osama Jalali, founder and culinary Head, The Mughal Plate by Jalalis is trying to revive the traditional flavours of Holi with recipes that are closely associated with his childhood memories. He says, “Holi means meethe chawal or Shahi Zarda, thanks to our neighbours who had come from Peshawar five decades ago. On every Holi, they would send meethe chawal for us. I decided to add these in my Holi menu.” Another Holi treat that Jalali has prepared is Khush Rang Murgh Pulao. “It has small balls of chicken coloured naturally with beetroot and spinach. It’s my mother’s recipe, who is from Rampur, UP. Her grandparent’s house was located in a non-Muslim area and they were the only Muslim family. Every Holi, they loved serving this colourful dish to people in the neighbourhood,” he says. Traditionally, the festival of Holi starts from Basant Panchmi and culminates on the full moon day, Fagun Purnima. And Brij Ki Holi stands out because it’s believed that’s the place where Holi as a festival has originated from. Samrat Banerjee, director operations, Rooh New Delhi, says, “Brij Ki Holi is unique. It’s played for 40 days in various parts of the region such as Vrindavan and Barsana. Apart from Phoolo ki Holi, Lathmar Holi and Rang Ekadashi, there is something called Laddu Holi where you throw laddu at each other.” Banerjee changes his menu during on the occasion of Holi. “The menu is called Fagun. Tesu ki barfi is one of the unique dishes, made with Tesu or palash flower. It’s a tinted milk cannelloni, stuffed with tesu coloured rabri, topped with palm sugar coated tesu flowers,” he says.

I had had online interactions with Deshmukh on two occasions when he was indisposed. If Singh's allegations are believed to be true then why did he wait till March and till he was transferred, to raise them".He said Singh could be under pressure of Central agencies since his close aide (Vaze) is in the NIA custody."Singh's allegations raise several questions. All this is scripted. How leaders of BJP gave sound bytes to news channels minutes after Singh's letter became public," he alleged.Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner in the midst of investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) into recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle which was found parked outside the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month.The NIA had arrested assistant inspector of Mumbai Police, Sachin Vaze, in the case.

Singh said that five kisan mahapanchayats, one each, were proposed in Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Mirzapur, Sonebhadra and Prayagraj. “She will start the tour with darshan at Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi,” he said. The rallies are aimed at the forthcoming panchayat elections in the state. The Congress would be contesting the panchayat elections with zeal, put up a good show at the grassroots level and also enthuse the cadres for both the panchayat elections (likely to be announced at the end of this month) and the 2022 UP assembly polls, he said. Earlier, Priyanka had addressed kisan mahapanchayats in western UP --in Saharanpur on February 10 and in Mathura on February 23. At these rallies she took on the central government over the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year and the fuel prices. She had said at the rallies that if voted to power, Congress would scrap the farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/priyanka-to-address-5-kisan-rallies-in-east-up-next-month-101616332004302.html

So many depend on this industry for their livelihoods,” said Bablu Ramjani, president, Pune Sound Electric Generators Equipments Vendors Association.“The peak time for business is during January-May. Last year we lost this season due to lockdown. This year also many restrictions have been imposed on the events. It is taking away our business and also hit the livelihoods of the workers who are dependent on such work,” he said.After Diwali wedding season starts and business operators in the events industry are in demand. “Our business is less than ten per cent currently. Due to the restrictions and the Covid fear, expenditure priorities of people have changed. Many are now preferring to perform like engagements, weddings at homes. There is no business left for us,” said Subhash Sarpale, owner of Sarpale Flower Merchant and also provides flower decorations for events.These business operators are demanding to let wedding halls and lawns operate with 50 per cent capacity instead of putting the limit of 50 persons at an event. “Restaurants, banquets halls are allowed to operate with 50 per cent capacity and marriage halls only with 50 persons. Many people are booking banquets because more people can attend an event. This rule is not only impacting our business, but also the livelihoods of the workers who depend on us. Marriage halls and lawns should be allowed with 50 per cent capacity,” said Anna Kudale, owner of LG Caterers and Events.“It’s not only about us who are running this business. Lakhs of workers are dependent on these businesses for their bread and butter. We employee local people. During the lockdown period, we helped our workers. Provided what they needed, but sadly we are too are facing difficulties now. We can hardly sustain ourselves. The government should think on these lines,” said Sarpale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/events-industry-takes-a-hit-livelihood-of-8-10-lakh-people-adversely-affected-101616328944037.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh letter on corruption claims against Anil Deshmukh: Who said what||A day after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray levelling corruption allegations against state home minister Anil Deshmukh, several political leaders have given their reactions. While the opposition has demanded Deshmukh’s resignation, his party members and alliance partners of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government have termed the matter as serious but have ruled out replacing him.In his letter, Singh, who was recently removed from office, claimed that Deshmukh asked arrested cop Sachin Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars in Mumbai. The letter, which is being widely circulation on social media, states that Deshmukh told Vaze, who has been arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with Mukesh Ambani threat case, that he had a target of collecting ₹100 crore a month from the city joints.Here’s who said what about the letterAnil Deshmukh: The Maharashtra home minister has refuted the allegations against him and asserted that Param Bir Singh made the claims to save himself as his involvement in the Ambani bomb scare case and Mansukh Hiran death case was getting clearer. Deshmukh has said that he is going to file a defamation case against the former Mumbai police commissioner.Chief minister’s office: CM Uddhav Thackeray himself has not commented on the issue yet, but his office late on Saturday said that the letter that was received was not signed by Singh and did not come from his official email address. They are still verifying the letter, the chief minister’s office said.Devendra Fadnavis: The BJP has stepped up pressure on the government and has asked the chief minister to sack Deshmukh if he doesn’t resign. Fadnavis has accused the home minister of being involved in corruption in the past as well. He has alleged that former Maharashtra director-general of Police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal had submitted a report to the government on corruption in the transfer of police officers but no action was taken.Sharad Pawar: The chief of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) - one of the constituents of the ruling MVA alliance - called the allegations against Deshmukh serious and said that it is the prerogative of CM Uddhav Thackeray to take appropriate action. “There has to be in depth inquiry by such an officer who enjoy full respect in police administration,” he said and suggested that former police commissioner of Mumbai Julio Ribeiro can carry out the investigation.Jayant Patil: NCP Maharashtra president Jayant Patil said there is no question of replacing home minister Anil Deshmukh and asserted, "The letter is a reaction after Maharashtra chief minister and home minister decided to take a tough stand," the state minister said. "If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want," he told HT.Raj Thackeray: After Param Bir Singh’s letter came to the fore, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief also demanded that Deshmukh quits from his post immediately. “The main issue is that of an explosive-laden vehicle being found near the residence of an industrialist. I request the central government to intervene. The state government cannot investigate this matter,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/param-bir-singh-letter-on-corruption-claims-against-anil-deshmukh-who-said-what-101616324586876.html

Under various initiatives, the NGO is also mapping the biodiversity of the area with the help of the forest department. Western Ghats is home to over 5,000 species of flora, 139 species of fauna, and over 500 species of birds. Along with the workshop, the foundation has also been actively working on mapping the biodiversity of the area. In order to reduce the burning of wood, the foundation has worked on a biogas plant in the area making the villagers sustainable. Speaking on the occasion of World Forest Day (March 21), Leena Dandekar, founder, Raintree Foundation said that the foundation is working in one of the most critical forest landscapes of western ghats. “Under our sustainable landscape program various community-led projects are being implemented to protect forests in a cluster of nine villages of Velhe block. Creating a continuum of forests is a way to ensure sustainable development of the landscape. The interconnectedness of all the forest ecosystems on the earth only can ensure climatic stability of the planet,” said Dandekar. She further added that the forests provide numerous ecosystem services which are the backbone of survival for wild species. “Interdependencies within an ecosystem need to be understood, especially the role of forests for providing water, air, and other natural resources on which rural agrarian communities depend. The forests provide essential resources which directly and indirectly have flourished the life and livelihoods of rural communities,” said Dandekar. Asha Bhong, Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF), Bhor sub-division said that through the biodiversity initiative, ground forest workers are able to understand forests and components of the ecosystem. “It gave them scientific in-depth knowledge. This young forest staff will work in Velhe taluka for many coming years therefore this knowledge is important for them in the process of conserving forests,” said Bhong. Manisha Rasal, a villager from Ghawar in Velhe Taluka said that till now we were working on the wood-burning stove. “Everyone in the house was affected by the smoke. The children were at risk of fire while playing around but now the biogas has changed our lives. It starts quickly with the push of a button. There is no smoke.

21-03-2021||Pune||Parents, students react sharply after offline board exams decision||Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Saturday confirmed that an offline examination will be conducted for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC). However, parents and students are unhappy with the decision due to the rising Covid cases in the city and State. Highlighting the problems students are facing, city-based class 10 student, Nisha Channe said that even if the syllabus has been reduced, there are many topics which are very hard to understand. “Even during online teaching, all year long, we have faced network issues due to which teaching was not efficient. All our exams were also online so far, so we are out of practice to write examinations, even if there is an extra half hour. Also, there is this problem of wearing masks compulsorily when we are attempting the exam. In this heat, how can we write while wearing a mask? The risk continues if the offline examination is conducted,” said Channe. Jayshree Deshpande, president of the Parents’ association of Pune said that the city is witnessing a new surge of Covid cases. “Every day the Covid threat is increasing, and lockdown seems inevitable. On the other hand, if any family member is positive how will the student appear for the paper? Also, there is no vaccine for children. The threat is increasing day by day. The whole year went by in online education, many students are reportedly saying that there are plenty of concepts that are not clear. There is a lot of mental and physical pressure on students today,” said Deshpande. She added that this offline examination seems only a formality. “Class 10 students at least should be given Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) and should be given the stream they wish in class 11. Anyways, there will be just online classes for class 11 also as the covid cases are on the rise,” said Deshpande. Harishchandra Gaikwad, president, Pune district Mukhyadhyapak Sangh (Headmaster’s association) have supported the decision made by the government.“The list of instructions was made keeping in mind the need for every school from across the state. We are also hoping that teachers get the vaccination before the examinations so that everyone is safe while the offline exams are conducted. Moreover, more time between two papers has been given to the students. Also, the time to attempt the paper is also increased keeping the challenges of the students in mind,” added Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-students-react-sharply-after-offline-board-exams-decision-101616325404564.html

What kind of Ram rajya is this?" he asked in his weekly column "Rokhthok" in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana'."What kind of Hindu religion are we representing?" he further asked.In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is called anti-Hindu because she refuses to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. But denial of water to a young boy and mercilessly thrashing him is also anti-Hindu, Raut said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi touches upon different issues in his 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme. "Hope he speaks on this issue too," he added."We are against Pakistan and not against Muslims.

21-03-2021||Pune||Two more arrests in bank account data theft case||Two more people were arrested by officials of the cyber police station of Pune police in the case of bank account data fraud in which 11 people were earlier arrested. While the first police custody remand of the earlier arrested 11 people ended on Saturday, their custody was extended till March 22 along with the two newly arrested men. The arrested were identified as Lakshminarayan Gattu alias Sonya (32), a resident of Baudhanagar in Varasigude in Hyderabad, and Vyankatesh Subramanium Uppala (40), a resident of Bhandalaguda in Nagol region of Hyderabad. Sudhir Shantilal Bhatevara alias Jain (54), a resident of Sun Empire Society in the Sinhagad road area of Pune was the one person who was not arrested by the police during the initial raid. Now, he has been declared as being at large after he failed to comply with the terms in the notice which was served to him. He was served a notice under Section 40(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and was advised to be available at home for investigation whenever required. The others arrested in the case include Anagha Modak (40), a resident of Vadgaon; Ravindra Mahadev Mashalkar (34), a resident of Ambejogai road in Latur; Mukesh Harishchandra More (37), a resident of Yerawada in Pune; Rajshekhar Yadaiha Mamidi (34), a resident of Hyderabad; Rohan Ravindra Mankani (37), a resident of Sahakarnagar in Pune; Vishal Dhananjay Bendre (45), a resident of Aurangabad; Atmaram Harishchandra Kadam (34), a resident of Mulund in Mumbai; Varun Shrikadam Verma (37), a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Vikaschand Mahendra Kumar Yadav (25), a resident of Surat in Gujarat; Rajesh Munnalal Sharma (42), a resident of Aurangabad and Paramjitsingh Sindhu (42), a resident of Aurangabad. Lakshminarayan is suspected to have been involved in providing data related to bank accounts with a high account balance to Mamidi who was earlier arrested in the case. From the WhatsApp chats recovered from them, the police found information about two bank accounts - one with ₹3 crore and another with ₹25.7 crore balance in it, according to the police. The woman, who is suspected to have brought the entire chain together, broke down while speaking to her lawyer Advocate S Wagh outside the court. “The woman has been co-operating for three days prior to her arrest. The FIR was registered after she was held, and everything has already been recovered from her. There is no need for further custody,” said Wagh. However, an officer close to the investigation had said that the woman was not aware that the hackers who were roaming with her were police decoys who had responded to her call for a hacker that had spread through word of mouth. “Several laptops were seized from her possession and the hard drive in one of them is missing. We need access to that hard drive and identify the role of any other accused. There is also clear evidence of her conversation with the other accused,” said public prosecutor Dnyaneshwar More. The defence advocate for two news channel owner partners, Sharma and Sindhu, presented a different story in the court. He said, “Modak had approached their loss-ridden channel as a financial consultant and offered to arrange for KYC money. The day they were arrested, she had called them for a meeting with a company that was supposed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for investment. They were to discuss how to make the investment. My clients were not aware what they were walking into,” said advocate Jitendralal Gorane who was representing the two. He also said, during his 30-minute-long argument, that the two major banks who run the accounts whose information was found by the police during the investigation have not complained to the police about data theft. However, the police are investigating whether an insider from the bank helped in leaking the information in the first place. A case under Sections 419, 420, 120(b), and 34 of Indian Penal Code and Sections 43/66 and 66(d) of the Information Technology Act was registered at Cyber police station in the matter. Multiple defence advocates argued that the sections of cheating and impersonation were wrongly invoked as no transaction or cheating occurred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-more-arrests-in-bank-account-data-theft-case-101616325104493.html

21-03-2021||Pune||Scrappage policy: 466 PMC vehicles to be discarded||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will face a hit with the Central government’s scrappage policy on old vehicles. The PMC will have to scrape 466 vehicles from the fleet and make provision of ₹60 crore to purchase new ones in the coming years. Now, the PMC has decided to frame a long-term policy on how to tackle the situation created by the scrappage policy of the Central government. The PMC will explore the option of outsourcing vehicles and electric vehicles. The civic body has a total of 1,245 vehicles in the fleet. Of that, the PMC will have to scrap 466 vehicles, many of which belong to the solid waste management department with 127 vehicles. The PMC has a vehicle depot located at Gultekdi (Market yard) and it spreads on more than three acres of prime land. The city generates more than 2,100 tonnes of solid waste and is collected and transported to solid waste processing plants which are located in the different part of the city. The solid waste department has got a major setback from the scrappage policy of the Central government. The PMC will have to remove or scrap solid waste department vehicles from their fleet step by step by March 31, 2022. The PMC motor vehicle department spends around ₹90 crore per year for the maintenance of vehicles which includes fuel, repair, maintenance, and staff salary. The share of outsourced vehicles is around 30 per cent and the PMC wants to increase it up to 40 per cent. Due to the increasing fuel prices, PMC is seriously conserving to increase the share of outsourced vehicles. Outsourced and e-vehicles Rajendra Shipekar, deputy commissioner of PMC Motor Vehicle department said, “The Central government will implement a policy from April 1, 2022. We have one year to take measures to follow the policy. As per our statistics, the solid waste management department vehicles are more in comparison to other departments. So, we have decided to call one meeting with solid waste management. We will discuss the plan, and how many new vehicles will be needed to purchase, and the possibility of outsourcing the vehicles and budget provision.” He said, “At present, the department has around ₹90 crore budget for the motor vehicle department. As per our calculation, we need around ₹60 crore to replace new vehicles which will scrap as per policy. It will take two years; we have to purchase BS-6 and it costs more.” “We are also thinking to increase the outsourced vehicles in our fleet and introduce e-vehicles (cars) in our fleet. It will reduce the capital cost and the liability of PMC,” he added. Policy not applicable to the fire department Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer of PMC said, “The fire department has a total of 26 vehicles. However, we will not be affected due to the new scrappage policy. As per the state transport policy, fire vehicles will have to use the vehicle for only ten years.

The crime branch has taken 14 persons into custody, and seized a hydraulic machine from Charholi. The mining was being carried out on the riverbed under the pretext of hyacinth being cleaned from the river, police said. PCMC police commissioner Krishna Prakash has ordered a crackdown on the illegal sand mafia operating in the area under the commissionerate. Similarly, the district administration’s revenue department, which has supervisory authority to raid illegal sand-mining spots, stated that the drive will be expanded further. It may be recalled that the district administration seized and destroyed 40 boats used for sand mining in the Bhima river basin over the past one month. The Bhima basin riverbed, according to police, is the hub of sand mining in the district and is known to have good quality sand, which is in very high demand for construction projects. In October and November 2020, the administration seized and destroyed 80 boats used for excavating sand illegally, and made 50 arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dist-admin-pcmc-police-seize-sand-worth-rs-1-31-crore-in-raid-on-illegal-mining-operation-101616324503663.html

21-03-2021||Pune||Your Space: High-risk group should get the jab first||The spike in Covid cases in Pune has prompted the district authorities to seek approval from the Centre to vaccinate all residents above 18 years of age. Even as the government machinery is trying to meet the inoculate target of high-risk group beneficiaries, including senior citizens, with some centres booked till April 6, is covering all above 18 years a far-fetched plan? Vaccine is not a final solution We should be cautious as vaccines are not the final answer. It is just a protective shield for the most vulnerable. So, until we are strictly following social distancing and wear masks, we can’t fight the pandemic. Getting everyone above 18 years vaccinated seems to be a far-fetched move in India at this point.Sushant Mayekar Increase public awarenessWe are jumping a step. Considering the production rate of companies and country’s population above 45, we should aim for making vaccine applicable to citizens above age of 45 first. Secondly, implementation of this drive (vaccinating all above 45) rigorously (with little force if required) is important. Strong campaign of awareness to go for vaccination and importantly regarding after taking first dose risk doesn’t decrease and no one can be casual or careless at this stage, is required. A sense of trust regarding infrastructure and systems at vaccination centers is required. For this, major improvement in these facilities is required and local government be made strongly responsible for this. Ideal centres be given wide publicity. I think, we have created a wrong belief in residents’ minds that we have vaccine now which can take care of everything. There is a need to dilute this belief and rededicate ourselves to taking proper care of self and others on prescribed safety measures (mask, social distancing).Mahesh PathakSet up more vaccination campsIt’s a good move. Prevention is better than cure. However, priority should be given to those who are at high-risk. Setting up more vaccination camps should ease the pressure. As long as social distancing is followed and masks are worn properly covering nose as well as mouth, we should be able to keep the numbers down. Everything will work fine if people co-operate, not step out unless it’s necessary and take care of themselves as well as others.Parth SiddhayeGive priority to eldersIn my opinion, it does seem like a far-fetched plan, but the priority right now is getting the high-risk group vaccinated. The vulnerable group of citizens does not comprise the young population, except a few exceptional cases. After the high-risk group, including senior citizens, are vaccinated then it would definitely be a wise decision to immediately start with the drive for the younger age group as they are more exposed to the virus and hence at a higher risk of contracting it due to jobs, schools, colleges and other occupation. Foreseeing the numbers it would definitely help in controlling the situation.Varada PendseWith rising cases, vaccination drive should cover allSince the last few days, there is a huge increase in Covid-19 positive cases in Pune. It is consistently been reported of 2,000 plus cases since the last few days. Although the administration is trying its best, the cases are still increasing. Considering the seriousness of the present situation, it would be better to extend the vaccination cover to include even the age group 18-45 years as well. It will definitely help build confidence in the general public. Apart from vaccination, all the other precautions like wearing masks, keeping social distance, washing hands regularly, keeping hygiene must be followed strictly.KN PeethambaranVaccine for all is welcomeWith number of cases in Maharashtra and especially in Pune spiralling, the district administration’s call to request the Centre for vaccination above 18 years is a well-intentioned move. Even though the waiting list for citizens itself is long, rapid expansion of private hospital list, engaging private companies in this exercise to inoculate their staff should help fasten the process. We should also reduce exports too until we have enough for our citizens. Also, hospitals have limited slots of 100 per day. That should be increased too. Also, crackdown on restaurants and tea cafes floating norms should be severe. Many still don’t follow the 50% occupancy rule.Sai KrishnaElders may suffer if jabs are open for all Despite the spike in Covid cases, vaccination should not be open for all although it may seem logical. The reason is once it is open for all, there is a distinct mentality amongst some people to use influence/status and take vaccine ahead of others. This would put senior citizens on a back seat. Currently, the number of vaccination centers is also low and availability of vaccines is still a question. In such a case, it is our responsibility to see our parents and elders get the vaccine first. After all, with parks and religious places closed for the longest time last year and people above 65 being advised to stay at home, senior citizens were the ones who faced the toughest time during the pandemic!

Here's why||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday once again appealed to the state’s residents to wear a mask and maintain social distancing in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Announcing a campaign, Chouhan said that on March 23, a siren would ring across Madhya Pradesh for two minutes at 11 am and 7 pm respectively.“When the siren rings, everyone will have to take a pledge to wear a mask and follow norms of social distancing”, Chouhan’s tweet, translated from Hindi read. “I also appeal to all the shopkeepers to draw circles outside their stores to ensure social distancing. I will also do the same,” he added.Referring to the Sunday lockdown in three districts of the state - Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur - Chouhan while addressing a press conference pointed out that the infection is rapidly spreading across several other districts of Madhya Pradesh and it has to be stopped. “ I do not wish that economic activities should be disrupted but the increasing pace of Covid-19 is worrying,” the chief minister said.23 मार्च को सुबह 11 बजे मध्यप्रदेश के सभी शहरों में सायरन बजेगा। जो जहाँ है, वहीं दो मिनट खड़े रहकर मास्क लगाने और सोशल डिस्टेंसिंग बनाने का संकल्प लेगा। दुकानदारों से भी अपील करता हूँ कि वे अपनी दुकानों के सामने दूरी रखने के लिए गोले बनाएँ। गोले बनाने मैं भी निकलूंगा।Madhya Pradesh on Saturday logged 1,308 fresh Covid-19 disease cases and two more deaths- taking the caseload and death toll to 2,74,405 and 3,903 respectively.

Authorities conducted 24,695 tests for Covid-19 on Saturday while over 61.17 lakh tests have been done so far.Residents of Bhopal, Jabalpur and Indore - the worst-hit districts in the state - woke up to deserted streets and closed establishments on Sunday as the one-day lockdown returned after a gap of seven months. The MP government had earlier imposed lockdowns on every Sunday in August last year.23 मार्च को शाम को 7 बजे भी दो मिनट के लिए सायरन बजेगा और हम पुनः यह सुनिश्चित करेंगे कि हमने और हमारे आसपास के लोगों ने मास्क लगाया है या नहीं।मास्क लगाना बहुत ज़रूरी है, इसलिए यह संकल्प अभियान हम शुरू कर रहे हैं। स्थिति हाथों से बाहर निकले, इसके पहले ही हम संभल जाएँ।According to a report by Hindustan Times on Friday, the home department said that all educational institutions will remain closed in these three districts during the Sunday lockdown.

The home said he will file a defamation suit against Singh.Fadnavis had demanded Deshmukh’s resignation on Saturday as well. On Sunday, he sharpened his attack against the home minister and alleged that this was not the first time corruptions allegations were levelled against him.He alleged that former Maharashtra director-general of Police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal had submitted a report to the government on corruption in the transfer of police officers but no action was taken.Soon after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar suggested that the former police commissioner of Mumbai Julio Ribeiro investigate the extortion claims, Fadnavis expressed discontent with the idea saying, “how can a former DG (Rebeiro) probe a home minister Anil Deshmukh against whom the serious allegations are levelled?”Also, on Pawar’s “revelation” that reinstating Vaze was Singh’s decision and not the chief minister or home minister’s, Fadnavis asked why the government did not take action against the move.While chief minister Thackeray has not made any comments on the matter, his office late Saturday said that they were still verifying the email from Singh as there was no signature on it, and was sent from a different e-mail address than his official id.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/on-corruption-allegations-against-anil-deshmukh-devendra-fadnavis-says-not-the-first-time-101616320332607.html

21-03-2021||Pune||Curtain call: The hybrid show of “White Rabbit Red Rabbit”||Last week, I had written about the play “White Rabbit Red Rabbit” written by the Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour. We were getting ready to perform the Marathi version of the show on March 13. It was part of a global event, wherein the play was performed in nearly thirty languages all over the world at exactly 8 pm local time on March 13 as all theatres were shut down in Europe exactly a year back and most of them are yet to re-open. The event was a tribute to them. Considering this, the original producers of the play had suggested more than one way to perform the show. The first was, of course, in the original form, wherever it was possible. This included booking a theatre, selling tickets and performing in front of a live audience. The second way was to conduct a performance on Zoom. The writer had modified the script for such a performance and had sent it across. The third way was to have a hybrid performance – a mix of the first two methods wherein the play is performed in front of an audience and is streamed live. A comprehensive handbook was prepared by the producers covering all aspects of the performance in all three ways. An online workshop was also conducted nearly ten days before the show. They had a few snippets of how the performance will be conducted on Zoom. If possible, the performer was also asked to have a helper around her/ him with whom the stage manager could co-ordinate the show. After reading all of this and also after seeing the snippets of a show conducted on Zoom, I felt more inclined towards producing it in its original, traditional format. A performance on Zoom, while convenient to almost everyone involved, comes with its fair share of troubles including, but not limited to, poor internet connection leading to delays in give and take with the audience. But the most important thing I felt was that there was a disconnect with the audience, which would have hampered the impact of the play. I spoke to Pushkaraj Chirputkar, who is an excellent and reliable actor (and most importantly someone who hadn’t watched the play before!) and asked if he would like to perform it. He is actually very busy with a television series and is occupied for almost all day, every day. But he agreed almost immediately! It would have been easier for him to just sit at home after his daily shoot and perform on Zoom. But he understood what I was going for and drove down from Mumbai immediately after shooting and left for an early morning shift almost immediately after the performance! Now you must have realised why I describe him as ‘reliable’. The profits of the show were to be donated to a charity of our choice. So, we decided to perform the show at my house instead of booking a theatre, to save costs. We created a makeshift theatre. It worked out fine and even the place looked set for an intimate performance. The only drawback of this move is that I might be inclined to organise more and more shows here instead of going out to watch a performance! We invited around ten people to watch the show live and also to be a part of the interaction that the play required. Nearly thirty odd people joined the live stream from all parts of the world. After a few initial technical hiccups, the performance began as planned. I had watched it twice or thrice before and was aware that every performance is different. For the first few minutes I was consumed by the technical difficulties and continued to watch the play while shooting it. But even I didn’t realize when I became an audience member. The intimate setting worked beautifully for this text. Amongst other things, the play deals with suicide. So, after the show we had organised a Zoom call for any audience member who wanted to just talk or be with someone after watching the play. Many members of the audience joined the call, but fortunately none of them felt adversely and we discussed the play instead, like an audience would, outside the theatre, after watching a play. After everything was wrapped up, we poured ourselves a drink to celebrate a night of pure theatre, before people left hurriedly to reach home before curfew started.

The CM also reiterated that schools will remain open in the state.“People of Bihar live in all parts of the country. They will come to their native places during Holi. We need to keep a special eye on people coming by trains, flights, buses and ensure that they are tested once they reach here,” said Kumar, while holding a review meeting with health officials and district magistrates of all districts on Covid scenario.Kumar asked to track people’s travel history and alert all those who come in contact with them. The chief minister said that at least 70% of all Covid tests should be conducted through RT-PCR and reports should be made available within 24 hours. “Ensure that limited number of people participate in any festival or celebrations and Covid guidelines are strictly followed,” said Kumar.He said since the situation in Bihar was not as alarming, therefore the schools won’t be closed. “The schools will remain open, and studies will continue. The schools will take all necessary precautionary steps,” he said and asked the health department officials to speed up the vaccination process further.Earlier the state government cancelled the leaves of all doctors and health workers till April 5 with immediate effect. Those on leave have also been asked to report to duty as soon as possible. However, those on maternity and study leave have been excluded from the purview of the order.On March 17, following an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19 situation across the country, Kumar said while the “situation in the state was under control, but we should be careful”.Earlier, the state government had made it mandatory for those travelling to Bihar from Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra to show their RT-PCR test report.“Passengers without report will be required to undergo a rapid antigen test upon arrival and anyone testing positive for the disease will be sent to isolation centres,” said the government’s order.Principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said micro containment zones and control rooms in all districts will see 100% Covid-19 tests. He said that total active cases in the state were 436 in number and the recovery rate was at 99.24% as against the national average of 96.26%. “As against the average national death rate of 1.36% of Covid patients, Bihar has an average of 0.59%,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-directs-officials-to-ramp-up-covid-testing-stay-alert-ahead-of-holi-101616293181899.html

Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus,” said Rawat.Soon after taking over as the state’s chief minister, Rawat scrapped the requirement of a negative Covid-19 test report for visitors to the Kumbh, one that had been put in place by his predecessor.The statement comes at a time when experts and social activists have sounded an alert that the mega event, scheduled to be held from April 1 to April 30, could potentially turn into a “superspreader event” and trigger large clusters of Covid-19 cases in the state. The government is, however, yet to issue the notification officially declaring the start of Mahakumbh.“With the Covid-19 cases again increasing in the country, the government’s approach should be “health first”, but that doesn’t seem to be the case, which is worrisome,” said PS Chauhan, a Haridwar-based senior academician. “The easing of restrictions would be very dangerous for the health safety of our state.”A high-level central team has been deployed in Haridwar to review medical care and public health arrangements for the event.“Religious sentiments need to be given priority as faith is stronger than fear as was seen in the Shahi Snan on Mahashivratri on March 11, for which about 3.4 million people arrived in Haridwar,” Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/will-lift-covid-curbs-for-kumbh-rawat-101616287005866.html
21-03-2021||Delhi||Ration scheme not for credit, will drop its name: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday his government will not use the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana” to refer to the scheme that will facilitate doorstep delivery of ration, and urged the central government to now allow its roll-out that is scheduled for launch on March 25.Kejriwal’s announcement at a digital press conference came a day after the central government red-flagged the project, saying the term “mukhyamantri” (chief minister) cannot be used in the name of a scheme to distribute foodgrains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).In a letter to the Delhi food commissioner on Friday, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the Delhi government is free to launch the scheme “without mixing the elements of the NFSA foodgrains”.Kejriwal said the Delhi Cabinet will convene a meeting on Monday to pass the revised scheme, which will no longer bear any name or mention “mukhyamantri” in it. After approval by the Cabinet, which is chaired by Kejriwal, the revised modalities of the scheme will be sent to the Centre again for its clearance. In this case, the Centre’s approval is required as the scheme is linked to food grains provided to states by the Union government under NFSA.“We will agree to all the conditions of the central government. Our intention is only to send cheap and clean ration to the beneficiaries without any pilferage or corruption... This project will not have any name now. I hope now we will have full cooperation and support from the central government for the roll-out of this scheme,” Kejriwal said.DJ Narain, spokesperson for the Union ministry of food and public distribution, said on Saturday, “We have to wait for a formal proposal to know the details. Appropriate action will be taken accordingly.” Narain had earlier said that a state government cannot suo motu (on its own) change the basic elements of a scheme being implemented nationally.The issue is the latest in a series of flashpoints between the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government. Six days before the scheme’s roll-out, the Centre raised objections to the use of the term “mukhyamantri” for the scheme and said any change in the delivery mechanism of the NFSA can only be done through a Parliament amendment. S Jagannathan, joint secretary in the Union ministry of food and public distribution, also said in Friday’s letter that any change in the nomenclature would give rise to confusion among the people.Kejriwal was scheduled to launch the scheme on March 25 from 100 households in Shahdara district’s Seemapuri area.“The project is not new. We have been working on it for three to four years now and I have been personally monitoring this scheme. But this letter was issued just five to six days before the scheme’s roll out... We are not introducing this [scheme] to take credit or glorify our name,” Kejriwal said on Saturday.“During peak Covid times also, we distributed free ration to people. Even at that time we said the credit is all for them (the Centre) to take. We will do all the work and take all the responsibilities. Today morning, I held a meeting and directed officials to remove the name of the scheme,” the CM added.Kejriwal said the scheme was planned with the intention to remove inefficiencies the system and address the difficulties faced by people in getting their monthly quota of ration. Delhi has around 7.2 million ration beneficiaries and distribution of ration is currently managed by a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops.“At present, people can get ration only by going to a fair price shop. They have to stand in long queues, or wait for shops to open as many open only for 2-3 days a month, which is illegal. Then there is the problem of pilferage, adulteration and corruption. So the doorstep delivery programme was aimed at addressing these systemic problems,” Kejriwal said on Saturday.The Delhi government initially tried to implement the scheme in 2018, but then lieutenant governor Anil Baijal advised the AAP administration to give full details of the proposed initiative to the Centre. But by then, the Delhi government’s own departments also started pointing out problems with the scheme. For example, the finance department said home delivery of ration will only replace one set of human intervention with another. So, in the past three years, the government had been working on removing all these anomalies even as the Centre had largely agreed to states launching their own schemes without interfering with the NFSA.The doorstep delivery scheme was one of the major poll promises by the AAP in the run up to the 2020 assembly polls. The Delhi government already offers nearly 100 such services across departments.Under the AAP government’s plan, millers empanelled with the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation (DSCSC) Ltd will take wheat and rice from the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The wheat will be processed into flour, and the rice will be cleaned before distribution. The Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store (DCCWS) Ltd will then engage Direct to Home Delivery Agencies to lift packed ration kits from fair price shops and deliver them to the doorstep of beneficiaries, a senior official involved in the project said.On Saturday, the Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said Kejriwal’s announcement was an admission that the scheme was not “legally correct”. He added: “Kejriwal’s act of removing the name ‘mukhyamantri’ shows he has admitted he was only politicising it.”The Delhi government has been at loggerheads with the Centre over a Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday which gives overarching powers to the lieutenant governor in the day-to-day administration and also limits powers of the assembly to constitute enquiry committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ration-scheme-not-for-credit-will-drop-its-name-kejriwal-101616277736682.html

She is unwell now and not politically active....Pawar should become UPA chief. If UPA emerges stronger, the Congress too will benefit," the Rajya Sabha member said.The Sena shares power with the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra, but it is not part of the Congress-led UPA.The Sena mouthpiece `Saamana', of which Raut is executive editor, had recenlty created a flutter by stating in an editorial that if Pawar became UPA chief, it will benefit the alliance.Parties such as Shiv Sena and Akali Dal should also come under the UPA umbrella to take on the BJP, it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-says-sharad-pawar-should-lead-upa-101616273311628.html
21-03-2021||Bangalore||RSS supports law against ‘love jihad’, says Hosabale||The newly elected Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary, Dattatreya Hosabale, on Saturday said the RSS would support the laws against ‘love jihad’.‘Love Jihad’ is a term used by right-wing activists to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, though the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise the term.“The use of fraudulent methods to lure girls for marriage, conversion, or taking them to other countries has to be condemned and opposed. Some states have even come forward to make laws against this and the RSS supports this,” he said.The 66-year-old also distanced the Sangh from the recent ‘ripped jeans’ remarks of Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat. “He (Rawat) is capable of answering…. There’s no reason to bring RSS into this,” he said.During the meeting of the Sangh’s highest decision-making body, V Baghiah and Suresh Soni, both in the 70s, were relieved of their duties as joint general secretaries and made part of the national executive. Former BJP general secretary Ram Madhav has been called back to the Sangh from the party and given a place in the RSS’s All-India Executive Wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/rss-supports-law-against-love-jihad-says-hosabale-101616272333676.html
21-03-2021||Chandigarh||Salubrious Sunday: I’m going home||It was 6 am. Backpack strapped, face masked, and a sling bag dangling on the side, I was ready to leave for Mumbai airport — one of the many physical structures whose face I had not seen in over a year. With excitement in my steps, I walked towards our society’s main gate. A cab waited on the other side. Just then, I saw one of my neighbours walking her dogs in that quiet morning hour.We exchanged smiles but the intrigue on her face was hard to miss.She said, “Hi Anusha! Where to?”I replied, “Hey Paromita! I’m going home.”I smiled and continued walking to my cab. Now, I didn’t exactly give out much, right? I didn’t say I’m off to the airport. I didn’t say I’m going to visit my parents in Ambala. I didn’t say I’m flying to Chandigarh for a couple of days.As I sat in the cab, I wondered why I stopped at those three words. If I were going to another city for work, I would have answered descriptively, “I’m going to the airport. I have a flight for Bangalore.” Or “I’m flying to Delhi for work. Will be back soon!” Or at least “I’m going for a work trip. First time in almost 12 months!”In contrast, when I was going to see my parents after a long pandemic-induced hiatus and was eagerly waiting to dip into the winter hues of mustard fields golden-yellow and green, all I said was ‘I’m going home.’ Was I in a tearing hurry? No. Was I keen to keep all details to myself? Not at all. I’d have happily shared where home was, who I was going to meet, and even what I was planning to do!The reason lay elsewhere.I realized ‘I’m going home’ felt complete. Those three words felt finite in their phonetic sound yet infinite in the depths of the emotional journey behind them. While our parents and grandparents nurtured that structure called home with much hard work and love over the years, isn’t home also the overhead skies and the peripheral neem trees? The sparrows and their nests, the parrots and the nibbled pomegranates. The marigolds and the roses, and the freshly plucked peas. Isn’t home also the chitter-chatter of neighbourhood children and the dusty lanes we cycled in, the gud ki roti slathered in ghee, and toffee that the local shopkeeper handed over for free? The crackling sound when switching from one radio channel to another and the signature tune of the 8 pm news, the call of the vegetable vendor, and the familiar golchakkar. The playground and the lazy afternoons, the Sunday movies, and the dinner with family. The sultry power cuts and the instant churn out of ghost stories, the ludo and the carrom, and the precious gullak of pocket money. Where does one start from where does one even end when a home is more than our thoughts can comprehend?Yes, ‘I’m going home’ is a complete statement. Home does not need further description. Home does not need qualifying adjectives. Home does not even need location specifics. The very thought of home sparks a million stories, a million conversations, a million moments, and a million memories as every brick, every patch of grass, every turn, and every crevice carries in its bosom a part of us, and more.Because home is not a thing. Home is not a place. Home is not a tangible structure. Home is a sentiment. A sentiment so characterful that each one of us paints it differently with our unique geographic and cultural experiences, family systems and formative interactions. A sentiment so vast that as much as we try to write volumes and volumes of literature to capture it, a full stop is but a mirage. How can we fit home into a mould? How can we enclose home in a boundary?Home to me feels like a yielding dollop of warm honey…To experience its soothing warmth, to enjoy its sweetness, all one has to do is take a pause, open the heart, and sip in a spoonful of the good old.Anusha Singh is a Mumbai-based corporate communications consultant and a columnist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/salubrious-sunday-i-m-going-home-101616270738142.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||‘43% unaided colleges choose not to hike fees’||Days after the state’s Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) said they have asked unaided professional colleges in the state to consider the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown and its effect on households before hiking annual fees, thy released a circular highlighting how at least 43% institutes this year have opted for “no upward revision” of fees: This means at least 43% institutes across technical, medical and agricultural courses will continue for the acadedmic year 2021-22 with the same fees as 2020-21.Figures shared by the FRA showed 1,024 of the registered 2,371 private unaided professional institutes in the state have already applied for no upward revision of fees. At least 87 engineering, 26 architecture, 199 polytechnic and 70 pharmacy colleges in the state chose not to hike their fees for the next academic year, and instead continue with the same fees approved by FRA in the previous year. Similarly, two medical, 10 dental as well as 11 institutes offering BSc in Agriculture have decided to not revise their fees.“A sizeable number of colleges have opted for no upward revision this year, and this could be due to various reasons. We all know that society is facing an extraordinarily challenging time this year. Due to the pandemic, many families are in financial distress due to high unemployment as well as lower salaries and therefore it is the need of the hour to consider the same,” said a circular released by FRA this week.Established in 2004, the FRA is a quasi-judicial body responsible for regulating the fees of all unaided private professional colleges in the state. Every year, institutes submit proposals for changing their fee structure to the authority, which considers a number of indicators such as nature of the course, number of students, teaching and non-teaching staff, infrastructure and other facilities at the college before fixing the fees.Colleges then have to display this approved fee structure on their website for students to check at the time of admission. Institutes are usually allowed a 10% fee hike, and also have the option of continuing two years or more with the same fee structure based on the approval of the FRA.According to figures shared by FRA, the 1,024 institutes choosing to continue with their previous year’s fee structure also includes 95 colleges who opted to not revise their fees for two academic years. “Some of these institutes had applied for a two-year no upward revision in 2019-20 itself, and will continue the same until 2021-22. We should encourage more institutes to take similar steps in order to ensure that no student ends up losing out on education due to lack of funds in such trying times,” said a senior FRA official, on condition of anonymity.He added that this year, the FRA is also taking into consideration the decrease in expenditure for institutes especially since their campuses were not in use all of last year. “The fact that they incurred less expenditure last year will reflect in their balance sheets that they have to submit along with their proposal. This, too, will help reduce the fees that will be approved for the upcoming academic year,” added the official.The director of a private medical college in Pune told HT that even though classes were not conducted physically, online classes were conducted regularly and the staff was paid in full. “No staff was sacked neither was their salary deducted because not only was our staff conducting classes but were also running the hospital for several hours at a stretch fighting Covid-19. We also need to take into consideration the considerable expenditure institutes will incur in sanitisation of classes and hostel, so the only way to meet expenditure is by charging fees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/43-unaided-colleges-choose-not-to-hike-fees-101616270617430.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Deshmukh says will sue Singh, CMO says it is verifying the mail||Following allegations made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh is in serious trouble and may have to resign from his post. Deshmukh refuted the allegations and also announced he would sue Singh for “making false accusations.”While the government officially did not respond to the allegations, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said it was verifying the authenticity of the mail. While the Opposition has asked for his resignation, coalition partners seem to have rallied around him.Deshmukh said Singh was doing so to save himself from further action as he was involved in the Antilia bomb-scare case and links were leading the probe to him. He also said the former Mumbai police commissioner was trying to mislead the ongoing investigation and he is ready for an impartial probe.In an eight-page letter, Singhhas alleged that Deshmukh had asked Sachin Vaze, controversial police officer arrested in Antilia bomb scare case to collect Rs100 crore a month, and several other allegations.The letter that was sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and copied to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, additional chief secretary home Manukumar Srivastava and Santosh Kumar, principal secretary to the Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has come at the time ruling Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leadership was already mulling to replace Deshmukh and deliberating on probable candidates who is more capable of handling the crucial department.A state official said the chief minister’s office received Singh’s letter by mail at 4.37pm Saturday.“It is an unsigned letter so we are verifying the authenticity. CM Thackeray was immediately informed about the same. The home department is trying to get in touch with Singh. The email is received from an ID which is different than the one given by Singh in the directory of IPS officer,” said the CM’s office.Thackeray is unable to hold any meeting since he is under quarantine after his son and state minister Aaditya Thackeray was found Covid-19 positive on Saturday afternoon. A senior Sena minister said Thackeray has already got in touch with NCP chief Sharad Pawar over the issue. “It is clear that Deshmukh will have to step down. The decision will happen any time,” he said.As Deshmukh refutes all the allegations, the opposition — Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — has demanded his resignation. They have also demanded a probe either by a central investigation agency or a court-monitored probe. To maintain pressure they have also demanded to launch state-wide agitation from Sunday, demanding Deshmukh’s resignation.“The former Commissioner of Police, Parambir Singh has made false allegations in order to save himself as the involvement of Sachin Vaze in the Mukesh Ambani & Mansukh Hiren’s case is becoming clearer from the investigation carried out so far & threads are leading to Mr. Singh as well,” Deshmukh said in a tweet in response to the allegations.“The allegations made by Param Bir Singh are completely false and he has to prove them now as I am filing a defamation case,” Deshmukh in another clarification,” Deshmukh in another clarification.After the arrest of Sachin Vaze why was Param Bir Singh quiet for so many days? Why didn’t he say everything then?, he asked. “It is a conspiracy hatched to defame me and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to save himself,” the home minister said.“On 16th March, When he realised that he will be removed from the post of Police Commissioner the next day on 17th, he deliberately asked a few questions to ACP Mr. Patil and got conveniently got expected answers out of it. This was a part of Mr. Parambir Singh’s larger conspiracy. It seems as if he intended to get ‘specific’ answers from these chats so that he can term them as ‘evidence’ later. You can clearly see the desperation of Mr. Singh through these chats. In the chats it is clear that Mr. Singh was leading the conversation to repetitively get particular information from Mr. Patil, why was that?,” he stated.In an interview given to Lokmat, I mentioned that Mr. Parambir Singh was removed from the post as a consequence of some serious issues against him came to our notice, so Mr. Singh again tried to create some evidence in the form of WhatsApp conversation on March 19, he added.Singh has created this conspiracy to deflect attention from the explosives case and Mansukh Hiren’s death. I ask the Chief Minister to conduct an unbiased & fair enquiry of Mr. Singh’s allegations, he said. Also, Deshmukh claimed it was Singh who reinstated Vaze who was suspended for 16 years and everyone in the police department is very well aware that Sachin Vaze and ACP Patil are very close to Param Bir Singh.“The government started taking some action after the [suspended police officer Sachin] Vaze episode [pertaining to his connection in the Antilia security scare case and Hiran Mansukh case] came to light. Several decisions that had been taken by certain officers including the one to appoint Vaze as in charge of Antilia case were questioned. A new officer [Hemant Nagrale] was appointed as Commissioner in Mumbai. The allegations that have been made against the home minister are a reaction to various steps taken by the government to clean the mess. If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want. Opposition can demand what they want but we will have to see why these allegations were made and why after the officer in question was transferred,” Jayant Patil, state NCP chief and water resources minister said.“The allegations made are not only serious but shocking. For the first time in the history of Maharashtra, a director-general level officer has made such allegations and that too with chats in which demand for money was made. The chat is evidence to what Singh has said. We are of the view that the home minister should immediately resign from his position and if he is not ready then the chief minister should take his resignation,” said Devendra Fadnavis, leader of opposition and former chief minister.He said the incident has defamed Maharashtra and if Deshmukh continues to work as home minister then the probe may not remain impartial. “We also want either a central government should investigate the allegations or a court monitored probe can be conducted... The allegations have been made by a DG rank official and not by some ordinary person,” Fadnavis said in his response.Shiv Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that he has not seen the letter and will not be in position to respond to the allegation. “I have not seen the letter. I don’t know anything about it. If the matter is related to the government, the people from the government will respond. I will not speak about the issue that I don’t have complete knowledge about. I don’t know what allegations have been made,” Raut told reporters in Nashik.Late in the evening, CMO also issued a clarification saying that the letter received from a mail which is not registered as his personal mail address and also didn’t bear his signature. It is necessary to verify if Singh has sent the letter or not. The officials from the home department are trying to get in touch with him in this regard.“The chief minister’s secretariat received a letter at 4.37pm from a mail — paramirs3@gmail.com. It has mentioned the name Param Bir Singh and doesn’t have any signature. We are trying to verify the details of this mail id and also home officials are trying to contact Param Bir Singh. In fact, Singh has given parimbirs@hotmail.com as his personal mail id, hence it is necessary to check authenticity of the mail,” stated the clarification.State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant sought to defend the home minister. He said that letter clearly appears to be an afterthought. The conversation being shown as a proof today should have happened a year ago and no sane person would do that after the busting of Antilia case.“So called SMS proofs appear to be manufactured for self-defense. HM (Anil Deshmukh) had told a month ago that some officials were under pressure. BJP has conspired against the MVA govt by putting officials under pressure from agencies. This is evident from the fact that the BJP leaders get secret information so early and in a planned manner by which they reacted swiftly,” he said in a series of tweets.“The government started taking some action after the [suspended police officer Sachin] Vaze episode [pertaining to his connection in the Antilia security scare case and Hiran Mansukh case] came to light. Several decisions that had been taken by certain officers including the one to appoint Vaze as in charge of Antilia case were questioned.

21-03-2021||Mumbai||Ex-Mumbai police chief accuses minister of extortion, throws govt into crisis||Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh accused state home minister Anil Deshmukh of running an extortion racket in a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, throwing the state’s ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government into a crisis.The letter, which is unsigned, comes days after Singh’s transfer, brought about by curious circumstances surrounding an explosives-laden vehicle found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in February.The prime suspect in that case, currently in custody, is a Mumbai Police Assistance Inspector, Sachin Vaze, who was reinstated in the force — he was suspended on March 15 following a custodial death case — after the MVA, a coalition of the Shiv Sena, Congress, and Nationalist Congress Party, took over.In the letter, which the Chief Minister’s Office has confirmed receiving, Singh accused state home minister Anil Deshmukh of “corrupt malpractices” for instructing police officers to “carry out official assignments and collection schemes including financial transactions”, as well as setting targets for them “to collect money” from establishments such as hookahbars and restaurants.Deshmukh, who denied the allegations in the letter in a series of tweets, said late on Saturday that he would file a defamation case against the former Mumbai police commissioner, who was transferred on March 17. Singh did not respond to calls and messages for a comment.The “instructions” were brought to Singh’s attention by suspended police officer Sachin Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police as well as Sanjay Patil, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Social Service Branch, the letter stated.“The Hon’ble Home Minister expressed to Shri Vaze that he had a target to accumulate ₹100 crore a month. For achieving the aforesaid target, the Hon’ble Home Minster told Shri Vaze that there are about 1,750 bars, restaurants and other establishments in Mumbai and if a sum of Rs. 2-3 lakhs each was collected from each of them a monthly collection of ₹40-50 crores was achievable. The Hon’ble Home Minister added that the rest of the collection could be made from other sources,” the letter stated, referring to a purported meeting that took place in the home minister’s official residence Dyaneshwar in mid-February.The allegations caused a political storm.“For the first time in the history of Maharashtra, a director general level officer has made such allegations and that too with chats in which demand for money was made. The chat is an evidence to what Singh has said. We are of the view that the home minister should immediately resign from his position and if he is not ready then the chief minister should take his resignation,” former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said.Officials from the chief minister’s office confirmed receiving the letter in the mail. “We have a received a letter on a mail today evening but it doesn’t bear Singh’s signature,” an official from the CMO said.“The chief minister’s secretariat received a letter at 4.37pm from a mail — paramirs3@gmail.com. It has mentioned the name Param Bir Singh and doesn’t have any signature. We are trying to verify the details of this mail id and also home officials are trying to contact Param Bir Singh. In fact, Singh has given parimbirs@hotmail.com as his personal mail id, hence it is necessary to check authenticity of the mail,” a clarification issued later on Saturday stated.“The allegations made by Param Bir Singh are completely false and he has to prove them now as I am filing a defamation case,” Deshmukh said.“After the arrest of Sachin Vaze why was Param Bir Singh quiet for so many days? Why didn’t he say everything then?” he asked. “It is a conspiracy hatched to defame me and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to save himself,” the home minister said.Singh was transferred out of the Police Commissioner’s office on March 17, and made Commandant General of Home Guards, Maharashtra.Fadnavis accused the MVA government of protecting Vaze, who was the lead investigator in the case before it was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), after Vaze’s name was linked to the death of a Thane businessman, Mansukh Hiren, who was linked to the SUV found outside Antilia.“I have been made a scapegoat to divert attention from the actual wrongdoers,” Singh’s letter stated and explained that the transfer “was effected under section 22N(2) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 with the reason that my transfer was necessitated by administrative exigencies. I believe that the reason for the transfer noted by the Govt. in my file is to ensure a free and fair investigation in the Antilia incident.”Hiren’s body washed up ashore a creek in Thane district on March 5, following which his wife, Vimla, gave a statement to the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) that she suspected that Vaze was involved in her husband’s death.The NIA, which took over the probe into the explosives case arrested Vaze on March 13 for allegedly planting the explosives and parking the car on Carmichael Road, where the Ambanis reside, on the intervening night of February 24 and 25.On Saturday, the Centre handed over the probe into Hiren’s death to the NIA.The letter also quoted a message exchange purportedly between Singh and ACP Sanjay Patil regarding a meeting that allegedly took place at Deshmukh’s official residence, in which other officials, including the home minister’s personal secretary Sanjiv Palande, were also present. The home minister allegedly gave similar instructions to Patil and another officer, DCP Raju Bhujbal.The letter claimed that Deshmukh announced a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and registration of an FIR into the alleged case of abetment of suicide of Dadra and Nagar Haveli parliamentarian Mohan Delkar in the Assembly on March 9, even though Singh had expressed his concern that an abetment to suicide case cannot be probed by the Mumbai police, but should be investigated by the police of the Union Territory.“Due to my resistance, the Hon’ble Home Minister was unhappy with me as the political mileage desired to be derived from the registration of the abetment of suicide case in Mumbai in the death of Shri Mohan Delkar, Member of Parliament against senior officials of Dadra & Nagar Haveli was not being achieved,” the letter stated.The letter comes at a time when the NCP leadership was already considering replacing Deshmukh. If asked to resign, Deshmukh will be the second minister from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to do so in the past three weeks. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rathod, who was handling the forest department, resigned on February 28 after his name was mentioned in a suicide case.However, the coalition government seemed to have rallied around Deshmukh on Saturday.“If we ask Deshmukh to resign now, we would be doing what certain people want. Opposition can demand what they want but we will have to see why these allegations were made and why after the officer in question was transferred,” Jayant Patil, state NCP chief and water resources minister, said.“So called SMS proofs appear to be manufactured for self-defense. HM (Anil Deshmukh) had told a month ago that some officials were under pressure. BJP has conspired against the MVA govt by putting officials under pressure from agencies. This is evident from the fact that the BJP leaders get secret information so early and in a planned manner by which they reacted swiftly,” State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said in a series of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/exmumbai-police-chief-accuses-minister-of-extortion-throws-govt-into-crisis-101616269887295.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze row: MVA government’s troubles mount||Troubles for the Maharashtra Vikas Agadi (MVA) government mounted after the letter. The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government that is already embarrassed by the alleged involvement of an assistant police inspector in the Antilia bomb scare and death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, could have their image further dented and see ample fodder given to the opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in the state and the central government.While Deshmukh, who said that this is an attempt to defame him and MVA government, Shiv Sena insiders said this is a ploy by the BJP. They, however, acknowledged that this allegation will “damage the image” of the government if it is not handled quickly.Sena insiders said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has taken the matter “seriously” and is expected to discuss the resignation of Deshmukh with NCP chief Sharad Pawar. A Sena leader said that Thackeray and Pawar had discussed a change of guard in the home department earlier in the week during their meeting. The Sena leader, requesting anonymity, said, “Both the leaders had reached an agreement on his removal, but no immediate decision was taken then. Uddhavji will speak to Pawar saheb over his resignation.”The opposition is likely to use this alleged “misdeed and malpractices” – as per Singh’s letter—to regain power in the state. BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar, while speaking in State assembly, had threatened of President’s rule in Maharashtra in the next three months. However, constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat said that the letter by Singh could be a thin ground for imposition of President’s rule in the state. “They are looking for it but it is very difficult. Article 356 clearly states that if the government of the state is not carried on according to the provisions of the Constitution, then President’s rule can be imposed. These are minor things and one cannot impose for this reason. They (BJP) are looking for it for the simple reason that once it is President’s rule, it is BJP rule through governor, President and the Prime Minister, which is the chain of command,” said Bapat. He also added, “This is a common feature that police commissioners are asked to collect money for political parties, and no party is an exception to it. Such if such order [of collection] was for political party then it is an offence. Normally such orders are given orally.” Political analyst Pratap Asbe questioned Singh’s motive and said, “Why was he silent earlier? Why did he choose to write the letter after he was removed? If he had made these allegations public earlier it would have been credible. This seems to be an afterthought. There are several doubts can be raised over his allegation, whether he has come out open after he saw that he is going to be in the dock,” Asbe said.Another political analyst Surendra Jondhale said that this letter will seriously damage the State government’s image. “Besides damaging the government’s image, this incident has also dented NCP’s image. This is a serious allegation on their minister. This is a second such incident in this government after Dhananjay Munde [who was accused for crimes against woman, but the complainant withdrew her complaint],” Jondhale said. This is the second time when a home minister has faced allegations of corruption. Deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the Congress-NCP government had faced charges of laundering Rs850 crore in the contract for construction of New Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-row-mva-government-s-troubles-mount-101616270438043.html
21-03-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Smears of spring||There are many species of warblers — tiny look-alikes that are very secretive in their habits. Differing calls and songs usually help distinguish different species. However, in the case of the Tytler’s leaf warbler, an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) near-threatened species, an alternative is available to ornithologists. The warbler’s head and chin is often stained with pollen when the bird migrates back to the Western Himalayas in spring from its wintering grounds in the Western Ghats. Pollen smears were not found by ornithologists in months outside of spring. Much like light Holi smears, these stains distinguish the Tytler’s leaf warbler from other species.“Thus, the flower-probing habits of the Tytler’s (shared with the dissimilar-looking Buff-barred warbler) may provide a supplementary clue to identification in spring. The thin bill of Tytler’s warbler is apparently related to the species’ propensity of foraging by picking and probing in various substrates rather than fly-catching,” wrote American ornithologist and an authority on South Asian birds, Pamela C Rasmussen. Her research paper was based on an examination of Tytler’s specimens curated in museums across the globe.The first record for the Tytler’s from the inter-state capital region (encompassing an area within 40-km radius from Chandigarh) came last week from Chakki Modh, Solan, which is brimming with nectar resources. The specimen was merrily feeding on petals while in passage migration to its breeding grounds in higher altitudes. Tytler’s warbler is endemic to the sub-continent while the common name commemorates British infantry officer and naturalist Robert Christopher Tytler (1818-1872), who took part in the first Anglo-Sikh War.Palkon ki chhaya I have walked calmly through swarming honey bees in spring in Chandigarh and the surrounding countryside. Bees are hyperactive while swarming as they are finding spots for new hives. Some of these ‘bizzee, buzzin’ bees alighted on my bare forearms to check me out, and then flew away to more pressing tasks. Never has a bee stung me during such swarming interactions. I did not indulge in piteous cries and flailing limbs that would have readily invited stings. They sensed my good intentions.Bees don’t want to sting us because it is suicidal for these pollinators. When a worker bee releases the sting from her lower abdomen, it leads to a rupture, body fluids are lost and she dies as a result of ‘bleeding’. Similarly, coy butterflies rarely alight on a human wrist but when they do so, it is because they discern noble intent.A painting of great visual delight and reflecting nature’s immensity was on display recently at the 19th all-India annual exhibition hosted by the WE Group of Contemporary Women Artists at the Government Museum and Art Gallery. Employed as an art teacher at Delhi World Public School, Zirakpur, Sonam Goel invested her artwork, Exploring Nature’s World, with a woman’s intuitive understanding. Ensconced in Vibgyor colours, Goel depicts one eye resplendent with flowers and shrubs sprouting like eyelashes that tenderly shade vision and lure many butterflies.In creative contrast, Goel is austere with the eye’s soulmate. “The other eye has lesser flowers and shrubbery but a butterfly still comes and perches at the edge. I want to convey that the butterfly has sensed a beauty in the defoliated eye that is welcoming, radiates harmony and brims with benign feelings,” Goel told this writer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzzsmears-of-spring-101616270323257.html
21-03-2021||Chandigarh||Two-thirds of Covid patients in Punjab in 20-60 age group||Nearly two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in Punjab, which is witnessing a second virus wave, are aged between 20 and 60 (working-age population), reveals the state health department’s analysis of the first 11 weeks of 2021. The trend suggests that people in the age bracket have a high rate of mobility as they have to venture out of their homes for work or other purposes. The figures also show that those aged between 31 and 40 are the most vulnerable to contracting the virus, with 17.2% of the total cases falling in the category. Besides, the 41-50 age group has the second highest positivity ratio of 16.70%, followed by 16% among those aged between 51 and 60. Around 15% of the total patients are from the 21-30 age group. Also, 17% of those infected are senior citizens (those aged above 60). Within this category, 10.9% of the patients are aged between 61 and 70, while 6.2% are above 70. Those aged between 0 and 10 are the least vulnerable as only 2.20% of the infected people are from this age group. Nearly 15% of the patients are aged between 11 and 20. A senior health department official said the nature of the spread of the virus in different age groups was almost the same during the first Covid-19 wave. Around 64% of the total deaths, maximum for any age group, were witnessed among senior citizens in Punjab in 2021, shows the data. While 20% fatalities were in the 51-60 age group, 11% in the 41-50 bracket, 3% in the 31-40 category and 1% were in the 15-30 age group. “Our analysis also shows that 78% of those who lost their lives were brought to hospital only when their symptoms turned severe. Therefore, the biggest reason behind the deaths is delayed reporting of symptoms,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/twothirds-of-covid-patients-in-punjab-in-20-60-age-group-101616270260900.html
21-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amritsar BRTS: PMIDC mulls fare cut, Golden Temple-airport link||As the metro bus service under the much-hyped bus rapid transit system (BRTS) project has been struggling for success, Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company (PMIDC) has proposed to reduce the bus fare and introduce a new route connecting the Golden Temple to the Amritsar international airport to attract interstate and international visitors.The ₹553-crore project had already been struggling to draw passengers before the pandemic too cast a shadow on the public transport.PMIDC, a wing of the local government department, that took over the project from Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) on October 1, 2020, has stated that remedial actions were being taken to ensure maximum passengers availed of the service.Akshay Sharma, transport manager at PMIDC, said, “Amid Covid-19 outbreak, we resumed the bus service in July last year. In six months, ridership has increased to 31,000 per day. Before the pandemic, it was 40,000. It is yet to achieve the previous daily count because the students who contribute to it considerably are not availing it due to suspension of offline classes in schools and colleges.”Though the officials concerned are claiming these figures to be good, in view of city’s population and footfall of visitors, this count is considered far behind the level of satisfaction and success, as noticed by the conscious residents of the city.“This is a project of the municipal corporation, which collects huge taxes from residents but doesn’t render up-to-the-mark services. The metro bus service has a few designated stations in the city. There are not parking arrangements for two-wheelers at these stations. These are among the many shortcomings of the bus operation that are turning out to be the hurdles in the way of its success,” said Kulwant Singh Ankhi, a patron of Amritsar Vikas Manch.Presently, 93 buses are plying in the city. The total monthly expenditure is nearly ₹2.5 crore, while the revenue is ₹70 Lakh (approx). “The difference between expenditure and revenue does not matter as the transport is to facilitate the public,” said Sharma.Delayed salaries Bus drivers also face the issue of timely payment of salaries. “We get the salaries every month, but late and only after demonstration and strikes. We got the last month’s pay using these methods,” said Onkar Singh, president of the drivers’ association.However, Sharma argued, “The bus operator is responsible for the delay in payment to the drivers. We release the salaries once the operator fulfills all the compliances.”Expansion on cardsTalking about the future plan to popularise the service, the PMIDC transport manager said, “While we have proposed reduction in the bus fare, a study has been conducted to ensure that maximum people avail this service. As per this study, expansion of this service is in the pipeline. We have sent the expansion plan to the higher authorities for approval.”As per this plan, Sharma said, “We have identified some potential routes in the city, on which the buses could be operated. The foremost route is the road leading to the airport. Keeping in view the religious tourism, we have proposed to connect Golden Temple to the airport to facilitate interstate and international visitors. With this service getting started, these visitors will get to have a smooth ride for nominal charges.”Riding cashless The PMIDC is also looking to provide a cashless riding experience to the passengers.“We have also planned to introduce other modes of like payment like Paytm and GooglePay for the passengers in case they are without cash,” said Sharma. “Apart from this, we have also started saving ₹15 lakh monthly by changing the parking system of the buses. At the end of the route, the buses will remain parked there and it starts its operation from that point the next day,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-brts-pmidc-mulls-fare-cut-golden-temple-airport-link-101616270138235.html
21-03-2021||Other||HSC, SSC students to take exams at own schools, junior colleges: Maharashtra min||State education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Saturday said that though HSC (Class 12) and SSC (Class 10) exams would take place offline, students will get their own schools and junior colleges as centres. In case there is inadequate seating in their school or college, students will be allotted the nearest centre. While HSC exams will be held from April 23 to May 21, SSC exams will be conducted from April 29 to May 20. “Considering the geography and demography of the state, we have decided to go ahead with offline exams. Online exams do not seem to be an option as a large number of students might not have access to technology,” said Gaikwad. The education department had released a set of guidelines for conducting the exams in the state in light of the rising Covid-19 cases and the resultant restrictions. Similarly, a list of concessions in light of the pandemic was also announced on Saturday. Gaikwad said that students of Class 10 will have to submit assignments instead of their science practical exams. Class 12 students from the science stream will appear for practical exams at their respective colleges from May 22 to June 10, while those from the arts, commerce and vocational streams will have to submit assignments instead of practicals. The details with respect to assignments will be released soon. Students will be given an additional 30 and 15 minutes for the three-hour (80 marks) and two-hour (40/50 marks) papers, respectively. Students will have to reach the exam centre at least an hour before the exams and papers will be given to them 10 minutes before time. The staff at all the board offices and those working in the exam centres, including teachers, will be vaccinated on priority basis before the exams. The Maharashtra board will conduct a fresh round of exams in June for those students who might have missed their exams owing to infection, being quarantined or staying in containment zones. Supplementary exams for students will be held in July-August as usual. The government is also planning to write to authorities in the state to allow students to travel by public transport throughout the exam period after showing their hall tickets. Some of the other measures include having an isolation room in each centre in case a student has to write their paper in isolation, and granting an hour more to students with special needs for a three-hour exam. Students can check the state board’s official website – https://www.mahahsscboard.in – for more details and updates. Nearly 3.3 million students appear for Class 10 and 12 exams from the state board every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hsc-ssc-students-to-take-exams-at-own-schools-junior-colleges-maharashtra-min-101616269838083.html
21-03-2021||Delhi||Cases, positivity rate creep up in Capital||Delhi recorded 813 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the most since December 24, and the test positivity rate rose beyond the 1% mark for the first time since December 27, suggesting that the Capital may be on the brink of yet another outbreak.The increase has been particularly sharp since Monday, March 15, when the city saw 368 cases. The trend is in tandem with similar rise in infections in several other states, particularly Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana. Overall, the weekly average of new cases a day across India has risen from around 23,500 on March 15 to over 31,600 on March 19.A Delhi government spokesperson said the situation in the Capital is under control. “Health minister Satyendar Jain is taking review meeting everyday and the administration is well prepared to take necessary actions when cases increase further. We still urge people to take all precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour, especially in the light of the festive season ahead,” said an official, while underscoring that other regions such as Maharashtra, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh “have much higher positivity rate”.The spokesperson reiterated the Delhi government’s appeal to open up the vaccination drive to include all people above the age of 18. “At present, vaccination is the most effective way to curb the spread of Covid-19. Hence, the government has requested the Centre to open vaccination to all adult citizens of the city. Vaccination centres are also being increased along with their timings being extended by 4 hours,” the spokesperson said.Union government officials have in recent days attributed the rise in infections to the recent wedding season. On Saturday, at least two district health officials in Delhi said several more factors could be to blame. “Out of the five states that have seen the number of cases shoot up recently, one is Delhi’s neighbour. And, the infection is coming in from there,” said one of the officials, asking not to be named. A second district official said that the rise in day temperatures could be forcing people to stay indoors, raising the likelihood of infections. “What we have seen so far is that the cases are among the middle class people, same as it was during the November surge of cases. This, I think, is mainly because of the change in weather prompting them to remain in air-conditioned environments where the spread can happen more easily,” this person said.The second official also added that people who were not exposed previously to the infection may have begun mixing among themselves more, giving the virus access to more vulnerable people. “The seroprevalence in Delhi is 56%, this means that there are still 44% of the people who are susceptible to the infection. It is now spreading among them quickly as interactions go up with everything going back to normal after the number of cases reduced,” this person said.The latest 813 cases came from 75,888 tests. The government spokesperson said the administration is focusing on increasing awareness, increased surveillance, and scaled up enforcement against violation of rules regarding wearing masks and social distancing.“We are doing the highest number of tests compared to other cities. Delhi’s test figures are nearly five times the national average. Vaccination is also being intensified in all districts. We are keenly monitoring areas that had not witnessed a surge during the last three waves in Delhi. Nearly 60% of the 3,409 active cases in the city are contained or inside containment zones and we are tracing at least 31 persons per Covid positive case,” the spokesperson said.Experts said it is crucial to increase vaccination coverage now. “The number of cases and positivity rate increasing is a cause for worry. I expect that by the end of the month, we would start reporting 1,000 cases a day. And, the main thing is that we need to speed up our vaccination drive and for that, we need to remove the current age bar in place. In Delhi, over 50% of the people already have been exposed to the infection, it is the remaining 50% who need to be vaccinated quickly,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and head of the first committee of the Delhi government on the control and management of Covid-19.Sarin added that the city must also look at what strains are circulating since “we know the efficacy of the Oxford vaccine is lower with the South African variant”. “Another thing we need to ensure is that people who have been vaccinated follow a Covid-19 appropriate behaviour till at least four weeks after receiving the second shot,” he added.According to the Union government’s Co-WIN dashboard, there have been a little over 990,000 doses delivered in the Capital as on Saturday. CM Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday that the administration will attempt to accelerate the drive by allowing centres to open till 9pm (from 5pm previously) and by increasing the daily capacity to 125,000. The actual number of doses being given in the Capital has fluctuated between 30,000 and 40,000 over the past week, leading to calls for the Union government to relax the eligibility rules for people to seek doses.(This story has been updated to accurately reflect the version of the Delhi government spokesperson.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cases-positivity-rate-creep-up-in-capital-101616268206288.html

21-03-2021||Lucknow||Centre circulates draft guidelines for power sector; states to comment by Mar 24||Prior to the launch of a new reform-based power sector scheme aimed to provide 24x7 reliable electricity to all the consumers across the country, the Centre has circulated draft guidelines to the states including Uttar Pradesh, asking them to send their comments/suggestions, if any, by March 24. “We plan to announce the new scheme as proposed in this year’s budget by the month-end after states send their comments on the draft guidelines,” secretary (Power), Alok Kumar told the HT over the phone. “Under the new scheme the Centre will also give grants to discoms to address their viability concerns provided they improve their financial and operational performance,” he added. Named as ‘revamped reforms-linked results-based distribution sector scheme’, it entails undertaking several reform measures as well as the creation of infrastructure to address ‘the most pertinent’ issues prevailing in the sector, that is, high aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and the average cost of supply and average revenue realization revenue gap. “Instead of adopting a one-size-fits-all approach the new scheme seeks to provide flexibility to states/discoms to undertake the works to meet their specific needs and problem,” says rural electrification corporation (REC) executive director R Lakshman in his covering letter annexed with guidelines circulated to states. REC has been appointed the nodal body for the implementation of the new scheme in 16 states including UP while Power Finance Corporation will be the nodal body for the same work in 19 other states. The draft guidelines were received by the chief secretary, UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) chairman, among others, here two days ago. The draft guidelines say that India is surplus in power generation today and sufficient transmission capacity has been created to carry inter-state and intra-state power, while the government has been assisting states/discoms through various schemes since 2014 to improve their distribution network as well as financial health. It further notes that the implementation of various schemes has resulted in improved access to electricity. An independent, survey according to it shows that an average Indian household gets almost 20.6 hours of power supply every day with urban areas getting 22 hours and rural areas getting 20 hours. “Despite all these measures consumers do not get reliable 24x7 electricity in many parts of the country. Average technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and consequently an average cost of supply and average revenue realized gap continues to be high. This sub-optimal performance of the distribution sector is due to structural deficiencies and weak infrastructures,” the draft points out.

I-T officials on Saturday said simultaneous searches were carried out on March 17 at the premises of the builder and a developer group based in Mumbai. Searches were also conducted at the places of mobiles accessories trade. Beside this, surveys were conducted at 14 premises under the operation.Questioned about the real estate group, I-T officials said it is developing a commercial mall with 950 units exclusively for mobile accessories business. Of these, about 905 have been sold since 2017. “Evidence stored in a pendrive seized during the operation revealed that the builder group has taken an amount of ₹150 crore as on-money receipts over and above the agreement value, which is not accounted for in the books of accounts on sale of such units. Further, similar evidence amounting to ₹70 crore has been found in the pendrive pertaining to a residential-cum-commercial project. Cash amounting to ₹5.50 crore was found and seized from various premises of this group. The receipts of on-money for sale of shops/flats by the builder in various projects recorded in digital form have been seized,” stated Surabhi Ahluwalia, commissioner of I-T department and official spokesperson for Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT). Raids at mobile accessories dealers led to seizure of incriminating evidence pertaining to out-of-books sales. “The group imports goods from China and sells these goods to various parties all over India. The imports are under invoiced and payments are made through hawala channels. Thirteen secret godowns containing unaccounted stock have been discovered. We are taking an inventory and valuation is under progress,” a senior I-T official said.The investigation by I-T officials led to recovery of evidence of unaccounted investments in properties by suspect dealers amounting to ₹40.5 crore, of which ₹21 crore is against the units at the said mall. Four undisclosed bank accounts in the names of employees have also been detected, which are used to collect sale proceeds from retail vendors of the group. The deposits in the bank accounts amount to ₹80 crore.The tax agency said the operation revealed the entire sector of trading in mobile accessories is largely unaccounted for. The main components are imported from China through Mumbai and Chennai ports. Search has revealed that dealers are undervaluing sales and purchases in a major way, the agency stated.The transactions with Chinese counterparts take place through We-Chat app, I-T investigators have found using forensics. Probe to extract information regarding the quantum and cost of Chinese imports is underway. So far, unaccounted cash worth ₹5.89 crore has been seized. The searches have resulted in the detection of undisclosed income of around ₹270 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/income-tax-dept-raids-mumbai-builder-mobile-accessories-traders-101616268577844.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||How Param Bir Singh-Deshmukh faceoff puts NCP chief Sharad Pawar in a tough spot||he allegations against home minister Anil Deshmukh have put Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in a tight spot.Pawar is considered as the architect of the three-party Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra. He brought the three parties from different sides of the political spectrum together to form a government and keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) away from power in a crucial state like Maharashtra. Over the past 15 months, Pawar has not just been monitoring the functioning of the government but also stepping in to resolve the crisis or advise chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on handling the same.Even in case of Antilia bomb scare-Sachin Vaze issue, Pawar held meeting with Thackeray last week following which Param Bir Singh was removed as Mumbai police commissioner.It was portrayed by MVA that Hemant Nagrale was brought in as the new police chief to clean up the mess in Mumbai Police.Till then, the Shiv Sena was at the receiving end of the flak over its links with Vaze. Following Singh’s letter, things have changed. Now Pawar’s party is facing a crisis of credibility and Pawar has to take a call on removal of Deshmukh.According to NCP insiders, Pawar was already planning to shift Deshmukh out of the home department. HT has reported how Pawar was mulling different options as Deshmukh’s successor in home department. According to party leaders, he planned to shift Deshmukh out of the home department after some time so as to avoid the impression that Deshmukh’s removal had something to do with Vaze case.However, in the changed circumstances, he may have to take action immediately though the party top brass was deliberating whether Deshmukh should be asked to resign immediately. State NCP chief Jayant Patil rejected the Opposition’s demand for Deshmukh’s removal.Significantly, Deshmukh was not Pawar’s first choice for the post of home minister when MVA was formed in 2019. Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar was keen on the home portfolio but several senior NCP leaders were not in favour of the same since Ajit had an anti-corruption bureau probe pending against him in connection with alleged irregularities in irrigation projects during his tenure as irrigation minister in Congress-NCP government. Pawar would have preferred Patil, but Ajit was opposed to it.As such Deshmukh was selected as a candidate acceptable to everybody.However, the way Deshmukh handled Antilia bomb scare-Vaze case inside and outside the state legislature did not impress the NCP top brass.According to NCP chief’s close aides, Pawar was considering Ajit, Patil and health minister Rajesh Tope for the portfolio.The problem, however, may not end here for Pawar.This episode has put a question mark over the credibility of his party and not just MVA. Besides, it is not yet known what would be the fallout of the Antilia-Vaze case.“NIA is still conducting the probe. We don’t know what Vaze has told the agency. Singh’s allegations of Vaze’s links with Deshmukh have made things difficult for MVA. The BJP may push for dismissal of the government in the state citing collapse of law and order,” said a senior NCP minister.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has been insisting that the Antilia case has links to higher-ups in the MVA government. He had alleged that Vaze was a “recovery agent” for some people in the government.“Despite the indications by Fadnavis, MVA, as well as NCP leadership, could not anticipate what could happen next. The government which looked pretty comfortable a few months ago now looks vulnerable. It is facing its worst crisis. People believed that Pawar could run a government efficiently. That belief may not last long with this kind of crises. There could also be doubts among legislators if Pawar can bail the MVA out of trouble. And this could affect the stability of the coalition government,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antiliasachin-vaze-row-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-in-a-tough-spot-101616268517857.html
21-03-2021||Delhi||Mumbai: After Antilia case, NIA takes over probe in Hiran’s death||The Centre on Saturday suo motu handed over the probe into Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran’s death to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has been probing the SUV laden with explosives found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. The NIA will take over the case from the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which has been investigating the possible murder of Hiran, a 48-year-old Thane-based auto spare parts dealer, who is linked to the Scorpio that was found with 20 loose gelatin sticks, and a threatening letter addressed to the Ambanis, outside their Antilia residence on February 25. NIA officials will take over case files including the post mortem report of Hiran after re-registering the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the ATS on March 7 against unknown persons for the charge of murder. The NIA arrested suspended police officer Sachin Vaze on March 13 for purportedly planting the explosives in the Scorpio. The ATS has also questioned Vaze over his role in Hiran’s death after it came to light through the statement of Hiran’s wife, Vimla, that the two knew each other. The ATS on Saturday sought Vaze’s custody in the murder investigation, but the NIA special court scheduled the hearing to March 25, when his custody with the NIA ends. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) used its power under Section 8 of the NIA Act, which says that any connected offence related to a scheduled offence already under investigation, in which the suspect is same, can also be taken over by the central anti-terror agency. The ATS approached the special NIA court on Saturday seeking Vaze’s custody, but the court scheduled the hearing to March 25, when Vaze’s NIA custody ends. After Hiran’s body washed up ashore at a creek in Thane district on March 5, Hiran’s wife, Vimla (43) gave a statement to the ATS, which led them to file a murder case against unknown persons. Vimla told the ATS that she suspected that Vaze, who knew Hiran well, had a hand in his death. Vaze was also lead investigator in the explosives case, before it was briefly handed over to the ATS. The NIA took charge of the case on March 9. “NIA has information Vaze had even called Hiran for questioning when he was the Investigating Officer (IO) of the SUV case. We are trying to establish the chain of events after that,” an NIA official said on condition of anonymity. Vaze had borrowed the SUV that was found parked outside Antilia, in November 2020 and returned it to Hiran on February 5. Hiran had later reported the car stolen on February 18, a day after he had met Vaze outside the police headquarters near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). Vaze, who was attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was suspended after Vimla’s allegations became the centre of a political storm between the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his arrest while the House was in session. On March 13, a Thane district and sessions court denied Vaze’s anticipatory bail plea and said that his custodial interrogation in Hiran’s murder investigation was “necessary”. The NIA has identified Vaze’s co-conspirators in bomb conspiracy case and some arrests are likely to happen after all the evidence is gathered, officials said. The NIA team on Friday reconstructed the crime scene at Carmichael Road, where the Ambanis live and the Scorpio was found parked. The probe agency is also examining several suspects and witnesses that include Mumbai police officers and some private persons, said an officer, who did not want to be named. HT had reported that NIA’s investigations revealed that Vaze had planned the explosive conspiracy with some other players. Political reactions Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya on Saturday said in a press conference that the party is happy that the NIA is looking at both the cases now and that the Chief Minister cannot save Vaze any longer. The BJP, including leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, has been alleging that Shiv Sena – a party that Vaze had joined when he had retired from the force in 2007 till he was reinstated in 2020 – had been protecting Vaze’s involvement in the case. The claim has been repeatedly refuted by the party, including CM Uddhav Thackeray who had said that the investigation will be conducted in a free and fair manner, and anyone found guilty would be punished. However, editorials in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana had criticized the NIA taking over the explosives investigation. He said, “I recently spoke with the family of Mansukh Hiren and they are satisfied with the investigation. Antilia and Mansukh Hiren murder is one case which will now be investigated by a single agency. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray tried to save Vaze by separating both the investigation,” Somaiya said. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that the NIA taking over the probe into Hiran’s death was not a setback to the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra government. “There was no need for the NIA to take up the probe into the explosives-laden SUV and Mansukh Hiran case. The Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and Mumbai police were capable of investigating them,” Raut said in Nashik.“However, the Centre is looking for opportunities to see how theMaha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government can be put in a spot. You can bring the CIA or KGB...It makes no difference. It is not a setback to the Mumbai police of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,” he said. Investigations continue Earlier this week, NIA had recovered the original number plate of the Scorpio from a Mercedes Benz purportedly being used by Vaze, 6-7 other number plates; a set of clothes which Vaze had apparently changed after the SUV was dropped at Carmichael Road around 2.20 am on February 25; ₹5.75 lakh cash and a currency counting machine apart from kerosene oil suspected to have been used to burn the oversized Kurta worn by the suspect. Forensic officials on Friday said that the NIA team made Vaze walk on paths marked with start and end points, while two forensic teams took pictures and made a video for gait analysis. The images will be fed in a computerised system along with parameters like height, weight and width of the person which will be compared to the video from a CCTV grab that emerged last week, showing a man in what seemed to be a PPE kit or a long kurta, with his face covered, walking on Carmichael Road, when the SUV was parked. A NIA team visited the house of Sachin Vaze on Saturday afternoon for over two hours. Also, the deputy commissioner of police, of ATS, Rajkumar Shinde visited the Thane ATS office in Wagle estate for investigation purpose. A team comprising three NIA officials accompanied by local police also visited Vaze’s Saket Complex residence in Thane. “The team reached the house at 12:30pm on Saturday and was there till almost till 2:30pm. This was their second visit to Vaze’s house, the team had earlier visited for over six hours on Wednesday,” a police officer said.

When she opted for the renewal process on this website, she had to furnish her personal details as well as bank details to pay the fee. However, later she found that ₹2,999 was transferred from her account. When she again looked for the website, she came across the official website, which warns people of fake websites duping people. She then realised that she was duped and approached the cyber police. Cyber police officers started their probe and technical investigation led them to Uttar Pradesh. Officers learnt about whereabouts of Alok Shukla, a suspect involved in the racket, in Mujaffarnagar, UP, and nabbed him there on March 16. The team brought him to Mumbai on transit remand on Thursday. Shukla has been charged under sections 420, 468, 471 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66c and 66d of Information Technology Act.

21-03-2021||Chandigarh||Minerva Punjab FC kicks off search for talent at grassroots||Chandigarh’s Ranjit Bajaj is focused on his goal. His passion for football and the knack of scouting for talent made him start Minerva Punjab FC in 2014 that went on to win the All-India Football Federation (AIFF) backed I-League in the 2017-18 season. Now, he has kicked off efforts to groom players for the Indian team that can qualify for the 2034 FIFA World Cup. “I want to provide the best to the Under-8 and Under-10 age-group footballers. My academy should be a feeder for the Indian team, which should be able to qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2034,” says Ranjit, who is holding trials and will be travelling across India to look for budding footballers in the coming months. The 42-year-old has played for India U-19 football team in the Asian School games and also featured in the Santosh Trophy and Durand Cup. The son of retired bureaucrats BR Bajaj and Rupan Deol Bajaj, he is credited with bringing football back to the region after Punjab-based Jagatjit Cotton & Textile Football Club (JCT) was disbanded in 2011. Bio-secure bubble at academy Ranjit’s academy has coached more than 49 individual players and 172 selections for various age group India teams in the last six years. At present, there are 200 young footballers as trainees. “We have created a bio-secure bubble at the academy to keep the Covid-19 infection at bay. The present lot is subjected to professional training. Nation-wide trials are on the cards for identifying such U-8 and U-10 players,” he says. “Our residential academy is making its presence felt,” says Ranjit, a faculty and chief operating officer at his grandfather Lt Col Deol’s Minerva Academy in Mohali, which trains students for defence services. In 2018, Minerva created history when it held all national titles across all age groups at the same time. On his inspiration, Ranjit says, “I wanted to be part of my grandfather’s legacy and his vision. We have provided budding footballers with the best facilities at Minerva Academy Football Club.” Serving football at the grassroots Bajaj surprised everyone by selling off his I-League victorious team to lifestyle and well-being firm RoundGlass in 2020. “When we won the I-League, it was like tasting redemption. I proved a point to myself through the title win. I did not see any profit in investing in a team for I-League as AIFF has given more prominence to the Indian Super League (ISL),” he says but doesn’t rule out a comeback in the I-League in the coming years.

A lawyer said that an order was issued by the principal district and sessions judge on Saturday. “Only litigants and witnesses will be allowed access to lower courts because of a surge in Covid 19 cases. We appreciate the order issued by the principal district and session court,” he added. There are 800 to 1, 000 lawyers who work in the lower court. “Under this order only litigants like accused and witnesses will be allowed,” he added. Another advocate said that given the existing circumstances, the traffic police should be allowed to impose and charge penalties from the violators on the spot and avoid sending the violators to the courts. “Courts also impose and charge penalties on the violators and hence this practice should be done away with till the situation normalised,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/access-to-lower-courts-in-jammu-restricted-in-view-of-surging-infections-101616266897381.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mother and two sons go under knife together for dual organ transplant||At the end of a 14-hour procedure that required doctors at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital to carry out simultaneous surgeries on three people, Mumbra resident Tabish Mulla, 25, has received a new lease of life thanks to organs donations from his brother and mother.In 2014, Mulla was diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria, a rare condition characterised by recurring kidney stones. His liver failed to produce the enzyme alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGA), which led to kidney stones. In 2019, after his kidney failed, Mulla was put on dialysis. Every alternate day, he would receive dialysis for six hours. After some time, his liver also started showing signs of damage. The only way to save Mulla was with dual kidney and liver transplantation. “This condition couldn’t be treated by a kidney transplant alone. A simultaneous liver transplant was also needed to ensure the enzyme defect in metabolizing oxalate was also cured and the newly-transplanted kidney didn’t get destroyed with oxalate deposition,” said Dr AS Soin, director of liver transplant at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. However, since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an over-100% drop in cadaveric donations (which allow organs to be taken from a brain-dead person). However, Mulla’s mother Shabana, 53, and elder brother Danish, 28, said they would donate their organs. “The patient could be saved because of his mother and brother,” said Dr Percy Chibber, Mulla’s doctor and chief kidney transplant surgeon at the hospital. Dr Chibber it could have taken Mulla one or two years to get cadaveric donors. On February 8, Mulla, Danish and Shabab went into surgery at the same time. It took 14 hours and a group of 35 doctors to complete the simultaneous surgeries. “Once the liver team had completed the liver transplant, we transplanted the kidney from his mother,” said Dr Chibber. “In a liver donation, a part of the liver is divided and removed from the donor and implanted into the recipient,” he explained. Mulla’s father, Gani, 58, remembers seeing doctors rushing from one operating room to another. “My wife and both my sons were undergoing surgeries at the same time in different rooms. They had to retrieve the organs and transplant it into Tabish’s body. It was a vulnerable moment for me,” said Gani. A little more than a month later, the donors and the recipient are doing well. For the last eight months, the Mulla family have been living in a rented home in the Dockyard area so that none of the patients have to undergo the 13-kilometre journey from Mumbra to the hospital. Mulla has to be extra careful as he is on immunosuppressants, which makes him more vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. “The doctors have counselled us about the precautionary measures to be taken as my immunity is low. But so far, I am better and haven’t developed any form infections,” said Mulla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mother-and-two-sons-go-under-knife-together-for-dual-organ-transplant-101616266598517.html

He said that the department plans to intensify the vaccination drive and administer the vaccine doses to everyone in state in the near future.The concept of mega vaccination day was introduced on March 15 when 1.5 lakh beneficiaries were administered the vaccine.Thereafter, vaccine doses were administered to 67,650 beneficiaries on Tuesday, 14,199 on March 17, 68,858 on March 18, 60,944 on March 19, and 14,581 on March 20.On administration of vaccine doses to healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs), the ACS said 1,75,736 HCWs were administered the first dose, which cover around 80% HCWs, and around 1,05,210 HCWs were administered the second dose, which covers around 60 % HCWs.He added that 93,371 FLWs were administered the first dose of vaccine, which covers 69% FLWs, and 28,426 FLWs were the second dose, which is 30%.Among people above 60 years, those within the age group of 45 to 60 years with co-morbidities, and general citizens, first dose of the vaccine was given to 5,04,735 beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-haryana-over-3-85-lakh-people-inoculated-in-six-days-101616266597297.html
21-03-2021||Other||Haryana to make direct payments of MSP to farmers from April 1||From the coming rabi harvesting season beginning from April 1, the Haryana government is going to implement 100% direct payment to farmers for all crops procured on the minimum support price (MSP) replacing the age-old method of paying farmers via ahrtiyas.Amid pressure from Centre, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday made it clear that the state government has decided to ensure 100% online transfer of payments directly into the accounts of farmers.Centre is trying to implement direct payment since 2012 and even direct directions in this regard were issued in 2016, but the state government had failed to implement the plan following protests by ahrtiyas.Ready for 100% direct paymentOfficials from the Haryana foods and civil supplies department said that they are ready for 100% direct payment to farmers as they have completed all formalities, and registration on ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Byora’ portal are on.“In the last Kharif harvesting season, around 50% payments were paid directly in accounts of farmers and from this year the payment will be disbursed with 48-hours of the procurement and submitting of the J-Form,” said Anurag Rastogi, additional chief secretary, Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department.Biggest reform for mandi systemAs per agriculture experts, if implemented successfully, the move will be the biggest ever reform in the mandi system of Haryana as it will not only give more financial powers to farmers but will also help put check on bogus procurements for which government had to pay crores every harvesting season.“This decision will shift the financial powers from ahrtiyas to farmers. Currently, ahrtiyas get payment of produce of their farmers and they pay farmers as per their convenience. But once direct payment is implemented, they will depend on farmers to clear their dues,” said commission agent Parveen Kumar, of Nilokheri grain market.As per the mandi officials, e-trading and direct payment will put a check on illegal trade in the mandis as farmers will have to give all their details and a copy of their land ownership to get a gate pass to sell their produce.To create rift between farmers, ahrtiasThe decision also assumes significance amid ongoing protests by farmers against Centre’s three farm laws as the decision will help government ‘create a division between farmers and ahrtiyas’.Since most farmers unions in state are in favour of direct payment and ahrtiyas are opposing it, the move will curtail the latter’s financial powers and will have to depend on farmers to clear their dues.Even officials in the Haryana Agriculture Marketing Board said that over 90% registered farmers have adopted option of direct payment.“Getting direct payment of their produce is right of every farmer. Why are commission agents demanding payment of farmers’ produce into their account? Ahrtiyas do not have any right on payment of our produce and they have already taken cheques from farmers for their dues,” said Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union president Ratan Mann, adding that this move will also bring transparency as the commission agents will not be able to provide fake J-Forms to tax evaders.Ahrtiyas to oppose moveWithin Haryana, ahrtiyas have threatened to boycott upcoming wheat harvest season if the state government implements the shift.“We have already held a state-level meeting in Kurukshetra in this regard. Most commission agents are against direct payment to famers. We have decided to take up the issue with the government,” said Ashok Gupta, president of Haryana Ahrtiyas Association.“But if the government fails to consider our demands, we will decide further course of action,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-to-make-direct-payments-of-msp-to-farmers-from-april-1-101616266418942.html

Admissions will also reopen in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur Municipal Corporation areas.As per a notification released by the office of the deputy director on Friday, yet another first come first served round will be conducted between March 19 and 26 for students, who are yet to confirm seats in any college. Students who wish to apply for the round can log into the admission portal and claim seats against vacancies in colleges as indicated there. They can then confirm their admissions by paying fees online by March 26.“Since some students had asked for more time to confirm their admissions, we have decided to give them one last chance. The portal will close for admissions on March 26,” said an official from the state education department.While students are not allowed to cancel their seats during this period, junior colleges can do so and get the cancellation approved by the office of the deputy director. Once admission is cancelled, students cannot get another allotment in this round.This year the department conducted seven admission rounds including regular rounds and first come first served rounds. However, even after that, over 36,000 students in MMR were still yet to be admitted. Officials are hoping that those yet to be admitted complete their process in the last round for the academic year 2021-22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-96k-seats-vacant-education-dept-to-have-another-round-for-fyjc-admissions-101616266177241.html
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM directs Haffkine to start talks with firms that have developed Covid-19 vaccine||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday directed the state-run Haffkine Institute to speed up the process for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. He has also directed the institute to start talks with firms that have developed Covid-19 vaccines and seek the Centre’s help in developing its own biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, which refers to biocontainment precautions required in establishments where personnel work with agents that may cause serious or potentially-lethal disease through inhalation. Thackeray’s directives came during his visit to Haffkine Institute where he reviewed the institute’s preparations to set up a new plant at an estimated cost of ₹154 crore, for the manufacture of the Covid vaccine in collaboration with Bharat Biotech. “The institute should focus on developing the Covid-19 vaccine and make all attempts to get desired permission and technology. It should also initiate talks with other firms that have developed Covid-19 vaccine,” Thackeray told officials during the review meeting on Saturday. The institute, during the first week of this month, had sought permission from the Centre to start fill and finish operations, which if approved would allow Haffkine Institute to bottle vaccines and pack them as a product after receiving the vaccines in bulk from Bharat Biotech, said Sandip Rathod, managing director of Haffkine Institute. Earlier, in January, Haffkine Institute had sought permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech, which has developed the first indigenous Covid vaccine Covaxin. To participate in the process of making the vaccine, the institute needs a BSL-3 facility. ICMR is the country’s apex body for formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research. Haffkine Institute is a public sector undertaking, owned by Maharashtra’s state government. In the past, it has developed a number of vaccines, including the anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum and polio vaccine. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said Haffkine Institute has enough land to set up manufacturing facility. “Considering the state’s population of 12 crore, it would require vaccines in bulk as each person is required to get two doses. They may also have to get inoculated every year. Hence, chief minister wants the institute to prepare accordingly as there are many firms that have developed vaccines which are also effective,” Kunte said, adding that the BSL-3 facility could be used to develop vaccines for other diseases in the future. Last week, during a video conference meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CM, Modi had said industries and institutions interested in manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine would be encouraged to do so by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-directs-haffkine-to-start-talks-with-firms-that-have-developed-covid-19-vaccine-101616265877755.html

The minister inaugurated the National Resource Centre for oral healthcare of children and the elderly (OHSC), advanced positron emission tomography (PET) scan and computed tomography (CT) facility, advanced vascular interventional lab, 384 slice dual source CT scan and refractive surgery suite (SMILE) facilities in different departments. Speaking on the occasion, Vardhan said PGIMER is one of the premier medical Institutes of India, providing specialised medical services to all five northern states of the country. He congratulated medical professionals and the scientific community for rising to the challenge and diligently fighting against the coronavirus and also bringing out a vaccine in such a short time. “PGI should create a successful model to enable the world to move towards health for all. It should also mentor other institutions. PGI should develop a new journey, new vision for the scientific community,” he said. On the OHSC, he said the sole purpose of this resource centre was to provide a model of oral health care delivery to children and the elderly in Chandigarh and thereafter support the National Oral Health Programme (NOHP) in replicating this model across the nation. The OHSC at PGIMER will be instrumental in substantially reducing the oral disease burden of the country.On World Oral Health Day, the minister said the government of India had envisaged the NOHP under the umbrella of the National Health Mission to provide affordable, accessible and equitable oral healthcare delivery in a well-coordinated manner to provide ‘optimal oral health’ for all. “The national oral health policy has been drafted under NOHP and is expected to roll out soon,” he said. Vardhan said the newly installed state-of-the-art robotic arm-assisted PET/CT guided intervention device at the advanced PET-CT facility provides real-time 3D visualisation of lesions for biopsies; less needle manipulations, repeat punctures and repeat scans during complex procedures. On the advanced vascular intervention lab, the minister said the cath lab in PGIMER was the first of its kind with hi-tech artificial intelligence software, transforming the management of stroke patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgi-must-create-a-model-to-achieve-health-for-all-dr-harsh-vardhan-101616265577078.html

The election took place on March 14 and the counting of votes began on March 17. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is likely to win the second MLC seat from Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency as well. TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, who is fighting the elections for the second consecutive time, was leading the table during the counting of second preferential votes, till filing of this report. Vani Devi, who contested the election on TRS ticket, defeated her nearest rival N Ramachander Rao of BJP, who is the sitting MLC from the constituency. She secured 1,87,339 votes in the final round after counting of second preferential votes, as against 1,68,520 votes required for winning the seat, accounting for 50% of the total votes polled. Apart from the BJP candidate, two others – G Chinna Reddy of the Congress and K Nageshwar, who contested as an independent – stood among the top contenders. Several TRS leaders including K T Rama Rao, Harish Rao and their cabinet colleagues congratulated Vani Devi for winning the MLC seat. “It is an endorsement of KCR’s policies by the educated voters,” Harish Rao said. BJP official spokesman K Krishnasagar Rao said the BJP would respect the mandate given by the graduate voters and humbly accept the electoral outcome. He, however, alleged that KCR had crowded the contest by ensuring multiple social influencers in the fray, which was an unethical attempt to confuse the electorate and split BJP vote. Congress candidate Chinna Reddy said the TRS had won the MLC elections purely because of its money power and it was unfortunate that the unemployed graduates were sold out to the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trs-candidate-vani-devi-wins-one-mlc-seat-in-telangana-101616265396483.html
21-03-2021||Other||Decision to delist from national scheme: Centre’s coffee plantation call leaves farmers in lurch||Hyderabad: A recent decision of the Central government to delist coffee plantation work from permissible activities under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP) scheme has left more than one lakh tribal farmers in forest areas of Visakhapatnam in the lurch. The Union ministry of rural development conveyed to the Andhra Pradesh government in September, stating that the MGNREGP would no more be applicable to works taken up in the coffee plantations in the tribal areas of Viskakhapatnam, where the famed ’Araku coffee’ is produced. “The decision was taken following a recommendation made by the Coffee Board of India in April 2020 itself. Their contention is that coffee plantation is not a perennial crop. Secondly, coffee is also a commercial crop. Hence, it cannot come under MGNREGP,” Andhra Pradesh commissioner of panchayat raj and rural development M Girija Shankar said. He said the state government had already written twice to the Union ministry to reconsider its decision. “Our chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, too, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our MPs, too, represented the matter with the Centre, but we fail to understand why the Centre is refusing to concede to our request,” Shankar said. The Andhra Pradesh government has been promoting coffee plantation under MGNREGP since 2009-10, as an area specific work in the Scheduled V areas (tribal pockets) of the Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam. “Only wage component tasks such as pitting, planting and intercultural operations, are taken up under MGNREGP and the material component is being met by the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) and the Coffee Board. Funds are directly paid to the bank accounts of the beneficiary ,” the commissioner said, adding that the total wage component under the project was around ₹32,000 per acre. According to Dr Salijamala Venkateswar, project officer of ITDA, Paderu, the Centre had permitted coffee plantation works in Visakhapatnam as a special project. Normally, MGNREGP doesn’t cover agriculture labour, but covers manual labour under horticulture, sericulture, plantation and farm forestry. “It was basically aimed at preventing the tribal people from undertaking shifting cultivation that results in destruction of forest areas and providing them a sustained livelihood. Since they have very small landholding – from half acre to a maximum of two acres, payment of wages under the MGNREGP would go a long way to improve their living standards,” Venkateshwar said. He said under this programme, each tribal farmer was getting on an average of ₹245 per day and on an average, there were 81 person days during a year. “On an average, each tribal used to get ₹20-25,000 per year towards wages under the project. Now, they are deprived of the same,” he said. According to the ITDA official, the Coffee Board took the decision to delist the Araku coffee plantation works from MGNREGP, as it was under pressure from other coffee-growing states like Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to include their coffee plantations, too, under the project. “However, there is a fundamental difference between Andhra Pradesh coffee growers and other states. In our state, it is grown exclusively by tribals for their livelihood, whereas in other states, they are grown in coffee estates in lakhs of acres,” Venkateshwar said. The state government represented to the Centre that as coffee plantations in Paderu and Araku areas provide sustainable income resources to primitive tribal households, their activity may be permitted under MGNREGP. “We pointed out that when the project is applicable for rubber plantations in Kerala, it could be applied to coffee plantations in Araku as well,” Shankar said. As per the MGNREGP guidelines, any plant that is perennial in nature and suitable to the agro-climatic conditions can be brought under the scheme. “Coffee plantation too was taken up as an area specific work in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam district where the altitude and climatic conditions favours it,” he said. Stating that the coffee plantation was a game changer in the tribal areas, the commissioner said delisting it from MGNREGP would adversely impact the livelihood of vulnerable tribals. “Since, as per Land Transfer Regulation Act 1 of 1970, the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals is banned, there is no scope for coffee cultivation by non-tribals in this area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decision-to-delist-from-national-scheme-centre-s-coffee-plantation-call-leaves-farmers-in-lurch-101616265336479.html
21-03-2021||Other||B’luru start-up opens up new market for veggie, fruit farmers||Bengaluru: Shyam Benegal’s ‘Manthan’ (1976), based on Verghese Kurien’s milk cooperative movement, inspired TN Manjunath to set up ‘Humus’ - a Bengaluru-based start-up that sources fruits and vegetables from the farmers in and around Karnataka. Humus procures over 100 commodities from nearly 1,000 farmers from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which is sold at three retail outlets in Bengaluru’s Yelahanka, JP Nagar and Vidyaranyapura. On Friday evening, wooden pushcarts painted sky blue were lined up inside a simple big box store in Vidyaranyapura. Customers took their time to pick the best from a fresh lot of vegetables offered at a 20% discount on market rates. “One of the learnings we picked from the ‘Amul model’ was setting up collection points,” said Manjunath, who started the Humus with his business partner and wife Shilpa Gopalaiah in 2019. “The collection points present farmers with an option of not paying the 10% commission to an agent APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) and saving another 5% on transportation,” he added. Manjunath, who was a teaching faculty in an engineering college in Bengaluru, said coming from a family of farmers, he always wanted to do something in the agriculture field. “We are trying to create an agri value chain. That is to connect four major verticals — production, processing, procurement and marketing. We are now working on procurement and sales and marketing to build trust with consumers and farmers. To master all verticals, we will need at least a decade,” he said. Manjunath said that one of the changes needed was to move from a production-driven agriculture model to a sales-driven model. “We believe it has to be sales-driven agri model. Our farmers produce the yield and struggle to sell it. So, if we have a clear idea about the demand, the production is streamlined. The stores we run provides us data to share with the farmers who are associated with us,” he said. Humus has six collection centres in Dibburahalli, Attibele, Pandavapura, Ooty, CK Palli and Malur. Taking even small quantities from farmers is what make them stand out, says Manjunath. “To send their produce to an APMC a farmer has to opt for a single crop system. For a farmer producing 100-500kg of a vegetable, taking it to the APMC would not be convenient, considering the transportation charges. At the same time, we accept smaller quantities and we are located close to the farming hubs. Farmers who work with us bring their produce on even motorcycles,” he said. Talking about expanding the model further, he said that like Amul, Humus wants to have collection points in every Hobli (collection of 50 villages) in the state. The company plans to expand to tier 2 cities of Karnataka as well. Srinivasa Prasad, a retired government employee and customer said that apart from the lower cost compared to the market, knowing that a farmer is getting his right dues attracted him to the store. “I walked in seeing the carts parked together and later I realised produces were coming straight from the farmer. There should be more such models. But we hope there is more organic produce,” he said. Manjunath said that their business model would allow the farmers to return to organic methods of farming, but would take time. “There is an assumption that the yield will be less in the organic method but it is not true. Over the years, the fertiliser industry has misled farmers and made them use chemicals even though the soil was rich. It did boost yield, but only by a small margin. The long-term result was that only 5% of the farming is now organic and our groundwater levels are depleting,” he said. He said a quick change to organic farming will not be practical. “If we are able to procure from these farmers over a long period of time and when the trust is built, a shift from chemical-based farming to organic farming, in a phased manner is desirable. To ask them to immediately change their way is not practical,” he added. While talking about ongoing protests against the new farm laws, which farmers’ union claim would lead to the corporatisation of the agriculture sector, Manjunath said that farmers continue to have the option of choosing between private markets or APMCs. “Agri sector is huge. No, individual entity can’t take control over the sector. Such a monopoly has happened in the telecom industry because they are tech-enabled. But agriculture requires a fraternity of people to run the show,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-start-up-opens-up-new-market-for-veggie-fruit-farmers-101616265277089.html

Officers’ familiar with the development said that the minister was questioned for four hours at the Bengaluru police’s technical cell in Adugodi. A senior officer in the SIT said that in the on-camera questioning, more than 50 questions were asked to the former minister. Jariholi told SIT officials that he was aware of the tape for four months but didn’t pay attention to it. “When the video was shown to him, he said that it was fake. He claimed that he doesn’t know the woman in the video. When the call records between him and woman were presented, he repeated that he doesn’t know the woman,” said an SIT officer. Jarkiholi went on to add that the tape was released as a part of a political conspiracy and asked the SIT to probe into it. He said that a call for ransom came through a legislator. However, SIT didn’t reveal the name of the legislator. Jarkiholi resigned from the state cabinet a day after allegations of sexual exploitation surfaced against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Gokak in Belagavi district on March 3. Subsequently, he had filed a complaint alleging extortion. Meanwhile, the SIT on Friday served notices to three people — the woman who accused the former state minister Ramesh Jarkiholi of sexual exploitation and two absconding journalists Naresh Gowda and Shravan, who are wanted for involvement in the case. On Thursday, Naresh Gowda released a video message claiming innocence. On March 12, the SIT questioned Gowda for his alleged involvement in leaking the video. Gowda has since been absconding. In the video, he claimed that he did not appear before the investigating officers because he believed he will be fixed in the case. “My name has been dragged into the alleged sexual exploitation case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi. There is a systematic effort to fix my involvement in the case,” said Gowda.Meanwhile, social activist Dinesh Kallahalli, who filed a complaint against Jarkiholi, had submitted a three-page written statement to SIT on Friday, responding to the notice issued to him. In his response, he said that a journalist he knew for many years approached him with the video allegedly of the minister. He added that hat the woman in the CD is a friend of the journalist who approached him. On Wednesday, a Bengaluru-based non-government organisation (NGO) had filed a petition before the Karnataka High Court, claiming the investigation in the alleged sexual exploitation case involving the former state minister violated the provisions of the Nirbhaya Act, 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sexual-exploitation-case-sit-questions-jarkiholi-for-four-hours-101616265276524.html

21-03-2021||Delhi||Three gang rape 25-yr-old in car after tiff with her brother in Aya Nagar||A 25-year-old woman was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by three men in south Delhi’s Aya Nagar early on Friday morning after she allegedly intervened in a fight that her brother was having with the men over giving passage to their vehicle.Barely half an hour later, and less than a kilometre ahead, the same trio fought with a truck driver and four labourers over the same issue and robbed the trucker of his purse containing ₹30,000, his driving licence, Aadhaar card and ATM card, the police said.Late in the evening on Friday, the three suspects were finally arrested from a forested area in Aya Nagar, where they were hiding, police said. The SUV used in abducting the woman was also recovered, along with the truck driver’s purse and ₹5,200 of the looted money, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur.The arrested men were identified as residents of Aya Nagar and live nearly 300 metres away from the woman’s house. The woman and her brother had identified the suspects and had noted down the SUV’s registration number, which helped the investigating team locate and nab the suspects, the police said.Around 3am on Friday, DCP Thakur said, the woman’s brother was walking in a lane near his house when three men arrived in a white Scorpio car and entered into an altercation with him over giving passage to their vehicle.“As the woman intervened and tried to save her brother, the three men forcefully bundled her in their car and started sexually assaulting her, even as her brother raised the alarm and alerted the neighbours,” said DCP Thakur.The police said that later, the suspects let go of the woman and fled as the brother had raised the alarm and sought help from neighbours. At 3.36 am, the police control room was informed about the crime. A police team arrived and took the woman to a hospital for medical examination.While the police were carrying out an enquiry at the spot, at 4.06 am, the police control room received another call regarding a robbery committed by three men travelling in a white Scorpio car. Another police team reached the crime scene — that was less than a kilometre from the place where the woman was sexually assaulted.The caller Shahzad, a truck driver, told the police that he along with four labourers were unloading bricks from his truck when three men arrived in an SUV and started abusing and assaulting them over giving passage to their vehicle. Shahzad alleged that the trio robbed his purse containing ₹30,000 and other documents, the DCP said.“On the basis of the woman’s complaint and her medical examination, we registered a case of gang-rape, abduction, and criminal intimidation under Indian Penal Code Sections 376D, 365 and 506. The second case of robbery and common intention was registered on Shahzad’s complaint,” said DCP Thakur.During the investigation of the cases, the DCP said, it was revealed that both the crimes were committed by the same three men travelling in a white Scorpio car. Multiple teams were formed and a manhunt was launched to nab the suspects and recover the vehicle. They scanned CCTV cameras to identify the routes the vehicle had taken. Since the woman and her brothers had identified the suspects, the police had to ensure that the three were caught before they could leave the city, said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Through human intelligence network, the police located the vehicle that was parked at a dwelling house in Aya Nagar. The suspects were arrested from a forested area late in the evening. None of them had previous criminal records. All three are into the business of building construction materials supply, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-gang-rape-25-yr-old-in-car-after-tiff-with-her-brother-in-aya-nagar-101616263616362.html
