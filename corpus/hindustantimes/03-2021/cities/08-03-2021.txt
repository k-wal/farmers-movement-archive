Residents who want to do away with the use of single-use plastics can avail steel utensils free of cost at the bank. MCG officials said that the bank will help do away with disposable and single-use plastic utensils, which are used in local community gatherings and weddings.“The opening of a steel utensil bank is a part of our continuous effort to remove plastics from Gurugram. In gatherings, especially at the local community level, disposable or semi-disposable plastic spoons, forks, cups, glasses, and plates are used. With the help of RWAs, local councillors, and active citizens, we will be reaching out to the organisers and offer them our utensils instead,” said Dheeraj Kumar, joint commissioner, MCG.Kuldeep Singh, MCG brand ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission, said that the bank, which was opened on Sunday, has around 2,000 utensils and the civic body is in the process of opening more such banks in wards 15 and 29 by next month to ensure a city-wide coverage.“Our overall aim is to open such banks at every ward so that there is micro-coverage. Along with the local councillor and MCG officials, we are in the process of opening the banks in wards 15 and 29 by next month,” said Singh.To avail of the service, MCG officials said that residents can contact them at 9599959886 or 9700774213.Brahm Yadav, local councillor of Ward 13, MCG, will collaborate with Buland Awaaz, an NGO, to supervise the bank from his office, officials said.Since December last year, MCG has undertaken various initiatives to remove plastics. The civic body has distributed cloth bags to shopkeepers at the markets of sectors 46, 23, 4 and Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1. This was done to make these areas polythene-free and eradicate the need for plastics.MCG’s bank is launched exactly a month after the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) opened its own steel utensil bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-opens-city-s-first-steel-utensil-bank-to-eliminate-plastics-101615227922226.html

However, this was a marginal improvement from Sunday’s AQI reading of 218 in the same category. Experts said that the air quality had improved on account of stronger winds that aided better ventilation. VK Soni, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) environment monitoring and research centre, said that strong winds had prevailed during the day on Monday, due to which the AQI had improved. “Strong winds with speed ranging between 8-12kmph prevailed during the day, as a result of which some improvement was seen. The skies are clear and easterly winds are prevailing. Winds are not blowing from the dust-prone regions as yet,” said Soni. He added that a further improvement in the air quality could be expected in the next few days. The level of ultra-fine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) — the city’s primary pollutant — was recorded at 141.12 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 175.05µg/m3 on Monday. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally but remain in the moderate to poor category on Tuesday. The AQI is expected to be in the ‘moderate’ category on Wednesday. Subsequently, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ categories over the next five days.While the IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record either the minimum or maximum temperatures on Monday, the IMD’s AWS at the Palam observatory in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 20.1 degrees Celsius. The city’s maximum temperature stood at 31.1 degrees Celsius. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 32 and 16 degrees Celsius respectively on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/strong-winds-help-to-improve-city-s-air-quality-101615227919803.html

The area of the plots will be between 50 and 125 square metres and the area of flats will range between 200 square feet and 400 square feet, the policy stipulates.In the policy document, the principal secretary of TCP has given a special dispensation for the sale of such units to the open category, as it noted that despite repeated efforts, the housing board of Haryana has not received an adequate response from EWS/BPL beneficiaries in the last two years. As per the new mechanism, the policy states that one last and final opportunity will be given to targeted beneficiaries after which the remaining inventory, if any, may be sold to general open category beneficiaries of the Haryana domicile.The policy, which was notified on February 26, further states that in the future, two attempts shall be made by Housing Board, Haryana, to sell the new properties transferred by developers under the EWS category, to the targeted beneficiaries. “Thereafter, these properties may be sold by the boards to general/open category beneficiaries of Haryana domicile. Sale of all such properties shall be by way of an open e-auction widely advertised on print and electronic media,” it stated.The policy also allows housing units to be earmarked for rental housing.As per an estimate of the DTCP, there are around 50,000 plots and units that have been developed under the EWS category in the past three decades. Earlier, these units were allotted by developers themselves but in 2018, the Haryana government decided that EWS units should be transferred by developers to the Haryana Housing Board, which shall allot these plots and flats to the eligible applicants.DTCP officials in Gurugram, meanwhile, said that this policy would help in increasing housing supply and curb illegal colonisation as a number of buyers of smaller units are buying properties in illegal colonies.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that it would be a wise strategy for the housing board to sell these units to general category applicants if there are not enough buyers from the EWS category, as there is a high demand for affordable units. “As the size of these units is smaller, there would be a lot of buyers for such properties in an e-auction. Also, selling them would give more option to buyers who are end-users and have low buying capacity, particularly in Gurugram, where property prices are higher,” he said.Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert said that this policy would increase the availability of such units in cities and attract more interest from all buyers. “The key to the success of this policy is strict monitoring and implementation. This will also boost rental housing for low-income workers, who need such housing, but can’t buy houses in the city,” he said. However, he cautioned that checks and balances must remain effective.Buyers looking for cheaper options and smaller properties, meanwhile, said that it was almost impossible to get an EWS unit without a premium till a few years ago as private developers were engaged in the allotment. “I can recall how hundreds of EWS plots and flats were sold and bought by individuals who were not eligible. The e-auction system would also bring transparency,” said Anup Kumar, a mechanic, who is looking to buy a small unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/unsold-ews-flats-to-be-auctioned-to-general-buyers-101615227919237.html
08-03-2021||Gurugram||Women lead farm protests at Haryana-Rajasthan border||Women farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur-Jaisinghpur Khera on the Haryana-Rajasthan border led the protests on Monday, on the occasion of International Women’s Day. Besides the women who are already camping at the protest site, women from various social organisations also joined them to celebrate the day. Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers celebrated the day with folk songs and dances, while the stage and course of events for the day were helmed by women protesters. “Women from various places, such as Alwar, Sikar, and Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan and Rewari and Mahendragarh in Haryana, were a part of our celebrations. Women play a crucial role in strengthening our protest and through the programmes today, we got a chance to recognise their contributions,” said Madhav. Farmers across the country have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year, for the past few months. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Nirmala Chaudhary, a 26-year-old farmer from Sikar in Rajasthan, who has been camping at the protest site with her family since last December, said that they had been protesting in the harsh winter conditions and will continue to do so in summer, but the government was indifferent to their struggles. “My family, including my grandmother, have been here since December. Despite all the difficulties, we have persisted. The government should understand that our struggle will not end since our livelihoods are at stake,” said Chaudhary. She said that farmers were facing financial losses since they were camping at the borders, but the government was not taking cognizance of their demands. “We have already suffered so much. Farming is suffering, there is no one to take care of the cattle back home, but the government has left us with no choice but to protest,” she said.Sumitra Chopra, a member of All India Democratic Women’s Association, said that women farmers were a crucial pillar of the ongoing movement and it was only through their support that the movement had continued for over 100 days. “Today, on International Women’s Day, we joined ranks with the protesting women farmers to extend our support to the farmers’ agitation. Along with women who have been camping here for months, we celebrated Women’s Day together. The government should see the unity of women and understand that we are united in our struggle against these unfair laws,” said Chopra. She said that the farm laws posed a danger to the lives and livelihoods of farmers across the country. “The manner in which the government has ignored the interests of farmers shows that democracy in the country is under threat. We appeal to the Prime Minister to roll back these laws or else, the agitation will be intensified further. Women farmers will struggle in tandem with men, but there is no question of giving up,” said Chopra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/women-lead-farm-protests-at-haryana-rajasthan-border-101615227918659.html
08-03-2021||Gurugram||Anganwadi worker felicitated by CM for her Covid relief work||For the last 10 years, Poonam Ghatwal has been working as an anganwadi worker at Aklimpur village of the Badshahpur block in the city. But last year was unlike any other for her. While people were confined to their homes due to the Covid-19 pandemic and maintaining strict social distancing, 34-year-old Ghatwal spent her days reaching out to women and children in shelter homes and slums, guiding them on how to protect themselves against the infection. Ghatwal distributed sanitary napkins to women and girls in slums and dry ration to families, who had no source of income due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Ghatwal’s earnest effort made her win state-level recognition from chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday at the International Women’s Day celebration in Panchkula. “It was an unusual year due to Covid-19. It was especially challenging for women and children living in shelter homes or in slums. Like others, they too were unaware of the disease and had to be protected against the infection,” said Ghatwal in a telephonic conversation with HT on Monday.“The challenging part was explaining these families about the new disease during the house visits,” she said. “They had questions regarding the need to wear a mask or had apprehensions about the fact that they did not have enough space to maintain social distance. So, we used to tell them about symptoms of the infection and the consequences they might face due to illness.” This basic understanding of Covid-19 management helped her in counselling people, especially reaching out to women. “Women required extra help during the lockdown. Many women and girls could afford to buy sanitary napkins even before Covid-19. But due to lockdown they had no access to feminine hygiene products altogether as they could not move out. It was our task to reach out to women in rural areas and guide them regarding the precautionary norms to be followed,” said Ghatwal, who also distributed masks and dry rations in slums of Badshahpur. “During the afternoon hours, our team used to conduct home visits and distribute dry ration packets to children and families who could not afford food due to the lockdown,” she said. Her constant efforts in reaching out to people helped her clear a state-level exam — one of the steps required to apply for the award. She made her way by appearing for a block-level exam last year by the department of women and child development to test the knowledge and skills of anganwadi workers “The question paper comprised questions related to Covid-19 management at the rural level and various government schemes. After clearing the block-level examination, I appeared for district level exams, where I stood first. Thereafter, I took the state-level exam and bagged the first position,” said Ghatwal. According to her, she has been the first anganwadi worker to win an award for Gurugram.The award consisted of a certificate and a cash prize of ₹21,000. Across the state, 29 women were felicitated, including Harshita Goyal and Santosh Rathod — two women entrepreneurs from Gurugram. Four students from Gurugram were also awarded by the women and child development department at the state level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/anganwadi-worker-felicitated-by-cm-for-her-covid-relief-work-101615227917923.html

Taking note of the sluggish pace, health department officials said they have chalked out measures to increase coverage.According to official figures, the district covered 6,749 beneficiaries out of its target of 93,480 under senior citizen category from March 1 to March 7, which was seen through at 31 private hospitals and 25 government healthcare facilities. According to directions by the state government, private hospitals are to administer the shots for a minimum of four days in a week while government healthcare facilities are to do the same three days per week, barring the district hospital, which undertakes the drive six days a week.“Given the slowness in the vaccination process, we are trying to increase participation of private hospitals and have communicated to them to increase the daily vaccination coverage, as well as procure more stock. At government healthcare facilities, we have a total of 42 teams deployed while eight more will be roped in soon,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.Going by the state government’s directions, the district was to vaccinate about 3,000 beneficiaries per day this month. The average of 965 beneficiaries vaccinated per day in March so far in Ghaziabad pales in comparison.“We have now planned that the private sector will ensure coverage of about 50,000 beneficiaries while the government sector will cater to about 40,000 of the monthly target in the district,” Dr Gupta added.However, officials said that private hospitals could procure only about 10,000 doses in the first week of March. As per government rules, private hospitals can charge a maximum of ₹250 for the shots while vaccination at government centres is free.In the private sector, the vaccine is administered through hospitals empanelled under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PMJAY) and hospitals empanelled under the health insurance scheme(s) of the state government.“To augment the engagement of the private sector, we have written to the UP government seeking special permission to rope in four more private hospitals which are not covered under the two categories of empanelled hospitals. Once these hospitals begin administering the jabs, we will have better vaccination coverage which can help meet the target,” Dr Vishram Singh, district immunisation officer, said adding that consent for administering the doses has been received from 35 private hospitals in Ghaziabad so far of which 31 have been allowed. The vaccination drive is almost over for healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) who received their first doses and are now in the process of getting a second dose. According to official records, till March 7, a total of 19,269 out of the listed 25,003 HCWs have received their first dose while 14,480 out of these have taken their second dose as well. For the FLW category, a total of 10,592 out of the listed 18,897 have been given their jab and 747 out of these have been given their second dose so far, while more are expected to take it in coming rounds. The Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association said the city still lags behind in terms of awareness.“People are still apprehensive of getting themselves vaccinated, besides the fact that the staff of some of the government departments did not take the jab. Just like the health department created awareness about wearing masks, adherence of social distancing, etc., during the initial months of the pandemic, they must now go to the ground level to spread awareness about the vaccines,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of IMA – Ghaziabad. “Private hospitals are trying their best to increase coverage and the IMA is ready to help,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/in-ghaziabad-officials-chalk-out-measures-to-achieve-monthly-vaccination-target-101615226717877.html

GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh said the commissionerate system has started a parallel vertical for women safety headed by DCP Vrinda Shukla. “DCP Shukla and her team created a strong vertical and have raised awareness. We also adopted western methods for solving crimes. We also launched a strict enforcement and pursued the case in the court, which resulted in these case convictions,” Singh said. Police said 56 cases resulted in conviction in three months. These are rape and sexual harassment cases, and several under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.The police team, through Mission Shakti and Swayam Siddha team, conducted enforcement drives and also arrested over 6,000 people in three months for drinking in public places, Singh added.He said the Gautam Budh Nagar has been selected as a safe city project and 1,500 CCTV cameras will be installed soon. “A data centre will be developed, which will analyse the footage and help in ensuring enforcement,” he said, adding that police are “trying to make Gautam Budh Nagar an international city in true sense”. “There is an immense investment opportunity due to the development of Noida International Airport in Jewar. We have discussed this issue with the Yamuna authority which has planned to set up two women police stations near the airport along the Yamuna Expressway. These initiatives will further empower women, and ensure their safety,” Singh added. District government counsel (DGC Criminal) Brahmjeet Bhati said the coordination between police, administration and legal department has increased in the commissionerate system, which leads cases to conviction. “Police are investigating the cases in a time bound manner, and also collecting evidence and interrogating witnesses. This plays an important role in the convictions,” Bhati said.The Noida police has also selected three candidates for their suggestions in improving women’s safety in the city. Deputy commissioner of police (women safety) Vrinda Shukla said Meena Yadav, Suraj Kapoor and Nidhi Telang were the top three winners. They won ₹5000, ₹3000 and ₹2000 cash prizes.“Yadav will be made assistant commissioner of police (ACP) for a day in the coming week,” Shukla said.

08-03-2021||Noida||On women’s day, ‘inquilabi mehndi’ steals the show at farmers’ protest in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Bindu Ammini, a Dalit rights and women’s rights activist from Kerala, was part of a group who sat on a 24-hour relay fast at the UP Gate on Monday, when women took over the reins of the farmers’ protest to mark the International Women’s Day.Hundreds of farmers, women as well as men, have been camping at the UP Gate since November 26 last year demanding complete rollback of the three central farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.“We all are one in the fight against the three farm laws. On women’s day, it is our message not to underestimate women. We have broken caste-related, religious and linguistic barriers to come together to fight for the cause. It is a crucial issue which needs to be resolved,” Ammini said, adding that she wants the country to be rid of any gender bias.She was joined in the relay fast by women from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Haryana at the dais at the UP Gate site, which was managed by women farmer protesters on Monday.The women also applied “inquilabi mehndi” (henna of revolution) to their palms.“This is inquilabi mehndi. This gives out a message that women use mehndi not only to enhance beauty but to bring about revolutions as well. The Prime Minister wished women on women’s day, but they are not listening to us who have been on the road for the past three months,” said Babli Singh, a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) from Hapur, who said she has stayed put at UP Gate since day one of the agitation. She added that camping at open borders around Delhi is tough considering that women face issues of proper toilets, bathing areas and sleeping in roadside tents.Women at UP Gate wrote slogans such as “inquilab zindabad” (long live the revolution) and “kisan ekta zindabad” (long live farmers’ unity), over their palms with henna and started with the activities since early in the day. “On Monday, 18 women observed the 24-hour long relay fast and also applied mehandi on their hands. On this occasion, we have also come up with a ‘women’s point’ where women can engage in creative activities, reading, discussions and exercises,” said Ravneet Kaur, the coordinator of the event at UP Gate. “They told us to go back home. But they won’t be seen doing so when it comes to voting. With active participation from women, this agitation will continue till our demands are met,” she added. Apart from those from neighbouring states, women from far off villages and states such as West Bengal and Maharashtra were also part of the events at UP Gate. Men, meanwhile, prepared gulab jamuns and served it to their women counterparts, who gave speeches from the dais and recited poems. “I think it is time that the Prime Minister comes forward and intervenes, so that a decision is arrived at. Instead of sending ministers time and again during talks, the PM should have come forward himself and the issues would have been decided by now. But we feel that the government sides with the corporates and does not listen to our issues,” said Surinder Kaur, from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. Seventy-year-old Kala Bai arrived from Satara in Maharashtra dressed in traditional saree. She said that she had come along with her son but decided to stay back after he left.“I farm my fields back home and we have output of 10 quintals, while my sons have their private jobs. There is also an agitation going on in Satara district and when I heard about Delhi, I decided to come here. I was very much impressed by the active participation of women farmers here,” she added. Krishna Adhikari, who is from Nadia in West Bengal and lives in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit was also part of the women’s group at UP Gate. “Farmers in West Bengal know about the agitation going on at the borders of Delhi but there is hectic political activity in the state due to the upcoming elections. However, the agitation will soon spread in states like Bihar and West Bengal and women will also be at the forefront. We have been fighting the patriarchal setup for long and we have shown that we can also fight to take this farmers’ agitation forward,” said Adhikari, who is also the UP president of Akhil Bharatiya Pragatisheel Mahila Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/on-women-s-day-inquilabi-mehndi-steals-the-show-at-farmers-protest-in-ghaziabad-101615226418384.html
08-03-2021||Noida||Women’s Day: GB Nagar admin makes three vaccination booths for women||NOIDA: To celebrate the International Women’s Day, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Monday made three exclusive vaccination booths for the women beneficiaries in the district. Only female staff were deployed at these booths at the district hospital, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and primary health centre in Jewar, officials said. District magistrate Suhas LY said that to prioritise women for the vaccination drive against Covid-19, the district health department reserved these booths for them. “Women over 60 years and those above 45 with comorbidities were administered the vaccine.

District vaccination officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that as many as 251 women beneficiaries were inoculated at the three booths. Health officials said that a total of 4,132 senior citizens and comorbid 45-plus beneficiaries were vaccinated at different booths in 16 government and 26 private facilities on Monday. “Apart from it, 743 health-care workers and 1,475 front-line workers also took their second dose on Monday,” Tyagi said.In GIMS, various programmes, including poster and slogan competition, cancer health camp and self-defence training, were held on the occasion of the women’s day. GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said that the medical college has made all efforts to make the environment safe and friendly for female staff and students. Even the private hospitals had made pink vaccination booths dedicated to women. At Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, a booth was specially constructed to honour the women who came to get the vaccine. Ajit Kumar, joint registrar of the hospital, said that employees and doctors of the hospital were asked to come in pink clothes. “A total of 269 people were vaccinated on Monday at the Sharda Hospital. While 214 were given the first dose, the remaining 55 received their second dose of vaccine,” he said. A pink booth – exclusively for women – was also made in Fortis Hospital Noida. “Altogether 230 persons were vaccinated in the hospital on Monday, of which 82 women got their jabs at the pink vaccination booth,” said the hospital’s PRO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/womens-day-gb-nagar-admin-makes-three-vaccination-booths-for-women-101615226417766.html
08-03-2021||Noida||Air quality improves, minimum temperature rises in Noida||Noida: The air quality of Noida on Monday improved to ‘moderate’ levels as the wind directions changed from north-westerly to easterly, said weather analysts.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the wind speed slightly picked up on Monday, it’s the direction that mattered. “Noida received easterly winds against north-westerly on Monday. The north-westerly winds bring along with them the vented pollutants from Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, due to which Noida is often at the receiving end. However, this is not the case with easterly winds. This is the reason that the air quality improved for Noida,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday was 192 against 278 (poor) a day earlier. Similarly, air quality of Greater Noida and Ghaziabad also improved on Monday. While AQI of Greater Noida was 196 against 270 a day earlier, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 230 against 329 on Sunday. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. On Monday, the minimum temperature for Noida soared by 3 degrees Celsius (°C) against 4°C at Safadarjung observatory considered average for NCR, as per IMD.The maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida were recorded at 30.8°C and 19.5°C respectively, against 33.3 and 16.3°C on Sunday. The minimum and maximum temperatures at Safdarjung observatory were recorded at 18.9°C (five degrees above the season’s average) and 32.2°C (three degrees above the season’s average). “The maximum temperatures will remain above average, but there will not be any steep rise till March 13 due to another western disturbance. Thereafter, the maximum temperature for Noida may rise to 35 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava added.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may deteriorate over the next 24 hours due to poor wind speed.“Surface winds are east-northeasterly and moderate. Lower-level winds are likely to be easterly-northeasterly for the next three days. A marginal decrease in surface winds is forecasted for the next 24 hours. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate but in the higher end of the moderate to poor category for the next two days. An increase in dust concentration is likely in the coming days,” said a SAFAR statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/air-quality-improves-minimum-temperature-rises-in-noida-101615226298418.html

The project will be funded in debt:equity ratio of 65:35 with ₹3,724 crore to be raised through debt, and ₹2,006 crore as equity, the company said.The Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL), the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project, will get over 1,334 hectares of land to commence the construction work in Jewar by June this year. It is estimated that 44% of the estimated cost will be spent on establishing the terminal.Officials of the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the nodal agency for the project, said the stable rating assigned to the term loan of the concessionaire shows that the project’s debt structure is suitable and financially sustainable for all investors and stakeholders. “The ratings indicate that the Noida International Airport is economically feasible. It also reiterated the fact that the state government is committed to support the project, and make it sustainable and the best infrastructure,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, NIAL.The Swiss firm will provide 40% of its share upfront — that is little over ₹800 crore. Once all the conditions of the project are fulfilled, YIAPL will get three years to flag off the first commercial flight from the airport.Last week, NIAL and the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration started the process of rehabilitating families affected due to the project. It is likely that the land will be handed over to the YIAPL in three to four months, the officials said.While evaluating the YIAPL’s proposal, the rating agency was of the view that the “hybrid till approach” shall augur well for the company. Only up to 30% of the non-aeronautical revenues (parking, rentals, food and beverages, among others) can be used to cross-subsidise aeronautical charges under the hybrid till approach, which was introduced in the aviation sector in India in 2016, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-airport-phase-i-to-cost-5-730-nial-calls-it-economically-feasible-101615226297775.html
08-03-2021||Noida||Residents complain of poor water quality in Noida||NOIDA: Residents of several areas in the city have complained about the poor quality of drinking water being supplied to households. They also complained of low water pressure and said that the Noida authority should look into the issues related to drinking water.The situation is worse in urban villages such as Barola, Nagli Wazidpur, Sorkha and Harola, said the residents.“We face issues of poor quality of water and also of low pressure. The Noida authority provides only groundwater in our village. We have to buy bottled drinking water as the authority has failed to supply Ganga water to the village,” said Deepa Chauhan, a housewife from Nagli Wazidpur.Similarly, residents of a high-rise in sector 74 have flagged concerns of poor water quality in the past one week, while that of sector 45 highlighted the low pressure problem on Monday morning.“The groundwater is hard in most of the sectors and it tastes salty. We have demanded that the authority should supply Ganga water for drinking purposes in all sectors. In some sectors, the authority supplies groundwater mixed with some Ganga water which is not enough to make it sweet. We have been demanding for 100% Ganga water for a long time,” said PS Jain, president of Confederation of NCR Residents Welfare Associations (Conrwa), an umbrella body of RWAs.Noida authority officials said that multiple issues have resulted in inconvenience to the residents. “I will get the all complaints addressed properly. There are issues of hardness, but we are addressing these issues properly. We are mixing Ganga water with groundwater to supply good quality drinking water. In villages like Nagli Wazidpur, we will start supplying Ganga water once our pipeline laying work is finished,” said RP Singh, deputy general manager of water works department.Singh also said that over the past one month, supply of Ganga water was disrupted since a new network was being laid down along the Delhi-Meerut Expressway in Ghaziabad.In Noida, only 40% residential areas get supply of Ganga water, according to official records. Sectors 128, 129, 130, 132, 133, 134, 135, 150 and 151, among others, depend only on groundwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-complain-of-poor-water-quality-in-noida-101615226237854.html
08-03-2021||Noida||Noida entrepreneurs raise objections as discom serves advance electricity bills||NOIDA: To meet its revenue target for the current fiscal, the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), has served electricity bills in advance for the month of March to nearly 10,000 entrepreneurs in the district who have commercial or industrial power connections. The discom has also made it clear that in case of non-payment, connections will be snapped.Usually, the discom issues the monthly bills after the end of the month, on the basis of units consumed. So for instance, for power consumed during February, the bill would be sent in the first few days of March, and the last date would be the last date of March. This time, however, the bill has been sent for February as well as for March, and the last date of payment is March 31, 2021.Kulmani Gupta, president of the Noida chapter of Indian Industries Association (IIA), alleged that the power supply company has been “targeting” Noida entrepreneurs since long. “Does the responsibility of the discom meeting its fiscal target rest with entrepreneurs? On one hand, businessmen struggle to file their taxes to save themselves from being blacklisted by the government while on the other, power companies target them in order to catch up with their revenue targets. We’ve raised this issue with the government to save Noida entrepreneurs, who have already suffered huge losses due to the lockdown,” he said.He added that how the advance bill has been calculated is beyond him as it is more than the monthly bill usually raked by a respective enterprise per month.“Even their calculation method for advance bills is not uniform. For the advance bill for the month of March, they have added a little more than the amount of bill for February,” Gupta said.Officials, meanwhile, maintained that serving advance electricity bills to entrepreneurs is not a new phenomenon. “We have been sending advance electricity bills in the month of March every year to these (commercial) consumers since the past five years. Advance bills were issued even in March 2020, but the discom withdrew it due to lockdown last year,” Virendra Nath Singh, the PVVNL’s (Noida division) chief engineer, said.The PVVNL has over 2.5 lakh domestic and nearly 50,000 commercial/ industrial consumers.He further said that since the PVVNL has to meet the stipulated target of collecting revenue of ₹400 crore, it has issued advance bills to nearly 10,000 commercial consumers. “The advance bill given to them varies between ₹5,000 and ₹5 lakh, which is not very whopping or unusual, considering their monthly consumption. Also, we have made clear that all advance amounts paid will be compensated in the electricity bills of April 2021,” the chief engineer said, adding that no advance bill has been issued to any domestic consumer in the district.When contacted, state energy minister Shrikant Sharma confirmed that the matter has come to his knowledge. “I’ll look into it and after discussion with officials, an amicable solution to this problem will be given by the government,” he said.Surendra Nahata, the chairman of the Noida Micro, Small and Medium Entrepreneurs’ Association (MSMEA), said that the discom issues such advance bills every year, with the warning of disconnection. “However, officials finally make it optional. The disconnection drive has never taken place over non-payment of advance bills. This year, too, it is not going to happen as the matter has been brought to the notice of the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-entrepreneurs-raise-objections-as-discom-serves-advance-electricity-bills-101615226177770.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Leader of opposition slams govt over financial mismanagement||Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, while initiating a debate on the state’s budget for the year 2020-21, slammed the government for financial mismanagement. Agnihotri said that the state’s 2021-22 budget presented in the state assembly by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur indicated the bankruptcy of the state government. He said all important issues had disappeared from the budget and there was no mention of where gap funding will be from. The Congress leader alleged that on one hand the government cited the high traditions of the House and on the other hid everything from the house. He said that there was neither a mention of the debts on the state in the budget nor a provision for money to implement the recommendations of the pay commission for employees.Agnihotri said the budget was full of flights of imagination. “A debt of ₹61,567 crore has been incurred by the state and by the end of this year it is expected to mount to ₹70,000 crore. By the time the term of current regime will be over, the state would be under an estimated debt of ₹85,000 crore. The contribution of the Jai Ram Thakur-led government to the debts will be ₹35,000 crore,” said Agnihotri. The leader of Opposition said there was no mention of generating resources and income in the budget. “Where did the money go when nothing was spent last year due to the pandemic. As per the economic survey, the state has gone into negative growth,” he said. The government’s budget is based on borrowings, he said, adding that most of the 1.25 lakh employees of the state had been depressed due to the budget. “Neither the contract period was reduced for employees nor any provision made for a new pay scale,” Agnihotri said. He also accused the state government of discriminating with daughters. The Shagun scheme discriminates against girls on the basis of caste. The scheme should be extended to the girls of all categories. The Congress leader termed the 30,000jobs announced in the budget as the biggest scam in the future of the state and asked the saffron party to remember the fate of former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/leader-of-opposition-slams-govt-over-financial-mismanagement-101615225878367.html

The state government and the ministry have been given six weeks to submit a detailed report, it said.The statement said that the media report highlighted the case study of a 62-year-old small farmer, with a meagre income, who had to borrow more than ₹10,000 from relatives to pay his hospital bills when his leg was fractured in Ukamar village in Latehar district in July last year.But for five months after his fracture, he did not receive any pension money of ₹1,000 per month, as per his entitlement under a central government scheme for senior citizens, it added.Reportedly, all the eligible persons are not being paid pension despite protest by people for long. There is a huge gap of about 64 per cent between the beneficiaries on the rolls, and the ones who are actually getting the pension under different categories, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/nhrc-notices-to-jharkhand-govt-ministry-of-social-justice-over-delay-of-pension-101615222214643.html
08-03-2021||Dehradun||Amid speculations of change in leadership, Uttarakhand CM leaves for Delhi||Amid the speculations related to change in the leadership of the Uttarakhand government following a sudden core committee meeting of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, the political temperature in the state again soared high after chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat left for Delhi to meet the party's central leadership on Monday morning.Rawat had to attend a few programmes on Monday on the occasion of Women's Day, including one in the summer capital of Gairsain but they had to be cancelled due to his Delhi visit. In the national capital, the CM is expected to meet national BJP president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.BJP leaders said that the CM left for Delhi with a few party MLAs loyal to him and would apprise the central leadership of the political situation in the state. They refrained from commenting whether he would be replaced although speculation was rife in the state capital about his possible replacement in the next few days.Also read: India's first forest healing centre inaugurated in Uttrakand's RanikhetEarlier on Saturday, after the sudden core committee meeting presided by state unit observers including former Chhattisgarh CM Raman Singh and state unit in-charge Dushyant Kumar Gautam, party state president Bansidhar Bhagat tried to douse the speculations of leadership change by saying that the meeting was to discuss the events for the completion of four years of BJP government ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. However, after Monday's development, the buzz around changing the CM again gained momentum.According to a senior party official who didn't wish to be named, "the CM left for Delhi in the morning at around 11.30 where he would meet party national president JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah. He is accompanied by a Cabinet minister and a party MLA who are considered to be his close aides."He said, "His visit is significant considering the fact that the central leadership is likely to decide on the change of the CM in the next few days. The two observers who chaired the meeting had submitted the report to the national leadership who will now take the decision."However, amid the speculations, the CM, while talking to media before leaving for Delhi, said all the buzz has been created by the media."It has all been created by media. I am going to Delhi to meet the central leadership after getting their time for the same," said Rawat.Meanwhile, with sudden developments in the BJP state unit, most of the party leaders are tight-lipped, refraining to speak on the issue.However, a senior party office-bearer in the state said, "There are chances that the CM may be changed in the next few days with former CM and present Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj among the front runners for the position."On Saturday's core group meeting, Nishank had also come down to Dehradun where he met Raman Singh at the capital's Jolly Grant airport."Nishank's close aides have started saying that he is soon going to be the chief minister. Meanwhile, Maharaj is also believed to be vying for the chief ministership for which he had met several national leaders in the past few months as his equations with CM Rawat are not good, a fact which is known to all," said the leader.He added, "Even if the two aforesaid leaders are the frontrunners, the party is in a fix because to balance the caste equation in the state leadership. The state president Bansidhar Bhagat is a Brahmin and CM Rawat is a Rajput. Hence, a new CM would also have to be a Rajput because both party state president and CM cannot be Brahmins."With the "All is not well" situation in the state BJP, there are also reports that the CM could try to douse the fire by making the appointments on the three vacant ministerial positions in the state government by accomodating senior party MLA Vishan Singh Chufal who reportedly wrote a letter to the national leadership along with 13 other party MLAs demanding the CM to be removed citing their unhappiness with "CM's style of working.""It is possible that to control the damage, CM Rawat could make the appointments by accomodating Chufal and another MLA from Kumaon region Balwant Singh Bhauriyal. The remaining one position could be filled by Vikasnagar MLA and CM's close aide Munna Singh Chauhan," said a party leader privy to the developments.Meanwhile, the Opposition Congress attacked the BJP for creating a political uncertainty in the state in "hunger for power among its leaders."Former chief minister and Congress national general secretary Harish Rawat said, "What is happening in the BJP right now is a deplorable game of power for which they are ready to push the state in a state of crisis leaving the people to suffer."Rawat said, "BJP is reaping what it sowed during my previous government in which it took away three senior leaders from Congress by wrongful means and made them ministers in their current government. Now that move is biting them back."The BJP, however, denied the speculations about any leadership change even on Monday with party state president Bhagat saying, "CM Rawat would discuss the events on March 18 to mark the completion of four years of this government and the election strategy for upcoming state assembly elections to be held in 2022."If CM Rawat is replaced, he would join the league of former chief ministers in the previous governments in the state who failed to complete their full tenure of five years except for the first CM of the state ND Tiwari in then Congress government who succeeded in completing the full term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/amid-speculations-of-change-in-leadership-uttarakhand-cm-leaves-for-delhi-101615221653574.html

08-03-2021||Pune||Survey: 69 per cent of students not satisfied with online lectures, demand reduction in syllabus||A total of 69 per cent of students are not satisfied with online lectures, according to a study conducted by a mathematics teacher in Mumbai. The students will be appearing for their class 10 and class 12 board exams this year through the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE).Dineshkumar Gupta, a maths teacher from Mumbai included 1,58,601 students from all 36 districts of Maharashtra in his survey.The students responded to the survey from March 4 to March 7, earlier this month.The study revealed that only eight per cent of students were satisfied with online learning. Only 11 per cent of students admitted that 100 per cent of the syllabus was taught to them in this academic year whereas 14 per cent of students admitted that only 50 per cent of the syllabus has been taught to them.A total of 20 per cent of students said that they have prepared 50 per cent of the syllabus all by themselves.Gupta who conducted the survey said, for rural students, the lockdown ended in November.“Online education was underway but many-faced problems like availability of smartphones, network. Many students faced a multitude of issues that have caused them distress,” said Gupta.Gupta also shared that it is possible to reduce the syllabus more, however, the board denied it.“There is a possibility of reduction of the syllabus for classes. The reduced syllabus is not completely 25 per cent. If we look at the CBSE, the reduction of the syllabus was uniform and so Maharashtra can also do that,” said Gupta.Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE said that the board cannot publish a list of possible questions for the examination.“The board cannot publish the questions and the syllabus will not be reduced for students. Also, taking the online examination for all students is not feasible. The numbers of students appearing for the board exam are around 30 lakh. The online examination at this scale is not possible to be conducted,” said Patil.Gupta added that many students have considered taking a drop due to the current scenario.“The data reveals that 33 per cent of students said yes and 44 per cent said no to dropping out. In such a situation, the authorities should take a quick stand to resolve the issue faced by students,” said Gupta.The survey highlights that 61 per cent students want an online examination, however, the board is not in a position to hold an online exam for 30 lakh students.Only 19 per cent of students want an offline examination to be conducted and 84 per cent of students have agreed that their syllabus should be further reduced.A total of 74 per cent of students have agreed that the exam pattern should be changed keeping the current situation in mind. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide parents’ association said that many students want online examinations or a pattern that includes online as well as offline examination for evaluation.“Class 10 and Class 12 are both important years for students. In such a case, students are not satisfied with online teaching. Many students have told us that they want online as well as offline examination to ensure that there is some balance. Moreover, many have requested a question bank and demanded that there should be a leave between two exam papers. A lot of students do not want practical exams. Instead, they are willing to do an assignment which can be evaluated instead of practical exams as they have not practised any practical this time,” said Sahai. In such a scenario, Sahai added that students are distressed and unsure about the exams which are scheduled in less then a month now.The Survey resultsAre you satisfied with online lectures?Fully Satisfied: 8%Partially satisfied: 1%Not satisfied: 69%Can’t decide: 22%Which mode of examination would you prefer?Online: 61%Offline: 19%Any: 20%Do you agree more syllabus should be reduced?Yes: 84%No: 7%May be: 9%Do you think the exam pattern be changed with the current situation in mind?Yes:79%No:10% Maybe: 12%Due to the current scenario, are you willing to take a drop?Yes:33No:44Maybe: 23If the exams are offline, do you have a mode of transport available?Yes: 27%No:53%Maybe:20%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/survey-69-per-cent-of-students-not-satisfied-with-online-lectures-demand-reduction-in-syllabus-101615220417508.html

Patil, a resident of Nashik was under the guidance of Ruturaj Agawane, director of Bucketlist adventure and also received support from Rohan More, an international swimmer. Patil completed this landmark milestone on March 1 and before achieving the feat, she trekked Kalsubai with her family. It was decided to try and achieve the seven forts after the enthusiasm and stamina she displayed while trekking Kalsubai. “I was enjoying myself while climbing all forts. I felt a little tired after climbing three forts on a trot but I took some rest in the afternoon which boosted my confidence and I finished the milestone,” said Patil who also is a student of Karate. The climbing was started from Tikona fort in Maval, taluka at 5.30 am in the morning followed by Tung, Korigad, Lohegad, Visapur, Manaranjan and Shrivardhan. “After the third fort, we had a doubt whether she would be able to continue but after taking a two-hour rest, Toshika was ready to climb forts again,” said Dr Apeksha Patil, Toshika’s mother. Agawane who is an experienced climber made sure that Patil does not face fatigue and gets adequate rest between forts. “All the four of us were travelling in a car which allowed her to take rest in between. Physically Patil is strong and she is more matured than eight-year-olds are and that makes the difference. She even enjoyed climbing during the night,” added Agawane. Since the age of three, Patil enjoyed going uphill at temples and her parents never carried her on their shoulders. “Even when she was small, she used to walk on the steps of Jejuri temple. In the morning she does yoga, and she also loves to do cycling,” added Tushar Patil, Toshika’s father. Agawane added, “We will be active in climbing of forts. In the future, we will plan to take her on a big trek to see how she responds. If she continues to show her interest, then she could be a good mountaineer in the future.” Umesh Zirpe, president, Akhil Maharashtra Giryarohan Mahasangh (AMGM) “It is a good achievement and now I suggest that she takes professional training in mountaineering and move step by step ahead into the world of adventurous sports.” Box Forts conquered by Toshika Fort; Height; Timings; Total hours Tikona; 3,500 feet; 5:30am to 6.38am; 1hr 8minutes Tung; 3,527 feet; 8am to 9:35am; 1 hr 35 minutes Korigad; 3,028 feet; 11.15 am to 12.33pm; 1 hr 18 minutes Lohegad; 3389 feet; 2.33 pm to 3.29 pm; 56 minutes Visapur; 3,553 feet; 3.48 pm to 5.15 pm; 1hr 27 minutes Manaranjan; 2700 feet; 7.15 pm to 8.07pm; 52 minutes Shrivardhan; 3000 feet; 8.07pm to 8.59pm; 52 minutes *Of the 15 hours and 30 minutes Toshika was climbing for 7 hours and 44 minutes while the remaining time was spent reaching the destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/born-to-climb-eight-year-old-toshika-treks-seven-forts-in-15-hours-30-minutes-101615220297478.html

08-03-2021||Pune||State govt fails to act on Dange committee report on fee restructuring||After a conflict ensued between students, parents and the school and college administration over the payment of fees last year, the state government appointed the J P Dange committee to restructure the fees. It was an attempt to review the existing fee structure of colleges in the state, however, the recommendations have not been considered by the state government. The committee submitted its report last year in September, as students were demanding to reduce gymkhana, library, canteen and other expenses from the fees. The recommendations by the committee have neither been considered nor made public. Student organisations are now demanding to immediately take action on it as a large number of students are not taking admission for this academic year due to high fees. “As schools and colleges are closed for the last year, various infrastructural things like the library, laboratory, gymkhana, canteen and many other things are not being used by students. However, most colleges have not waived off these fees. Students from rural parts of the state are already suffering financially and on top of that paying such high fees is not possible for them. So, we were repeatedly demanding to review the fee structure, and accordingly, this committee was formed, they submitted their report in September last year and still, nothing has been done,” said Amar Ekad, president of Cops students’ organisation, Maharashtra. According to Ekad, there are a large number of students who are not taking admission for their desired course just because of the high fees. “The committee report should be made public, and we have the right to know what recommendations have been given, and why the implementation is delayed. We are continuously following up on this issue and until students get justice from the hiked fees we will not stop our fight,” he added. Kedar Jamane, a student said, “I wanted to take admission for MBA in finance this year, but when I approached the desired college, the fees were too high. I cannot afford the fees and lectures will be online until the government allows offline lectures. So why should we pay more fees for college infrastructure if we are not going to use it? At least for this year, there should be some concession given to students over fees.” Dhanraj Mane, director of state higher education department said, “We have not yet received any directives about it, once we get any order it will be worked upon accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-govt-fails-to-act-on-dange-committee-report-on-fee-restructuring-101615220237457.html

The total project cost of this road is ₹26,000 crore and will be constructed by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). A total of 1,822 hector land is required for this project. The MSRDC had already floated the request for proposal for selection of the consultant for providing assistance in land acquisition proceedings and related activities for the construction of the ring road. Pawar said in his budget speech, “A large number of passengers and goods are transported from other parts of the state as well as from the Konkan, Marathwada and North Maharashtra via Pune. This puts a huge strain on the traffic of Pune city. To avoid this, it is necessary to undertake the construction of the ring road around Pune in order to save fuel and time. For this, the work of the Pune ring route will be taken on an eight-lane circular road with an estimated cost of ₹26,000 crore. The total construction will be around 170 km and the land acquisition work will be undertaken this year.” MSRDC stated, “The Pune ring road is a proposed circular outer road for the Pune Metropolitan region, the decision was taken on June 2007. In the earlier stage, the proposed ring road was widening of the existing outer ring road but later it is modified and decided to align away from the city considering future growth and development of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).MSRDC proposes development in two packagesPackage 1: 90 kilometres starting from Khed Shivapur on NH4, popularly known as Satara road and culminating at Urse on Mumbai-Pune Expressway via Bhivari (Pune Baramati Road), Wadki (Saswad Road), Theur (Solapur Road), Lonikand (Ahmedngar Road), Kuruli (Nashik Road) and Talegaon (Old Mumbai Pune Road)Package 2: 85 kilometresKhed Shivapur (Satara Road), and culminating at Urse on Mumbai Pune expressway via Malkhed (Pune Panshet Road), Muttha Village (Pune- Lavasa Road), Ghotavade Phata (Paud Road).BOX 2Details of land acquisition(Eastern Part- Phase 1)Taluka/ villages affected/ area in HectorsMaval/9/171.71Khed/10/298.53Haveli/15/291.40Bhor/5/141.48Purandar/7/165Western Part - Phase 2Bhor/5/108.10Haveli/9/239.96Mulshi/14/272.41Maval/6/133.45Total 80 villages will be affected, and land required is at 1,822.24 hector||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-approves-land-acquisition-for-msrdc-s-pune-ring-project-101615220057465.html

08-03-2021||Patna||Bihar CM loses cool in council, asks RJD leader to 'follow rules'||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday lost his cool in the legislative council during the question hour and advised Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) member Subodh Kumar to follow the rules while he asked for supplementary.The incident took place when Kumar posed a supplementary to the rural works department's Jayant Raj over a starred question of the fellow party member Mohammad Farooq, who sought to know as to how long the department would take to improve the condition of Katsari (Sheohar)-Parsauni (East Champaran) road. Farooq alleged that the condition of the road, along with others in the area, had been deplorable for the past three months.The chief minister stood up on the chair barely after Subodh Kumar sought to pose a supplementary and said that the minister had replied in agreement, and apparently asked the RJD members to hear the reply and then put up the supplementary.However, Subodh Kumar refused to sit and contested that the ministers usually take many supplementary questions together and reply. “This has been the usual convention and more supplementary questions are posed by the treasury members,” the RJD member contented.Also read: Women take centre stage in Bihar Assembly, seek higher representation“You (Subodh Kumar) should know the norms. You sit down...” said the CM, asking RJD's senior Ram Chandra Pubey, who was sitting by the side of Subodh Kumar, to apprise him about the rule.Working chairman of the council Awadhesh Narayan Singh also requested Subodh Kumar to stay quiet and sit down but refused to oblige him and kept on arguing with the CM.The CM said that it was not the way to behave. “Would you keep arguing when I am speaking? You don’t listen,” said the CM, adding that the rulebook states that those who put up the original question are allowed to ask the supplementary question first. “You (Subodh) are allowed to ask once the minister replied to the supplementary to the main questioner. I don’t have any objection to anybody but I stand up to remind the rule when it’s observed in the breach,” said the CM.The chair, however, intervened and normalized the charged atmosphere in the House.In November last year, CM Kumar burst out in anger in the assembly when opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav had alleged that the former was involved in a murder case and a case of plagiarism was lodged against him by a JNU student. Taking all those present in the House by surprise, Kumar was seen standing up and screaming “jhooth bol raha hai yeh (Tejashwi is lying)”.The working chairman, when contacted in his chamber, refused to comment about the rules, saying that he did not comment on issues about the House.Talking to media persons later, Subodh Kumar said that the CM had reached the age where he should take retirement. “The CM gets inconvenient when the RJD members question the conduct of his ministers and ask for his clarification,” said the RJD member.Congress member Prem Chandra Mishra said the way the CM is losing his cool does not suit his image and the dignity of the post he holds. “Everyone in the House is empowered to question the government and every member has his self-respect. The CM’s conduct in the House appeared odd,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-loses-cool-in-council-asks-rjd-leader-to-follow-rules-101615217222914.html
08-03-2021||Gurugram||A Sultanate period tomb now serves as a village centre||Nestled in the midst of modern constructions and mustard fields in Gumat Bihari village is a historical tomb that dates back to the 14th or 15th century AD. The structure, located nearly 90 kilometres from Gurugram in Nagina block of Nuh district, stands out from afar due to its towering presence but navigating through the mesh of modern constructions to reach the tomb can be a tough task for history lovers and heritage enthusiasts.The village, residents said, grew around the tomb and hence, derives its name Gumat (tomb) from the structure. A narrow pathway leads to the tomb that is spread over nearly three to four acres.Little is known about the history of the tomb that stands out due to its unique three-tiered structure. The tomb demonstrates architecture from the Sultanate period, as per experts, and stands on an arched basement that serves as a platform for the upper structure of the tomb.Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the department of archaeology and museums, said that the tomb demonstrated the influence of Pathan infrastructure. “The architectural influence of the structure dates back to the Sultanate period (14th-15th century). This type of architecture is identified as Pathan architecture. The tomb is huge and unique, in terms of architecture,” said Bhattacharyya. She said that the structure was made of heavy stones, rubble and brick, and undergone renovations.On the outside, the tomb is decorated with niches that are now stuffed with hay and cow dung cakes. Intricate carvings and squinch work adorn the interiors of the tombs both on the first and second floor. The tomb is home to two unmarked graves. While one of the graves is located on the first floor, the second is within the basement, said locals. The grave located on the first floor is inscribed with verses from the Quran on all sides in multiple colours, mainly red, green and blue. While inscriptions have faded over the years, parts of the Arabic font remain legible.There are four sets of stairs, one at each corner. While three open into a closed balcony, one of them goes up to the first floor. The second floor of the tomb structure comprises a dome that is surrounded by turrets on all sides. Initially, six turrets stood around the dome. Due to damages sustained over the years, only two turrets remain at present. The interiors walls of the second floor have also been defaced with graffiti.“From the architecture, one can see that the place was renovated from time to time in the past. We can’t be sure if the first layer is the basement or the ground floor since the road height has increased over the years. It’s possible that back then, the current basement was the ground floor and hence, had sufficient space for people and animals to cross across the town,” said Bhattacharyya. She added that the basement of the structure consisted of a path for facilitating the movement of horses.Abdul Wahid, a 60-year-old resident, said that while the background of the tomb wasn’t known, it was crucial to the village’s origin. “Centuries ago, the gumat used to be very grand. Our forefathers used to tell us that horses and camels would pass through the tunnel in the basement. There is a tomb in the basement too. People from far off come to see it. We don’t know who got it made,” said Wahid.He said that the place was surrounded by sprawling gardens on all four sides in its early days but that these had vanished with time. “This place was surrounded by gardens and wells on all four sides. Now, two wells remain but they are dry. Back then, women from surrounding villages would come to rest on the ground floor while men would occupy the first floor as this place stayed naturally cooler. People did not have cooling facilities or electricity then,” said Wahid.At present too, locals often occupy the tomb complex during summer days. “During the summer, it’s relatively cooler here. It is used for holding panchayats and important gatherings,” said Ishfaq, another resident, who goes by his first name.Parul Munjal, associate professor at the Sushant School of Art and Architecture, said that historical structures from that time period were designed in a manner to beat the heat during summer. “The use of construction material, the thickness of walls and the high ceilings of such structures are among the factors that ensure they stay cool when it’s hot outside. Similarly, during the winter months, such places are likely to be warmer, ” said Munjal.Ibrahim Hussain Khan, 66, who owns a shop in the vicinity of the monument, said that locals used to offer namaz inside the tomb many decades ago. “When we were growing up, people used to offer namaz here. This was nearly 50 years ago. Even I have prayed here,” said Khan. He said that the portions of the tomb were used by local residents for storing hay or cow dung cakes.Fifty-five-year-old Fareeda, who visits the tomb daily for tending to her cows, said that while the basement of the complex was being used by locals for sheltering cows, they would willingly clear the premises if the government was ready to take responsibility for the tomb’s upkeep and repairs. “The government should get the tombs repaired and restored so that people can visit our village for tourism. It is our historical legacy, and we want people to know about it,” said Fareeda, who goes by her first name.The structure has sustained considerable damage over the years due to the vagaries of nature and human intervention. Portions of the dome and the basement and the peripheral walls are broken in parts. Over the years, locals have used brick and mortar to cover up two of the gateways that open into the inner enclosure of the tomb. A gate has also been installed to ensure that trespassers do not access the dome of the tomb.According to the villagers, a government school used to be run on the structure and later, housed an anganwadi office until about five years ago. Since then, the place has remained unoccupied and is taken care of by the villagers, who use the premises for holding village council meetings.Over the years, locals have reached out to authorities seeking protection of the monument but to no avail. “We have made many efforts to get this place cleaned and reached out to MLAs, but no steps have been taken. Around two months ago, a delegation of 20 people met the local MLA to request him to get this repaired but apart from mere assurances, no concrete step has been taken,” said Wahid.Intezar Aalam, a resident, said that villagers had approached the district administration multiple times seeking urgent intervention for protecting the monument. He said that locals fear that the structure would get encroached if steps for its upkeep are not taken immediately. “Earlier this month, I filed a fresh plea at the CM window seeking support from the government for the upkeep of the tomb. The tomb complex is an important part of our local history but has received no attention. We want the government to develop this place as a tourist spot so that our present and future generations can appreciate its importance,” said Aalam.Nuh’s deputy commissioner, Dhirendra Kharagata, said that he had learned about the presence of the heritage structure and the administration had made an initial inquiry about its present status. “Neither is the structure under the watch of ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) nor the state department of museum and archaeology. We need to check the historical value of the structure and reach out to appropriate agencies to see if the protection of the structure is their mandate. If neither the ASI nor the state departments are able to act, the district administration will try to work out a solution,” said Kharagata.He said that there were a number of similar structures in Mewat and the administration was trying to gather information about them. “Local organisations are helping us in collecting information. We have tied up with some of them,” said Kharagata.In response to an email query, Ashok Khemka, principal secretary of the Archeology and Museums Department, said that the department will get the heritage structure and its protection status re-examined. “This was examined and not cleared at the level of director earlier. I will get it re-examined,” said Khemka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/a-sultanate-period-tomb-now-serves-as-a-village-centre-101615217537372.html

The three labs are Metropolis labs, Suburban diagnostic centre and Krsnaa Lab. There was no official response from the labs till the time of going to press.The laboratories will not be able to test any samples for Covid-19 in the city, henceforth. The letter sent by the civic body claims that the labs failed to provide the complete addresses of the positive patients, which hampered contact tracing by the civic body and could lead to more cases in the future. Earlier, the civic body had raised this issue, that private labs are not providing reports on time, and with incomplete information, leading to delayed contact tracing. The civic body had sent an official letter to these labs on February 25, asking for an explanation and telling them to follow the state government guidelines. The civic body, in its letter, mentions repeated conversation with representatives from the labs, despite which they have refused to follow the guidelines. “In some cases it has been found in the reports that only “Pune” is mentioned as the location, which hampers the contact tracing process and could further lead to a surge in the number of cases,” the letter states. The letter, informing the labs of their closure, has been signed by PMC additional Commissioner Rubal Agarwal and is the under the Epidemic diseases act and the Disaster management act. It was submitted to the labs on March 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-seals-3-city-labs-over-incomplete-covid-19-reports-101615217357283.html

But neither the ruling coalition nor the opposition alliances seem sure of who will head the next government in the state.Despite having an incumbent chief minister in Sarbananda Sonowal, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not projected him as the party’s choice for the top post. This has led to speculations on whether it’s a poll strategy or something else within the party.On Friday, when the BJP’s first list of 70 candidates was announced in New Delhi, BJP national general secretary Arun Singh said the decision on the chief minister candidate would be taken by the party’s parliamentary board after the election.The BJP, which came to power in Assam for the first time in 2016, is contesting the polls in alliance with the old ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), which is contesting 26 seats, and new ally United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) which will put up candidates in eight seats.“The decision on the chief minister is taken by the party parliamentary board after the election. We announce a CM candidate in states where we are not in power but in those where we are in government, we don’t do that. We will abide by whatever decision the party takes on this,” Assam BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass told NDTV on Sunday.Also read: CM Sarbananda Sonowal says people of Assam eager to bring back BJP-led govtIn 2016, the BJP had projected Sonowal as the CM candidate, this time around, there are speculations that the choice is open between him and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who is the convener of BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a regional front of anti-Congress parties.Sarma had earlier declared that he was not interested in contesting the assembly polls and had intimated his decision to the party leadership. As a caveat, he had added that any decision on him contesting would be taken by the party and he would abide by it.While Sonowal would be contesting again from Majuli this time, Sarma will continue with his home constituency of Jalukbari. There are rumours that if Sonowal continues as the CM for another term, Sarma could be given a place in the Modi-led government at the Centre or if Sarma is given the charge, Sonowal could head to Delhi."There is a tussle between Sonowal and Sarma for the CM's post and BJP doesn't want to risk its election campaign by projecting one or the other as the face for the top post at present. Though the party is quiet on this tug of war between both leaders, it is clearly getting visible that Sarma is increasingly being projected as someone who can lead the campaign as well as take charge after the polls, if required," said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, political columnist and professor of political science at Gauhati University.On the other hand, the Congress-led grand alliance, which comprises the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), three Left parties and a newly formed regional party, has also decided not to put forward the name of a chief minister candidate.Bickering within Congress’s senior leaders as well as differences with allies on a choice for the top post is believed to have forced the grand alliance to keep the decision on the CM in abeyance till after the polls.The regional alliance of Raijor Dal and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), which were formed last year as an outcome of the violent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December 2019, have also refrained from naming a CM candidate. While the AJP is headed by Lurinjyoti Gogoi, jailed activist Akhil Gogoi is the president of the Raijor Dal.The election in Assam will be held in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assams-ruling-alliance-opposition-fronts-keep-choice-of-cm-candidate-open-101615214726805.html

08-03-2021||Bangalore||Congress terms Karnataka budget as 'hollow'||The Opposition Congress on Monday dubbed the budget tabled by Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa in the assembly as 'hollow' and one which does not supplement development. "This is not a budget that supplements development. It has no vision or target. Its a hollow budget," opposition leader Siddaramaiah told reporters. He said budgets presented so far in the state had allocated funds department wise, but it had been done away with this time and divided into six sectors. "Dividing the budget into sectors will not help understand how much is to be spent department wise," the former chief minister said, adding, that there were no adequate statistics in the budget and it lacked transparency. Earlier in the day, the Congress had staged a walkout ahead of the tabling of budget, alleging that the BJP government was 'carrying a bundle of sins' and has no moral right to continue in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-terms-karnataka-budget-as-hollow-101615211430480.html

At its peak, over 90,000 tests were conducted per day, which is not just the highest tests per capita for any city or state in India, but also globally," as per the city government's performance report.In the report, the deputy chief minister was quoted as saying that the government believed that the "only way to stop the spread of this virus is to test aggressively" and isolate those found infected in a timely manner, before they can spread the virus to others."Just as a comparison, when Delhi was testing at the rate of 4,400 tests per million population daily, Kerala which was second highest in tests in India, was testing at the rate of 2,300 tests per million daily whereas the all India average was 1,300 tests per million daily," the report said.For aggressive testing, the Delhi government set up 330 testing labs and centres at its hospitals, dispensaries and Aam Aadmi mohalla clinics. Out of 87.8 lakh tests, 6.25 lakh patients were found positive which translates into 7.12 per cent positivity rate, for that period, as per the Outcome Budget.Also, up to December 2020, 6,09,322 patients had recovered from Covid-19 whereas 10,536 patients lost their lives. The fatality rate of Delhi in this period stood at 1.68 per cent, it said.Responding to the surge in cases during this period, the Delhi government had innovated and created the "world's first home isolation programme", the report claimed.The Delhi government also ensured timely augmentation of hospital infrastructure by rapidly increasing Covid-19 designated beds in response to rising number of cases and to reduce mortality, as per the report."Including government and private facilities, the Delhi government ensured that 135 dedicated Covid hospitals, 15 quarantine, dedicated Covid Care Centres and six Covid Health Centres, with a strength of 18,718 beds, 8,273 beds and 882 beds respectively, were made available to the people of Delhi," it said."In all, 1,79,241 patients needed hospitalisation and were admitted in these quarantine Covid Care Centres, health centres and hospitals. It is a testimony to our sound planning that at all times, despite three waves, total number of Covid beds were more than twice the number of cases," the report said.Also, 496 Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinics (AAMC) have been established up to December 2020, against the target of 750 clinics. On an average, each AAMC handles 97 patient visits per day, it said.According the Delhi economic survey, on the healthcare sector front, the government also said that the sanctioned bed capacity in medical institutions in Delhi is 54,321.About 14,000 new beds are planned to be added by way of completion of ongoing, new projects and remodelling or expansion of existing hospitals.Also, per capita expenditure on health in Delhi has increased from ₹1,996 in 2014-15 to ₹3,029 in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-says-87-8-lakh-covid-19-tests-done-till-dec-31-2020-in-outcome-budget-101615208906990.html
08-03-2021||Patna||Women take centre stage in Bihar Assembly, seek higher representation||On the occasion of International Women’s Day on Monday, Bihar Legislative Assembly witnessed woman legislators cutting across party lines and raising their demand for increased participation of 33 per cent in the state Assembly as well as Lok Sabha.Bihar was the first state to give a 50 per cent quota for women in the panchayats. Some women members stated it was high time for the state to allow a 50 per cent quota for women in the legislative bodies to add meaning to the slogan of equality in society.The women's reservation bill has been pending in Parliament for nearly a decade and a half.As soon as the House assembled, Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha congratulated the woman legislators and spoke about the big strides women have made in different fields. Parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary suggested that women be given greater opportunity to ask questions and preside in the second half o the women’s day as a mark of respect. He said the kind of work the Bihar government has done for women empowerment is an example for not only the country but is also appreciated across the world.Also read: Bihar slow to push generic drugs using PM’s Janaushadhi projectWith the woman legislator empanelled in the list of presiding officers absent at that time, the senior-most member present in the House, Gayatri Devi, was asked to preside in the second half. Though several women legislators were not present in the House, all their questions were taken up first out of turn and most of the questions were addressed to the home department.Women legislators also took the lead from both treasury and opposition benches to participate in an engrossing debate. All the parties gave an opportunity to them. While the treasury benches lauded the state government’s achievements in providing a 50 per cent quota in panchayats and teachers’ recruitment and 35 per cent in government jobs, the Opposition countered it with issues of women safety and corruption. The woman legislators said that the females needed to get the equality they deserve and it should not be lost in sheer symbolism.While RJD woman legislators lauded the Bihar government’s move for 50 per cent quota in panchayat bodies, others pointed out that there were just two women in the Nitish cabinet - one each from the JD-U and the BJP - and reminded that it was the RJD that gave Bihar the first woman CM as Rabri Devi.In the present Vidhan Sabha, the number of women legislators dropped to 26 (10.2 per cent) from 28 (11 per cent) last time. In 2010, the number of woman legislators was 34 (14 per cent), the highest representation in the last seven decades. The disconcerting trend is that in the last two Vidhan Sabha elections, it has been declining despite a lot of hype about women’s empowerment, their greater participation at the panchayat level and higher voter turnout in elections than male counterparts.Congress MLA Neetu Kumari drew the attention of the government towards the lack of basic amenities like toilets at public places, bus stands, markets and block offices. “I urge the government to not only look into the matter but also implement it. This will be a gift to all women,” she added.Rural development minister Shravan Kumar, during the government’s reply on his department’s budgetary demand, which was passed by the Assembly, accepted the demand and said the government would build toilets at public places as several woman legislators have demanded.“Nitish government is committed to women’s empowerment and several schemes and quota for women in this regard are a testimony to this. Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, Jeevika Didis made masks for the people and now they will also make school dresses for children to make their financial inclusion a reality. The women have been actively involved in village governance and economic activities due to the Nitish government’s initiatives,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/women-take-centre-stage-in-bihar-assembly-seek-higher-representation-101615208794290.html

Chadha said the agency has moved the Supreme Court against the Haryana government to immediately stop the discharge of untreated pollutants into the Yamuna river and to release sufficient water to Delhi.Before this, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader had also urged the Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to intervene in the matter and direct the Haryana government to release the water supply and curb contamination.@DelhiJalBoard is in constant contact with Haryana Govt requesting them to address these issues on war-footing, but to no avail.I urge Hon'ble @MinOfJalShakti GOI, Sh. @gssjodhpur to kindly intervene & direct Haryana Govt to release Delhi's share & curb rising levels of ammonia.Chadha on Sunday accused the Haryana government of reducing the water supply to the national capital which was resulting in water scarcity. "Haryana has reduced the supply of raw water to Delhi, as a result we are facing a shortage in water production. Currently, Haryana through CLC Canal is supplying only 549.16 cusecs (against 683 cusecs) and DSB Canal is supplying 306.63 cusecs (against 330 cusecs)," Chadha said.The AAP leader also said that the state government is dumping sewage water into the Yamuna river as samples checked by the quality laboratory in Delhi had shown the presence of a high level of contamination or ammonia. "Wazirabad and Chandrawal WTP's water production has reduced by 30% and Okhla WTP's production has reduced by 15%.

The arrested man was identified as Major Thiru Murugan and was brought to Pune on Sunday from Tamil Nadu where he was posted. He will be in the custody of the Special investigation team (SIT), constituted by the Pune police to investigate the matter, until March 15. The remand was granted by the court of special judge SR Navander with public prosecutor Premkumar Agarwal and advocate RA Lonandkar as the defence advocate. Assistant commissioner of police Laxman Barate of Pune police crime branch was present as the investigation officer. “After the arrest of the first accused in the case, the investigation led the police to the present accused. The paper was 100 per cent stolen. It was forwarded from his WhatsApp account. The investigation is about where he got it from. Some of the earlier arrested were found with copies of the question paper,” said PP Agarwal. The police and the PP added that some messages were deleted by the accused and further investigation in the matter is needed. The defence lawyer argued that the phones of the present, as well as theearlier accused, have already been seized. Therefore, further custody is not required as experts can retrieve the erased information. To this, the judge asked for the case diary from ACP Borate and after going through it, he read the order stating, “The accused is the key person in the conspiracy of leaking the paper. There may be various links to this conspiracy. Due to the unlawful activity, the entire recruitment process has been stopped and the entire procedure has been postponed.

Land acquisition for the project had started in 2006 itself. The only new aspect in the budget was the introduction of a private party for the land acquisition.Also Read | K’taka Budget: No burden of additional taxes on common people, says CMDuring his budget speech, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa announced the construction of Bengaluru Signature Business next to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).

08-03-2021||Pune||Decentralised vaccination plan helps cover over 1.46 lakh people in Pune||Pune: From just 31 vaccination sites where 1,802 health care workers (HCW) who were the first beneficiaries in phase one on day one (January 16), the district is now inoculating over 15,000 beneficiaries, including senior citizens and those with comorbidities at 122 sites. The administration has risen to the occasion as senior citizens stormed the vaccination sites in a fight against the infection. Authorities and public are hoping to get the shot and win the Covid war, unlike last year during this time when they were unaware of the danger lurking around. The district administration has now decentralised vaccination at multiple centres. Of these 71 locations, 44 are government and 27 are private hospitals and at two hospitals in the city, Kamala Nehru and Sassoon hospital, women special session was also planned. With a population of over one crore in Pune district, if about 15,000 people are vaccinated per day then it would take about two years for the entire district to be vaccinated with the first dose, given that the supply of the dose is continuous and that everyone comes forward to take the jab. However, the local administration has multiple limitations given that they have to strictly abide by the guidelines provided by the central government. Rubal Agrawal, PMC additional municipal commissioner, said, “We do not have any roadmap as of now regarding vaccinating the rest of the city as we are awaiting further instructions from the Centre. We have to follow the instructions. For now, we have to vaccinate those eligible under phase one and two and for that we are opening up more centres each day as there has been an enormous response from mainly senior citizens. Even non-empanelled private hospitals have shown interest in vaccinating people and we are sending out letters to the central government for permission.”As of March 8, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) alone has begun vaccination at 71 locations which was only 4 on March 1. In view of the increasing demand, the session sites have been increased and at some hospitals multiple sessions are being conducted in two shifts. A senior PMC official said, “We have 70 hospitals, including primary health centres and major hospitals, of which 45 have space for vaccination. We need three rooms for vaccination as per protocol — waiting room, vaccinating room and observation room. At some of our primary health centres construction is going on, some are the mobile clinics where we cannot do vaccination and also some are the smart city clinics. So, we can have maximum 45-47 PMC centres while the remaining would be private ones.” In the rural areas too, the administration is ready to take up vaccination centres as and when needed. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “As of Friday, we had 40 locations where we vaccinated about 5,040 beneficiaries, including first and second dose, as against our target of 4,000. We will further increase the vaccination centres if need be.” The district has not seen any major adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI) since the first day, except in 2-3 cases where the beneficiaries had to be hospitalised as a precautionary measure. Also, since the beginning of phase two of the vaccination for senior citizens and those aged 45-59 years with comorbidities, not a single AEFI has been reported. This is boosting the morale of senior citizens as more are rushing to the vaccination centres.Despite technical glitches which were reported earlier, citizens did not avoid vaccination. A huge response was seen for walk-ins at vaccination centres and even today (March 8) only nominal numbers are vaccinated through advanced registration while most prefer walk-in registration despite the administration’s appeal to prefer online registration. As of Sunday, Pune continues to be the most affected district in the country with most active cases and accounting for almost one in every ten new Covid-19 cases. The spread of the infection and the possible fear of a second wave are also causing citizens to rush to vaccination centres where often the most vulnerable may face risk infection as social distancing norms are not followed at some centres. However, with such an enthusiastic crowd, the administration now has the challenge to meet up to their demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/decentralised-vaccination-plan-helps-cover-over-1-46-lakh-people-in-pune-101615202656608.html

Singh, a former Allahabad University students’ union (AUSU) president, said the parents of the child were asked to move to another hospital due to lack of money and there was gross negligence in treatment. Attaching reports and videos with her letter to NMC, she demanded cancellation of the hospital’s licence.In her letter to NCPCR, she said although the commission had asked the district administration to initiate an inquiry on the issue and the probe was now underway, no action had been taken against the hospital so far. The letters sent to NMC and the PMO also requested that action be taken, said Singh.Kareli resident Mukesh Mishra's three-year-old daughter was suffering from acute intestinal obstruction. She was admitted to the private hospital on February 15 and underwent two surgeries on February 24 and March 2 before being referred to the government-run children’s hospital under the SRN Hospital on March 3, the hospital claimed.However, the girl’s father alleged she was forced out of the private hospital owing to the family’s inability to pay more. He said he rushed her to different hospitals, eventually admitting her to the government’s children’s hospital on March 3. He left the government hospital with the child on March 4. The girl died on March 6. The parents alleged that she died following negligence by the private hospital, located under the Pipri police station of Kaushambi.Must Watch: 'PM Modi bought ₹16,000 crore planes but...': Priyanka Gandhi to UP farmersThe hospital has categorically denied the allegations. There was uproar after the child’s death. Video clips of the child went viral on social media that led to the Prayagraj district administration ordering an inquiry. An FIR was registered at the Pipri police station on the father's complaint. The post-mortem of the girl was carried out on the intervention of Kaushambi police before her cremation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/action-against-prayagraj-hospital-sought-in-alleged-medical-negligence-case-101615200820113.html

Maybe they are not aware - it is not a power demonstration; it is a devotional demonstration. In this program, not politics, religion is the policy, whose path I have been following from the beginning,” said Raje at Adi Badrinath Temple in Bharatpur.The former CM started the day, also her birthday and International Women’s Day with prayers at Badri Nath Temple in Bharatpur.People in large numbers reached there to wish her on her birthday. Locals also welcomed her during the trip from Adi Badrinath to Kedarnath temple.“Along with my birthday and International Women's Day, we also have the birth anniversary of Panna Dai (a lady famous for sacrifice of her own son to save king's son from enemies). I salute such a braveheart. Such a large number of people from all over the state came to wish me a happy birthday. I am deeply grateful to all of them,” she said.“Today's program is a happy coincidence. Today, I have completed my 36 years as a legislature after I was elected a first time MLA on March 8, 1985 from Dholpur. All 36 communities in the state have always been supporting me with regards and love. I was inspired by my mother Vijayaraje Scindia to run on a spiritual policy,” Raje added.The national vice-president said her government had spent ₹550 crore for development of 125 temples and ₹110 crore for beautification to set up religious tourism. We have to root out Ashok Gehlot government to develop the state again.“The government is stuck in its own politics hence the development of Rajasthan has stalled. But you should not worry, Atal ji had said that darkness will be sorted - lotus will bloom. We will nourish lotus in Rajasthan again,” Raje said.Also Read: Rajasthan police officer accused of rape suspended with other senior officersReacting to the statements made by Raje, state health minister in Congress government, Subhash Garg said, “I don't agree with the statement of Vasundhara Raje that no development work in the state was taking place in the present government. The (developmental works) are going on at a rapid pace under the leadership of Ashok Gehlot.”Garg added that Raje was the BJP’s biggest leader in the state just like Ashok Gehlot in Congress.

We are expecting more women to join at different protest sites,” she told PTI.The demonstrators want a repeal of the three laws enacted by the government in September last year to facilitate free farm trade. The farmers, however, say that the legislation will hurt their livelihood and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. Multiple rounds of talks between the central leadership and farmers have failed to break the deadlock as the government has ruled a complete roll back and offered to make amendments but farmers are adamant on their demand.Meanwhile, farm union leader Rakesh Tikait is holding kisan panchayats in several states across the nation. He will be in Madhya Pradesh on Monday where farmers have warned that they will intensify their agitation if the Bharatiya Kisan Union BKU national leader is arrested in connection with a previous case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/entry-exit-at-delhi-metro-stations-between-tikri-kalan-to-brigadier-hoshiar-singh-on-green-line-shut-101615185486456.html

The GAD wants Vikramaditya to vacate the bungalow allotted to Shekhawat, when he was the vice-president.The notice issued to Vikramaditya states that the additional district magistrate court on October 7, 2019 directed that the house be vacated in 15 days, which was challenged by you in session court - the appeal was quashed on November 16, 2019.The GAD’s notice has asked him to deposit ₹5,430,000 as rent for the bungalow, pending since November 2019, at a rate of ₹10,000/day in the office of director estate.After the death of Suraj Kanwar, wife of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, the GAD in 2015 (during the previous BJP government’s tenure) had served notice to vacate but Vikramaditya expressed inability citing his mother’s “poor health”. Thereafter, the GAD in 2017 started the eviction process at the additional district magistrate office (estate officer).Also Read: Rajasthan police officer arrested for raping woman complainant in Alwar“We will be challenging the ₹54 lakh notice in the court.

He had reported it stolen on February 18 at Vikroli police station, he said. Senior ATS official confirmed the FIR was registered on the basis of the statement of Hiren’s wife Vimala on Sunday. The security scare case was transferred to ATS after Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis demanded an NIA investigation into it. The murder case has been registered under section 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons.Also Read | Uncovering truth behind Mansukh Hiren’s death crucial for MVA: Sanjay RautAn ATS team also visited the Kalwa creek in the afternoon and inspected the area where the body was found, said ATS official.

08-03-2021||Patna||Bihar slow to push generic drugs using PM’s Janaushadhi project||Bihar was behind the national average in terms of growth in sale of medicines through Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), as the Prime Minister announced on Sunday that Ayush medicines would now also be available under the scheme to patients, along with generic allopathic medicines at 50% - 90% cheaper rates than branded drugs.The state registered 57% upswing in sales under the PMBJP during the last 11 months. This was, however, 3% less than the national average growth of 60% till February, said officials.Though Bihar, during this period, has been able to increase the number of PMBJP centres from 161 to 222, the pace of opening such centres has been far from satisfactory, said an official of the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, requesting anonymity.As per the Centre’s roadmap, Bihar should have had at least 534 such stores — at least one in each of its 534 revenue blocks. Of the 222 existing outlets, 29 are in Patna alone. Sixty-one more such centres are to open across the state by the end of the year.“Bihar does not have a standard operating procedure (SOP) on how to open such stores in the state. As a result, it leads to inordinate delay in processing any request for opening of the PMBJP outlet at a government health facility,” he said.“A state facility has to give its consent for opening such an outlet on its campus. This does not happen smoothly even in Patna. The situation is worse in districts, where civil surgeons are generally not proactive,” said the officer, who requested anonymity.In Patna, for instance, the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) and the AIIMS do not have PMBJP outlets. The two facilities, however, have Amrit stores, which provide implants and generic drugs at subsidised cost.Amrit stores are owned and run by the PSU HLL Lifecare. Here the government caps the price of drugs purchased through distributors. In case of PMBJP, procurement is done directly through drug manufacturers by asking them to compete in tender, floated through the Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India, a PSU of the Central government. As a result, the common man generally gets a higher discount on drugs purchased through PMBJP outlets.The Nalanda Medical College Hospital and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) are among the few centres in Patna to have an Amrit store as well as PMBJP outlet on their campuses.Another reason for the less than the national growth in sale of generic drugs in Bihar was the reluctance among doctors to prescribe them.BJP MP from Aurangabad Sushil Kumar Singh acknowledged this fact and requested doctors to prescribe generic drugs.“Our Prime Minister has named you (doctors) Corona warriors. My earnest request to you is to prescribe maximum generic drugs. Branded drugs should be prescribed only under compelling circumstances, so that the financial burden on patients is reduced,” said Singh at a function at the IGIMS.IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the institute had already issued instructions to its doctors to write generic drugs on their prescriptions after a PMBJP store was opened on its campus on September 24, last year.Talking of red tape in Bihar, Pawan Kejriwal, who runs the PMBJP store at IGIMS said, “I had to wait for four years to open the store. The authorities cancelled three of my previous allotment orders during this period before I competed the fourth time last year.”The Centre had initially advised states to earmark land on its hospital campuses to open Amrit stores, to provide affordable and reliable generic drugs, stents and implants under the PMBJP, re-launched in November 2016.Bihar was slow to soak in the concept when generic drug stores were first mooted in 2008 under ‘Jan Aushadhi’, a project for sale of generic drugs through exclusive outlets called the ‘Jan Aushadhi medical store’. It was not before 2017-18 that the first Amrit store opened at Patna’s IGIMS.Also Read: Bihar Congress leaders in competitive show of strength to lead state unitIn September 2015, the 'Jan Aushadhi scheme' was revamped as 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana' (PMJAY). To give further impetus to the scheme, it was again renamed as ‘Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana’ in November 2016.Two years back, Bihar had only 132 (approx) generic drugs stores as against thousands of retail outlets selling branded medicines. Darbhanga, Lakhisarai, Sheohar and Sheikhpura were then among a few districts which did not have any generic drugs store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-slow-to-push-generic-drugs-using-pm-s-janaushadhi-project-101615179679755.html

Besides the parade by an all-woman contingent and a motorcycle show, the programme will showcase the journey of women cops from the grassroots to the highest ranks in uniform.Pioneers become role modelsRani Devi, 66, was among the first three women to have joined the police as a constable in 1973, inspiring many to follow suit. Rani served the police for 40 years before retiring as deputy superintendent of police in 2013. “My service in the police force makes me feel proud even today. I’m glad that many young women went on to choose a life in uniform and serve the country,” she said.In November 1975 when Himachal Pradesh was just four years old, the state police recruited its second batch of 27 women.Major milestones in journey to topPunita Bhardwaj joined the Himachal Pradesh Police Service in 1986 and set another benchmark in the history of the state’s police. She was inducted into the Indian Police Service (IPS) in 2001 and was awarded the police medal for meritorious service in 2011.Satwant Atwal Trivedi became the first woman IPS officer in the state in 1996 and went on to become the first woman superintendent of police at Una besides the first woman officer from the state to serve the National Investigation Agency and Border Security Force. She is credited with initiating the implementation of artificial intelligence in the BSF. A gold medallist in clinical psychology and German, at present she heads the BSF’s intelligence directorate and is the joint secretary of National Intelligence Grid or (Natgrid) to counter terrorism.Other women who have done the state police proud include Gulshan Negi, who became the first woman assistant sub inspector in 1994, and Babita Rana, the additional superintendent of police at Sirmaur at present, who was the first woman sub inspector in 1996. She was the first woman officer to head a police station at Kihar in Chamba.Bollywood in praise of state policeActors Hema Malini, Anupam Kher, Aruna Irani Aamir Khan, singer Hans Raj Hans and director Prakash Jha have felicitated women police personnel on the occasion. In video messages, they congratulated Kundu for organising the event in Shimla to recognise the contribution of women cops. “Women empowerment leads to a strong nation,” said Kher, who is from Shimla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-celebrates-role-of-women-police-personnel-101615178476375.html
08-03-2021||Bangalore||The voiceless communities of Karnataka||In 2013, Shekar Kudri, then a 27-year-old from Muralgi village of Belagavi district became possibly the first person in the Dakkaliga community, a nomadic tribe in Karnataka, to land a government job.By their own estimates, there are about 3,000 people who belong to this community, classified as Scheduled Caste (SC), in Karnataka. Kudri’s appointment presents a stark reflection of how smaller and relatively unknown caste groups in the state get so little from reservation, depriving them of opportunities and a chance at social justice.“My parents were agricultural labourers and did not know about reservations. I gathered information when I was studying, pursued it and applied for a government job,” said Kudri, now a 35-year-old physical education trainer in a government school in Muralgi.His relatives at Chikkanayakanahalli in Tumkuru district, however, have not been so fortunate.Most of the families that live next to the cemetery in the village continue to beg for a living while a few others sell cheap plastic goods to eke out an income.“We have been fighting to get the government to allocate grants for the construction of houses,” Shantharaju, a small-time trader from the same community, said. Most families in this settlement live in huts, put together with plastic sheets, straws and other material. He described the living conditions of the community as “heenayakara” or deplorable.Communities like the Dhakkaligas are one of the hundreds, if not thousands, whose lives have not changed with the image of India, whose economic might is often showcased worldwide.The rise in per capita income, industrial progress and technological prowess has had little or no impact on their lives or livelihood, enunciating the already glaring social and economic inequalities in India. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this situation as it forced those who tried to break out, right back into poverty.But few are aware of the so-called benefits of reservation due to the lack of education, employment and awareness.The conditions of these people are rarely ever deliberated on by the political class, who spare no opportunity to identify with their own caste groups.The rise of caste-specific ‘mathas’ or monasteries are instruments to uphold the interest of the community and as a consolidation measure to prove strength that would also be used as a political bargaining chip, experts said. There are at least three prominent communities—Panchamasali, Vokkaliga, Kuruba and Valmiki—where a sizeable strength of people from these groups are in active politics, high offices and avail benefits from government schemes and programmes.To be sure, most of the benefits even within these dominant communities are cornered by a few who are in power, leaving the remaining as vote banks or support systems with little or no benefits other than the name of the community itself.Experts and social activist groups said the biggest problem for the state is that it does not have adequate information on these communities, their living conditions or their whereabouts since they are nomadic and often move around for livelihood.The other problem is an argument often used to appropriate the higher allocations to larger communities based on their population, experts said.“Few communities grab benefits meant for more deprived groups,” CS Dwarakanath, the former chairman of the Karnataka backward classes commission and a civil rights activist, said. He added that there is no source of information to gauge the actual benefit of representation availed by any community.The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2015 undertook a survey to determine the actual living conditions, population and social, economic and educational status of all caste groups in Karnataka. The survey is yet to be released.Siddaramaiah had initiated the study based on the recommendations of Professor Ravivarma Kumar’s report in 2000. However, analysts said, Siddaramaiah’s reasons may have been more political as he, a Kuruba, who stormed into power with the help of AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits), wanted to challenge the dominant caste theory in the state, dominated mostly by Lingayats and Vokkaligas, who are believed to be the largest with significant political influence.There are broadly five categories of caste classifications in Karnataka apart from reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC/ST).But atrocities against people in the name of caste, religion and subsects, among other reasons, continue to thrive unabated.A group of 15 people, who see themselves as upper-caste, stormed and assaulted a group of youngsters from the Madiga community in Koppala district, about 351 km from Bengaluru, in October last year.The youngsters had visited a local eatery where they got into a scuffle with a few people from upper caste boys, who objected to their presence.Madiga is a term used for over 50 Dalit sub-castes that have been treated as untouchables for centuries in Karnataka and other places. Though untouchability and casteist slurs are punishable offences, few are charged with these crimes as it is accepted as a way of life for many across Karnataka’s rural landscape, experts said. “Many times they do not even have the courage to file a complaint,” Sanna Hanumantha, a social activist in Koppala district, said.A 2019 study by Swabhimani Dalit Shakti, a social advocacy group in Karnataka, found that the practice of untouchability was rampant in nearly 87 villages in Haveri district, where they were not allowed to draw water from the wells, enter temples or even get a haircut.“We put up advertisements in newspapers when we visit any district to get more people from marginalised communities approach us and share their grievances,” K Jayaprakash Hegde, former member of parliament and chairman of the Karnataka Backward Class Commission, said.Hegde said there are cases where spelling mistakes deprive members of marginalised communities a chance to procure a caste certificate, which is mandatory to avail any benefits of reservation.The lack of awareness is one of the biggest challenges in reservation that leads to abject poverty, exploitation and malnutrition and even genetic problems due to the practice of marriage among close relatives within the community, experts said.A group of 50 members of the Yerava community, who mostly work in coffee plantations in Kodagu and Chikmagaluru districts, gave a reservation-related representation to the local police as they did not even know who the relevant authorities were.Bhavya, a 23-year-old woman at Ponnampet in Kodagu district said there are cases where caste certificates are illegally procured by people of upper castes or landlords with the lure of alcohol and money.Any effort to mobilise the marginalised caste groups is often met with brutal force by landlords, who see this as a threat, experts said.“Most of these nomadic tribes are people who do not have land, strength of numbers and even voting rights and hence are ignored by the political class,” Dasanuru Kusanna from the Institute of Socio-economic Change said.He added that the other problem is splintering of sub-castes from the main group, which then becomes a struggle within members of what is categorised as the same community to get benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/the-voiceless-communities-of-karnataka-101615177340699.html

I have told them now that I am 66 years old and want to do some good work in the remaining three years,” he said.Union minister Sadananda Gowda told Hindustan Times on Sunday, “Yes, he (Muthalik) came to me but the ultimate decision will be taken by the core committee of the party.”Muthalik had made headlines when Sri Ram Sene assaulted women in a pub in Mangaluru in 2009. He has taken extreme positions against Valentine’s Day and his followers have targeted young couples and others in the garb of saving ‘Hindu culture’.He has had a love-hate relationship with the BJP which he tried to formally enter even in the past.In March 2014, Muthalik was inducted into the BJP in a grand event only to be removed just a few hours later after public outrage.The Belagavi seat fell vacant after Suresh Angadi, the central minister for railways died due to Covid-19. The dates for the bypolls are yet to be declared but the two main national parties--BJP and Congress--have already started work to secure a victory in the border district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/sri-ram-sene-s-muthalik-tries-to-join-bjp-again-seeks-belagavi-bypoll-ticket-101615175990980.html

If the police arrest him under the directions of the BJP-led state government, we will intensify our protest and the state government will be responsible for any untoward incident,” said BKU state president Anil Yadav.While the farm leader is coming to MP to garner support against the three new farm laws, and will hold three rallies this week, speculations are rife that he may be arrested on arrival. A police officer said on the condition of anonymity the arrest would be in connection with a 2012 case in which Tikait staged a protest against a power plant in Jaithari area of Anuppur district. Tikait, along with 100 others, was arrested under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with armed weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC but as released on bail. Later, he didn’t appear during a hearing and an arrest warrant was issued against him in 2016. Since then, he is absconding. However, Yadav pointed out, “Tikait has visited the state at least eight times since the court issued an arrest warrant against him. Why didn’t the MP police arrest him then? The government wants to suppress the protest and that’s why, ministers are making efforts to send farmer leaders behind the bars.” Anuppur superintendent of police Mangilal Solanki said, “I can’t comment over it but we will act as per the law.” Sheopur superintendent of police Sampat Upadhyaya said, “We don’t have any information regarding any arrest. We are just maintaining law and order in the district.” Heavy police force has been deployed in Sheopur as thousands of people are expected in the panchayat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rakesh-tikait-in-mp-today-farmers-warn-of-stir-if-he-is-arrested-in-2012-case-101615176615935.html

08-03-2021||Bangalore||100 years apart, a tale of Bengaluru's two pandemics||The year is 1898. As travellers arrived in Bangalore (now Bengaluru), they were checked. Only those unaffected by the plague were allowed to enter the city. Even those who tested negative were escorted by the police to their homes and kept under observation for 10 days. Their clothes were disinfected before entering the city.Over 100 years later, the people of Bengaluru experienced familiar scenarios during the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit India in 2020. From appointing a health commissioner to monitor the pandemic to creating isolation centres, there were many similarities in how the city dealt with the pandemic then and now.But most importantly, the years following the plague resulted in a change in the way people lived in Bangalore. This included developing new layouts and creating a new sanitation system, among others. Those studying history and contemporary Bengaluru feel that just like the Plague, even the Covid-19 pandemic will change the DNA of the city.The days of the PlagueAccording to government records, the first case in then Bangalore was reported in the city cantonment in August 1898. After the servant of the railway superintendent died due to the Plague, the disease was reported among the porters at the station. By the end of the pandemic, around 3,393 unofficial deaths areas outside the cantonment and 3,321 deaths were reported in the cantonment. Talking about how the city changed after the devastating pandemic, Meera Iyer of the National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) said that the first change was the development of a new, spacious layout system instead of the crowded markets like Chickpet. Basavanagudi, Malleswaram, Frazer Town and other areas were developed to ensure people didn’t live in congested areas.“There was a lot of emphasis on lighting, ventilation and hygiene post the Plague. This changed the way houses were built too. In the cantonment side of the city, especially in Fraser Town and Richards Town (which came up in 1911), there were the so-called plague-proof rules — country tiles allowed, no thatch roof, no mud floors, houses to be built slightly higher so that they were higher than the drains and so on,” she said. In the Maharaja-administered part of Bangalore, Chamarajapet and Seshadripuram had been built in 1892. “Basavanagudi and Malleswaram came up just six years later so they provided an interesting study of how the Plague had affected planning and architecture. For instance, Chamarajpet had quite a few row houses, but thanks to the plaque-induced horror of ‘congestion’ and ‘lack of ventilation’, Basavanagudi houses were mostly built with gardens,” she said.She also added that there was also an increased emphasis on proper sewage and drainage. Roads were built very carefully with proper drainage in mind. “Even today, you will rarely find flooding in Basavanagudi’s streets,” she added.In 1899, the Mysore government diverted ₹27 lakhs for sanitation work across the state. Several administrative experiments took place thereafter. Between 1898-1902, the post of Special Commissioner for Plague came into being. In 1913, the head of the Medical Department was designated as Sanitary Commissioner.The new pandemicThe Covid-19 pandemic too is an opportunity for such a change, say experts. Mohandas Pai, former director of Infosys said one of the first changes the city will see is the way it works, and work from home is here to stay, at least in a hybrid model.“The pandemic forced companies to rethink the way they operate. In the future, the idea of having a large office with all employees in one place will be obsolete. From an employee point of view, people are thinking of the quality of life, especially by wasting time travelling large distances within the city. A hybrid model which involves work from home and having small hubs across the city will be the way forward. Many are already doing it,” he said.V Ravichandar, a civic expert said that the city should and will have a ‘5 km city’ in the coming days. “The work from home culture will enable people to work and live in a 5km radius. Such a system will make Bengaluru a pandemic proof city to some extent. One thing this pandemic has taught us is that cases happen in bubble and travel results in the spread,” he further added.Both experts felt that a combination of hybrid work culture and removal of cross-city travel would not only decongest Bengaluru but also improve reliance on public transport.“Once the need for long-distance travel within the city is limited, we will see people walking or using cycles more in the 5 km hubs,” Ravichandar added.Such a move, however, requires a change in the government’s thought process. While Ravichandar asked for a relook at the city’s master plan with this new outlook, Pai said that areas across the city should be developed as hubs with all provisions, for which, people travelled across the city in the pre-pandemic era.“To give an example, Mysuru can be the new hub for the Bengaluru dwellers. The city provides a better quality of life and since work from home allows people to be away from the big city, more people could move there,” Pai said.A senior official of Bengaluru traffic police agreed to the assessment and said that since the pandemic, despite the economy opening up, the volume of traffic in the city has reduced considerably.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/100-years-apart-a-tale-of-bengaluru-s-two-pandemics-101615173182005.html

Fires in forests in Jonha, Angara and Sitafall localities have caused heavy damage, wildlife experts said. The forest officials, however, said the situation is under control and village forest committees have been activated to tackle the fires.Experts say fire incidents in the area are shrinking animals’ habitats with burning of shrubs and insects, which are food for several animals. Birds are also leaving since the temperature around their habitats in these parts has increased due to fire.Forest officials and experts claimed most of the forest fires were man made. Fires caused by Mahua flower pickers are common in March and April in Jharkhand forests. But, the fires are expanding this year due to the prolonged dry season. The maximum temperature is hovering around 32 degrees Celsius, 1.5 degrees above the normal.Ranchi based environmentalist Nitish Priyadarshi, who visited the Jonha and Sitafall area on Saturday, said, “The birds are badly affected by the fire, as their shelters have turned hot. Besides, large numbers of animals are also migrating to other safe places to protect themselves from the fire and in search of food.”He said the huge plumes of smoke billowing out carbon dioxide are also impacting the environment and need to be addressed as soon as possible. “The forest dwellers are also suffering due to the fire,” he said.Priyadarshi said such fires are started in small patches, mostly to collect mahua flowers during this season. “However, the fire is breaking out in a large area due to the prolonged dry season and less moisture in the soil. Earlier, in Ranchi district, there used to be water in forest streams, which used to prevent fire from spreading. But, this year they have dried,” Priyadarshi said.Also Read:10th century Buddha Vihar discovered in Jharkhand’s HazaribagRegional chief conservator of forests (RCCF), Ranchi, AT Mishra said, “This is actually ground fire and not forest fire and is much under control. We have activated the village committees, who are actively dousing the fires, when reported.”Mishra said, “There are several reasons for spreading ground fire. Besides the mahua pickers, rural people or tourists throw burning cigarette or 'bidi' buds on the ground, which also causes ground fire in forests some time. However, the situation is not alarming. We are monitoring the situation closely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/forest-fire-in-ranchi-and-surroundings-poses-threat-to-wild-animals-environment-101615169544815.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Varavara Rao goes home on bail after release from hospital||Poet-activist Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, has been discharged from Nanavati Hospital, people in the know of the matter said.“Free at last ! Varavara Rao out of Nanavati hospital 11.45 pm, 6th March 2021,” lawyer Indira Jaising tweeted as she posted a picture of Rao smiling into the camera.The 82-year-old activist, who was granted interim bail for six months on medical grounds by the Bombay high court on February 22, was discharged from the private hospital late Saturday night, they said.Rao, arrested in 2018, was admitted to the medical facility in November last year due to ill health. The HC had last month directed he be released immediately on bail after being discharged from hospital.While granting him bail, the high court had asked Rao to furnish a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two solvent sureties of the like amount. Rao later requested the court that he be allowed to furnish cash surety as the process of submitting solvent sureties was taking time. The court last Monday allowed Rao to furnish a cash surety of ₹50,000 and gave him time till April 5 to submit the two solvent sureties of the same amount.The case is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The HC while granting him bail imposed various conditions on his release, including a direction to remain in Mumbai, within the jurisdiction of the NIA court here.After the six-month period, Rao will have to either surrender before the trial court or approach the HC for extension of the bail period.The case pertains to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the “Elgar Parishad” conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/varavara-rao-goes-home-on-bail-after-release-from-hospital-101615152495233.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi among top 3 states with most ‘contaminated sites’||Delhi has featured third on a list of states and union territories with most contaminated sites, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.The CPCB report released on Sunday said that there are over 112 sites in India that are contaminated by toxic and hazardous substances. Apart from this, another 168 sites were identified that might be contaminated, but require investigation and confirmation, the report said.The list is topped by Odisha, which has 23 contaminated sites, followed by Uttar Pradesh, with 21 such sites in the state and Delhi, which has 11.Delhi’s 11 sites are Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills, industrial areas in Jhilmil and Wazirpur, New Friends Colony (NFC), Dilshad Garden and Lawrence Road. Apart from these, there are another 12 spots under the “probably contaminated” list in the Capital.According to the Union ministry of environment, contaminated sites are defined as delineated areas where the “constituents and characteristics of the toxic and hazardous substances, caused by humans, exist at levels and in conditions, which pose existing or imminent threats to health and environment”.Such contamination may happen at production areas, landfills, dumps, waste storage and treatment sites, mine tailings sites, spill sites, chemical waste handler and storage sites where the waste is either of hazardous nature or has the potential of turning hazardous.Municipal agencies in Delhi are responsible for the upkeep of landfills, and waste disposal and management.Delhi’s civic body officials refused to respond on the report.According to submissions made to the National Green Tribunal by respective state governments last year, remediation work has been started to clean up 14 contaminated sites across seven states: Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and UP.Shashank Shekhar, assistant professor, department of geology Delhi University, said, “Sites such as Ghazipur and Bhalswa are very old and have not been developed to scientifically to handle waste and as a result, the area’s soil and even groundwater have been severely contaminated. The lesson from this report should be that the same mistakes should not be made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-among-top-3-states-with-most-contaminated-sites-101615151772392.html

In many families, either the men or the women have not returned. Under such circumstances, how could others stay here?” asked Rafiqa Bano.Asif Khan, a resident of Burma market in Jammu, said: “Many among us didn’t return home last evening. The police action has caused fear.”Several thousand Muslim Rohingya immigrants, fleeing Myanmar to escape persecution, have been staying in the Union Territory for years now. According to official data, nearly 5,700 Rohingya immigrants were settled in and around Jammu.“We will go back when peace returns to our country,” said Sufeera, 28, who said her uncle and brother had been sent to the holding centre, leaving her alone with her children.Another refugee, 48-year-old Sadiq, said members of his family had also been detained. “We have been told that we will be deported,” he said. “They took mother and father ... Who will take care of them?”On Saturday, the J&K administration started the verification process of the Rohingya. By late evening, 169 immigrants without valid travel documents were sent to a jail in Kathua, which has been declared a holding centre.On Sunday, dozens of queued up outside the stadium for verification following police orders.“This was done under section 3(2)e of the Foreigners Act. Due process of law was followed in this exercise. These immigrants were not holding valid travel documents required in terms of section (3) of the Passports Act,” Jammu IGP Mukesh Singh said on Saturday. On Sunday, he told AFP that after verification, details will be sent to the ministry of external affairs to be taken up with Myanmar for deportation.An estimated 40,000 Rohingya have taken refuge in parts of India over the years. Fewer than 15,000 are registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Another immigrant, Kafiullah, who runs a grocery kiosk to make ends meet, said he will have to follow the government’s order. “We don’t have much choice with us,” he said.On Sunday, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s J&K president Ravinder Raina said that illegal Rohingya immigrants were being sent to the holding centre following Myanmar’s assurance to take them back. “Myanmar’s external affairs ministry has assured India to take back its people, not only from India but wherever they live in other parts of the world,” he said.Former deputy chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Kavinder Gupta, too, said on Sunday the “deportation of Rohingya was on the BJP agenda since long... Now, the time has come to deport them.”With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dont-have-much-choice-rohingya-face-deportation-101615151467232.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||Pandemic phase of Covid-19 is over: Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said that test positivity rates remaining lower than 1% for more than two months indicated that the pandemic phase for Covid-19 was over in the national capital.“The pandemic phase for Covid-19 is over in Delhi. One has to look into the test positivity rate which has been lower than 1% for more than two months now. Covid-19 is now nearing an endemic phase in Delhi. Experts say some cases continue to occur in the endemic phase. Delhi witnessed a swine flu outbreak around 10 years ago, but still some cases are reported every year. Coronavirus is not going to end completely... we will have to learn to live with it,” Jain said in a press briefing.However, experts cautioned against Jain’s remark. “The decision about whether it is a pandemic or endemic has to be taken by scientific bodies like the WHO or ICMR. It cannot be a political decision and we cannot loosen our grip and guard against coronavirus infections at this crucial point,” Dr JA Jayalal, president of Indian Medical Association, told NDTV.An infection is said to be endemic in a population when it is constantly maintained at a baseline level in a geographic area. After reporting 300-plus cases for two consecutive days till Saturday, Delhi on Sunday recorded 286 new Covid cases and two related deaths, taking the city’s infection tally to 641,101 and fatalities to 10,921.The 286 cases came on the back of 91,614 tests – of which 71,250 were RT-PCR tests that are believed to be more accurate. The caseload stands at 1,803, a jump of 24 patients from the 1,779 reported on Saturday, the bulletin showed.Also, 260 patients were reported as recovered on Sunday, taking the total recoveries to 628,377 at a recovery rate of 98.01 per cent, according to data. The bulletin also showed that 937 patients have been in home isolation and the city currently has 538 containment zones as of Sunday.On Sunday, the test positivity rate was recorded at 0.31%.On Friday and Saturday, Delhi recorded 312 and 321 new Covid-19 cases respectively – and the positivity rates were 0.53% and 0.63% — raising concerns at a time when several other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala are witnessing increase in cases once again. In Delhi, the total number of tests also dropped below 60,000 over Friday and Saturday, records showed.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has categorised Delhi along with Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh as states in focus, after a surge in the number of daily new cases were observed.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday: “We are in the endgame of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.” He was speaking at the Delhi Medical Association’s (DMA’s) 62nd Annual Delhi State Medical Conference (MEDICON 2021) in collaboration with Dharamshila Narayana Hospital on Sunday.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research, said: “Pandemic and endemic are technical terms, best to be decided by experts on the basis of studies. As far as the numbers are concerned, Delhi is in stable shape now. However, Delhi government has to ensure that it does not scale down tests, contact tracing and surveillance. We have to learn from states which evidently went complacent with their policies and witnessed fresh uptick in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-phase-of-covid-19-is-over-jain-101615151015148.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||AAP smells a scam in Rani Jhansi flyover delay; baseless, charge, says BJP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of corruption in the three municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) and demanded answers with regard to expenses incurred and delay in construction of the Rani Jhansi flyover in north Delhi.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and hit back, saying that the AAP should answer why the construction of the Signature bridge in north-east Delhi faced delays.The AAP is in charge of Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations. Delhi goes to municipal polls in 2022.The north Delhi municipal body inaugurated the Rani Jhansi flyover in October 2018 and the AAP government inaugurated the Signature bridge in November 2018. Both projects witnessed delays – Raji Jhansi flyover took 24 years and Signature bridge was supposed to be inaugurated in 2013.“The BJP claimed that the Rani Jhansi flyover will be completed in two years, then why did it take 24 years? They claimed that the flyover will be completed within a budget of ₹175 crore, then why did it take ₹724 crore. If not for corruption by the BJP leaders then why?” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor cited several hurdles in the work and rejected Pathak’s allegations. “These are baseless allegations. There were numerous hurdles ranging from legal to administrative that delayed work on the Rani Jhansi flyover project. The AAP should rather answer what took them five extra years to start the Signature Bridge, even though the project was not caught up in legal hurdles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-smells-a-scam-in-rani-jhansi-flyover-delay-baseless-charge-says-bjp-101615150871542.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||Shots will stay free at all Delhi govt hospitals||The Covid-19 vaccination centres in Delhi government facilities are likely to continue with the free jabs even after the drive opens up for everyone, irrespective of their age or health comorbidities, a senior government official said on Sunday.Appropriate allocation of funds in this regard will be made in the upcoming Delhi budget that is likely to be presented this week, he added .The budget session of the Delhi government starts on Monday and it is scheduled to continue till March 16. HT has learnt that the economic survey and outcome budget 2020-21 is likely to be tabled on Monday, while the 2021-22 state budget — the seventh by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) — will be tabled on Tuesday.The Delhi government had proposed a ₹65,000 crore budget outlay for 2020-21, the highest till date and around 8.33% higher than the previous financial year’s expenditure. The total outlay in the AAP government’s first budget, presented in 2015-16, was ₹41,500 crore.In the 2021-22 budget, the government is likely to further increase the total outlay, said the senior government official.This will be the first budget by the state government after the Covid-19 pandemic struck the Capital, with the infection and the consequent nationwide lockdown severely denting the state government’s revenue collection by at least 42%, finance department officials said.The 2020-21 budget had been tabled on March 23, even as Delhi planned a week-long lockdown, and plans for a nation-wide lockdown loomed.VACCINE PLANS“Covid-19 vaccines will remain free for all in the government centres. Funds for the same will be allocated in the budget in this regard,” said the first government official.Currently, Delhi has 402 vaccine centres spread across 192 locations. Of the total locations – 136 are in private hospitals and 56 are in government hospitals. The drive is currently open for health workers, front line workers, people aged over 60 years and people aged between 45 and 59 years with specific comorbidities as listed by the Central government. While the inoculation drive was launched across India on January 16, vaccine shots for the last two groups only started on March 1. Delhi, so far, has administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines to 75,673 people aged over 60 years and 11,095 shots to people with comorbidities aged between 45 and 59 years , government data showed.In a report published in HT on Wednesday, health minister Satyendar Jain said the government would take two to three months to cover the first dose for these groups. While there are 2.1 million people aged over 60 years in Delhi, government data showed, there is still no clear estimate of people aged 45-59 years with comorbidities from the Central government’s list.Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India, said: “Extensive vaccine coverage is needed even for persons below 60 years, because of a high prevalence of comorbidities in younger age groups. Many people with those health conditions are unaware of them, especially in the lower socio-economic groups. Both to protect such people and to slow down the transmission, vaccines have to be administered free of cost in government hospitals.”DELHI’S BUDGET THEMEThe theme of the upcoming budget of the Delhi government will be “patriotism” and there is likely to be an allocation of funds for a series of events to he held across the city over a span of 75 weeks – starting this Thursday with a programme in Connaught Place – to celebrate 75 years of independence in India in August next year and installing national flags across the city, said the senior government official.The senior official said that the upcoming budget is also likely to have a proposal for setting up a new Sainik school in Delhi, apart from allocation of funds for Delhi’s own state education board which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shots-will-stay-free-at-all-delhi-govt-hospitals-101615150689157.html

08-03-2021||Delhi||Indian water gun manufacturers giving China a run for its money||In November 2015, Deepak Vats went to Sadar Bazar to buy toys for his son. A toy importer in the market, who knew that Vats was a manufacturer of plastic containers, showed him a sophisticated Chinese pichkari (water gun) and asked him if he could try and make anything similar in his factory.“I accepted the challenge, though I had never produced toys before,” says Vats, sitting in his sleek, first-floor office in Narela industrial area on the outskirts of Delhi.Soon, Vats, a mechanical engineer by training, got down to the drawing board.His team did a 3D digital image of the Chinese water gun, and after three months of working in the tool room, Vats was able to make the required moulds to fashion out his own water gun. In February that year, just before Holi, he went back to the Sadar Bazar trader with the water gun he had produced and also the Chinese one.“The trader was surprised and failed to recognise any difference between the two. He immediately placed an order for 15,000 units, ” says Vats. “That is how I first started making water guns.”Six years on, Vats is one of the country’s biggest water gun makers in the organised sector, who makes about 80 different kinds of water guns under the brand name of Kittu Toys & Pichkaris. “I really do not know why we should have allowed Chinese water guns to overtake the Indian market in the first place ,” says Vats, the only water gun maker in Narela industrial area, which has about 300 factories that produce household plastic items. “Making a high-end water gun for Holi is no rocket science.”It is a Friday afternoon, and Vats is busy overseeing the production of the last lot of water guns this season. He starts production in November and stops it three weeks before Holi, after which he gets back to making packaging containers. The assembly floor of the factory, which has the capacity to make about 3,000 water guns a day, is packed with cartons ready to be shipped to states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Chennai. “I no longer supply them to Sadar Bazar. The trader I made the first water gun for, sold it as a Chinese product. Besides, our new models are easily copied by small producers in the unorganized sector running factories out of homes in and around Sadar Bazar,” says Vats.The process of making a water gun, Vats explains, starts with creating moulds in the tool room , which has a Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) Machine Centre, and several manual lithe, drilling, and milling machines. The mould is then taken to the injection moulding machines and blow moulding machines. Plastic granules are fed into these machine to be melted. The hot molten plastic is shot by the machine into the mould’s cavities. Then it cools, hardens, and, now a solid object—a part of the pichkari –is ejected. “Chinese factories are bigger and have more of the same machines we have. It is the quality of the mould and the quality of the plastic granules that determine how fine a water gun or any other toy is. We have matched China in both quality and pricing, despite their economies of scale,” says Vats.What also goes in desi water gun manufacturer’s favour, he says, is that raw material — poly proypelne, high-density polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polyvinyl chloride — is easily available in India. “But post-pandemic, the cost of the raw materials has gone up by up to 50 percent, which could make us less competitive compared to china. The government should regulate the prices of raw material and ensure its steady supply,” he says pointing to sacks of plastic granules in his factory produced by Indian petro-chemical companies.For the past two decades, a common refrain among water gun traders in Sadar Bazar is that Chinese pichkaris captured the Indian market because Indian manufacturers could not match China in terms of variety, quality and quantity.However, Lokesh Kataria, partner, Star Toys, a company that manufactures toys in Gurgaon, including water guns, disagrees. “That we cannot match China in quality and variety is a myth. I have come up with over 150 designs in the last four years,” says Kataria, who was a toys trader before he started manufacturing them, including water guns, in his factory in Gurgaon, four years ago. “I started making toys on a trial basis; today I do not import anymore from China,” Kataria adds.Kataria says Delhi’s flourishing toy cottage industry is responsible for the prevailing image that India produces poor quality toys compared to China. He is referring to many makers of water guns and other toys in areas such as Bara Hindu Rao, Quresh Nagar, Kasab pura, Azad Market, Shahadra, among others. “Operating out of homes, they are producing shoddy pichkaris because they do not have modern machinery and use scrap plastic as raw material, instead of virgin plastic granules,” says Kataria.Until the 1970s, brass pichkaris were most popular in the country, says Satish Sundra, 84, who runs Ram Chander & Sons , India’s oldest toy store in Connaught Place. Locally made plastic squirt guns became popular in the 1980s. “But the arrival of fancy water guns from China in the early 2000s, upended the market. Some of the oldest toy traders and manufacturers became importers. The Chinese invasion of the Indian toy market had begun,” says Sundra.Most toys, including water guns, are imported from the coastal city of Shantou in China’s Guangdong province.“I used to manufacture squirt plastic water guns until two decades ago, but stopped when there was a sudden influx of Chinese toys. I felt I would not be able to match them in price and quality, and switched to making plastic suitcases,” says Basant Somani, who, runs Somani Enterprises in Narela, which manufacturers a range of household goods. “Today, I think we gave up without a fight.”Vats says in the toy industry, the key to matching China is introducing new designs every year. He scours the Internet and makes a mandatory monthly trip to Sadar Bazar, “Just to see what is coming from China and how I can make my products different,” he says. His latest and bestselling model is called Water Gun Racing Car—a water gun whose water tank is shaped like a car and can be detached and used as a racing car toy.The Atam Nirbhar Bharat campaign, he adds, has helped his products get a thumbs up from big toy traders who earlier used to import water guns from China. “They are slowly realising that it suits them to buy from us; they get quality assurance, can buy on credit, and get timely delivery. When they import from China, they have to pay in advance, and if a certain model is selling well, it takes a lot of time to import it again, or it may not be available. We can supply them any model within days,” says Vats. “Most toys in India are made by small and medium scale industries. The government must bring together engineering institutions and MSMEs to help latter make special purpose machines.”Naresh Gautam, vice president, The Toy Association of India, says the government should set up a toy research and development centre, provide rebate on import duty of machines and moulds. “Most importantly, it should ensure supply of raw material at a reasonable rate, which will enable us to compete with China in toys. Many homegrown pichkari manufacturers are already beginning to give China a run for its money,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/indian-water-gun-manufacturers-giving-china-a-run-for-its-money-101615150282752.html
08-03-2021||City||Stalin gives 25 seats to Cong; promises 10 lakh jobs a year and 20 lakh houses||Having inked alliance with all seven parties, including the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin on Sunday announced sops for people in the 10-year-vision plan, if the party comes to power in April 6 polls, while claiming that days of ruling AIADMK is numbered.Addressing massive state conference for its cadre in the outskirts of Trichy, Stalin said that the DMK government will give ₹1,000 every month to housewives and will create 10 lakh jobs every month.“We aim to lift 10 million people from poverty and increase per capita income by four-lakh rupees every year,” Stalin said.In the farming sector, Stalin aspired to bring Tamil Nadu among the top three states for cash crops and double crop cultivation from 10 lakh acres to 20 lakh acres. He promised 20-lakh concrete houses, piped drinking water supply and broadband connectivity for all households in villages.The announcement came on the day DMK is poised to fight 170 of the 234 assemblies with an aim to get a simple majority on its own. On Sunday, Stalin agreed to give 25 assembly seats and Kanyakumari Lok Sabha seat to its main ally Congress. Kanyakumari seat fell vacant after the death of Congress MP H Vasanthakumar last year.Asked if his party was satisfied with the number of seats allotted by its ally, Congress Tamil Nadu in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao said the only aim was to ensure the victory of the secular front led by DMK. The Congress had initially asked for 40 seats and the number is one of the lowest the party is contesting in the southern state for almost two decades.With this, the DMK has allotted 48 seats from its share to parties in the coalition (CPI, MDMK, VCK, IUML, MMK) with talks remaining only with the CPI(M) and a few smaller parties. Talks between DMK-Congress hit a roadblock as the national party wanted at least 30 seats but the DMK wasn’t willing to budge as they wanted to contest more seats and enter the assembly with a comfortable majority.“This election isn’t just for a change of government but for the DMK to remain in power continuously in Tamil Nadu,” he said while revealing his vision which he said was prepared in consultation with economists, educationists and experts.The high-voltage conference had mobilised more than one- lake cadre who had gathered in the outskirts of Trichy near Samayapuram toll gate at a 350-acre that was covered in red carpet. Stalin entered with fireworks and a DJ-team blaring his campaign song as he went on a one-kilometre ramp walk waving to the crowd.Trichy, being a stronghold of the DMK, is represented by MLA and party principal secretary KN Nehru and has had several such conferences in the past. “But this is the biggest I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said veteran leader Durai Murugan. Stalin recalled that decades ago, it was in Trichy where DMK founder CN Annadurai had held a conference and decided that they would enter the electoral fray.Three stages were erected for party leadership, legislators and second-rung leaders. The stages were enveloped by LED screens that displayed graphics as Stalin spoke of his vision.“People are yearning for a change,” said former Union minister A Raja on the sidelines of the conference. The cadre who had gathered from neighbouring districts said that they would win with more voter difference this election than in the 2019 LS polls. “From the crowd here can’t you tell that the DMK only will come to power?

With the reduction in the supply of raw water, the production at Wazirabad and Chandrawal water treatment plants (WTP) has reduced by 30%, and production has gone down by 15% at the Okhla WTP.Senior DJB officials said that the shortage of raw water at the WTPs might not lead to an immediate impact on the supply, as it takes at least 24 hours for the water from these plants to reach the supply stage. However, if the shortage persists, parts of central and west Delhi will be the worst hit. Water supply to areas such as Janakpuri, Uttam Nagar, Vikaspuri, Mandi House, offices at Barakhamba Road, etc will be severely impacted, they said.“Haryana has reduced the supply of raw water to Delhi, as a result, we are facing a shortage in water production,” Chadha tweeted.“...Further, Haryana government’s lackadaisical attitude has led to the unchecked dumping of sewerage into Yamuna. Samples picked up by our quality lab show high contamination/ammonia levels,” he tweeted.He said on behalf of the DJB, he has reached out to the Haryana government to find a solution to the Capital’s water woes, and also asked the Union ministry of Jal Shakti to intervene in the matter to find a speedy remedy for Delhiites.“Delhi Jal Board is in constant contact with the Haryana government requesting them to address these issues on a war footing, but to no avail. I urge honourable ministry of jal shakti, government of India to kindly intervene and direct the Haryana govt to release Delhi’s share and curb rising levels of ammonia,” Chadha tweeted.This is not the first time that Delhi has been caught in a face-off with the Haryana government on Delhi’s share of water supply. On several occasions last year and earlier this year, Chadha blamed the Haryana government for the increasing levels of ammonia in Delhi’s water, which led to the water treatment plants being forced to operate with reduced capacity and hitting water supply to several areas in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-curtailing-delhi-s-water-supply-says-chadha-101615149825140.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||Animal-friendly Ridge with no barbed fences||To make the Delhi Ridge safer for animals and birds, the city’s forest department is going to implement a detailed plan to ban the use of barbed wires and concertina fencing, which could potentially injure animals, senior forest department officials said.They said with the onset of summer, the department is also working on increasing the availability of water through natural channels in the Ridge for animals.A senior forest department official said district-level teams have been working towards minimising the use of barbed wires and concertina coils within the Ridge area. “The use of such potentially harmful items will be minimised so that animals, are not accidentally trapped and get injured. The wires will remain on the main boundary walls but inside the Ridge, they will be removed,” the official said.While instances of any major injuries to animals have not been reported from any part of the Ridge in the recent years, in July last year, a leopard died from his injuries in Coimbatore after getting trapped in a barbed wire. He sustained grave injuries to his stomach, neck.Delhi’s Ridge is home to several animal species, including Indian crested porcupine, Bengal fox, Nilgai, Golden jackal and blackbuck among others. There have also been sightings of leopards in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary and Yamuna Biodiversity Park.The forest department first floated the proposal to reduce the use of potentially hazardous material inside the Ridge in 2020. The matter was also put up for discussion before the Ridge Management Board (RMB) in September last year. The meeting was, however, cancelled as the file for the appointment of two of the independent members to the RMB was stuck with the environment minister.On Friday, during the first meeting of the board with the newly appointed independent RMB members, this proposal was discussed and was cleared. The RMB is a body headed by the chief secretary of Delhi, by the directions of the Supreme Court, for the preservation of the city’s ‘green lungs’.Currently, apart from having barbed wires and concertina coils in the fences, these items are used in various portions of the Ridge to demarcate sections and to stop encroachers from entering the protected areas of forest. For instance, in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, wires are used to stop residents from nearby residential colonies such as Sangam Vihar, from trespassing into the Ridge.With the onset of summer, when temperatures in Delhi soar, the forest department is working towards increasing the availability of water in the forest area through natural means. Officials said that water holes could be provided around areas with maximum animal habitation so that they do not have to solely depend of the natural springs.Experts said such initiatives will ensure that the only continuous green space in the national capital is preserved.Vimlendu Jha, executive director of environment NGO Swechha and the former member for the RMB, said, “All efforts for the preservation of the Ridge and its occupants are welcome. Depending on the nature of these water holes, it can also help recharge the groundwater. The focus should be on minimising the intervention of humans and man-made material that could potentially harm animals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/animalfriendly-ridge-with-no-barbed-fences-101615149588269.html

All the seven children delivered in the PCR vans during the lockdown are healthy, the police said. “These police personnel are not trained to handle deliveries, but they didn’t let that come in the way of helping the women,” said Esha Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (PCR).At Monday’s event, the police will also felicitate 21 women police officers for their works during the pandemic. “Fifteen women Good Samaritans who helped the police during the pandemic will also be honoured,” said Biswal.A host of functions to honour women have also been scheduled at different police stations and DCP offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/9-who-delivered-babies-in-pcr-vans-to-attend-women-s-day-at-delhi-police-hq-101615149387800.html
08-03-2021||Delhi||BJP plans new campaign to take on AAP after bypoll loss||In the light of municipal bypolls debacle, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is gearing up to take on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) with a new campaign plan and new strategy.Senior leaders aware of the matter said the Delhi BJP is planning to launch a campaign next month in which it plans to publicise the works done by the three party ruled municipal corporations “despite the fund crunch”. In the same campaign, the party also seeks to highlight the “failure of the AAP government in Delhi to deliver on its key promises”. The strategy for the municipal elections will be discussed in the Delhi BJP’s two-day long working committee meeting starting from March 12.Municipal polls are scheduled to be held in Delhi next year. In the bypolls to five wards, results of which were announced on March 2, the BJP could not manage to win a single seat. While the AAP won 4 wards, the Congress secured win on one seat.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “We are planning a mass outreach programme. We recently completed the puzzle parking in Lajpat Nagar. We have taken several steps to address the sanitation issues. We now plan to tell people about the achievements of the three corporations despite the fund crunch. We will start a campaign around mid-April when the corporations will complete four years of its third term in power.”Gupta has also started ‘mandal pravas’ (stay in each municipal wards) to connect with the party workers and supporters. “We have to go door-to-door and tell people about two things: achievements of the central government and the municipal corporations, and failure of the AAP government to deliver on its promises,” said Gupta, who will hold meetings in all municipal wards.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said there was a need to counter the “lies” of the AAP government. “Some of the policies of the AAP government are not citizen-friendly. We have to expose them. The government has paralysed the three municipal corporations by not releasing funds on time.From now on, as a responsible opposition while criticising the Delhi government for its failures, we will also offer our vision for those issues.”With over a year left for the municipal polls, senior party leaders say that there is a lot of time to strengthen the cadre and plan mass outreach programmes. “We are working on a plan to strengthen our base, especially in wards where we are not in power. In the upcoming working committee meeting, we will discuss the action plan and also work out a strategy for its implementation,” said Harsh Malhotra, Delhi BJP general secretary.Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, however, rejected BJP’s contentions and said the recent bypoll results have shown that the people of Delhi are firmly supporting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “The people of Delhi are very happy with the development works done by the Kejriwal government. In the recent MCD bypolls, the AAP won four of the five wards while BJP got zero. The BJP is ruling the MCDs for the last 15 years and today, the MCDs have no money even to pay the salaries of their employees. The citizens of Delhi are tired and fed up with the corruption in the BJP-ruled MCDs. On the other hand, the Kejriwal government has fulfilled all its promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-plans-new-campaign-to-take-on-aap-after-bypoll-loss-101615148923610.html

The ICP facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and movement of passengers from India to Pakistan and vice-versa. Officials at the ICP believe that trade would not be able to cross ₹2,500 crore this fiscal. In its first year of operation in 2012-13, the ICP saw a trade of ₹4,800 crore. The highest trade of ₹5,443 crore was recorded in 2013-14 though the ICP.After the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, the Centre imposed 200% duty on all items being imported from Pakistan. As a result the import of Pakistani goods reduced to all but zero while the export to Pakistan, and trade with Afghanistan remained as it was. Only rock salt was the main item which continued to be imported from Pakistan, due to its low cost.In August 2019, India abrogated Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. In reaction to this, the Pakistan government, unilaterally, cut off all trade ties with India. The Pakistan government also stopped India to export its items to Afghanistan. Since then Afghanistan has been exporting through the ICP. Onion, apple, dry fruit major items, which Afghanistan exports through the land border.Before this, gypsum, cement, plaster of paris, caustic Soda (flake or liquor), glass, soda ash, coal and rock salt were among the major items exported by Pakistan and Afghanistan. Similarly, India had been exporting soya bean, chicken feed, vegetables, red chilies, cotton, spares of automotives, biscuits, newsprint, plastic granules, fresh mutton etc.A senior Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI) official, from March 2020 to January 2021, when the covid-19 was its peak, 4,602 trucks imported goods, including onion, apple, dry-dates, from Afghanistan. He said, “In March 2020, before the imposition of the nationwide lockdown, 201 trucks were received from Afghanistan. In April, trade remained closed. In May, only one Afghan truck was received, as three in June and 65 in July. After this, import of onion from Afghanistan started and 500-1000 trucks started coming every month.”ICP’s manager Sukhdev Singh said, “Time and again, we hold seminars and meetings with the stockholders, including traders, to increase trade through the ICP.”Thousands of truckers and their drivers, porters and their helpers have suffered due to the dip in trade. Anil Mehra, president, Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association, said the Indo-Pak relationship had shown signs of improving and they expect a boost in trade. He added, “The Pakistan government should lift its ban on trade with India through the ICP. India should also remove the 200% duty. Once trade opens between the two countries, the potential is up to ₹10,000 crore and more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trade-at-amritsar-icp-dips-to-nine-year-low-due-to-covid-101615148114855.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Hundreds of Punjab women leave for Delhi’s Tikri border to mark International Women’s Day||Hundreds of women from Punjab on Sunday left for Delhi’s Tikri border to observe International Women’s Day on Monday. The women activists under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha travelled in buses, tractor-trolleys and other vehicles via the Khanauri border in Sangrur while raising anti-Modi government slogans. All farmer unions decided to observe Women’s Day at the Delhi border where women will run the stage and manage other responsibilities to show their power and unity. The farmer unions were running a door-to-door campaign and holding meetings in villages and towns to mobilise women for a massive rally at the Tikri border. Over the past six months, women have already protested as a big force in protests against the farm laws at the borders of Delhi.In Dhanaula town of Barnala district, around 600 women assembled at a grain market and they moved in around 12 buses along with their children. “Women are ready to fight for their land. Earlier, our brothers were holding protests at the border but now women are moving in huge numbers,” said Jaspal Kaur, a farmer leader.“The farmers’ agitation spread awareness among women and they are participating in protests. Even our children know about the struggle and stand by us. We will also maintain gatherings at the time of wheat harvest,” she added.Harbans Kaur, another participant, said, “Women are already playing an important role in the farmers’ agitation. There is no need for new farm laws. If there was, we should have been defending these laws. Our struggle will force the Modi government to repeal the black laws.”Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), said despite inclement weather, women marched to Delhi from across the state in hundreds of vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hundreds-of-punjab-women-leave-for-delhi-s-tikri-border-to-mark-international-women-s-day-101615148054509.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Women to take centrestage at farmer protest sites at Delhi borders today||From managing the stage, food and security to sharing tales of their struggles, and significance of taking part in the farmers’ agitation, thousands of women farmers, students and activists will take over key roles at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur protest sites at Delhi’s borders on International Women’s Day on Monday. Noting that women contribute significantly to the country’s farming sector, the organisers have laid out elaborate plans to let women farmers take centre stage and all the space under the sky to acknowledge the “big but unrecognised” part of the farming community. Thousands of women farmers especially from Punjab and Haryana will congregate at Delhi’s borders on Monday and the day will be entirely dedicated to women farmers, activists and students, farmer leaders said. Marked annually on March 8, International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating gender parity. “To celebrate women’s day, the stage will be managed by women, and the speakers too will be women. And there will be a small march at Singhu border, the details for which will be shared later. We are expecting more women to join at different protest sites,” senior farmer leader Kavita Kurugranthy, who is also a member of the Samkyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), told PTI. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur --- for over three months, demanding the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture. On the occasion of International Women’s Day, around 15,000 women farmers along with college principals, teachers and social workers will join the protest sites at Singhu and Tikri borders, the organisers said. “Women are a big part of the farming community but they don’t get recognised. In fact, they work more than the men. Approximately 10,000 women from different parts of Punjab and Haryana will come to the borders to be part of the women’s day program,” farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said. Sandhu said they have also asked women farmers to join the different protest sites in Punjab and Haryana on the occasion. Women protesters will talk about their rights, struggles and significance of participation in the movement at the two stages at Tikri border, one of the organisers said. “...Women will be taking over security roles at Singhu border. Hundreds of women from different parts of Punjab are coming in vehicles and will join us at the borders tomorrow. We are expecting a gathering of around 15,000 people at Tikri and 4,000 people at Singhu to mark International Women’s Day,” said Jagmohan Singh of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), Punjab. Farmer leader of Krantikari Kisan Union Avtar Singh Mehma also said that stage management at all borders will be done by women on the occasion of International Women’s Day. “Those delivering speeches on the stage will also be women, whether they are from a student organisation, a farmer organisation or simply an organisation doing social work,” Mehma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/women-to-take-centrestage-at-farmer-protest-sites-at-delhi-borders-today-101615147937710.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||86% Mandi Gobindgarh industries issued show-cause notices for causing pollution||Taking a serious note of rising air pollution levels, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has issued show-case notices to 205 (86%) of a total of 239 rolling mills and other industries in Mandi Gobindgarh, also known as Punjab’s steel city, as why their approval to run the units should not be cancelled. These units have failed to switch over to piped natural gas (PNG) from coal, said the board in an action taken report it submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday (March 5). Mandi Gobindgarh is among Punjab’s 9 “non-attainment” cities, including, Dera Baba Nanak, Dera Bassi, Ludhiana, Nangal, Patiala, Khanna, Jalandhar and Amritsar. Non-attainment cities are those which consistently fail to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 10 or NO2. The board has not served notices on industries in other cities so far. “We have issued notices for cancellation of consent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, as only 34 industries in Mandi Gobindgarh have successfully converted their re-heating furnaces from coal to PNG. Besides, 123 units have entered an agreement with PNG providers and are in the process of shifting,” the report reads. A board official said there are some technical issues between the PNG suppliers and industries over some clauses of agreement and the cost of switching from coal. The shifting process involves financial cost of ₹25-30 lakh per unit and three months’ time. PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said they are making continuous efforts to push the industries towards clean fuel to curb air pollution. “Earlier, we had fixed the deadline of March 31, 2020, for this and later we extended it up to December 31. We will cancel consent if they fail to comply and they will not be able to operate their units,” he said “A meeting was arranged between the representatives of industries, gas provider agencies and the department to resolve the issues last month. In some cases, the units have been leased out and the lessees are in a dispute with owners over bearing expenses of the process,” Garg added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/86-mandi-gobindgarh-industries-issued-show-cause-notices-for-causing-pollution-101615147394532.html

Rice is fortified by adding a micronutrient powder that sticks to grains in layers with a vitamin and mineral mix in form of a coating. Millers had been worried after a communiqué from the FCI on February 16, asking the millers to deliver fortified rice and start delivery from March 1. Following this, rice millers from the state had Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal on Friday seeking relaxations.“There are 15 fortified rice plants across the country. It is extremely difficult for Punjab rice milers to procure fortified rice and supply it back into the pool. State’s millers do not have the required machinery so the condition of fortified rice be made applicable from this year’s paddy season,” rice milers have said in their written communication to the Centre. Bal Krishan Bali, president of a section of rice millers association in Punjab, said most rice mills in the state are small-scale units and do not have the funds for installing the machinery that costs between ₹5 lakh and ₹25 lakh. He added that rice millers were ready to make changes, but some handholding from the government was required.Bali added that at the meeting with Goyal, they had offered that the bigger rice mill units capable and interested in setting up fortified rice units be allowed to do so with a fresh deadline. An agreement be signed for supply of fortified rice for a period of five years was also proposed. He demanded that arrangement be made for payment of delivered rice after a week, as it involved cost.Rice millers also demanded arrangement for additional space for storage of custom milled rice as in the current season 135 lakh tone rice is expected to come for storage. “The procurement of rice has been slowed, leading to a glut in the state and lack of storage space for other crops. We requested for additional space and the Centre has agreed to resolve the issue,” claimed Bali.ARHTIYAS ON STRIKE FROM MARCH 10A section of rice millers of state led by RS Cheema has announced indefinite strike from March 10 against the Centre’s move to make a direct payment to the farmers bypassing the arhtiyas. The Centre has sought land records from farmers for crop payment ahead of upcoming rabi procurement. “The state government is hand in glove with the Centre, as it is not taking up issue with the Centre for relaxation,” added Cheema, claiming that 28,500 arhtiyas in all 249 perennial mandis and 2,000 procurement centres were unanimous on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/breather-for-millers-on-supply-of-fortified-rice-as-state-fci-to-draw-up-timeline-101615147154609.html

When I refused, he slapped me. Then again when I refused, he poured inflammatory material on me and set me on fire,” the victim is purportedly heard saying in the one-minute and 27-second video.“We have recovered the video and put that as evidence,” said Praful Kumar, inspector general of police (IGP), Bikaner range.An official said the video was recorded by a local resident who did not wish to be identified.According to the police, accused Pradeep Bishnoi, who arrested for raping the victim in 2018, was out on bail.On March 4, Bishnoi broke into the victim’s house and set her afire. She succumbed to the injuries the next day.Bishnoi and another person has so far been detained in the case and probe is on to ascertain the role of a few others, an official said. “We are establishing the link between the suspects and the victim. In one of the footages, a picture of one more suspect has been obtained and the role of two more people has surfaced. We are connecting the dots,” said Kumar.Bishnoi’s father, who was questioned by the police, however, maintains that his son is innocent. “Police should take fair action.

08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Villagers pitch in take care of land of farmers who are protesting at Delhi borders||With a large number of farmers leaving home for participating in the agitation against the three Central farm laws on the borders of Delhi, villagers and panchayats of their villages are also contributing to the struggle that started over a 100 days ago. Villagers have formed informal groups to ensure fields of farmers who leave for Delhi are not neglected and the required work is done.From arranging labour for the farms to spraying pesticides, fertilisers and feed for their cattle, villagers take care of everything, so that the protesting farmer can go without any worries.In the majority of villages, farmers in groups of 5-7 are sent to Delhi in turns for a week or so. After the group returns, another group is sent with the returning members taking care of the land and other work. A resident of Kishangarh village in Raikot, Gaganpreet Singh said,”This is the time to harvest the potato crop and I along with my friends from my village and adjoining villages have been involved in overseeing the work being done by the labour in farms of Andlu village residents, who are participating in the protest. Even before the agitation began, the villagers used to share responsibility. We need to support each other for the success of the agitation.” Villagers say monetary help is not required in most cases as farmers have arranged labour and they have agreements with shopkeepers for pesticides, fertilisers and other requirements. The farmer asks villagers to collect material and he makes the payment after returning. A panchayat member of Lakha Singh Wala village, Harbans Singh said, “Every time a group leaves for Delhi, responsibilities are fixed at the village level, if required. When no family member is available for taking care of farms, the farmer in adjoining farm or some one else from the village is given responsibility. I spent five days in Delhi in February and my fellow villagers took care of my farm.”Sudhar sarpanch Harminder Singh Gill said,”Villagers automatically extend support to those leaving for Delhi. We also ask owners of adjoining farms to look after the farms of the other. This fight cannot be won without unity. The panchayat also extends help to farmers joining the stir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/villagers-pitch-in-take-care-of-land-of-farmers-who-are-protesting-at-delhi-borders-101615146854770.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||International women’s day: The women in Maharashtra’s politics||While Maharashtra has never had a woman in the chair of the chief minister, or handling top portfolios in the state cabinet, on the occasion of Women’s Day, HT takes a look at three women who are playing a key role in Maharashtra’s politics, and are likely to substantially influence the state’s political landscape – Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Member of Parliament Supriya Sule; Rashmi Thackeray, the chief editor of Saamana, mouthpiece of Maharashtra’s ruling party Shiv Sena; and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national secretary and former state minister Pankaja Munde. Among the things that stood out during the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was the role played by Supriya Sule, daughter of NCP chief Sharad Pawar. From crisis management for her father, after her cousin and senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar tried to split the party to form a government with the BJP, to advising the party top brass on picking ministers, Sule remained instrumental in decision-making. She also did her bit in getting her cousin back to the party; leaders say they share cordial relations despite the talk of tussle for the position of senior Pawar’s political heir. In the year after the formation of the government, she has been constantly travelling in the state to strengthen the party and also connect with the people. Hemant Desai, a senior political analyst, said, “Sule is an intelligent leader with a sharp political acumen. She has been instrumental in strengthening the NCP’s social media presence.” Her independent work with women’s self-help groups or the issues she picks up in Parliament, such as triple talaq, are notable, according to Desai. Following the attempted political coup within the NCP in November 2019, Pawar is trusting his daughter to play a much bigger political role, making her a very influential leader. While taking oath as an MLA, then 29-year-old Aaditya Thackeray introduced himself as ‘Aaditya Rashmi Uddhav Thackeray’, not only a sign of his mother’s role in his life, but also an indicator of her influence within the Shiv Sena. Rashmi, the wife of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is considered a friend and confidante by many Sena leaders. “We all go to her for advice. Her opinion is sought during all key or critical political decisions,” a senior Sena leader said. She took over as the chief editor of the party mouthpiece Saamana in May 2020, a sign that a member of the Thackeray family will continue to hold such a key position. Rashmi has stayed out of public glare. However, she has been Uddhav Thackeray’s most trusted adviser. According to Sena insiders HT spoke to, she played a key role in the Sena’s decision to break ties with the BJP and join hands with the Congress-NCP, when it became clear that the BJP would not concede chief ministership to the Sena, after the erstwhile alliance won the 2019 Assembly elections. When Sena leaders were housed in a hotel before the MVA was formed, after the 2019 Assembly elections, Rashmi is said to have visited them to continue building morale, and ensure they remain with the party. A senior Sena leader said, “Rashmi Thackeray or ‘vahini’, as she is referred to, keenly follows all political developments, has an opinion on them. She shares her opinion with us. She has worked very closely with the women’s wing of the Sena.” Manisha Kayande, Shiv Sena MLA, said, “She is carrying forward the legacy of her mother-in-law, Meena tai, who worked behind-the-scenes.” Pratap Asbe, another analyst, said, “She has a strong hold on the party. She may not be a mass leader, and is not in the rank and file of Shiv Sena, but she has influence on the first and second rank of Shiv Sena leaders.” The Thackerays were never directly in power until Aaditya contested and won his first election in 2019, and Thackeray took oath as the CM. “Rashmi Thackeray seems to have been instrumental in encouraging Thackeray to be the CM,” Asbe said. Sena leaders say she played a role in the entry of Aaditya Thackeray into politics. Aaditya is now a state minister and being seen as the undisputed political heir to his father.Pankaja Munde’s test of leadership was after the death of her father Gopinath Munde in 2014. She not only handled an unruly crowd of emotional supporters at the time of the funeral, but also managed to keep her flock together, even as things were not favourable for her within the party. A good orator with organisational skills, she has taken up the role of the BJP’s Other Backward Classes (OBC) leader, which also serves her support base, just like her father. Never hiding her ambition to be the CM, she survived allegations of corruption and a serious political setback when her cousin Dhananjay defeated her in the 2019 elections from the constituency she won since 2009. While there were speculations that she may join the Shiv Sena or NCP, Pankaja Munde stayed put. Recently, she was appointed the vice-president in party’s national executive and also given the responsibility to handle party organisation in Madhya Pradesh. She will now have direct access to the party top brass in Delhi. He said, “Her entire tenure between 2014 and 2019 was eaten up in infighting and a power struggle. ...Even her father had lost elections, but he stood like a rock afterwards.” Hemant Desai said, “Pankaja climbed up the ladder very quickly after her father’s demise. Despite losing the Assembly elections, she has managed to retain support from her voters in Marathwada and her relevance in the party.” Namita Mundada, BJP MLA from Beed, said, “The changes she has brought in have made it easier for women politicians like me to work in the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/international-women-s-day-the-women-in-maharashtra-s-politics-101615146674581.html

08-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The shrine’s best-kept secret||It’s one of the lesser known shrines of the capital and it is tucked within… oh well, another lesser known shrine.The historic graves of Hazrat Sarmad Shahid and Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah lie just outside Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid, and yet aren’t visited by many tourists, nor many pilgrims. Until recently, the shrine was identified by its red and green colours. Red symbolises Hazrat Sarmad, who was executed by Emperor Aurangzeb, and the green, or hara, commemorates Hazrat Hare Bhare. But as part of an ongoing renovation that began during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown last year, the shrine’s signature tiles are being gradually replaced by white marble from Rajasthan. This week, the outer wall too has been paved over by marble.Whatever, the two ascetics are buried next to each other, separated by a neem tree. For that reason, many consider the landmark as a twin shrine.That’s true only up to a point.The third grave—also of a mystic—lies in an almost-invisible corner, in a narrow gallery just by the entrance. The tiny place appears so dilapidated that not everyone will notice it, and it might as well be dismissed as an unused cupboard. The window screen is broken. The wall is defaced. The seeming neglect fills up the narrow place with melancholy. And the spot itself feels remote, like a cell for intense self-isolation.The grave belongs to Sufi ascetic Madni Shah Baba. Not much is known of him except the fact that he lived in the time of Aurangzeb. The shrine’s rose seller remarks that “these three tombs constitute a silsila (order) of mystics... Hazrat Sarmad was a shagird (disciple) of Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah, and Hazrat Madni Shah was a shagird of Hazrat Sarmad.”Meanwhile, the early impression of Madni Shah’s memorial lying in neglect dissipates on closer inspection. This morning, a fresh rose is lying on the chadar covering the grave. The ashes of the previous night’s incense sticks are piled up in a mound, while the dust-covered floor immediately beside the grave shows an array of footprints. Clearly, the third saint in the so-called twin shrine is visited by some devotees at least, even though he lies in such a cramped corner. This makes his resting spot a place for consolation and comfort for those who feel largely ignored by the world around them. For they reside fondly in the hearts of a few, at least.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-shrine-s-best-kept-secret-101615146135899.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Staff salaries not paid for 6 months, Bathinda govt sports school stares at uncertainty||The management of Government Sports Senior Secondary School, Ghudda, in Bathinda district is in a quandary ahead of the new academic session starting from next month as salaries to the staff members have not been paid since October last year. The arrears of staff at the school, run by a local committee headed ex-officio by the Bathinda deputy commissioner, have piled up to ₹83 lakh and the state government has yet not released any grant, it is learnt. The residential school offers 11 different indoor and outdoor sports for students of Class 7 to 12. Besides 13 coaches, there are nine subject teachers. The school has only two regular teachers and the principal is on deputation from the education department.The decade-old institute saw a ray of hope when the state sports department in December proposed to take over the school. It was proposed that it may be affiliated with the under-construction Maharaja Bhupinder Singh Punjab Sports University, Patiala, to boost sports facilities at the local institute.But no decision has been taken as the admission process for the next session by conducting sports trials is already done.Officials said a nod in this regard was needed at the ministerial level.A brainchild of former CM Parkash Singh Badal, the school was set up in 2010 to identify and groom talented players. Officials blame the state government’s model wherein the sports department had no role in running the institute.“The education department manages the institute and coaches and faculty members are being hired on contract. The sports department used to give nearly ₹60 lakh annually to budding players. But it was suspended in 2019 after anomalies were pointed out in the annual audit,” said an official.When the school was launched by then SAD-BJP government in 2010, a fixed deposit of ₹15 crore was instituted. Education department officials said due to the scarcity of funds, the school depends on ₹30 lakh received quarterly as interest against the FD from the bank that is insufficient to meet expenses.Principal Amarbir Kaur said the monthly bill of the school is around ₹27 lakh and measures are being considered by the committee to reduce the financial burden.“A decision will be taken after the ex-officio chairperson returns from month-long leave. There is a proposal to shift students to another government school located in the same village for academics while sports training may continue on the Ghudda campus. We are also exploring the option to add about 100 new seats where additional students may pay nominal fees,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/staff-salaries-not-paid-for-6-months-bathinda-govt-sports-school-stares-at-uncertainty-101615146314330.html

As per the FSI fire alert system, Odisha saw around 7,000 new fire points in the last 24 hours.The Near Real-Time (NRT) satellite observation from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) showed most of Odisha covered with red fire spots.Also read: Odisha doctor tests Covid-19 positive after vaccination, again tests negativeThe Similipal biosphere reserve in Mayurbhanj district on Sunday, which hogged the limelight over wildfire for about a fortnight, reported more and more fire spots as the inferno spread to more areas of the 5,569 sq km reserve. The fire alert system of the Forest Survey of India showed at least 127 fire spots over Similipal with almost all the fringe areas of the reserve seeing new fires."The rising temperature and lack of summer rain have made Similipal a tinderbox. In other years, occasional showers help keep the moisture in the reserve. But this year, there has been no rain for almost a month that has turned the reserve completely dry. A spark of fire is enough to start a fire. The tribals who live on the fringes have their own belief system and are still lighting up leaves in the forest to keep the forest bed clean. Though we have pressed over 1,000 people including 400 fire watchers, the task is becoming more and more difficult for us. Some amount of rain is necessary to keep more fires from coming up," said Regional Chief Conservator of Forest if Baripada circle, M Yogajayananda.However, Akshita Bhanja Deo, a member of the royal family of Mayurbhanj, said the tribal community is not being taken into confidence by the forest bureaucracy of Simlipal. "There is an immense trust deficit. Neither the local community have not got any incentive nor the civil society has been brought in with a detailed plan of action. Stripping away forest ownership from local communities means they are removed from the healthy upkeep of the forest. Even though NASA satellite images show the fire is active and burning, around the buffer zone smoke is visible from high altitudes. Fire can be seen on top of the hills. It is becoming impossible to walk through 2,000 hectares," she alleged.As per the data available with the Forest Survey of India, the number of large fire events detected in Odisha as of March 7 stood at a massive 918, which was more than 3 times what was reported on March 3 (296 large fires).Wildlife and forest expert Biswajit Mohanty alleged that this year the forest department has been caught napping as there was no proper and adequate plan of action. “It seems the state forest department is not alert. Since the alerts were issued based on satellite images, a readymade plan of action by the State Forest Department could have averted the spreading of the fire to new areas. The fire needs to be controlled at the ‘surface fire’ level only. The fire lines are also not maintained properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/more-fires-in-similipal-rest-of-odisha-officials-say-rain-is-need-of-the-hour-101615145816169.html
08-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab budget today, focus likely on agri sector, jobs & healthcare||Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal will present his budgetary proposals for financial year 2021-22 in the state assembly on Monday. The budget will be the last one of the present Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government ahead of the state assembly polls due early next year. The finance minister is expected to make fresh announcements and provisions for partially implemented or unimplemented promises with focus on the agriculture sector, jobs and healthcare, according to people associated with the budget exercise. The budgetary proposals also hold significance as they will be presented in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers’ agitation led by cultivators from Punjab and Covid-19 cases in the state are also on an upward trajectory again even as it has fallen behind others in vaccination drive. REVENUE DEFICIT GRANT, ADDITIONAL BORROWING Though the state’s revenues, including goods and services tax collections, have been hit due to coronavirus pandemic this year and only started showing signs of recovery in the past three-four months, the ₹25,968-crore revenue deficit grant recommended by the 15th Finance Commission, including ₹10,081 crore for financial year 2021-22, will help cushion the impact. Also, the additional financial borrowing of 2% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP), which has been allowed by the Centre to states, is also likely to give the state headroom of ₹12,000 crore. CHALLENGES FM NEEDS TO ADDRESS However, many challenges, which together paint a grim picture of the state finances, lie ahead for the finance minister. The state’s rising outstanding liabilities being a matter of concern for the past several years. The debt-GSDP ratio has risen to 40% from 31% in 2012-13 and much of these borrowings go into debt. “Expenditure is rising much faster than receipts in the state creating fiscal sustainability challenges. Its trend growth rate of total revenue expenditure was 11.3% against a trend growth rate of own revenue receipts of 8.5% from 2011 to 2019,” a recent report said. Then, committed expenditure of 62% of the total revenue expenditure in 2018-19 was the highest among major states in the country even as a pay hike has been long due for the state employees. “With the current resource base, Punjab needs to either increase own revenue receipts’ growth rate to 12% during the next five years or reduce total revenue expenditure growth rate to 8%,” the finance panel said in its report. Another area requiring attention is capital expenditure, which took a severe hit in the current fiscal, to create income-generating assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-budget-today-focus-likely-on-agri-sector-jobs-healthcare-101615145474275.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||One year of Covid-19: Online mode - a big lesson for education system||Months after the nationwide lockdown started in March 2020, 15-year-old Sahil Gaikar’s life was upended forever. He found out that his parents’ savings were nearly over. His father, Sandeep, a dabbawala, and mother, Kavita, a home-maker, had no money left to pay the rent of their Kalyan flat, buy food, or pay the fees for his sister, Pratiksha, and him. There was only one option left: to live with his grandparents in Junnar, Pune district. It was meant to be temporary. In October, Sandeep, Kavita, and Pratiksha returned to Mumbai – Kavita got a job at a local tailoring unit, Sandeep took up a job as a security guard as office-goers were still working from home and no one needed their lunch boxes delivered. Pratiksha got admission in a college. The money was still barely enough. Sandeep asked Gaikar to stay back with relatives in Sangamner in Ahmednagar, where he could join a junior college. Gaikar, who scored 73% in Class 10, wanted to join the Science stream, and that’s what he did, at a tenth of the cost. “I left behind all my friends and my house in Mumbai because we could no longer afford my studies in the city,” Gaikar said. But living on a farm, and attending college in a small town came with its own challenges. For one, his college does not have a proper functioning laboratory. Gaikar has no coaching classes nearby – something that he sorely missed. Internet connectivity is poor in the village and Gaikar has barely been able to attend classes after his college started in September 2020. “It has become really tough to study,” Gaikar said. Affected by inequality Millions of school and college-going students would agree with Gaikar. Online learning is revolutionary in many ways: it can take education modules to remote corners of the country and help supplement learning benchmarks for different age groups. However, when it became the only mode of learning during the lockdown months of 2020, the stark inequalities of class, caste and gender became immediately visible as thousands of children were forced out of the education system and thousands more faced learning setbacks. Between April and June 2020 the state education department collected data from schools in two blocks of each of the 36 districts to understand the means of communication that students had access to. Nearly 16% of the students who responded had no access to any medium of communication (radio, television or mobile phone); more than 26% students in the state did not have access to even a simple mobile phone. Inequities varied across the state. For instance, in Mumbai, nearly 88% students reported having access to phone. In another survey, this one conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) before the beginning of the academic year in June, it was found that of the 5.98 million students who had access to a smart phone, only about 57% had internet connectivity. A total of 737 schools (private and state-run) and 6,855 students (between classes 1 to 10) were surveyed. Students in remote parts of the state like Gadchiroli and Palghar were simply unable to attend online classes due to poor network and lack of digital resources. Reshma Agarwal, an education specialist at UNICEF, said the survey team realised that many children had simply fallen off the radar. “When we did the survey in June, we got the phone numbers of a few students picked in a random sample and within that lot 3-4% students could not be reached. We got their contacts from their teachers, but we still couldn’t track them down. We need to tackle the loss of a learning environment along with loss of livelihood, and anxieties that come with migration.” In December 2020, Leadership for Equity, a Pune-based NGO that works closely with the state education department, conducted a community survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on learning. The NGO reached out to 382 teachers and nearly 400 parents across six districts, including Pune, Akola, Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik. Almost every teacher reported that at least two children from their class had failed to return to school. In Mumbai where mobile penetration is higher than other parts of the state, data compiled by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) last month revealed that more than 60,000 of the 628,000 students studying in 2,387 municipality-governed schools, for which data was collected, have not been able to attend online classes due to varied reasons, including migration and lack of access to devices. Challenges for teachers“I started with a revision of all that was taught to the class over the last 10 months but realised that students had not understood quite a bit. It was shocking because I had never realised this until I took a physical session with them. In online classes, they seemed to respond well and also solved tests sent to them on their phones. But the fact that a large number of students struggled was left unaddressed till it became more apparent in the offline classes.” That was the experience of a 32-year-old Math teacher in Osmanabad with her Class 9 students on the first day back at school in November. Vikram Adsul teaches at a Zilla Parishad school in Karjat, Ahmednagar. The school is located in a small hamlet called Bandgar Vasti, home to members of the Dhangar community. When the school opened in January 2021, Adsul also realised what the loss of learning in a physical space meant. “We found that while foundational skills of students, including reading and writing were more or less intact, their ability to take up complex tasks and understand concepts in various subjects had drastically reduced. The response rate of students has definitely gone down and it is a cause of concern,” he said. The state education department allowed schools in the state to reopen for classes 9 to 12 from November 23, 2020 and for classes 5 to 8 from January 27, 2021. The final decision of reopening schools, however, rested with the local authorities. Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai decided to remain closed as the cases of Covid-19 infection were still high. Ashwini Sonavane, block education officer in Bhor in Pune district said parents fear that their children have lost a year altogether. “I worked in Bhamragad, Gadchiroli earlier and there, majority of the households barely have electricity. How can you expect students to attend online classes? The end result of this is learning loss and the risk of children dropping out. Girls, for instance, are likely to bear the brunt of this more because they are made to work in the household and in the farm instead of allowing them to study.” Efforts madeOn March 1, the state education department began a drive to identify the number of students who are not attending class across 100,000 schools in all districts. They will halt this drive on March 20. The idea is to get a sense of how many students have fallen out of the education net. MSCERT and UNICEF have also compiled some of these experiments into a small booklet which will be released this month. One of the teachers mentioned in this booklet is Smita Kapse, a 43-year-old Math and Science teacher in a Zilla Parishad school in Malewadi, Solapur. More than 50% of her students did not own a smart phone and could not attend Kapse’s online classes. So she came up with a strategy. Kapse reached out to her former students and formed a group that called itself Corona Fighters. This group, comprising 16 to 25-year-old students many of whom are either in college or working, began to hold physical classes for small groups of students in their own localities. “Each former student was allotted three students. Every week, I would meet them and guide them for the following week’s plan,” Kapse said. “Most of them are children of labourers who work on fields in the village. Their parents don’t even have permanent homes and having an Android phone is out of question,” she said. Between April 2020 and January 2021, Corona Fighters taught nearly 150 students. Snehal Suryavanshi, a class 12 student and one of Kapse’s former students, said she was happy to see the children keep up with their studies in tough times. “Kapse ma’am taught us to motivate these children to study by offering incentives like positive remarks or a toffee if they did well. This made learning fun for them. We are happy we could make a difference.” Meanwhile, Sahil Gaikar has made peace with the fact that he is stuck in Ahmednagar for now. He is keen to prepare for the army and navy entrance. “I miss my friends and my teachers and sometimes call them when I have some doubts with studies. But the pandemic has changed everything for me,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/one-year-of-covid-19-online-mode-a-big-lesson-for-education-system-101615145414568.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA govt all set to present its second budget today||Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar will on Monday present the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s second budget, which is expected to register a revenue deficit of more than ₹1 lakh crore against the estimated revenue generation of ₹3,47,457 crore, in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and months-long subsequent lockdown. Although the state has hardly any room left for imposition of new taxes, it is expected to tap the possibility of hike in excise duty on liquor and toll tax on heavy vehicles. The economic survey of Maharashtra projected the state growth to be -8% in 2020-21 and Gross State Domestic Product to drop by ₹1,56,925 crore. The cumulative figures of revenue receipts show the government could generate ₹197,996 crore (or 57%) till January-end against its estimated generation in the financial year. With ₹50,000 crore expected to be generated from the remaining two months, the state still stares at a shortfall of revenue collection by about ₹1 lakh crore. “As the revenue generation in the past few months has improved, we may end up registering a revenue deficit of ₹95,000 crore to ₹1 lakh crore. This will result in reduction on the planned spending on development works and social schemes by about ₹40,000 crore. The gap between the revenue deficit and cut to the spending will be made up by the borrowing. The state’s debt burden, which is expected to be ₹5,20,717 crore in 2020-21 from ₹4,64,020 the previous year, may rise heavily the next financial year. It may be around ₹75,000 crore- ₹80,000 crore,” said an official from the finance department. The state suffered in revenue generation from major heads like GST, excise and stamp duty. “Against the target of ₹1,07,142 crore, the GST generation of the state was ₹54,717 crore till January-end, besides a huge compensation of more than ₹25,000 crore due with the Centre. Revenue generation from stamp duty was ₹17,456 crore by January-end, against the target of ₹30,000 crore. Excise collection was ₹10,989 crore against the target of ₹19,225 crore. In the remaining two months, we expect 70% of the revenue generation target to be achieved. The major drop in GST was a result of the industry and services sectors getting majorly affected during the lockdown,” the official said. The official said the new projects and schemes are unlikely to be announced as the thrust of the government would be to complete the old schemes announced earlier. The state is however expected to consider reduction in duty and cess on petrol and diesel. It may also announce incentive schemes for farmers paying their loans regularly and one-time settlement plan as part of the farm loan waiver scheme announced earlier. The state cabinet discussed the budget on Sunday. Ministers were informed about the deficit, GST dues from the Centre and restrictions on levying any new taxes or duties. The state cabinet will meet again at 1pm on Monday for nod to the final budget before it is presented in both the houses at 2pm. Mumbai University’s economist Neeraj Hatekar said, “The economy is expected to be revived in the next one to one-and-a-half years and the growth will come fast from tier 2 and 3 cities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mva-govt-all-set-to-present-its-second-budget-today-101615145174612.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Aviation sector awaits successful vaccination drive; crawls towards normalcy||With the nationwide mass inoculation drive against Covid-19 underway, the aviation sector, which was severely affected last year with a two-month halt in flights followed by restrictions on domestic and international operations, has begun crawling towards some signs of normalcy.Last month, low-budget airline Indigo hired 32 new pilots who are currently being trained with 25 newly purchased jets, said an industry expert. “We have opened hiring for ground and operational staff,” an IndiGo official confirmed.To survive the economic impact of Covid-19 lockdown, all airlines had, in 2020, adopted cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, salary roll-backs or cuts, and leave-without-pay programmes. Private airport operators had also issued pay cuts to their employees. TeamLease Services, an employment portal that deals with entry-level and blue-collar jobs in all metropolitan cities, said while the impact of Covid-19 pandemic slowed down the pace of growth in 2020, the aviation industry is treading cautiously towards its growth trajectory. “While aviation industry salaries are better than national averages, the uncertainty around job longevity is very high too. Jobs of Indian pilots, flight attendants and ground staff took a severe hit during Covid,” said Deval Singh, business head, mobilisation (hiring), TeamLease Services.Singh added, “While India Inc. will see an average salary hike of 7% in 2021, most businesses seem to feel confident about their recovery and want to retain their talent. But the aviation industry, in comparison, will see a muted hike that will be less than the national average, owing to the fact that their road to recovery will be longer than other industries.”Stating that there was no reduction in 4,000-plus staff strength at Vistara during the pandemic, the airline’s spokesperson said, “In fact, we have been hiring for select operational roles, replacements of voluntary exits, strategic needs, etc. We will continue to invest in resources in line with our expansion plans.” Although domestic airlines are currently operating at 80% of their pre-Covid levels, passenger footfalls have recorded an increase with the roll-out of vaccines. Air traffic in January was recorded at 7.334 million; it was 7.327 million in December 2020 and 6.354 million in November 2020.Experts said the ministry of civil aviation is estimated to create 1,058 jobs this month which signals growing optimism in the industry. “Indian aviation sector is a critical enabler for India’s endeavour towards the $5 trillion economy. Financial year 2021-22, will witness a robust 78% year-on-growth in domestic air passengers, owing to the low base of 2020-21,” TeamLease said.In another indication that the aviation industry has resumed the recruitment process, Dr GK Chaukiyal, head of academics of Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University, an autonomous public central university in Amethi, said 25% students have been hired as operation staff in Hyderabad and Delhi in both commercial and cargo airlines. “Our students who completed their internships at Delhi and Mumbai airports have been hired by airlines and airports for operations and security-related jobs at the entry level,” said Chokyal. “Currently, companies in the aviation sector are preferring freshers to avoid paying higher salaries. Recruitment process will fasten only when flights start operating at 100% and after 30-40% Indians are vaccinated.”The Indian aviation industry is among the fastest growing aviation markets in the world. The country has 100 operational airports at present, and the government has also announced development of 200 airports in the next couple of years including airports, heliports, seaports and advanced landing grounds. Industry experts, however, said it will take at least six more months for airlines and airports to witness footfalls near pre-Covid levels. CS Subbiah, former chief executive officer of Alliance Air, said, “When we are not even allowing flights to operate at their full capacity (the government has allowed airlines only 80% of their flights’ capacity), how can the traffic reach pre-Covid levels unless the state governments ease their respective restrictions (like mandatory negative RT-PCR test report) and more people are successfully vaccinated?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aviation-sector-awaits-successful-vaccination-drive-crawls-towards-normalcy-101615145054134.html

His son, who was riding a pillion on the scooter, escaped with minor injuries.Jagram Prajapati, an interior designer and his son Amit, 18, were headed to the Bhayander railway station. When the bike reached Chandulal Wadi, near Cross Garden, a branch of a huge cluster tree fell on Prajapati. As per the video images, Prajapati and his son lost their balance and fell off the bike.

08-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Topic of emergency should be buried once and for all, says Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Sunday said the topic of India’s Emergency of 1975 is “outdated” and must be “buried once and for all”, as the current situation in the country is much worse. “The present situation in the country prompts us to say the situation during the Emergency was better,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut weekly column’s RokhThok in party mouthpiece Saamana said. Raut said newspapers and media houses are being controlled, many opposition leaders are jailed, public property is up for sale, and only some people are gaining from it, and those who point out this is wrong are termed ‘enemies of the country’. Those who speak frankly and sometimes criticise the actions of the government, including persons from the film industry such as Anurag Kashyap and Taapsee Pannu, were raided by the income tax department. “How is this any different from the Emergency,” the column questioned. Talking about the arrest of the Disha Ravi, the 22-year old environment activist for sedition, Raut said, “Why is the government afraid of a 22-year old? Does this suit the world’s biggest democracy? Such incidents erode the basis of democracy.” After a huge stadium was renamed after Narendra Modi, it is a resounding reminder of the slogan coined during the Emergency, “Indira is India”. Now Indira’s place has been taken by Narendra Modi, the mouthpiece said. The column also questioned if it is necessary for Rahul Gandhi to express that emergency was wrong and revisit the topic? “That topic has now become obsolete,” the editorial said. Praising Rahul Gandhi, the editorial said he is frank hearted, and what he spoke simply became a talking point. State BJP’s media cell head Vishwas Pathak said, “The Sena’s support to Emergency is understood. Even Sena founder the late Balasaheb Thackeray had supported the Emergency in 1975. The Sena is helpless and has to support Congress.” Shiv Sena’s Ratnagiri MLA and higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said, “Shiv Sena is with the locals who are still against the project. We have already cleared our stand and have opposed the project. Any party or its chief has every right to put forward their stand on any issue. The decision over it will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.”Shiv Sena’s publicity department released a video on Suday in which Raj Thackeray is seen staunchly opposing the project. “We would not allow the project to set up, let the government do whatever it wants to,” he had said in a public rally when the protests against the project were at their peak .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-topic-of-emergency-should-be-buried-once-and-for-all-says-shiv-sena-101615144875158.html

08-03-2021||Mumbai||U-turn by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena: Raj says revive Nanar to get jobs for locals||In a complete U-turn, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, has demanded revival of the refinery petrochemical project at Nanar in Ratnagiri, which was scrapped by the previous Fadnavis government in 2019 after all political parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed it. Raj has written a letter to his cousin and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to take steps for the ₹3-lakh crore project which, he said, has the ability to change the fate of the Konkan. In his four-page letter written on Saturday, Raj said that owing to the pandemic-ensued lockdown, lakhs of Maharashtrian youth have lost their jobs and the project can provide a much-needed boost in the employment sector. Raj wrote, “The locals had opposed the project fearing they will lose out on their lands, the ecology will be affected and there were also concerns about temples. All these are justified concerns but we have to find a way out of this. The state government should take initiative to convince the local with the help of experts from the field.” He further wrote that Maharashtra cannot afford to lose this project while referring to (without naming) American electric vehicle giant Tesla opting to set-up its office at Bengaluru and not Mumbai. He also wrote, “The government must try to make the locals understand. I know all political parties, including MNS, had opposed the project. However, times have changed now.” He said that the government can sign an agreement with the company to provide jobs to the Marathi youth. He also said the government can make use of technology to minimise the damage caused to ecology. “MNS will extend full support to the state. We will also work on a development plan and submit it to the state,” he wrote. Locals said they will continue to oppose the the project. “Raj Thackeray’s U-turn is surprising for us. MNS workers had vandalised refinery office in protest. We believe the CM is firm on his stand. The demand for the revival of the project is out of vested interests of the investors and business from Mumbai,” said Ashok Valam, president, Konkan Refinery Prakalp Virodhi Sangharsh Sanghatana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uturn-by-maharashtra-navnirman-sena-raj-says-revive-nanar-to-get-jobs-for-locals-101615144574038.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Professional course institutes grapple with time crunch to finish syllabus||Delay in admissions to professional courses this year has led to serious trouble not only for students, but also colleges. Colleges have been grappling with separate class and exam schedules for their first-year batches as compared to rest of the batches. However, most regulating bodies have clarified that there will be no condensing of curriculum for the first-year batches, despite most colleges commencing regular lectures only in February, leaving colleges and students with very little academic time to complete the prescribed curriculum.“Colleges started online classes for their existing students in September-October 2020 whereas classes for first-year batches started only in February. Our teachers have been working non-stop. Now, our concern is that classes for batches other than first-year will end by April, but first-year classes will go on till June-July at least. There’ll be no breather,” said the vice-principal of a city-based engineering college.The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which is the regulating body for engineering, pharmacy and management colleges, has clarified that colleges will have to adjust holidays and conduct extra lectures to ensure that the entire portion is covered for first-year batches.“We have asked colleges to use weekends and extend the academic calendar by a month or so in order to cover the portion. Condensing curriculum is not the solution. Colleges can instead cut-down on vacations as well as try to finish the portion by end of May or June,” said Anil Sahasrabuddhe, director, AICTE. He added that the next academic year might also witness a delayed start because of delays in the current academic year.Colleges, however, were not impressed. “There are two semesters to cover for the first-year, and with classes beginning only in February, we will be in a position to finish the first semester only by April or May. We don’t know how to finish the curriculum for the entire academic year by June,” said Dr RK Srivastava, professor and head of department at Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education (SIMSREE).Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months this year, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court (HC) for clarity on the status of Maratha quota. In December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state government decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of the socially and educationally backward class (SEBC) quota.The worst affected in this lot are law aspirants, admissions for whom are still in the process. The second seat allotment list for law students is scheduled to be released this week by the state common entrance test (CET) cell, and in all probability, regular lectures for first-year law students will not begin until the end of this month.“There’ll be a good possibility that the first-year batch for the 2020-21 academic year and the next academic year will end up studying together. The state CET cell has made a mockery of the admissions process. To make matters worse, the state government has not raised any concern about the fact that it is March and first-year law students are yet to start lectures,” said Sachin Pawar, president, Student Law Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-professional-course-institutes-grapple-with-time-crunch-to-finish-syllabus-101615144514040.html

The reason for the fire is unknown. The shopkeeper, who was cleaning his shop on Sunday, found the minor’s body inside the debris. Police have registered an accidental death report. Senior inspector, N Bankar, said, “ The body is completely burnt. We have the body to Sir JJ Hospital for post-mortem and forensic analysis. Initial reports of the doctor, state that the body is of a 12-year-old boy. Previously, shop owners registered a few theft complaints and harassment from drug addicts who would take shelter under his shop for their illegal activities. Very few people knew that a small part of the shop had an entry from the backside road. We suspect that the boy entered inside from a secret entry and while lighting the cigarette, the shop would have caught fire. We are checking in nearby areas for details of the missing boys. So far, we have registered an accidental death report. ” On March 1, a fire broke into a small shoe shop of owner A Gupta, near Kalyan railway station. The fire brigade had doused the fire and the shop was closed till Saturday. On Sunday morning, Gupta went to clean the shop with some workers when he found a burnt body in the debris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kalyan-shop-fire-body-of-a-12-year-old-found-101615144454402.html

08-03-2021||Kolkata||Battle for Bengal: At mega Kolkata rally, PM Modi sharpens attack on Mamata||Promising a 25-year development plan for West Bengal, if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins the imminent assembly polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday sharpened attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee at his first rally in Kolkata this year. The PM accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief of getting blinded by the affection for her nephew Abhishek Banerjee and looting common people to an extent that her regime might win had there been an Olympics on corruption.Taking on the TMC’s popular election slogan, ‘khela hobe’ (let’s play) Modi, during his 72-minute speech, said, “How long will the extortion and torture continue? People want an answer and they (TMC) are scared. That’s why they are talking about playing a game. They have played enough. There is no game left. Even ration sent by the Centre was stolen. I want to appeal to all people. Do not be afraid. Vote for the BJP without fear. End the anarchy. Victory for Bengal means victory for India.”"You have played with the lives of people. Khela sesh (the game has ended)," said Modi who used Bengali words several times while speaking in Hindi.Brigade Parade Grounds, the venue of Modi’s rally in the Maidan area, witnessed an impressive turnout, thanks to a few lakh people who came from the districts in trains and buses with innovative and colourful props. Modi’s plane arrived at Kolkata around 1.30 pm and he flew to the Maidans in a chopper.Also read: 'PM Modi bought ₹16,000 crore planes but...' - Priyanka Gandhi to UP farmersThe prime minister's speech focused on the BJP’s plans for Bengal’s development, corruption during the TMC regime, the plight of women in the state during the last 10 years and, not surprisingly, the Left-Congress coalition that has triggered the possibility of a three-way split in votes in some districts. Modi did not mention cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front which is part of the third coalition.While addressing a rally in north Bengal’s Siliguri town, about 570 kilometres away, Mamata Banerjee unleashed a more scathing counterattack around the same time. “I have never seen a prime minister lying so much. The only syndicate India has is the one run by Modi and Amit Shah. The prime minister talks of cut-money (illegal commission). A poor man may take ₹5 or ₹10 as cut-money. But what about selling national assets?” said Banerjee.The TMC rally and roadshow was held in protest against the rise in the price of LPG. “I am giving free ration to all people but they have to buy LPG cylinders for ₹900 to cook their food. You have to provide LPG for free. Tell them when it will be provided free,” said Banerjee. Turning at the crowd she said, “Do not vote for the BJP till LPG comes free.”Banerjee accused Modi of unethically helping big industrialists, who she referred to as the prime minister’s friends.Modi shot back in Kolkata.“The opposition says that I work for my friends. We all make friends in places where we grow up. I can feel the difficulties faced by my friends. I will always do so. I am working for my friends in Bengal. I have given my friends in Bengal 70 lakh homes and toilets. People working in the tea gardens are my special friends and for them, the Union budget has allotted ₹1,000 crore,” said Modi.Reciting a couple of lines from a Sanskrit scripture, Modi said, “When someone gets angry because of excessive affection, the person makes more mistakes and eventually loses everything.” He did not name Abhishek Banerjee whose wife and sister-in-law were recently questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the coal smuggling case.“Even I am not spared. Sometimes I am called Ravana, sometimes a demon and sometimes a ruffian. Why do you get so angry Didi?” Modi said referring to some of the comments Banerjee made in recent rallies.“The lotus is blooming because you (Banerjee) deprived the poor, kept youths unemployed. I know Didi for years. This is not the Didi who fought for Bengal. She is now being controlled by others. The remote control is in the hands of someone else,” said Modi.“The whole of Bengal is now saying aar noi anyay (no more injustice, the BJP’s slogan). The entire nation needs to hear this. This is the voice of the Bengalis," he said."The sons and daughters of Bengal are asking you questions after 10 years. They choose you to be their elder sister but you limited yourself to being the aunt of just one nephew. What about the millions of nephews and nieces? You could not escape from the same family politics that you spoke against,” said Modi.Indirectly referring to the TMC’s official poll slogan, ‘Bengal wants to its own daughter,’ Modi talked of last week’s incident when the chief minister somehow managed to save herself from a fall from an electric scooter that she rode in protest against rising fuel prices.He said, “You are not the daughter of Bengal only. You are the nation’s daughter. When you rode the scooty, everybody prayed that you do not fall. Thank God you did not because if you did, the state where the scooty was made would have become your enemy. However, instead of going to Bhawanipore, your scooty went to Nandigram. I do not want to see anyone getting hurt but what can I do if the scooty has decided to fall in Nandigram?"Naming some prominent Bengali women who took part in the freedom struggle, Modi said, “I am fortunate that in the last six years our daughters and sisters have been the beneficiaries of our welfare schemes. Home and toilets have been built for them. The Centre’s Jan Dhan Yojana benefits women too. They were given LPG during the pandemic.”“Is it not our job to think about the poor? It is a pity that the TMC government is lying to the poor. The state government could not spend a lion’s share of central funds. Is the TMC government not guilty? It has locked up central funds. Didi is determined. She will not work and won’t let others work as well,” he said.Pointing at the crowd at the Brigade Parade Grounds, the venue of many historic rallies since the 1960s, Modi said, “This ground has seen many patriots. And, this ground has also seen those who blocked the state’s development, those who conspired to stop progress with strikes. People of Bengal have withstood these for generations. It is because of their willpower that people never gave up the hope to see change.”He talked of bringing in ‘asol poribarton’ (real change) and building ‘sonar Bangla’ or golden Bengal.“You (the people) trusted Mamata Banerjee. But she and her cadres destroyed your dreams. They broke your trust. They insulted the people of Bengal. They tortured our sisters and daughters but could never destroy their hopes. This crowd is the living proof of that hope. Bengal wants sonar Bangla, they want peace, progress and prosperity,” said Modi.“In this election, there is TMC on one side, there are the Left and Congress on another side while there are the determined people of Bengal on the third side. The fact that a few million have turned up today proves that all people want is Bengal to follow the path of progress. I have come to assure you that there will be change. There will be investment, industrialization and 21st-century technology. The state’s culture and heritage will be protected. We will work 24x7 for the development of Bengal. We will live every second for you and your dreams. We will serve you. We will win your hearts with our service. The development will be for all,” said Modi.“We will build a Bengal where infiltrators will not find any place. People know what Bengal has lost since Independence. I have come with the determination to announce that whatever has been robbed from here will be returned. The next 25 years are crucial for Bengal. The coming polls will launch the first phase. The next five years is important. In 2047, when India will celebrate its 100th year of Independence, Bengal will once again lead other states as it did in the past,” said Modi.“Kolkata is the city of joy. It has the legacy and the possibility of a great future. There is no way it cannot be made the city of the future. A few days ago, a list of top cities was published. People want to see Kolkata in that position. Once you have the double engine government (the BJP at both the state and the Centre) all obstacles will disappear. Because of corruption, a lot of work has been stalled. The smart city project will get a new boost. All flyovers will be set up on time. Even slum dwellers will get new homes. Hawkers will get benefits from Central schemes. Other cities of Bengal will also contribute to the dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India)," said Modi.“The national education policy will be enforced in Bengal. Engineering and medicine will be taught in Bengali as well. The daughter of a poor man can become a doctor or engineer even if she does not know English,” said Modi.Taking on other opposition parties, Modi said, “Was it an Indian who founded the Congress party? The Left, on the other hand, was inspired by Karl Marx and Lenin. The BJP is the only party that is inspired by Indians and Bengal. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee inspired it. BJP has Bengal in its DNA. BJP can pay back this debt.”“The Congress came to power because of Independence. It worked for a few years but started the politics of vote bank in Bengal. The Marxists took this forward ahead. They said they would crush the black arms of the Congress. That is how they came to power and stayed for 30 years. I want to ask how those black arms of the Congress suddenly turned white,” said Modi, referring to the Congress-Left alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/battle-for-bengal-at-mega-kolkata-rally-pm-modi-sharpens-attack-on-mamata-101615141307693.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lab operator arrested over false Covid -19 report||Shivaji Nagar police arrested a pathology lab owner on Friday for allegedly giving a forged negative report to a 71-year-old Covid-19 patient. The arrested accused identified as Abdul Khan, 31, is currently in police custody till March 9. During investigation, police found that Khan had collected swabs of people who had symptoms of Covid-19 and allegedly generated false reports without even conducting tests for monetary benefits, said senior inspector Kishor Gayke, Shivaji Nagar police station.According to the police, Khan has taken a franchise of a pathology lab in Shivaji Nagar area of Govandi which collects blood samples and swabs of people to test for Covid-19. He later sent samples to another lab for test. The incident came to light in October when a 71-year-old man, resident of Shivaji Nagar area, approached him in the first week of October last year for Covid-19 test, said Gayke.Khan collected his swab and blood samples for test and sent those samples to a lab in Turbhe, Navi Mumbai. However, Khan then generated false negative report and gave it to the senior citizen, added Gayke. The victim suspected some foul play in the report as he had symptoms, so he got tested at another lab which came positive. He then approached Khan and the Turbhe lab, the letterhead of which was used for the report, and showed him the second report from the other lab which had come positive, added the officer.During inquiry it was found that the senior citizen had tested positive according to Turbhe lab, but before they sent the report, Khan generated false report on the letterhead and gave it to the senior citizen, said Gayke. “We found that Khan has duped at least seven to eight people by giving false reports without even conducting tests and took the money. Further investigation is going on,” added Gayke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-lab-operator-arrested-over-false-covid-19-report-101615144033996.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Shakti bill delayed further as govt seeks time for deliberation||The Shakti bill which has the provisions of stricter punishment for heinous crimes like rape, acid attack, social media abuse against women and children is likely to be delayed again at least by four months. The state government has proposed the extension to the joint select committee (JSC) appointed to deliberate on the bill, till the monsoon session to be held in July.The bill, named as Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, along with Maharashtra Exclusive Special Court (for certain offences against women and children under Shakti Law), was sent to the JSC of 21 legislators in December. Opposition benches and some women rights group had opposed the bill, after which, the state government decided to send it to the JSC for further deliberation.“The committee held several meetings, met activist, lawyers in Nagpur, Pune and Aurangbad, and has received hundreds of suggestions and objections. The JSC is yet to complete its work and finalise the revised draft of the bill. The committee needs more time, hence it was decided unanimously to seek more time for the final draft to table in the houses,” said Bharti Lavhekar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) and member of the JSC.Lavhekar said the JSC is looking at all the aspects including suggestions from some male organisations, and delay in the assent by the president to Andhra Pradesh’s Disha Act on which Maharashtra’s Shakti bill is modelled. “We want to ensure that the bill passed in the legislature is full proof and should be passed with due deliberation,” she said.Home minister Anil Deshmukh has proposed the extension to the JSC till the last day of the monsoon session expected to be held in July. The extension motion will be moved in both houses on Monday.By amending the sections in the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso), Shakti bill has hiked the punishment to the death penalty and fine up to ₹10 lakh for the heinous crimes against women and children. The bill has also made it mandatory to complete the investigation and filing of charge sheet in 15 days and completion of the trial in 30 days after filing of the charge sheet.According to leaders from the ruling parties the state government also wanted to avoid discussion on the crimes against women in the backdrop of the controversial cases raked up against two of their ministers recently. Social justice minister Dhananjay Munde and former forest minister Sanjay Rathod faced allegations of involvement in two separate cases related to women. Rathod had to resign from the post after BJP alleged his involvement in the suicide case of a Pune woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shakti-bill-delayed-further-as-govt-seeks-time-for-deliberation-101615143973990.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Amid Covid-19 women in science juggle with chores, childcare, research||The Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown amplified challenges faced by women. On International Women’s Day, HT speaks to women pursuing careers in science and are simultaneously juggling childcare, household responsibilities and research. While some have managed to overcome challenges, others have either put their careers on hold or given it up completely.‘It has been a learning curve’In February last year, just ahead of the first lockdown, Rohini Karandikar, 36, had completed her postdoctoral studies from the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). She was looking forward to joining as a curriculum and innovations manager at a city-based startup.However, with lockdown in place, navigating her new job from home, while engaging her five-year-old son was an exhausting task. “The first few weeks were filled with anxiety as I had to call-off meetings because my child needed me. The daycares were shut, hence the job of engaging him in activities had fallen on my shoulders,” said Karandikar, who was also engaged in other voluntary research projects. Her husband, a research scientist at a pharma company, is an essential worker and could contribute in shifts.“I made frantic calls to my friends to ask them how I could keep my son busy while I am working. Fortunately, my employers were understanding and supportive,” Karandikar said. She worked out a system of scheduling meetings when her husband was home. Along the way, she has found creative ways to keep the five-year-old occupied. “One of the things that worked well was asking my relatives to join in on a video call with my son. It was exhausting to look for those 15-minute gaps when I could concentrate on my work,” she said. Karandikar says it has been a learning curve but she’s resorted to scheduling meetings at 11.30pm after her son has slept off.Going from full-time PhD to part-timeThe plan to complete her PhD in 3.5 years seems near impossible now to Sneha Swami, 28, a research scholar from the Centre for Policy Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B). In the third year of her PhD, Swami had to start her field-work all over again in June last year.“My primary research work is in the area of the electricity distribution system. This means a lot of fieldwork and during the pandemic, it had to take a back seat,” said Swami. While she was pursuing her fieldwork in Pune, in June last year, following her marriage, Swami moved to Nashik. “I had to start over and make new contacts in the electricity offices in Nashik and get the relevant permissions,” said Swami.While earlier, living on campus in the institute, Swami spent around six-seven hours a day on her research work, now, on her own, she can barely work three-four hours a day.“Sitting at home, with no access to libraries, working a few hours has led to a lot of anxiety. I have always been inclined towards fieldwork, but since I was helpless, it started affecting my mental health,” said Swami. Marriage, too, has brought in responsibilities that keep her away from work at times.“From a full-time PhD student, now I have become a part-time one. I miss being in a lab and discussing problems with other researchers. Our team meetings are also few now. Fortunately, I have found a library here to keep myself busy,” said Swami.Working odd hours to fulfil research demandsArchana Iyer, 34, is a researcher at the department of biological sciences at TIFR and also a mom to a two-year-old daughter. At the onset of the pandemic, with the sudden closure of the daycare, non-availability of maids, Iyer and her husband found themselves in a fix.“I was involved in a research story that was close to publication but needed key experiments to be fulfilled within a limited time. My husband on the other hand is the owner of a company and had to work from home. The fear of Covid-19 brought uncertainty and tribulations and it was important to adapt to these overwhelming changes,” she said. The duo took turns to take care of their child, stand in grocery queues, clean the house, cook food, all the while engaging their daughter.“Since I lived on the institute campus, I managed my experimental demands by working at odd hours. We realised that the pandemic related trials would last long and we had to make the best of it. The biggest comfort was in the realisation that we could now spend much more time with our child,” said Iyer.She and her husband have now reorganised their daily chores such that they can contribute to their respective professional lives and yet manage their personal tasks. “This new routine became the new normal. It was certainly difficult but finding little positives all along we were able to cope,” said Iyer.Key takeaways:Domestic duties: “Doing all the household chores by myself stole a lot of time. It made me realise the contribution of household helpers and the role they play in our lives,” said Rohini Godbole, Centre for High Energy Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Found time for family: “The pandemic has been brutal and exhausting, as well as rewarding. Having teenage boys at home meant producing mass quantities of food. I’ve attended webinars and meetings while stirring a pan of veggies. However, this was the first time in ages that we, as a family, could share a meal during the day,” said Shubha Tole, neuroscientist, TIFR.Missing the lab: “One of the key aspects of research is getting together with other researchers and faculty members to discuss a problem. There’s so much scope to learn from these face-to-face experiences. While we all work online, the importance of discussing a problem and looking for solutions as a group is immeasurable,” said Amruta Muthal, a machine-learning researcher from IIIT Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-covid-19-women-in-science-juggle-with-chores-childcare-research-101615143373996.html

08-03-2021||Mumbai||Things to keep in mind during tax assessment||While announcing the budget this year, one particular announcement was greeted with particular cheer by high-income group (with an annual income equal to ₹50 lakh or more) earners: they would not have to pay extra towards coronavirus related cess. While there were no changes in income tax slabs, tax rates, or deductions, some investments that were tax-free will now be taxed, which means the investments we make from a taxation point of view will need to be revisited. With the deadline for self-assessment of tax fast approaching, here’s what you need to know.EPF contributionsContributing regularly towards employee provident fund (EPF) is one of the few investments that several of us rely upon. However, the Budget 2021 surprised many high-income taxpayers as the non-taxable portion of the fund’s interest has been capped at ₹2.5 lakh. Budget 2020 had capped the non-taxable PF contribution and interest each to ₹7.5 lakh. To save on taxes, the best way out is to stop making large voluntary employee provident fund contributions.ULIP investmentsULIPs investments had an EEE (Exempt-Exempt-Exempt) feature: The three exempts referred to the annual premium towards ULIPs; the interest accumulated over the period; the income generated from the investment However, now, ULIPs bought or issued on or after February 1, 2021, will not be exempt from tax if the annual premium payable on them every year exceeds ₹2.5 lakh. For taxation, these ULIPs will be treated like equity-oriented mutual funds. “The government is seeking to ensure that all investment options are treated similarly. However in case of the unfortunate death of the insured person, the death benefit will continue to remain tax-free,” Vivek Jain, head of investments, Policybazaar.com, a financial services marketplace, explained. In case the total annual premium of ULIPs bought after February 2021 is greater than ₹2.5 lakh, then the gains at maturity will be considered as long term capital gain. The current tax rate is 10% tax beyond a gain of ₹1 lakh in any financial year. This will be applicable whenever the policyholder makes partial or full withdrawals any time after five years. The idea behind this rule is to encourage people to stay invested in ULIPs for prolonged periods.Tax on propertyThe government is trying hard to boost the real estate sector. Even home loans have been reduced to boost people’s interest in residential property. Tax norms have been eased on purchase of residential property in which the property price varies with the stamp duty charges. During property purchase, taxpayers should check if the stamp duty charges exceed the agreement value by 20%. If the stamp duty costs more than the agreement value by 20% or more, the difference will be taxable. This means taxpayers buying residential property, sold in distress, can heave a sigh of relief as the stamp duty would not be more than the agreement value. However, this tax relief is subject to certain conditions. “The increase of gap between the circle rate and the notional deemed sale consideration for taxation purpose will help the developers liquidate their existing inventory. This is a relief for distressed sellers,” Sudarshan Lodha, Co-founder, a commercial real estate investment platform said.“In times of Covid-19, when property values under stamp duty laws are higher than what a property can get, a notional tax on a deemed value is a significant deterrent for the correction of property prices. A 20% deviation from the stamp duty value allows for prices to be reasonable and benefits both the seller and the buyer,” Sridhar R, Partner, Grant Thornton Bharat, an integrated Assurance, Tax and Advisory firm, said.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thing-to-keep-in-mind-during-tax-assessment-101615143134043.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC stays termination of Solapur university senate members||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday stayed a February 4 order of Solapur University wherein the membership of five members of the senate, management council and board of studies were terminated after it came to light that they had given false information to the media about the vice-chancellor of the university. The court held that the provisions of the Maharashtra Universities Act, under which the membership of the members were terminated, was applicable to students and could not be applied to senate members, hence the court stayed the termination order and asked the university to file its reply before the next hearing on April 6.A division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Milind Jadhav, while hearing five petitions filed by the terminated members, was informed by advocates NV Bandiwadekar and Milind Deshmukh for the members that the petitioners were duly appointed to the senate, management council and board of studies after, following the due procedure laid down in the Maharashtra Universities Act.The advocates submitted that on February 4, the university issued them a notice section 71(10)(c) of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 stating that their membership was terminated as they had provided some information without evidence to news reporter against the vice-chancellor of respondent No.1 (Solapur University) which was later on found to be incorrect.The advocates then argued that the provisions under which the members were terminated dealt with conditions of residence, conduct and discipline of the students of the universities, colleges and recognized institutions and the action to be taken against them for breach of discipline and misconduct within or outside universities. They concluded that as the petitioners were teachers and elected members of the said bodies the same provision could not be applied to them.Advocates PN Joshi and Nikhil Pujari for the university submitted that the termination of the membership under section 64 of the aforesaid Act particularly to clauses (f) and (h) was valid and sought time to file reply affidavits.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “On a reading of the said provisions we find that those can be invoked to disqualify membership from the above authorities if there is omission or commission on the part of the member to carry out the provisions of the act, statutes or ordinances or disclose or cause to disclose to the public any confidential matter concerning examination or evaluation.” The court then held that as the grounds on which the memberships were terminated were not as per the provisions, stayed the termination as an interim measure and directed the university to file its reply before the next hearing on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-stays-termination-of-solapur-university-senate-members-101615142654003.html

08-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC relief for Malad animal welfare society as derecognition order set aside||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday set aside a December 2020 order by the Animal Welfare Board of India which suspended and derecognised the Universal Animal Welfare Society at Malad on the grounds that cruel activities were being carried out at the centre run by the society. The centre undertakes welfare activities such as animal birth control (ABC) programmes. The HC, while setting aside the suspension held, that before taking such drastic action, society should be given enough opportunity to be heard.A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing a petition filed by the advocates Eknath Dhokale and Ahmad Abidi on behalf of Universal Animal Welfare Society, an NGO, was informed that on December 14, 2020, the Animal Welfare Board of India had issued a notice suspending the recognition of the society. The bench was informed that apart from the suspension, the society was also ordered to close down its ABC programmes at the Malad centre on the grounds that cruel animal welfare activities were found to be carried out at the centre. The advocates submitted that as the society was not allowed to give any clarification, its rights were violated, hence the suspension order should be set aside. Advocate RP Ojha for the Union of India and the Animal Welfare Board submitted that the notice was issued based on an inspection after the board received certain complaints about suffering and pain to stray dogs due to the non-availability of proper feed. The inspection committee found that the society was running the ABC/AR programme, SOP and ABC (Dogs) Rules, 2001, without adhering to the norms stipulated by the animal welfare board.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the inspection report of December 11, 2020, completely lacked particulars and said, “Before taking such drastic action of suspension of recognition granted to the petitioner for conducting Animal Birth Contract Programme and closing down the centre of the Petitioner-Society, the Petitioner-Society ought to have been given an opportunity of being heard.”In light of these observations, the bench said, “We set aside the impugned order dated 14- 12-2020 (society). If the Animal Welfare Board of India desires to take action against the petitioner, it shall first issue a show-cause notice and share the relevant material with the petitioner.”The court then directed the society to file a reply on receiving the show cause notice and a decision to be taken thereafter by the board. Thus saying the bench disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-relief-for-malad-animal-welfare-society-as-derecognition-order-set-aside-101615142478056.html
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: MIDC police recover 117 stolen, lost mobiles in a special drive||The MIDC police, Andheri, this month, traced the users of around 200 lost or stolen phones within its jurisdiction in 2019 and 2020. The users of 117 of the 200 mobiles have returned the handsets to the MIDC police, as they were not aware that they were using a stolen or lost mobile phone. A six-member team, comprising three officers and three members of the constabulary - made hundreds of calls a day for almost the entire month, to trace the users of 200 (of the total 300 mobile phones) stolen or lost phones. MIDC police had started the drive after Maheshwar Reddy, deputy commissioner of police, zone 10, had directed all the six police stations in the zone to try to solve and close about 2,200 small cases registered in 2019 and 2020 within the zone. The six-member team then started tracking all the 300 mobile phones, reported stolen or lost within its jurisdiction in 2019 and 2020. “For a week we put surveillance on the mobile phones and found that about 200 out of the 300 phones were switched on and were being used,” said sub-inspector P Thombre, who was part of the six-member MIDC police station team. “We tracked down the IMEI numbers of the 300 phones and found 200 of them were switched on and were being used in different states of the country,” he added. Thombre said that the rest of the 100 phones were either dismantled or were being used after changing their IMEI numbers. It was not easy tracking these phones, as along with the locations we also needed a call data record of the 200 phones. We called the dialed numbers to find out where and by whom the stolen or lost phones were being used, he added. “With the help of software, we eventually reached out to the 200 people who were using the robbed or missing mobile phones located at in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, Chennai etc.,” said Thombre. “We called up the users and informed them that they had been using a robbed mobile phone which made them an accessory to the crime, and they could be arrested for the same. We then asked the user to courier the phones to MIDC police station,” said Thombre, adding that we ultimately received 117 of the 200 tracked handsets. He added that the users from UP and Bihar were non-cooperative, but users elsewhere sent their mobile handsets which we have returned to their rightful owners. Twenty-two-year-old Niyati Menon, who works at a private firm at SEEPZ in Andheri (East), was one among those to get back the phone. She was boarding a rickshaw in 2019 when two men on a motorcycle had snatched her mobile phone and fled. The woman, who lost all her contacts, photos in a moment, approached MIDC police.She had forgotten about the phone and lost all hope when she received a call from the MIDC police last week that they had traced and recovered her stolen mobile phone. Menon’s phone was traced after a month of tracking, obtaining a call data record and contacting the user of her phone in Delhi. He was not aware that he was using a robbed mobile, said the officer, adding that he couriered the handset to the police station. “I had done a similar operation in Chandrapur which was successful and thought of replicating it here,” said DCP Reddy. “Today a mobile phone is more precious than money, for people are now storing all their contacts and other important details in their phones,” he added. He added that other police stations in his zone too recovered a few phones but MIDC police station got back the maximum. Five other police stations in the zone have together recovered 28 stolen and lost mobiles. It included the recovery of seven phones by Jogeshwari police station, three each by Andheri and Sakinaka police stations, five by Powai police station and 10 by Amboli police station. Encouraged by the success, MIDC police station has decided to also try track remaining stolen and lost mobiles, including about 100 handsets whose IMEI numbers are subsequently changed. “We will continue this operation and recover the remaining phones stolen,” said Reddy. A police officer attached to MIDC police station said maximum phones were traced to Karnataka which is emerging as a new market for robbed or missing phones, “Second-hand phones are easily available in Karnataka and many robbers travel there to sell the stolen mobiles,” said Thombre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-midc-police-recover-117-stolen-lost-mobiles-in-a-special-drive-101615142414336.html
08-03-2021||Pune||SPPU first semester exams postponed, students, teachers seek more clarity||The first-semester examination at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has been delayed. Earlier, the exam was scheduled to start on March 15, however, no schedule or timetable has been declared by any departments. The examination has now been moved to the month of April, and it has made students and affiliated college administrations confused about exam preparations. “The first semester exams are being postponed to April and conducting exams so late will not be right for the academic year. Most of the principals are of the opinion that the first and second semester exams should be held together. Since the decision is delayed, it is impacting student preparations. The colleges are not getting any clear idea about conducting exams. We will discuss this issue on priority in the SPPU management council meeting soon,” said Prof Sudhakar Jadhav, secretary of state college principals mahasangh and also a member of the SPPU management council. On the other hand, the college administration and faculties are confused about the examination. Sopan Rathod, president of SPPU teachers’ association said, “If the SPPU administration had begun the preparation of the exam in the month of January, things would have processed smoothly. As the exam process is getting delayed, now it is demanded that both the semester exams should be held together and many things need to be cleared for us, students and the college administration.” Last year, from October 12, 2020, the SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day onwards, both online and offline students faced a lot of issues while appearing for the exam and it even continued in the declaration of results. For offline exams, 113 centres were identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a one-hour duration. The condition of students who are preparing for the examination is similar. Priyanka Munje, a second-year science student said, “I am regularly studying for all the subjects of the syllabus, but as we don’t know when exams are going to be held it is becoming difficult to plan our timetable. We hope that SPPU doesn’t declare the exam schedule suddenly since we need some time for revision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-first-semester-exams-postponed-students-teachers-seek-more-clarity-101615142353397.html

08-03-2021||Pune||PMC to organise monthly collection drive at 300 centres for e-waste||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) solid waste department has decided to organize a monthly collection program at 300 centres for e-waste and plastic waste. Recently, the PMC organized a one-day e-waste and plastic waste collection received a good response. The PMC held a Swachhta week between February 20 to 27 for the awareness and collection of e-waste and plastic waste. On February 28 (Sunday), the civic body set up 300 collection centres and collected 15 tonnes of e-waste and eight tonnes of plastic waste in a day. The drive was organized with the help of a non-government organization. According to PMC, the Pune region, which includes Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the cantonment areas around Pune and the IT belt in Hinjewadi, generates around 10,000 metric tonnes of e-waste per annum. E-waste is classified as a hazardous waste because it contains many toxic ingredients including halogenated compounds PCBs and heavy metals. Dr Kunal Khemnar, PMC additional municipal commissioner said, “We received a good response from people in the e-waste and plastic collection drive. We have decided to continue the 300 collection centres which were temporarily set up during the drive and conduct it on a monthly basis. Besides, we are continuously taking action under the plastic ban drive in the city.” Dr Ketki Ghatge, assistant medical officer of health, PMC solid waste management department said, “In this initiative, the PMC reached over five lakh people. We received a good response. The NGOs, self-help groups (SHGs), Mohalla committees took part in this campaign. On the background of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were a lot of computers, laptop and computer-related accessories in e-waste.” She further said, “We have decided to organize a one-day collection drive in a month. We will campaign on social media as well as distribute pamphlets and handbills for creating awareness on plastic and e-waste.” The Maharashtra government had in March 2018 issued a notification banning the manufacture, sale and use of single-use plastic bags. It also banned an array of plastic products including cutlery, straws and containers. The ban imposes a penalty between ₹5,000 and ₹25,000 for those violating the rules. The city generates around 2,100 tons of garbage daily in which the plastic share is around 12 per cent. It increases during festival seasons and reaches 15 per cent. Plastic waste contains milk bags, oil bags, food bags, yoghurt containers, plastic glasses, cooking oil canisters laminate tubes (toothpaste, medicines ), carry bags ( all micron thickness) blister packing, bubble wraps, shampoo powder bottles, empty sachets, detergent bags, wrappers cassettes, CD covers, plastic flowers, buckets among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-organise-monthly-collection-drive-at-300-centres-for-ewaste-101615142293451.html

Local residents of the area are complaining of illness due to the supply of turbid water. Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Material that causes water to be turbid include clay, silt, very tiny inorganic and organic matter, algae, dissolved coloured organic compounds, and plankton and other microscopic organisms. After a long delay, the project to supply Bhama-Askhed water through a closed pipeline to the eastern part of the city was completed in December 2020. After the inauguration of the Bhama-Askhed water scheme in January 2021, the civic body began a trial run to supply water to the eastern part of the city. Two months later, the PMC has not been able to supply drinking water to the entire eastern part of the city as it is still facing problems of water turbidity in some parts of the Yerawada area. Anirudha Pawaskar, chief superintendent engineer of the PMC water supply department said, “There are some parts in Yerawada where people are getting turbid water. We have received complaints from local corporators and residents. Now, we have stopped the Bhama-Askhed water supply in that area and water is supplied from the Pune Cantonment water treatment and supply centre from where Yerwada used to get water earlier. The turbidity is high, and I have given instructions to engineers to wash pipelines and clear turbidity before starting the supply.” The project was initiated to provide water to Kalas, Sangamwadi, Yerawada, Lohegaon, Dhanori, Kalyaninagar, Vadgaonsheri and Kharadi. The 200 MLD project is expected to meet the water supply needs of the region until 2041 when the local population is estimated to have increased to 14.5 lakh. The project was started in 2013 and has been completed in December 2020. No water in Kharadi yet Bapu Pathare, former Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Wadgaonsheri area who pushed for the Bhama-Askhed water project during his tenure, said, “I took an initiative and pushed for the Bhama-Askhed water project, it is my brainchild. However, we are not getting water in the Kharadi area where I live.

Anush is among the many students pursuing degrees or wanting to study from the foreign universities whose plans have been disrupted by the Covid pandemic. Their period of uncertainty has now changed into anxiety as the virus-related restrictions have extended in many parts of the world. “I had begun the application process for permanent citizenship in Canada two years back. After I received the clearance documents around March 13-14 last year, I had planned to leave on March 28, but all flights after March 20 were cancelled,” said Anush of Sinhgad road, who did his Masters in Computer Network from New Zealand. Like, Anush, another student Rohit Mahajan, a city architect, who wanted to pursue a post graduate degree in Construction Management from a university in the United States, had to postpone his date of joining the course due to the pandemic. “I had applied in August last year for the spring batch. It was supposed to start in January 2021. I had finalised to join the Texas A&M university. With the Covid outbreak, I waited till October-November hoping that the number of positive cases will drop. By December, I decided that come what may, I will go to the US and I started applying for the visa dates, but could not get the dates. I was told that there was a lot of backlog of previous applications as the visa offices were closed. Hence, I differed my intake to fall in July-end,” said Rohit. Meanwhile, most of the students who were studying in China and returned to India after they were evacuated last year are continuing their education online. Though, after a year, they are trying to get adjusted to the routine of virtual classes. On January 31, 2020, Jaydip Devkate, a 21-year-medical student from Pimpri-Chinchwad, left his college located in Xianning city in Hubei province in China with her 30 batchmates to return to India. He was looking forward to resume offline studies when the Covid situation would normalise. “We are still waiting for the official clearance to return. The Chinese government is yet to start the visa procedure,” said Jaydip. “While in college our lecture used to start at 7.30 am. Now, because of the early time difference (China is 2:30 hours ahead of India), we have to get up early for classes. We have requested the teachers to reschedule the online classes to suitable timings,” he said. To compensate for practical lessons, Jaydip is planning to do internship at a local hospital. Saloni Tribhuvan, a 23-year-old medical student from the same university, said that studying from home is not fruitful and she was looking forward to continue her college and hostel routine again. “We have been missing practical lessons for almost a year. We learn from videos though it is not enough. As medical students we will have more confidence if we see and do things personally. We cannot pay full attention at home like we do in a classroom,” Saloni said. Shreya Ranade, 21, is pursuing her bachelors in Chinese language and literature from Soochow University in Jiangsu province in China. Shreya returned to India in the first week of January 2020 during the spring break and was planning to return. “As a language student, it is essential for me to have a proper communication in the language I am studying. I need to regularly hear and speak the language that I am learning. So, if I get an opportunity to go back I would definitely do so,” Shreya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/under-the-shadow-of-uncertainty-students-of-foreign-universities-hope-to-pursue-their-dreams-101615142053422.html
