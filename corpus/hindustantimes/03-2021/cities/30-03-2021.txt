The administration will take a call on whether to impose partial lockdown in the areas reporting maximum new cases based on the reports of the surveillance teams. District magistrate Suhas L Y said it is not easy to put restrictions in place, especially when all commercial activities are open. “The district being an industrial hub has a floating population. We cannot permit any callous approach that may facilitate the spread of the infection. Since many Covid-19 cases have emerged in the last 15 days, we have asked the surveillance teams to find the pockets with maximum caseload. We’ll ask the residents’ associations of those areas to restrict the movement of people and commercial activities,” he said. Suhas added health officials have been asked to increase surveillance at public places and also enhance contact tracing of patients. “We are aware that the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi has a direct impact on the neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. We don’t have any option apart from proper surveillance and taking all precautionary measures to check the further spread of Covid-19,” he said. Attributing massive vehicular movement on the Delhi-Noida border for the surge in Covid-19 cases, the district magistrate said, “In the meeting with the officials of different departments today (Tuesday), I have asked them to make provisions for Covid-19 helpdesk at their establishments and not allow entry to any employee having influenza-like symptoms, like high fever and cough. Health officials have been asked to conduct up to 7,000 tests daily and enhance contact tracing in the district. They have also been asked to keep a vigil in the crowded areas. If the situation does not improve, the administration will have no option but to impose restrictions and chalk out containment zones in the critical areas,” said Suhas. Echoing similar views, Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (CMO), said after the first Covid-19 case was detected on March 8 last year, it took 386 days for the overall case tally to cross the 26,000-mark in the district on March 28 this year. “After January 2, when the overall case tally reached the 25,000-mark, the infection rate was comparatively slow with 73 active cases in the district as on March 15. After March 15, the district recorded 387 cases in 14 days, which means the last 1,000 Covid-19 cases have been added in 85 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-crisis-gb-nagar-increases-surveillance-may-go-for-pocket-level-curbs-101617128809439.html

As per the health department data, about 1.60 lakh persons were tested last week as compared to about 1.33 lakh the week before.“Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and rapid antigen testing ratio in the past 30 days is 98:2 which indicates that we are heavily focused on RT-PCR testing, which is considered the gold standard for Covid diagnosis,” said additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora.Arora said that more than 1.63 lakh individuals were vaccinated on Tuesday during the mega-vaccination drive. “We are close to vaccinating 15 lakh people,” the ACS said.Ambala with over 25,000 inoculations led the way followed by Sonepat with 20,042, Gurugram 15,036, Faridabad 11,507, Bhiwani 9,316, and Sirsa 9,007.However, certain districts with higher number of active cases seem to be lagging in inoculating its population.

30-03-2021||Chandigarh||Cong slams Haryana govt over electricity deposits||The Congress on Tuesday slammed the BJP-JJP government in Haryana for asking electricity consumers of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) to deposit advance consumption deposit (ACD).The DHBVN had recently decided that all active consumers will pay advance security amount equal to two average billing cycles in a financial year as per instructions of the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission.Due to the pandemic, the power distribution corporation had postponed review of the ACD last fiscal.Former Haryana minister and Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala demanded immediate withdrawal of the decision. Surjewala said that the Khattar-Chautala government is constantly trying to invent new ways of harassing the common man.“Due to this new decision, electricity consumers are getting exorbitantly inflated bills on account of which there is a widespread resentment among power consumers,” Surjewala added.Congress MLA from Faridabad NIT, Neeraj Sharma said that imposition of ACD will put a big financial burden on the consumers.“The best way will be to raise a bill every month instead of a two-month billing cycle. Also, the line losses of DHBVN are lower than UHBVN and the cost of service of DHBVN was lower by 0.59 paisa as compared to UHBVN,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-slams-haryana-govt-over-electricity-deposits-101617126349892.html
30-03-2021||Chandigarh||Govt can restrict right of an employee to apply elsewhere: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court held that an employer has a right to restrict its employee from applying elsewhere to defeat the practice of those in public employment hopping from one job to another.The HC bench of justice Anil Kshetrapal said that selection of a public servant consumes a lot of time and involves a lot of expenditure for the employer. And contract conditions that are unlawful or forbidden by the law cannot be imposed. But to stop job-hoppers, certain conditions can be imposed.In the case in hand, Yogesh Kumar Vashisht was an assistant professor with the department of forensic medicine at the Bhagat Phool Singh Government Medical College for Women in Khanpur Kalan, Sonepat.In 2019, he had applied for the post of assistant professor at Pandit BD Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak.However, he was denied no-objection certificate (NOC) by the institute. He had challenged this decision in the HC, arguing that the contract signed at the time of employment with the clause as in given case is “unconscionable” and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as it deprives a person the right to equality before law.At the time of employment, the bargaining power between an employee and the state is unequal and thus, the employee has no other option but to sign on the dotted line, the petitioner had argued.The court found that at the time of employment, Vashisht had signed a contract according to which he was not to get NOC till completion of five years of service. If he was to resign, he was to submit three-month advance notice or deposit three months’ salary.Another condition was that the resignation will be accepted only after arrangement of a suitable substitute in his place so that studies of students and patient care do not get affected.The court observed that the restrictions imposed are only for a period of five years and that the petitioner could not have applied for the same post. There is no restriction on applying for a higher post.“By now, it is well known that sometimes qualified persons indulge in job-hopping. Such clause has been incorporated to curb such practices,” the bench said, adding that selection of a public servant consumes a lot of time and involves a lot of expenditure for the employer.“If the teacher, who has been appointed after following a long process, is allowed to hop from one job to another immediately after joining, then students are likely to suffer,” it added, dismissing the plea.The court said that the clause is not in violation of Article 14 and the Indian Contract Act. Rule 21 of the Haryana Medical Education Service Rules, 1988, enables an employer to impose special terms and conditions in the order of appointment. If the petitioner wants to resign, he has to comply with the rules and terms of the appointment letter, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-can-restrict-right-of-an-employee-to-apply-elsewhere-hc-101617126118943.html

30-03-2021||Lucknow||For UP government departments, all roads lead to treasuries on closing day||With the state government allowing them to submit bills up to March 31, the last day of current financial year, various departments are making last minute rush to the treasuries to get payments for works.The decision to allow the departments to submit their bills till the last day of financial year has been taken in view of increased work pressure on drawing and disbursing officers in the month of March.“Keeping in view the problems of the departments, I have been asked to convey that all the drawing and disbursing officers may submit their bills to the treasuries in time by March 31. This will ensure that treasuries make e-payment for the bills passed in the current financial year,” said additional chief secretary (ACS) finance S Radha Chauhan in an order dated March 26 and sent to all the ACSs, heads of department, divisional commissioners and district magistrates. ACS finance, in her order, has also noted that the decision to allow submission of bills up to March 31 was taken as the departments may not have been able to submit their bills by the deadline (March 25).The state government, in its orders issued on March 8, had asked the departments to issue all the financial sanctions by March 15 and ensure that the bills were submitted to treasuries for payment by March 25.A close analysis of the functioning of various departments indicates that the departments were issuing financial sanctions for various works after March 15.The state government’s departments have issued more than 1,330 government orders (mostly financial sanctions) from March 15 to March 30 against nearly 1,230 government orders issued during the same period in 2020. These include sanctions issued for buying land for the defence corridor in Aligarh and Lucknow, shifting of utilities for Ganga Expressway (Prayagraj to Meerut), remodeling of Ram-ki-Pedi project and carry out various works for development of Maryada Purusottam Sriram Airport, Ayodhya and NOIDA International Airport (Jewar), Gautam Buddha Nagar. While the ACS finance and other senior officers of the state government were not available for comments those aware with the development said this was not for the first time that departments were are issuing sanctions in the last month of any financial year or making last minute rush to submit their bills to the treasuries. The state government’s departments have been doing so in recent years to ensure that the funds allocated to them do not lapse. Yes, there is a pattern to issue sanctions at the last minute. Ideally, this last-minute rush should be avoided to ensure greater transparency and better utilization of funds. But the departments may have some compulsions after decision to scrap the public ledger accounts. The departments obviously want to ensure that the funds allocated to them are used,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor department of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/for-up-government-departments-all-roads-lead-to-treasuries-on-closing-day-101617124489287.html
30-03-2021||Ranchi||BJP seeks action against Cong MLA for ‘violating’ Covid-19 protocol on Holi||Even as Jharkhand celebrated Holi in a guarded manner on Monday following the state government prohibiting celebration at public places due to rising number of coronavirus cases, the BJP has demanded action against Congress Barkagaon legislator for allegedly participating in a public gathering on the occasion.Major political parties and leaders dropped their public events in light of the government order. However, Congress MLA Amba Prasad allegedly took part in ‘Matka Phod’ (breaking a suspended earthen pot ) event at her native village of Pahragaon. “We demanded relaxation on celebrations of Holi and Ram Navami from the government but it ordered a blanket ban on these celebrations. Violation of the order invites action under the Pandemic Act. Now, when a legislator from the ruling party violated government’s order, police took no action even after 24 hours,” alleged state BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.The government in its order issued last Friday directed all district administrations and concerned authorities that , celebrations and congregations at public places during festivals such as Holi, Sarhul, Shab-e-Barat, Navaratri, Ram Navami Easter etc shall not be allowed in the state. People may celebrate Holi with family members inside their respective houses only, the order said. Shahdeo said, “All rules for social distancing and wearing masks were violated at the event in which the Congress MLA took part. Was this ban effective only for common people and not legislators of ruling parties?”However, when contacted, the Congress MLA said the gathering at the event was a limited one. “I am a public representative. So, I have to keep their sentiments in mind. In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, the programme was organized for a very short duration. There is not a single positive case in my village. Besides, it was a gathering of very few villagers,” said Prasad.The Congress MLA hit back at the BJP, saying that the party should take note of its leaders’s actions before targeting her. “Everyone can see the way in which Covid-19 protocols are being violated by top BJP leaders during Bengal elections.”Meanwhile, the charm of the festival was missing across the state this Holi in view of the pandemic. Most people preferred to celebrate indoors or in colonies. Very few Holi revelers were seen on streets.“I was in a double mind whether or not to play Holi in view of Covid-19. Finally, I played with my family at home and not outside with my friends,” said one Amit Mahto, a resident of Kokar in Ranchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bjp-seeks-action-against-cong-mla-for-violating-covid-19-protocol-on-holi-101617121789177.html

30-03-2021||Pune||MSRTC sees major drop in passengers||From the last one month, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) is facing several issues in running the bus service, as the daily passengers count has reduced drastically. On the Pune - Mumbai route the daily passenger number has reduced to half. Now, on a daily basis most of the buses go vacant or with very few passengers on major routes from Pune. The drivers and workers are demanding to reduce the bus schedule to avoid further losses. “As the number of Covid cases are increasing from the last one month, it is impacting the overall bus operations across the state. Before lockdown, daily around 65 lakhs passengers would travel by around 16,000 buses running on the road. The daily income which was upto ₹10 crore after September last year which has again started going down in the last one month. Currently, ₹1.5 crore is spent on diesel for buses unnecessarily,” said Sandeep Shinde, state president of MSRTC workers’ registered union. The three major ST stands in the Pune division, Swargate, Shivajinagar and Pune railway station are connected to the entire state by various routes, however, very few passengers have been using them.“The Pune to Mumbai bus service has impacted the most and it’s ridership has gone down by more than half. Our demand is that the organization should not make their own losses and then blame drivers and staff for not getting the passengers on board.” added Shinde. Talking on anonymity, one of the drivers on the Pune to Sangli route said, “Daily I wait more than half an hour than the scheduled departure time to get passengers from Swargate stand but there has been a major drop in people travelling and we hardly get five to ten passengers, sometimes even the bus goes empty.” Ramakant Gaikwad, MSRTC Pune division controller said, “There is certainly a drop in passengers from the last few weeks due to the increase in Covid cases. If any route has a major drop then we take a call and cancel that bus than to send it empty and waste diesel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msrtc-sees-major-drop-in-passengers-101617119029088.html

There is a 2.25-acre land inside the IISER boundary wall which is used for erecting an electric substation. For this purpose, an excavation was going on at the spot for the metro line, according to police officials. “When we say grenade, it was just the shell. Usually there is a plunger and a pin. After the pin is removed and the plunger is released, it bursts. In this case, both were missing,” said deputy commissioner of police Pankaj Deshmukh of Zone-4 of Pune police. IISER is close to several military establishments including the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE). The grounds where it was found was also in possession of the military in the past and was used for various purposes. The police have informed the officials at the ordnance factory in Khadki to determine and identify the make and model of the grenade. The grenade had an inscription “hand grenade 36” on it. “We have secured it and after the court order it will be disposed. That process will take another three to four days, I assume. The BDDS has a safe location for storage of such material. It will remain in that facility until the court order is secured. Since, it has been there for so many years, it is safe to assume that it won’t burst until we charge and burst it,” said Milind Patil, assistant commissioner of police, Special Branch-1. The grenade is suspected to be British-era due to the rusty and old look of the grenade. However, the ordnance factory officials are yet to confirm the ammunition’s timeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shell-of-british-era-hand-grenade-found-in-iiser-101617118849086.html

30-03-2021||Pune||Tale of two markets: Fund shortage hits relief, restoration of Shivaji Market and Fashion Street||Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) does have funds to repair, reconstruct and restore the historic Shivaji Market and Fashion Street in Camp that was destroyed in fire recently. The estimated total loss to property according to officials is around ₹25 crore. The board has written to the district collector seeking release of ₹5 crore for repair and reconstruction of Shivaji Market citing non-availability of funds due to non-release of GST (goods and services tax) revenue by the government since 2017. PCB is facing a financial crisis with the administration struggling to pay the staff’s monthly salary. Many development projects are affected as the administration is facing fund shortage of around ₹200 crore. Fashion Street trader association has pegged the loss at ₹20 crore and the cantonment police have completed the panchnamas. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has directed the Collector Rajesh Deshmukh to examine the Shivaji Market and Fashion Street cases and submit a report on Friday. PCB president Brigadier Kuljeet Singh said, “We are still deliberating on the losses and compensation. Currently, the board is not in place, but will take the issue ahead. We don’t have funds is a known fact and are seeking financial assistance from disaster relief. The board chief executive officer has also written to the civil administration for help.” Shivaji Market vendor association president Manzoor Shaikh said, “The market needs immediate restoration and release of funds for repair and other related development.

Presiding over a review meeting at Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda, the chief minister said health experts have observed that common symptoms such as cough and fever were not detected in patients infected with the mutant virus and instead they were suffering from joint pain, weakness and loss of appetite besides pneumonia. The new strain of the virus is not found in the nasopharyngeal region, rather it directly affects the lungs, which means the window period is shortened. Thakur asked the health department to encourage people to take the vaccine to reduce chances of infection. He directed the health authorities and the local administration to keep a close watch on people in isolation. Panchayat representatives should be involved in monitoring and encouraging people to take precautionary measures, he said, adding nobody will be allowed in public places without a mask. “The safety protocol should be followed so that economic activities are not hampered again,” he said, directing the health authorities to increase testing. Kangra chief medical officer Dr Gurudarshan Gupta said the new strain has hit across the country. “There are no symptoms such as fever or cough, but X-ray scan shows moderate chest pneumonia. The virus spreads directly to the lungs, causing acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia. That’s why the new strain has become acute and more fatal,” he said.

30-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi sees a dip in Covid-19 cases with fewer tests on Holi||With fewer tests conducted on the occasion of Holi, Delhi reported just 992 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday, which is the lowest number of infections in a week. There were 36,757 tests conducted on Monday – reported a day later in Tuesday’s bulletin – in comparison to over 83,000 tests conducted daily on average during the last seven days. The positivity rate—the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested —remained high at 2.70% on Tuesday. The average positivity rate for the last seven days stood at 1.8%, up from 0.9% the week before, and 0.56% the week before that. The positivity rate, which is indicative of the ongoing spread of the infection, had remained below 1% consecutively for 82 days between December 28 and March 19. Delhi has been focussing on increasing the number of tests and thorough contact tracing to check the spread of the infection. “In order to stop the increase in the number of cases, we have increased the rate of testing with around 85,000 to 90,000 tests being conducted each day. This is five times more than the country’s average. Isolation and contact tracing is also being done. For every positive case, over 30 contacts are traced and asked to remain in quarantine in order to contain it as fast as possible," Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday. The number of tests has crossed the 90,000-mark twice this month, which has been the highest number of tests conducted in Delhi ever since the first case was detected on March 2 last year. The city has also ramped up the number of more accurate RT PCR test. Over 68% of all the tests conducted in Delhi over the last seven days were using the RT PCR method. The Centre had asked the 12 states and Union territories, including Delhi, that have been reporting a surge in the number of cases to scale up the number of tests being conducted and ensure that 70% of the tests are conducted using the more accurate RT PCR methods. Delhi’s South District is one of the 46 districts the Centre has identified as “most affected”; it is the only one from Delhi so far. With four people dying of the viral infection on Tuesday, the number remained lower than the seven deaths reported each day on average during the last seven days. The hospitalisations due to the infection have also been on the rise, crossing the 1,500-mark on Tuesday. There were 1,584 persons admitted to city hospitals with Covid-19 as of Monday night. With fewer cases reported on Tuesday, the number of active cases or those currently living with the infection saw a dip to 7,429 from Monday’s 8,032. The city currently has about 5,700 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19, with the health minister on Saturday saying that more beds weren’t required as of now. “Hospitals have a sufficient number of beds. Currently, the occupancy is around 20%. For instance, there are 500 beds in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital, but only around 20 to 25 people are admitted. The rate of occupancy for ICU beds too is 20%; in Lok Nayak hospital we have 300 ICU beds and in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital also 300 of the 500 beds are ICU beds. So a large number of ICU beds being provided and we would increase them if required," Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sees-a-dip-in-covid-19-cases-with-fewer-tests-on-holi-101617101114589.html

Jandiala station house officer (SHO) Yadwinder Singh said a probe was on and the body was sent for post-mortem. Diljaan’s wife and children are in Canada. Singers and actors from the Punjabi music and film industry took to social media to mourn the Diljaan’s death. The singer rose to fame in 2012 when he took part in Sur Kshetra, a singing talent show between teams of India and Pakistan. Diljaan was the runner-up in the show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-singer-diljaan-dies-in-road-accident-near-amritsar-101617095208806.html
30-03-2021||Kolkata||Bengal coal scam: CBI questions key accused Anup Majhi||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday questioned Anup Majhi alias Lala, the main accused in the multi-crore rupees coal smuggling scam in West Bengal. The accused, who had been 'absconding' until now, appeared before the CBI at the agency's Kolkata office at 11 am for the interrogation.Majhi is the alleged mastermind behind illegal mining operations at the Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in West Bengal's Asansol, and the CBI is questioning him in connection with a coal pilferage scam in the Kunustoria and Kajora areas. The Supreme Court had restrained the agency from arresting Majhi till April 6.For a while now, the investigating officers had been in close pursuit of Majhi. In addition to issuing a look-out circular, the CBI had raided several of the accused's premises in the city and in the coal-bearing belt of Asansol and Ranigunj.Sleuths believe that the scam runs into several thousands of crores of rupees and part of the crime proceeds had been transacted through the hawala route. The case is being jointly probed by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), while the West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has also formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT).On March 13, the West Bengal CID made the first arrest in connection with the case — Randhir Singh, who is said to have been involved in the scam and working for Majhi, was arrested from the Paschim Bardhaman district. Moreover, Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee's wife Rujira and his sister-in-law Menaka Gambhir were also questioned by the CBI in connection with the case.ECL general managers Amit Kumar Dhar and Jayesh Chandra Rai, ECL security chief Tanmay Das, Kunustoria area security inspector Dhananjay Rai, and Kajora area security in-charge Debashish Mukherjee had also been named in the FIR registered by the CBI in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-coal-scam-cbi-questions-key-accused-anup-majhi-101617093315833.html
30-03-2021||Chandigarh||BJP struggles to quell rebellion in Himachal MC elections||With the April 7 municipal corporation (MC) elections drawing closer in Himachal Pradesh, the rebellion in the ruling BJP has grown intense with the party suspending 25 rebel candidates in Mandi, Palampur and Dharamshala. The party faces its toughest challenge in Dharamshala, where it faces rebellion in 12 of the 17 MC wards. The party has put its troubleshooter and state forest minister Rakesh Pathania at the forefront of its campaign. “We have quelled rebellion in some wards but there are still many who have refused to withdraw from the fray. The party is trying its best,” Pathania said. Rift between Gaddi community leaders Infighting threatens to hit the party’s prospects with the rift between first-time legislator Vishal Neharia and Lok Sabha member Kishan Kapoor out in the open. Kapoor, a four-time legislator from Dharamshala, has been lying low since his election to the Lok Sabha in 2019. The party sidelined Kapoor, who belongs to the dominant Gaddi community that constitutes 50% of the 37,000-strong Dharamshala MC electorate. Neheria is from the Gaddi community too but Kapoor holds considerable influence. With the rebels refusing to budge, the BJP suspended 14 party workers for contesting against the party nominees in Dharamshala, four in Palampur and six in Mandi, where local BJP MLA Anil Sharma has also refused to campaign for being sidelined after the last assembly elections. Those suspended from the BJP in Dharamshala include Sujata Aggarwal (ward 1), Nisha Nehariya (ward 2), Dinesh Kapoor, Rajender Kumar and Mahender Singh (all from ward 3), Asha Baloria (ward 5), Vijay Kaul (ward 6), Bhagwan Singh (ward 9), Champa Devi (ward 10), Sanjeev (ward 13), Rajni Devi (ward 12), Sarvachand Galgotia (ward 16) and Dimple Kumari ward 17. Battle of prestige for BJP, Congress It’s for the first time that the MC elections in Mandi, Palampur, Solan and Dharamshala are being held on the party symbol, making it a battle of prestige for both the Congress and the BJP. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has been campaigning in Dharamshala, while Union minister of state for corporate affairs Anurag Thakur canvasses on April 3. Jai Ram Thakur will visit Dharamshala again on April 5. On the other hand, the Congress is hoping to gain from the BJP infighting. “The BJP always describes the Congress as a divided house, facing rebellion. But the Congress is contesting these elections unitedly,” said Nadaun Congress legislator Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, who is the party in-charge for the election in Dharamshala. Issues that matter on the ground According to Sukhu, inflation, lack of development and rising unemployment are the main poll issues. Lack of development, particularly in the rural areas, has put the BJP on the backfoot, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-struggles-to-quell-rebellion-in-himachal-mc-elections-101617080568294.html

30-03-2021||Mumbai||PIL seeking independent probe against Anil Deshmukh to be heard today||The Bombay high court (HC) is scheduled to hear on Tuesday a petition filed by Mumbai lawyer Dr Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, seeking an independent investigation into the purported malpractices by Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, as alleged by former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Dr Patil has referred to the March 20 letter written by Singh to the chief minister, in which the former top cop has alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze, arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Antilia explosives scare case, to collect ₹100 crore every month, including ₹40-50 crore from 1,750 bars and restaurants in Mumbai. She sought handing over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) or any other independent agency.Singh himself has filed a criminal public interest litigation (PIL) in HC after the Supreme Court directed him to do so, when he had approached the Apex court. Singh has also sought a CBI probe into the alleged malpractices resorted to by the home minister and sought the seizure of the CCTV footage of the minister’s home. His PIL also calls for the report of the then commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla, and all files connected to the report – purportedly revealing malpractices in police transfers in Maharashtra – to be placed before HC.Meanwhile, advocate Ghanashyam Upadhyaya has also a filed a PIL seeking a court-monitored probe by CBI or ED into the allegations made by Singh. Upadhyay also sought the seizure of the properties amassed by tainted police officers. He has called for a time-bound probe against Singh, Vaze, assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil, deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal and some politicians including Deshmukh.Meanwhile, Vaze’s brother Sudharm had on March 15 filed a habeas corpus petition in HC, seeking the former cop’s production before the court.No specific dates are, however, given for hearing of the PILs filed by Singh, Upadhyay or Sudharm.2 cops stationed outside home of Vaze’s kin Vaze’s sister Anuradha Hatkar, 50, on March 19 had filed an application in the court to issue directions to the media, stationed outside her house since her brother’s arrest. Hatkar, who stays at Saket, claimed that several media persons were repeatedly asking her questions regarding the case. She claimed that she feared for the well-being of her family despite being nowhere connected to the case. The court of district judge Shailendra Tambe directed the Rabodi police station to look into her complaint. Rajendra Shirtode, senior police officer of Rabodi, said, “Following the court’s directives, we have stationed two constables round the clock outside her house to discourage anyone from going near it.”Retired HC judge likely to head state probe against DeshmukhThe Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government decided to probe the allegations of extortion against home minister Anil Deshmukh last week, but is yet to make an official announcement on itIt is likely to set up a judicial commission under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952, in which case, the probe has to be headed by a retired high court judgeUnder the Act, the panel will have certain powers, and can work like a civil court. It can summon any person and examine witnesses on oath. It can also receive evidence on affidavits and requisition any public record or copy thereof from any court or officeThe commission will get a couple of months to complete the probe and submit its findings to the state governmentCurrently, a panel under the Commissions of Inquiry Act is investigating the violence that took place at Bhima Koregaon near Pune in January 2018. Formed in February 2018, it was given four months to complete the probe. But the completion of the probe was extended on multiple occasions. It is yet to submit its report to the state government.ATS applicationTwo of former cop Sachin Vaze’s accomplices – cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor, 31, and ex-cop Vinayak Balasaheb Shinde, 51 – were sent to Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad’s (ATS) custody in Thane trader Mansukh Hiran’s murder case till March 30. However, on March 24, the chief judicial magistrate at Thane directed ATS to transfer the probe to NIA. Accordingly, NIA received Gor and Shinde’s custody. The application for Vaze’s custody filed by ATS before the special NIA court became infructuous and was not pressed by ATS on the due date, March 25.Vaze’s pre-arrest bail Apprehending his arrest in the Hiran murder case, Vaze had on March 12 applied to the Thane district and sessions court for anticipatory bail. The next day, he was arrested by NIA in the Antilia case. The sessions court refused to grant any interim protection from arrest to him and posted his plea for further hearing on March 19. It was then adjourned to March 30.(Inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pil-seeking-independent-probe-against-maharashtra-home-minister-to-be-heard-today-101617045886378.html

The individual relocated to the UK in 2004 after his acquittal and broke all contact with his advocate. The court also directed the state to provide a copy of the non-bailable warrant to the UK embassy and directed the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai and Virar division police commissioner to execute the non-bailable warrant issued against the man in whichever way possible. A division bench of justice Sadhana Jadhav and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the appeal of the state against the 2003 acquittal of two persons in a case of murder at Kashimira police station, was informed that the when the appeal was filed in 2004, both the respondents had been represented by their lawyers, and hence no action was taken against them under section 390 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, as the hearing of the appeal was delayed, the first respondent returned to the United States, and thereafter was not in touch with his lawyer. The court was further informed that the second respondent, who was a resident of Baroda when the appeal was filed, had blocked all the contact with his lawyer, and hence it was not possible to get his presence for the hearing of the appeal. Advocate Nitin Sejpal informed that though his letters to the respondent had been received at the given address, there was no response from the second respondent. On March 9, the second respondent’s step-sister, who had received the letters of the advocate at the Baroda address, approached the court and informed that she was not aware of his UK address, only a mobile number was available. After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “In view of this fact, we are constrained to issue non-bailable warrant against respondent no 2.” The court further directed a lookout notice to be issued against the respondent, which will be circulated at all airports too. The court then directed the state to send a copy of the warrant to the UK embassy, and submit a report to that effect within two weeks, and directed the registry to issue a notice to the Embassy about pendency of the appeal against acquittal. In an earlier hearing, the court had issued a similar notice to the US embassy regarding a non-bailable warrant issued against the first respondent in the appeal, who had shifted to the US after his acquittal. However, after the US Consulate informed the court that the Ministry of External Affairs needed to serve a letter rogatory (request to foreign court) through the Indian Embassy in Washington, DC to get the non-bailable warrant executed, the court changed its order and directed the police commissioner to issue letter rogatory to the MEA authorities concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-notice-to-uk-embassy-over-pending-appeal-against-resident-101617045526439.html
30-03-2021||Mumbai||Antilia security scare: Number plates recovered from Mithi of stolen vehicle||The identical vehicle number plates recovered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from Mithi river in Mumbai on Sunday in connection with the Antilia security scare case belonged to a stolen vehicle owned by a state government servant.Vinay Nade, a resident of Jalna employed as a clerk with the state’s social welfare department, had reported the vehicle, a Maruti Eco, stolen from Aurangabad district in November 2020. Police inspector Sambhaji Pawar of the City Chowk police station in Aurangabad confirmed that a case of vehicle theft was registered on November 20, 2020 on the basis of a complaint lodged by Nade.“My car with the number ‘MH-20-FP-1539 T’ was stolen on November 16, 2020, and an FIR was filed. I have a copy of the same. For three months, there was no information but yesterday, I was informed about it,” Nade to ANI.The NIA on Sunday took former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to a spot near the Mithi river in a bid to recover crucial evidence with the help of professional divers, even as officials said the suspended policeman tried to destroy proof related to investigations into an explosives-laden car found near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the death of a man linked to the vehicle.NIA investigators recovered two digital video recorders (DVRs), two CPUs, a laptop and two vehicle registration plates with the help of divers, a police official said on condition of anonymity.Also read | ‘Lockdown can be avoided, if…’: Maharashtra minister Nawab MalikThe development comes after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government decided to conduct a judicial probe into allegations of corruption levelled against home minister Anil Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who was removed amid investigations into the two cases that have also triggered political slugfest in the state.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday claimed he had warned some party leaders that Vaze could create problems for the coalition government and that the episode has taught some lessons to the Shiv Sena-led coalition government.The central agency is probing the cases of the recovery of the car outside the south Mumbai residence of Ambani and the subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiran.Vaze was arrested on March 13 for his alleged role in planting the explosives-laden car. He has also been accused of masterminding Hiran’s murder, which the NIA is also investigating.“During interrogation of accused Sachin Vaze, he disclosed willingly to show the place where he threw the material used in the crime and destroyed the evidence. Accordingly, two independent witnesses were called and his voluntary statement was recorded. Further, accused showed the place as Mithi River, BKC, Bandra (East), Mumbai,” an NIA official said.“The said place was searched with the help of divers. NIA recovered one laptop, one printer, 2 hard disks, a pair of number plates, 2 CPUs, 2 DVRs, etc. The said articles were identified by rightful owners/custodians from whom accused Sachin Vaze had collected them illegally without proper documentation. Also, the laptop and printer recovered was used by Sachin Vaze in his office,” the official added.This is one of the most important recoveries made in the investigation so far.An NIA officer said that most of the items were damaged before they were thrown into the river. He added that the recovered articles would be sent to Pune’s forensic science laboratory and the Centre for Developing Advanced Computing, for data retrieval.He added that the laptop and the printer recovered from Mithi river were used by Vaze in his office in the Crime Intelligence Unit of the Mumbai Crime Branch. “A visible effort was made by the accused to destroy the same as hammer marks are present on them,” the officer said.Vaze was initially the investigating officer in the case; he got all the evidence in his custody and after Hiran’s murder, when he realised that the case could go to some other agency, he tried to destroy the proof, an official said. According to people familiar with the developments, the DVRs were allegedly removed from the housing society in Thane where Vaze lives. NIA also learnt that a lot of evidence collected by Vaze as the investigating officer was not recorded in the case diary, as the main aim was to destroy it to save himself, said another officer, asking not to be identified.“A group of 10 divers conducted search around three hours and recovered crucial evidence,” another NIA official said on condition of anonymity.The NIA probe team reached the spot at 3.15pm and the search was conducted till 6pm with the help of local divers, the second NIA official said. It is suspected that assistant police inspector Riyazuddin Kaazi told NIA during his interrogation that the evidences were thrown into the Mithi river, according to news agency Press Trust of India. An official told ANI that the DVRs have a recording of Vaze’s society where the car was parked between February 17 and February 24 before it was planted.Hiran, linked to the car that was found containing explosives outside Ambani’s house, was found dead on March 5 in Thane.Investigations into his death were being carried out by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) until the Union home ministry handed over the probe to NIA.Vaze was earlier in NIA custody till March 25 for his alleged role and involvement in planting the explosives-laden vehicle. Later, a special NIA court on March 25 allowed the agency his custody till April 3.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-security-scare-number-plates-recovered-from-mithi-of-stolen-vehicle-101617045406362.html

The accused, Abdul Karim Khudabaksh Shaikh alias Dubai Akram, a resident of Cheetah Camp, has dozens of cases of house break-in, robbery, chain snatching and assault registered against him, and was a wanted accused for over a year. In November 2020, officers at Trombay police station received a tip-off that Shaikh has returned to his house in Cheetah Camp. However, Shaikh learnt that a police team was visiting his house to arrest him. “Shaikh had connected electricity to the door latch, and when a police officer from the team held the latch to open the door, he sustained an electric shock. Taking advantage of this, Shaikh escaped from the spot. The injured police officer was rushed to a hospital,” said police sub-inspector Rushikesh Babar. “Shaikh had been evading his arrest by consistently changing his locations. He spent months in Ajmer, Goa and Ujjain. In Maharashtra, he kept moving between Nashik, Thane, Janata, Auarngabad, Badlapur and Navi Mumbai,” said constable Shashikant Gangawane, who had been tracking his movements. Recently Babar and Gangawane learnt that Shaikh has been hiding in a residential society at Ulve, Navi Mumbai. On Friday, a police team searched the entire building and nabbed Shaikh from a flat. “Shaikh has been arrested under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 353 (assaulting or obstructing public servant from discharging his duty) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 25 of the Arms Act. A court remanded him in police custody till Wednesday,” said assistant inspector Amol Kadam of Trombay police station Shaikh has admitted to his role in various crimes committed in the jurisdiction of Trombay police. “Because of the lockdown, he had targeted closed shops, malls and had formed groups of burglars,” Kadam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historysheeter-who-tried-to-electrocute-cop-held-from-navi-mumbai-101617045407039.html

30-03-2021||Mumbai||Up in flames: Maharashtra's saga of forest fires||At 3pm on March 2, Santosh Jamghare, a supervisor on a commercial farm in rural Maharashtra’s Shilottar village, noticed licks of flame and billowing smoke, approaching from the teak and palash forests which line the farm’s northern perimeter.Jamghare immediately alerted 38-year-old Adityavardhan Pathak, the farm-owner, who at the time was inspecting a crop of mangoes on the other end of the farm. Within minutes of receiving word, Pathak and three members of his staff bundled into a car and drove off to assess the blaze -- its size, intensity and speed.“The fire was initially coming from one direction, but it quickly spread outward. The farm is surrounded by woods on three sides and the grass is very dry this time of year. Before we knew it, there were ground-level fires coming at us from every direction,” said Pramod Lakde, a farm supervisor, who was present that day.On February 15, Pathak had shifted residence from his home in Mulund, Mumbai, to the 80-acre estate in Thane district, where he grows fruit (cashews, papaya, mango, jamun, amla), rice and some vegetables. The produce is sold to a mix of caterers, food processing units, wholesalers and also directly to villagers in Shilottar.The farm was bought by his doctor parents back in 2002, and Pathak -- a former army captain in the Short Service Commission -- joined them in 2011. Pathak spends the majority of his summers on the property, arriving in February or March and staying till the monsoon arrives in June.Each year, usually between February and May, a couple of fires break out in nearby farmlands, or in the forests surrounding his property. “I have to be present if they suddenly go rogue,” Pathak said. The closest fire station is at least 30km away, in the Murbad industrial area, which he said, was too far. This year, Pathak was yet to create fire-lines -- breaks in combustible vegetation which can prevent fires from spreading -- and clear the boundary of debris like twigs, leaves and straw.So on March 2, as soon as the flames began licking the edges of his farm, he and his staff got to work: first, they identified areas where the fire might breach the boundary. Over the following five hours, about 18 to 20 agricultural workers, along with three to five supervisors, did the gruelling task of clearing vegetation from the perimeter, keeping track of the fire’s movements, and doused the licking flames and embers before they spread.“There were four to five teams assigned to different parts of the farm, and they would keep switching locations depending on where the fire was spreading. We usually bring in an earth moving machine to clear the debris, so our challenge was doing it manually, and quickly,” explained Pramod.Since water, a scarce commodity in the region, is required in prohibitively large quantities when dealing with fire, jute bags and palm fronds were brought out of storage to beat back the flames. Swabs of wet cloth were distributed to those venturing too close to the fire. “To cover our mouths. Otherwise, you might breathe in the smoke and start suffocating,” said Pramod. Another agricultural worker, Manda Lakde, was assigned the job of ensuring a steady supply of drinking water as firefighting leaves one parched.Despite this, the blaze eventually found its way into Pathak’s six-acre cashew orchard, destroying his crop and some irrigation equipment. “The trees themselves are alright, fortunately. Only one season’s yield has been lost. We’re trying to salvage some of it by making olya kajuchi sabzi, a Maharashtrian delicacy which uses raw cashew-nut,” says Pathak’s wife, Sujata.“These fires happen once or twice a year, but they are usually smaller than what we just saw. The hair on your arms gets singed if you stand even a few metres away. It is scary, but if something were to happen to the farm, where will I come back and work tomorrow?” said Lakde, a daily-wage earner.Signs of an uptickSigns of fire are, in fact, conspicuous along the Murbad-Kalyan highway as one drives toward Shilottar in Thane’s Shahapur taluka. One sees not only the remnants of controlled, square-shaped fires lit in recently harvested paddy fields, but also entire hillsides that have been scorched, trees and all.Data from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) shows a steep increase in fire counts in Thane this year. The district witnessed 2,477 forest fires between January 1 and March 28 this year, a 257% increase from the same period last year, when just 694 fire counts were observed.At a more granular level, data obtained from the Forest Survey of India (FSI) fire alert system shows that within Thane district, the highest number of fire counts is observed in the Murbad, Dhasai, Dolkhamb, Kalyan and Shahapur forest ranges, which are in close proximity to Shilottar where Pathak’s farm is located. These ranges together make up just under half of all fire counts in Thane district since November 2018 as per FSI data.Several theories have been posited for why such fires break out: one, electrical infrastructure like distribution lines and transformers passing through wooded areas, which create sparks when they malfunction, or make contact with vegetation; another, the hunting practices of the resident adivasi and forest-dwelling populations. “The tribals set small fires to drive out pigs and rabbits. Sometimes it can cause trouble,” said Nandu, a small farmer from the nearby town of Vasind, about 19km away.Then there’s also the issue of climate change. Rising temperatures and increasingly erratic monsoon have led to a “drying” or “browning” of vegetation in parts of Maharashtra, creating conditions in which fires can spread easily, said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune.“Most fires may be set by humans, but their frequency and impact can be exacerbated by climactic conditions. Across Maharashtra, we have seen two major factors -- erratic monsoon and a rise in temperature over the last five decades or so -- which would be making the environment conducive to fire. This is perhaps why you are seeing an increase in fire counts at the district level, in places like Thane and Raigad. The link between these fires and changing climactic conditions needs further study,” said Koll.Madhav Gadgil, eminent ecologist and founder of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, noted that all these were plausible culprits. “But speaking from my own experience in Maharashtra’s fire-prone districts, human interventions are almost always directly associated. They are overwhelmingly more responsible for forest fires than say, increasing temperatures or drought, though of course those are factors too,” Gadgil said.A 2019 study by the Forest Survey of India, identifying fire prone forest areas in the country, states: “Some forest fires start from natural causes like lightning, rolling stones, friction of dry bamboos and stems of trees. Moreover, high atmospheric temperatures and dryness (low humidity) offer favourable circumstance for a fire to commence. In India, however, over 95 % of fire incidences are of anthropogenic origin.”Thane district, though, is not considered a problem area by the forest department. Multiple officials in the department, including Sanjeev Gaur, additional principal chief conservator of forests (protection), said that mitigation efforts are largely concentrated in the drier, water-scarce, and more densely forested region of Vidarbha.“In Vidarbha, as compared to Western or Madhya Maharashtra, the fires are not only more in number but also more intense. The risk to biodiversity is also more than in, say, Thane or Raigad,” said Gaur, citing the example of Gadricholi -- a densely forested district bordering Chhattisgarh in central India, which accounted for 1.78% of India’s forest fires between 2003 and 2016, according to a 2018 joint report of the Ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the World Bank. This made it the only district in Maharashtra to be ranked in the nation’s top 20 fire prone districts.In Vidarbha, officials said, controlled fires are also lit by forest-dwelling communities when foraging for tendu leaves used in beedi making, which may inadvertently spread over larger portions of the forest.Success storyEven so, data shows a consistent downward trend in fire counts in these regions. Satellite data shows a clear reduction in fire counts across Vidarbha in the last four years. Gadchiroli’s fire counts in 2020, for example, were a third of what they were in 2016 (4,332 fire counts, down from 12,425). Similar trends can be observed in nearby Amravati, Chandrapur, Yavatmal and Gondiya districts, where the state’s fire management efforts have been redoubled in the last half-decade or so.“Gadchiroli has been a challenge, but through effective interventions and implementation of dedicated fire management plans, there have been improvements. Nearby districts like Amravati and Chandrapur are also prone to fires,” said Gaur who oversees the fire management plans in each of the state’s 36 districts.The main tool of the forest department is to create fire-breaks, or fire-lines. These are essentially three to six metre-wide gaps in vegetation that we create in the most high-risk areas of the forests, based on past experiences. This is done by physically removing the vegetation or setting controlled fires to it.“Work on this starts every year in December and January. Since most fires we encounter are ground fires, a well-placed network of fire-lines does the job effectively,” he said.In addition to pre-emptive measures, though, officials also said that increased monitoring and integration with NASA-FIRMS and the FSI’s forest fire alert system have also played a role in reducing the impact of forest fires. A case study is that of Melghat Tiger Reserve in Amravati district, which has a dedicated fire cell constituted last year, comprising a district forest officer (DFO), a range forest officer (RFO) and 10 forest guards.As per a technical document shared by the Melghat Tiger Reserve fire cell, all assigned forest guards are registered with NASA FIRMS and FSI, and receive SMS alerts in real time when a forest fire is detected by satellite. When the guard receives the alert, he creates a ‘forest map’ using an open-source, GIS software, showing the exact location of the fire in relation to the forest’s administrative boundaries, the document explains.The map is then shared with field staff through WhatsApp. During fire season, every range officer in Melghat is assigned an eight-member fire-squad, along with at least one vehicle and a number of fire-blowers. As soon as the range office receives the alert, a squad sets off to track down and douse the fire using directions provided by the guards. “Similar operations will be implemented in other districts as well,” said Gaur.In five years, the number of annual fire counts in Melghat Tiger Reserve reduced from 11,401 (in 2016) to just 1,015 (in 2020), as per data provided by the Melghat Fire Cell. Year on year, the area of forest affected by fires in Melghat also declined, from 379 sq kms in 2016 to 128 sq kms in 2020. Department officials attributed this to pre-emptive steps (like timely creation of fire lines), but also the fire cell’s enhanced capacity to respond to incidents in real time.Madhav Gadgil, on the other hand, strongly emphasized that these trends are more attributable to community participation from gram sabhas in Vidarbha, where a substantial number of community forest rights claims have been recognised, largely under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act over the last five or six years.“It can be confidently said that the indigenous population is now encouraged to protect their own resources. I have seen first-hand how forest dwelling communities have been reluctant to actually put out fires, due to conflicts with the forest departments. Now that their claims over the forest have been recognised they are able to finally protect their own resources after years of being harassed by the state machinery,” said Gadgil.New hotspotsEven as the state has been able to control outbreaks in Vidarbha, emerging hotspots for fire counts are a cause for concern. Data shows that in the past eight years (2013-2020), Thane comes third among Maharashtra’s 35 districts (based on 2011 census) by average share of fires --- after Gadchiroli. Other districts where forest fire counts are significant include Raigad, Satara and Pune, which are all outside Vidarbha.Raigarh and Thane account for 8.4 and 7.2% of all fire counts in the state over the past eight years, while Pune and Ratnagiri, also western districts which have not been historically fire-prone, came in at fourth and fifth place, contributing 6.2 and 6.1% of fire counts between 2013 and 2020.Nizamuddin Jalal, an activist who has been tracking stray fires in Raigad’s Mahad taluka, said, “In front of my home, there is a hillside which has been burnt before my own eyes. There is a new fire that is reported to me every day.”Responding to these concerns, Gaur said that it is still a “long way away” before the fire department can exercise complete control over emerging forest fire hotspots. “The Western Ghats and Konkan areas are just as important for biodiversity as Vidarbha’s forests. We already have district-level plans in place for these areas, and will tweak them based on our experiences in eastern Maharashtra. Our achievements in Melghat will surely be replicated elsewhere.”January to March is also the time when farmers in Maharashtra prepare their fields for the upcoming kharif season, using controlled burning to clear land of crop stubble. “Many times, these fires go out of control, or embers may travel some distance and create a spot fire somewhere else. These are not intentional but can still cause damage,” said Gaur.“During this season, the weather gets hotter, leaf matter dries up and falls to the ground, and hot winds start blowing. These are the catalytic factors,” he said.In 2011, a few years after Pathak began farming commercially (and when he wasn’t well prepared to manage this sort of disaster), a particularly intense blaze had laid waste to more than 50 acres of his farm, resulting in financial losses that he pegs to be in the lower eight figures. He not only lost produce but also expensive equipment like solar panels, irrigation pipes, and an aquaculture pond that remains defunct. The fire also diminished crop yield for the following three years at least, he said.“We have a proper fire management plan in place now, but the worrying thing is that there seem to be a lot more fires in the area this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/up-in-flames-maha-s-saga-of-forest-fires-101617045227064.html

A neighbour broke a window and rescued two other children, who were stranded inside the house. On Sunday, the family celebrated Holika Dahan and went to sleep, after rolling the shutter half down. “Around 2.30am, a huge fire was reported from the house. Ananta Moule, the store owner, who was sleeping in another room near the house, rushed to the spot after hearing the screams. The store was gutted in the fire and his wife Dwarkabai, 47; mother Gangubai, 78; and children Krishna, 10, and Pallavi, 15, were charred to death. Their neighbour, Madhukar Moule, managed to enter the store and rescued two other children, Ashwini, 16, and Bhavesh, 12. They are being treated in Nashik and Mokhada government hospitals. Ananta has suffered head injuries while trying to rescue his family,” said a Mokhada police official. Mokhada police have registered a case of accidental death and are waiting for the post-mortem report. Locals suspect the fire could be due to a short circuit. However, Kiran Nagaonkar, superintendent engineer, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), Palghar, said short circuit is the preliminary conclusion, but at an adjacent spot, there is a kerosene shop located, and the fire could have started from there. The exact cause of the fire is being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-of-family-charred-to-death-in-palghar-101617045046988.html
30-03-2021||Mumbai||Personal finance: How to use a credit card||According to data provided by the Reserve Bank of India, as of December 2020, there are 60.4 million credit cardholders in the country. The credit card debt in the same month was ₹63.84 lakh - arrived at by assessing the value of transactions at ATMs and point of sales (POS). The total number of credit card transactions in December 2020 alone equalled 174.7 million. Many of us rely on credit cards to pay off bills or withdraw money, but are we aware of the fine print? Here’s what you need to know when you use credit cards. Credit rating matters Your credit score depends on the regularity of your financial activity and how promptly you pay off your bills. Timely repayment of credit card debt will help build up your credit score that would augment the chances of getting loans approved. You miss a repayment cycle, and the result is debt piling up on your card. This gets recorded in your credit file, thus, impacting your credit score in the negative. Higher interest rates Many credit card companies offer bonuses for signing up for credit cards. The customers avail bonus points on having spent a certain amount within a certain period. These bonus points can provide discounts on other purchases. Cashback offers during seasonal bonanza sales also help you avail of discounts on paying with credit cards; sometimes you may even get a small amount of money back on paying with credit cards. Credit card companies make it seem attractive to use credit card to spend. But it’s equally important to remember that the money should be repaid else it will invite interest charges as high as 10% every day. Nothing comes for me, so hold your horses before you revel at the sight of discounts and cashback offers. To avail discounts, you must earn bonus points that are not possible without spending on a sizeable point. This means that the whole idea is to make you spend using your credit cards. This is because merchants accepting payments via credit cards must pay a percentage of the transaction amount to credit card companies. The cashback that you get is simply a part of the merchant fees that the credit card company shares with you. Besides, there is a yearly cap on cashback rewards beyond which you cannot exceed. Independent of currency Credit cards can be used to pay bills in any currency. Though banks or credit card companies may charge currency conversion fees, you may use your card to shop at overseas online stores or pay during an international trip. Some credit card companies also wave off fees on international purchases as a reward for increased use. However, beware of rampant credit card use as it may cause you to miss a payment or carry forward a balance debt that will have to be repaid with fees and interest charges. In some cases, the charges can be high; combine that with Goods and Services Tax (GST), and you end up paying a hefty amount as a foreign currency mark-up fee. Crossing the limit You may want to shop till you drop dead, but your credit card company may have had other plans for you. There is a limit beyond which you cannot spend depending on the credit card you use. However, spending beyond the credit card limit can invite a hefty amount as a penalty. The minimum over-limit fees charged is ₹500 from where it can go up depending on how much you have crossed your limit. Cash withdrawal charges You have the option to withdraw cash from an ATM using either a debit or credit card. If possible, never use your credit card to withdraw cash. This is because of the high cash advance fees that could either be fixed or levied as a percentage of the amount withdrawn. The credit limits on different cards vary, thus, determining the cash withdrawal limit. In most cases, banks and credit card companies allow their customers to withdraw up to 40 per cent of the card limit. However, interest charges ranging between three and five per cent accrue immediately after cash withdrawals using credit cards. This means that a withdrawal of ₹10,000 can incur an interest penalty in the range of ₹300-500. Not many credit cardholders are aware of the GST applicable on all credit card fees and charges. If you are someone who makes informed decisions on income and expenses, unbridled spending using credit cards may not be the right choice.

All his scheduled meetings have been cancelled till further notice. The veteran leader was feeling uneasy owing to abdominal pain and was taken to the hospital for a check-up on Sunday evening, where he was diagnosed with stones in the gallbladder and was advised an immediate surgery.“Pawar was on blood-thinner medication and following advice of doctors, they have stopped the same. On March 31, he will be admitted to the hospital for endoscopy followed by a surgery the same day,” said Nawab Malik, chief spokesperson, NCP.Party insiders said he is on painkillers and is taking rest at his south Mumbai residence — ‘Silver Oak’.“The surgery could have been conducted immediately if he wasn’t on blood-thinner medication. Those medicines have to be stopped 48 hours before a surgery. He is also likely to undergo laparoscopic surgery that will take an hour or so, but he has to be kept under observation for a day or two. Later, he will have to be at home for rest for some more days,” said a NCP insider.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, union minister of health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan, legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar, MNS chief Raj Thackeray etc. enquired about his health.

30-03-2021||Mumbai||NCP opposes Maharashtra lockdown plans||With the fear of a lockdown looming large, the ruling Nationalist Congress Party insisted that a lockdown is not a solution to the pandemic and the people and state are not in a position to afford it. The statement came a day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday asked state officials to begin preparing a plan for another lockdown that will have minimal impact on the state’s economy. The NCP is part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state along with Shiv Sena and Congress. Nawab Malik, NCP chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister, said, “Daily cases are on the rise and on Sunday it crossed the 40,000-mark but the people and the state won’t be able to afford another lockdown. We have told the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) that lockdown is not a solution to the pandemic and we should focus upon improving health infrastructure to tackle the situation. The way cases are increasing, the state may face a shortfall of beds considering which the chief minister has ordered for the preparations as well.” He also said the situation was still under control. “The state government has not taken any decision on imposition of a lockdown. The situation has not gone out of control. If people start strictly following Covid rules, we can still avoid lockdown,” he stressed. In a meeting attended by Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope and members of the state Covid-19 taskforce, the chief minister said the citizens were flouting all Covid-19 guidelines and the state would be forced to take this step. He made the announcement soon after the state’s Covid-19 taskforce recommended strict measures including a lockdown to counter the alarming surge in infections and deaths. “There should not be any kind of confusion among the people once a lockdown is announced,” the CM was quoted as saying. From March 28, the state government has imposed a night curfew, prohibiting gathering of more than five people at a place and shutting down of all cinema halls, malls, auditoriums and restaurants from 8pm till 7am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-opposes-maharashtra-lockdown-plans-101617044866296.html
30-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees 5,890 new Covid cases; active cases now stand at 46,248||Mumbai on Monday recorded 5,890 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the active cases to 46,248. Mumbai also recorded 12 deaths, taking the toll to 11,665. Following the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) dashboard noted that 75% or 9,789 of its 13,006 beds for serious, critical, and symptomatic Covid-19 patients were occupied as of Monday morning, whereas 3,217 beds were vacant. These include its 1,709 ICU beds, of which 73.8% or 1,261 beds were occupied, and 448 were vacant, as of Monday morning. A total of 226 ventilator beds of the 1,036 total beds are vacant. Among the 3,241 beds in Covid Care facilities meant for mild symptomatic patients, 1,022 were vacant. On Monday, the BMC issued an order for optimising its bed management, and also directed all facilities across the city to activate maximum available beds for Covid-19 patients. The guidelines in the order mandate strict implementation of decentralised bed management system, put in place at the beginning of the pandemic. Hospital beds will be allotted to Covid-19 patients only through the ward war room, and not directly via hospitals. Sixty-nine more private hospitals will become operational for Covid-19 patients, adding 1,909 hospital beds, and 360 more ICU beds, according to the order. After hospitals activated maximum beds for Covid-19 patients, 80% of these beds, and 100% of all ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients will be handed over to BMC for management via the ward war room, the order said. The war rooms will first allot beds at local nursing homes and hospitals. Once these are fully occupied, beds at private hospitals will be allotted to patients, followed by beds at jumbo facilities, then at government hospitals, and lastly at municipal hospitals. A nodal officer will be appointed for every private hospital, for 24x7 coordination with the BMC. Asymptomatic patients will not be allotted beds in hospitals, so these remain vacant for those in need. The order read, “In view of the current surge in Covid-19 cases, it is necessary to reiterate some of the important guidelines for better management of needy Covid-19 patients. It is observed that in spite of above orders, patients are directly admitted by the hospitals without information/intimation to the ward war room.” In a statement last week, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said BMC will increase the city’s bed capacity to a total of 21,000 beds in the next two weeks. According to the statement, BMC projected that these numbers will be able to cater to a situation of up to 10,000 new cases per day, should such a situation arise. Going by the present trend, only about 15% of such patients are critical and need hospital beds. On Monday, Mumbai conducted 33,966 tests. This brings the positivity rate for the day to 17.2%, as opposed to 12%-14% recorded in the previous week, and 4%-5% recorded in the beginning of March. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 4,017,316 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-5-890-new-covid-cases-active-cases-now-stand-at-46248-101617044806349.html
30-03-2021||Mumbai||Close to 600,000 Covid-19 cases in March for Maharashtra||As the fear of another lockdown looms over Maharashtra, March 2021, with two days still to go, is on its way to be the state’s worst month, in terms of Covid-19 cases. The state’s battle against the pandemic had crossed a year earlier this month.Maharashtra has recorded 590,448 cases from March 1 to March 29, while the worst month, September 2020, had seen 593,192 infections, data revealed. Another grim statistic: While Maharashtra had entered 2021 with a huge drop in cases compared to the previous three months, the new cases recorded this month has also surpassed the tally of the past four months. Between November 2020 and February 2021, the state had recorded 487,519 infections. On Monday, the state recorded 31,643 cases and 102 deaths, a day after recording its sharpest single-day spike of 40,414 cases. The state’s tally is now 2,745,518 cases and toll 54,283. Since March 17, Maharashtra has been recording more than 20,000 cases every day. The state has also recorded 2,129 deaths this month.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state-appointed task force, said the numbers will continue to rise in the state. “It will rise further as tests have increased. We will have to keep testing more until the positivity rate goes down,” Dr Pandit said. The state’s positivity rate on Monday was 14.08%, while the recovery rate is 85.71%. The state has been conducting more than 100,000 tests every day for the last few weeks. The only silver lining in this second wave is that the death rate is still low, despite the increasing number of cases. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state has also reduced to 1.98% as of Monday, as per data released by the public health department.“While the death rate is still comparable to November-December 2020, the absolute numbers are still high,” Dr Pandit said. Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the death audit committee, said the late arrival of patients is still a problem being faced by authorities. “While it is a rapidly spreading strain, patients are recovering, however, late arrival is still a problem,” Dr Supe said.On Monday, Mumbai also recorded more than 5,000 new Covid-19 cases with 5,890 cases and 12 deaths, taking the tally to 404,614 and 11,665 fatalities to date. In a meeting held on Sunday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also asked officials to draw up a strategy for a lockdown. The state has already imposed a night curfew wherein more than 5 people cannot be seen together between 8pm and 7am. A day after the CM asked the administration to make preparations for a lockdown, the ruling Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said it was not in favour of a lockdown and instead, the government should strengthen infrastructure. The state has 336,584 active patients currently, with the highest in Pune (59,475), Mumbai (46,248), Nagpur (45,322), Thane (35,264) and Nashik (26,553). Currently, 1,607,415 people in the state are in home quarantine, while 16,614 are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/close-to-600-000-covid-19-cases-in-march-for-maharashtra-101617044747596.html
30-03-2021||Mumbai||Stage all set for NCP vs BJP poll battle in Pandharpur||The stage is all set for a poll battle for Pandharpur assembly constituency in Solapur after both the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared names of their candidates on Monday. While NCP declared Bhagirath Bhalke as its candidate, BJP decided to field Samadhan Autade.The by-election for the seat will be held on April 17. It had fallen vacant following the death of sitting NCP MLA Bharat Bhalke in November last year. The NCP has fielded Bhagirath, Bhalke’s son and a three-time MLA. He had defeated BJP’s Sudhakar Parichak by 13,361 votes in 2019 assembly polls. Both Bhalke and Paricharak died of Covid-19 last year. Bhalke was undergoing treatment post Covid complications and died in Pune on November 28, 2020.Autade fought as a Shiv Sena candidate in 2014 and as an independent in 2019 assembly polls. He was picked by the saffron party over their sitting MLC Prashant Paricharak’s insistence for the candidature for his nephew Pranay. Paricharaks have a stronghold as Sudharkar Paricharak, Prashant’s uncle, represented the constituency for five terms between 1985 and 2009.Autade, who is in the construction and cooperative sector, had polled 54,124 votes as an independent in the 2019 election and 40,910 votes in 2014 as a Shiv Sena candidate. He was reportedly in touch with the NCP too for the candidature. He will have to face dismay within the party as the aspirant from Paricharak family has been denied the ticket by the party leadership. Besides, his close rival and NCP candidate Bhagirath Bhalke may enjoy sympathy owing to the demise of his father which may go against Autade.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena’s local leader Shaila Godse too has filed her nomination as an independent candidate posing a challenge for the NCP candidate.

30-03-2021||Mumbai||Special lectures for Class 10, 12 students||In order to help SSC (Class 10) and HSC (Class 12) state board students beat the exam stress, the education department has come up with a unique initiative. The Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) will hold special lectures for students between March 29 and 31.State education minister Varsha Gaikwad made the announcement on Sunday. “Students will be motivated with these lectures and will get confidence to write their exams. We wish them all the very best,” tweeted the minister. Some of the topics on which sessions will be held include developing self-confidence, maintaining discipline in studies, getting rid of stress and being able to concentrate for a longer time. These lectures will be aired on MSCERT’s YouTube channel between 8am and 8.30 am.Earlier this month, the department had also started putting up several expert videos on its YouTube channel to help students ace the exams. Teachers said while these initiatives are really helpful, students are still going to have some stress about writing their papers in the pandemic. “Students are scared because of the rising number of cases across the state and this anxiety is natural. The government should still think of some solutions if the exams cannot be held due to rising cases,” said the principal of a civic school.While the HSC exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, SSC exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20. Nearly 33 lakh students appear for the exams every year. Students will get their own schools and junior colleges as exam centres as per an announcement made by the board last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/special-lectures-for-class-10-12-students-101617044746371.html

30-03-2021||Pune||Pandharpur bypolls: NCP’s Bhagirath Bhalke to take on BJP nominee Autade||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday announced Bhagirath Bhelke, son of former MLA Bharat Bhalke as its candidate for Pandharpur-Mangalwedha legislative assembly bypolls scheduled on April 17. The counting of votes will take place on May 2. The bypolls were necessitated at Pandharpur-Mangalwedha seat after the demise of three term NCP legislator Bharat Bhelke during the last week of November. In an attempt to post a serious challenge against NCP nominee, BJP on the other hand has fielded Samadhan Autade who fought 2019 assembly polls and garnered over 54,000 votes. Autade has been assured all possible support by BJP leader and its legislator in the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) Prashant Paricharak. Prashant’s uncle Sudhakar Paricharak, who died of Covid in August last year had unsuccessfully contested against Bharat Bhalke in 2019 polls. “I thank the BJP for trusting me for these polls. With Prashant Paricharak and me, we will definitely develop this constituency,” said Autade after his nomination was declared by BJP from Delhi. During 2019 polls, Bharat Bhalke defeated Paricharak by over 13,300 votes even as Autade was the second runner up in the contest. The NCP hopes to get benefit of sympathy wave for its nominee this time. “With the approval of Sharad Pawar, the party has decided to announce Bhagirath Bhalke’s candidature for Pandharpur-Mangalwedha constituency. We are confident of his victory,” said NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil. In view of the rising Covid numbers, the state election commission has made arrangements for virus infected patients, those above 80 years and disabled persons in the bypolls. Due to the second wave of pandemic, all the political and social gatherings in the Solapur district have already been banned. According to the election commission, the constituency has around 1,200voters above 80 years while 1,782 with physical disabilities.Political observers feel even as Autade’s entry into polls fray from BJP has made the contest tougher, the sympathy wave in favour of NCP nominee and likely poor voter turnout in view of Covid may help Bhagirath Bhalke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pandharpur-bypolls-ncp-s-bhagirath-bhalke-to-take-on-bjp-nominee-awatade-101617032265875.html
