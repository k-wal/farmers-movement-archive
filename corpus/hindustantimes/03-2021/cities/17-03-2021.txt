17-03-2021||Mumbai||EAC did not consider our objections on Mumbai coastal road clearance: Green group||The Conservation Action Trust (CAT), a city-based non-profit environment group, wrote to the Union environment ministry on Wednesday, objecting to the amended Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) coastal road (south Mumbai), that were recommended by a Central expert committee.HT had reported, on March 17, that the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) expert appraisal committee (EAC) for CRZ clearances has approved an amendment in the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance granted to the contentious infrastructure project. Once ratified by the Centre, this approval will give legal sanctity to the BMC’s move to reclaim an additional 21 hectares (ha) of land for a stretch of coastal road between Marine Lines and Worli. The CAT’s letter, authored by executive trustee Debi Goenka, states, “The proposed amendment to the coastal road project (south Mumbai) was discussed at the 257th EAC CRZ meeting held on March 5, 2021. We had submitted our representation to the committee on March 4, 2021. We had also requested that we be heard by the EAC. The minutes of the meeting of 257th EAC (CRZ) do not record any of the concerns reflected in our written representation and written submissions submitted to MCZMA, MoEFCC, and EAC. We were not given an opportunity to be heard.”The CAT is currently one among at least four petitioners that have opposed the coastal road project in the Bombay high court, on grounds that it will lead to widespread ecological destruction and loss of marine biodiversity along Mumbai’s coastline. The CAT has also maintained that the project will benefit only a small section of the city’s population and that it will not be able to solve the city’s traffic woes, which is one of its main objectives. These points, among several other contentions, have been detailed in their representation dated March 4, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.Goenka’s letter, dated March 17, also states that “many members of the MCZMA were not present for the meeting” held on October 2020, when the Authority was to hear citizens’ concerns during its 147th meeting. Moreover, Goenka points out that the additional municipal commissioner and deputy chief engineer of MCGM “attended the meeting as members of the authority instead of recusing themselves because of the conflict of interest.”A member of the EAC, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The committee has followed due process. As far as the petitioner’s letter is concerned, I have not seen it yet. It would be best to direct any enquiries to the recipients of the letter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eac-did-not-consider-our-objections-on-mumbai-coastal-road-clearance-green-group-101616005510880.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP scam: ED attaches assets worth ₹32 crore of 3 channels||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached movable and immovable assets worth ₹32 crore belonging to three channels; Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movies channels, in connection with the television rating points (TRP) scam, a senior ED officer confirmed.The properties are in the form of land, commercial and residential units in Mumbai, Indore, Delhi and Gurgaon and balances in bank account totalling ₹32 crore. Investigations have revealed that the proceeds of crime for these channels is to the tune of ₹46 crore, said an ED officer. ED’s investigation is based on the first information report (FIR) registered by Mumbai Police. Probe in the money laundering aspect of the case has revealed that People Meters/devices also called bar-o-meters were installed at certain places/households (approximately 1,800 in Mumbai and 44,000 in India in total) on a proportionate basis to mimic the viewership pattern of 197 million households in India for capturing viewership of various channels of different genres and languages in selected homes to calculate the TRP.These bar-o-meters are installed for Broadcast Audio Research Council by Hansa (BARC decides the household, where the bar-o-meter is to be installed and the installation is handled by a third party agency - Hansa Research Group Limited), employees (relationship managers).TRP enables advertisers to understand the viewership pattern of the channels. TRP becomes an important basis on which advertisement is allocated to any channel and determines the revenue generation of a television channel. Thus, manipulation of TRP becomes a tool for generating greater advertisement revenue.The investigation further revealed that television channels namely Fakt Marathi, Box Cinema and Maha Movie, had entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat and committed the offence of criminal breach of trust, forgery to gain wrongfully by manipulating TRPs of these television channels. Thus, by fraudulently enhancing the TRP ratings, these channels have garnered enhanced advertisement revenue. In two of these channels, just 5 compromised households were contributing to approximately 25% of the viewership of Mumbai for the relevant period and in the third channel, 5 compromised households were contributing to approx. 12 % of viewership of Mumbai.Accordingly, the movable and immovable properties of the channel’s owners/entities have been attached to the tune of ₹32 crore against the total proceeds of crime to the tune of ₹46.77 crore generated during the manipulation period of TRP of the channels under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.Mumbai police have so far arrested 14 accused in the case including the chief executing officer, BARC, Partho Das Gupta and distribution head of Republic Television. Mumbai crime branch has already charge-sheeted some of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-scam-ed-attaches-assets-worth-32-crore-of-3-channels-101616005331354.html

17-03-2021||Other||Delhi riots: Man who complained about loot at his house made accused in the same case||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday termed it “an apparent absurdity” that a man in the north east Delhi riots, who had complained to the police about the damage and loot of his house during the north east Delhi riots, had subsequently made an accused in the case by the police after his complaint was clubbed with another complaint of one Naresh Chand.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, while hearing the police’s review plea challenging the magistrate’s decision to register an FIR in the burning of the Madina Masjid during the north east Delhi riots in February last year, noted that the complainant Hashim Ali, was himself arrested.The court said that even though a DD entry is available on record with respect to the burning and desecration of the Madina Masjid on February 25, wherein Ali has named 15 persons as rioters, however, there is nothing on record with respect to the investigation conducted in case FIR No 55/2020 registered at PS Karawal Nagar which the police have claimed to register in the arson of the masjid.Ali filed two complaints with the police—one in connection to the burning of his house and the other was with respect to the burning of the Madina Masjid, Shiv Vihar.His first complaint was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand FIR-72/2020 and later a charge sheet was filed against him on February 2021 naming as an accused along with one Abu Bakar. Ali is out on bail in the matter.On Wednesday, the court said, “It is really strange that the complaint with regard to burning of house of respondent no 1 (Ali) was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand, being case FIR No 72/2020, PS Karawal Nagar and later on the respondent no 1 was arrested in the same matter, meaning thereby that he is not only complainant in the matter,but also an accused, which is an apparent absurdity.”The judge directed the DCP (north east) to file a report on the status of investigation in the case by March 25 while also asking the SHO of Police Station Karawal Nagar to remain present before it along with the investigation file and case diaries of the matter related to the mosque.The court noted that the police did not inform the magistrate court that an FIR had already been registered in the mosque case on February 26, 2020.“A perusal of the impugned order dated February 1, 2021, passed by Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) clarifies that the issue involved in the matter is with regard to burning and desecration of ‘Madina Masjid’, Shiv Vihar, Delhi on February 25, 2020. As per the version of police, already an FIR No 55/2020, PS Karawal Nagar has been registered in this regard on February 26, 2020, but no such averment was made by the police before the MM. “ Since the issue involved in this case is with regard to Madina Masjid, the specific complaint of complainant dated June 25, 2020 is on record, wherein he has named 15 persons as rioters, who had burnt and desecrated ‘Madina Masjid’; however, there is nothing on record with regard to investigation conducted in case FIR No 55/2020, PS Karawal Nagar in the matter,” it said.During the hearing, advocate MR Shamshad, appearing for Ali, had submitted that according to the police the FIR in the mosque attack case was registered in February last year but they had filed various status reports in the last six years before the magistrate court without disclosing it.Shamshad alleged that various wrong status reports were submitted before the magistrate court and the police disclosed the fact about the FIR exactly a year later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-riots-man-who-complained-about-loot-at-his-house-made-accused-in-the-same-case-101616004490046.html
17-03-2021||Noida||Protesters can build permanent structures at borders, says Naresh Tikait||Taking a stand contrary to the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president on Wednesday said farmer protesters at the Delhi border sites could build permanent structures.“Summer is approaching, and houses are needed to protect farmers from heat when temperature peak to about 45 degrees Celsius. When our agitation ends, we will remove the structures,” said Naresh Tikait, the BKU president, while addressing a mahapanchayat on UP Gate.The protesters had been building shelters using bamboo, tin, plywood and even bricks at the Tikri and Singhu borders over the last two weeks to beat the summer heat and rain.On Sunday, the SKM had called on its followers not to build the structures and said alternatives would be offered. On Saturday, Kundli police had registered two FIRs against farmers for constructing brick and mortar houses and digging borewell along the highway at Kundli on the complaint of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).That is not all. Naresh Tikait’s speech also countered what younger brother and BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said Tuesday on blocking the Delhi-Noida border“We have no intention to block the roads. It may have been said but we will talk over this issue. The roads should be open, and we don’t want to trouble commuters. Even the road (Delhi Meerut Expressway) was barricaded by the police and they opened it on their own,” Naresh Tikait said. The traffic movement resumed at the Noida-Delhi Chilla border on the night of January 27 after BKU’s Bhanu faction called off their strike and removed their tents and belongings from the protest site. Over the issue of deadlock in talks with the government, he said that if Satya Pal Malik, the present Governor of Meghalaya, is given a chance for mediation, farmers would welcome the move. Malik on Sunday said that the Centre should accept one of their (farmers’) demands of writing minimum support price (MSP) into law and advised it against using the might of the state against the protesting farmers. Malik was addressing a gathering at Sheelchand Inter College in Aminagar Sarai town of his native district Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh. He also said that he had written letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah about the ongoing farmers’ agitation, but it remained unresolved. He also said that he opposed the arrest of farmers and advised the government not to use force against them but ensure that they did not go back empty-handed. “Satyapal Malik ji is a good man, and he is also from a farmers’ family and knows the issues faced by farmers. We have good relations with him, and farmers liked the statements he made. If he is sent to mediate, we hope that issues can be resolved. Earlier we said that we are also ready to speak to Rajnath Singh ji (defence minister) if he initiates talks with us. But the major issue is that the government is having no effect and not listening to farmers,” Tikait added. The talks between the government and the farmers’ unions were held last on January 22 and deadlock has ensued since. The farmers are still stuck on their demand for repeal of three farm laws while the government last proposed staying of implementation of the laws for a period of one and half years. The situation also hit a major roadblock after the incidents of violence in Delhi on the Republic Day during the tractor rally carried out by the farmers. The Delhi police lodged various FIRs against farmers’ leaders including Rakesh Tikait but the farmers maintained that it was handy work of some “outsiders.” The farmers are camping at the UP-Gate since November 28 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/protesters-can-build-permanent-structures-at-borders-says-naresh-tikait-101616004371101.html

His 32-year-old wife Parwati had gone into labour.“No one answered our calls,” said Kumar. The couple were in an auto-rickshaw heading to a government hospital in Ghaziabad. When the pain became unbearable, the vehicle stopped near the Vijay Nagar police station and Parwati rushed to a public toilet.“I was with her inside. I tried calling up the emergency numbers, 102 and 108, but sometimes the numbers were busy and at other times it did not connect,” said Kumar. The police at the station rushed to help the couple and even called an ambulance from a private hospital. In the toilet, at around 7pm, Parwati gave birth to twin girls.“We rushed the mother and children to Flores Hospital in Vijay Nagar,” said Mahavir Singh Chauhan, SHO of Vijay Nagar police station. While Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani congratulated his team on Twitter, Kumar’s troubles did not end. One of the newborns suffered complications. “Late night, she died. I took her body in an auto to Lal Kuan at around 6am (Wednesday). From there, I boarded a mini truck and reached Sikandrabad and then took a bus to Bulandshahr. From there I called up a few villagers who arrived on a bike and took us along,” said Kumar whose native village is Bansi Nagla near Vair, almost 58km from Ghaziabad. Taking an ambulance till there was too expensive.After performing the last rites for his daughter, he returned to Ghaziabad where his wife and daughter were still admitted. “The other child is still sick and admitted to neonatal intensive care unit. The mother is, however, stable,” said Dr Manoj Singh, managin director, Flores Hospital. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr NK Gupta said that he will conduct an inquiry into the incident. “The 102 and 108 government ambulance services are centralised and operated through a control room at Lucknow. However, I will conduct an inquiry about why the calls did not connect,” he added. When approached over the entire incident, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he will seek all details from the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/unable-to-connect-to-ambulance-services-32-year-old-delivers-twin-daughters-in-public-toilet-one-dies-later-101616004310423.html

As per the provisions of the Land acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the agency takes two to six months to carry out the survey.“Once the SIA is completed, the section 11 of the 2013 Act will be implemented inviting objections from the public. Then we will implement section 19, and subsequently compensation will be decided and distributed to land owners as per the rules,” said Singh.The work at the airport site will begin once the houses of the farmers are shifted from Nagla Ganeshi, Nagla Chhitar and Ranhera, among other villages, the officials said. “In first round, we allotted residential plots to 238 farmers of Nagla Ganeshi. Now, in the next round we will allot the residential plots to farmers of Nagla Chhitar so that they can shift into new houses in airport township in Jewar Bangar area,” said Singh.Meanwhile, the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) said that the development work of the airport township will be finished by the end of April. “The work on township is in full swing and the farmers have started shifting their houses,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.For the first phase of airport project, the district administration has handed over 1,334 hectares of land to Swiss company Zurich International AG that is likely to start the developmental work by June this year. The swiss firm wants to start operations in first phase by 2023-24, said Yeida officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/land-acquisition-process-for-phase-2-of-noida-airport-begins-as-state-govt-sanctions-2-890-crore-101616004250002.html
17-03-2021||Other||Plastic waste menace: Time for consumers to re-think buying habits||Plastic pollution has reached such alarming proportions that as consumers, we now need to demand accountability from manufacturers who use plastic for packaging their goods but refuse to take responsibility for the waste that they generate. We also need to re-think our buying habits vis-à-vis plastics.The urgent need for concerted consumer action also comes from the fact that in the last one year, Covid-19 has pushed up enormously our use of plastic. Besides face masks, gloves and PPEs, our consumption of sanitizers , home cleaning agents and a variety of disinfectants have gone up so substantially during the past year that it’s only added to the mountain of plastic debris that’s toxifying our land, air and our water resources. However, with most manufacturers paying only lip sympathy to the cause of environment and many civic bodies around the country failing to enforce stringently, even the not-so-stringent Plastic Waste Management Rules, consumers need to take a more active role in ensuring accountability from manufacturers. In fact the global federation of consumer organizations, Consumers International, has brought to the forefront the crucial role that consumers have to play in forcing corporate and government accountability, by declaring ‘Controlling Plastic Waste’ as the theme for this year’s World Consumer Rights’ Day..As a first step towards this, we need to demand mandatory label information on every packaging material and container that uses plastic. We must know whether they are recyclable or not and those that cannot be recycled should have no place in the market and consumers should boycott all such products..The mandatory label information requirements can be brought under the Legal Metrology (packaged Commodities) rules, so that it can be enforced by the consumer affairs ministries of state governments. Today, every package has to mention the consumer helpline. This helpline should also be used for answering consumer queries on the recycling programme of the manufacturer.The same rules should apply to e-commerce food platforms too. They must use recyclable packaging and take responsibility for recycling them or use biodegradable packing materials made from agricultural waste or plant fibres originating from banana, sugar cane, bamboo, wheat and such plants. According to ‘ The WasteProject,’ the online food delivery platforms are generating plastic waste of 11000 tonnes to 14000 tonnes per month. And most of it is said to be non-recyclable single use plasticManufacturers (and also retailers ) should also take full responsibility for collecting the packing material /empty pouches and bottles that they use, for recycling. Businesses in fact should use the same channels of distribution that they use to sell their products, to also collect recyclable materials from the consumer. And it should also become mandatory for every manufacturer to inform once in a quarter, either through advertisements or through the website, specific details on the quantity of plastic waste generated by them, collected , re-used and recycled. And consumer preference for goods --- be it cosmetics, fast moving consumer goods, processed foods, milk - should in future depend not only on the quality and safety of the product, but also on the environmental accountability of the manufacturer/service provider.Of course there is one area, where consumers too have to act more responsibly and that’s with respect to carry bags. While large shops can well afford to give inexpensive cloth bags without charging for it, consumers have to carry their own cloth bags when they buy vegetables or fruits from roadside vendors. According to government sources, per day generation of plastic waste in the country is about was 26,000 tonnes . Out of this only 60 per cent is collected and recycled. It’s time we stopped that 40 per cent from destroying our environment and killing us and our future generations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plastic-waste-menace-time-for-consumers-to-re-think-buying-habits-101616004191199.html

17-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 536 new Covid-19 cases, most since Jan 6||The Covid-19 trend continued to tick upwards in Delhi, with the Capital reporting 536 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the most in a day since January 6, when the city logged 654 cases of the viral infection. Delhi on Wednesday added over 500 cases for the first time in nearly 70 days, and for the fourth time this year. The other three were in January, when the number of cases in the city was still on the decline after the heights of the third wave in November.The new cases came on the back of 80,856 tests and a positivity rate of 0.66%, also the highest since January 6. The daily case-spike and positivity rate have nearly doubled over the past fortnight, from 240 cases at a rate of 0.33% on March 3.Even though the positivity rate remains below the 5% threshold that the World Health Organization recommends for an infection to be considered under control, experts believe Delhi’s case spike is a cause of concern. “The number of cases has nearly doubled in the last two to three weeks and even though the positivity rate in Delhi is low, things will soon get out of hand. People have not been following Covid-appropriate behaviour and they tend to follow it only when there is strict enforcement. The government should again start fining people for not wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research. The Centre has identified Delhi as one of 70 districts of concern where cases are on the rise.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain two days ago had said, “The positivity rate in Delhi was over 15% at one time and the WHO (World Health Organisation) says that it should be below 5%. The positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for a few months now and below 1% for nearly 2.5 months. In comparison, the positivity rate in Maharashtra is 16.46%, Kerala 3.54%, Punjab 4.81%, and Gujarat 1.78%. This means that the positivity rate in Gujarat is three times that of Delhi, Punjab six time, Kerala seven times, and Maharashtra thirty times. Till the positivity rate does not cross 1%, the infection is well control.”Dr Kant, however, disagreed. “There is a need to immediately take action – increase and intensify contact tracing, test as many people as possible, and prevent large gatherings. The government also needs to start looking at whether the new infections are in a different age group or demography – there are still around 50% people susceptible to the infection in the city.” The city has started increasing the number of tests being conducted, with nearly 81,000 samples being processed on Tuesday, as reported a day later in Wednesday’s health bulletin. The experts have also asked for an increase in the pace of vaccination. “Yes, we have vaccinated a huge number of people but when we look at the size of our population, it is nothing. It is important to vaccinate as many people are possible as quickly as possible to prevent severe disease and deaths. However, the pace of the vaccination drive has remained slow because of vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant for internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital. He said, “I believe that the launch of Covaxin was a little rushed, if it had just been launched a month late along with the data people would have had more confidence on it. Now, with the European countries stopping the use of the Oxford vaccine, people have doubts about the Indian variant Covishield as well. I am receiving several calls a day to ask whether they should take the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-536-new-covid-19-cases-most-since-jan-6-101616004011469.html

The Delhi government standing counsel (criminal), arguing for the Delhi Police, told the court they have shown the victim’s family and lawyers CCTV footage of the incident.The high court was hearing a plea filed by the victim Navreet Singh’s grandfather, Hardeep Singh, claiming that the deceased farmer suffered gunshot injuries to his head. Hardeep Singh’s plea said the victim had been shot by the police, because of which he lost control of the tractor. However, both the Delhi and UP police have told the court that Navreet did not suffer any gunshot wounds, and claimed that the man died under the tractor after it overturned.The victim’s autopsy was conducted at Rampur district hospital in UP.Delhi Police had on February 26 told the court that while they had asked the UP Police to hand over the original X-Ray plate and post-mortem video, Rampur police and the district hospital said they would do so only on if the court ordered..The UP Police counsel and hospital’s chief medical officer said told the court they did not have the X-Ray report but only the X-Ray plate and autopsy report, which they said they would share with the Delhi Police if so decided by the court.The petitioner’s counsel, Soutik Banerjee, had earlier contended that the Delhi Police had conducted itself in a manner that “does not inspire a shred of confidence”. According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the tractor parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour of the pre-agreed route for the march.Navreet was the only protestor who had died during the farmers’ tractor rally on R-Day. On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/medical-board-to-examine-x-ray-of-farmer-who-died-during-r-day-clashes-in-delhi-101616003889949.html

Teltumbde has a reward of ₹50 lakh on his head declared by Gadchiroli police in May 2018. The statement was recorded in the course of the trial which Bhelke is facing for a case registered against him and his late wife Kanchan Nanavare in 2014 under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The trial is underway in the court of judge SR Navandar. The surrendered Naxal questioned on Wednesday was identified as Krushna alias Birju Masa Dorpate (33), a resident of Allapalli area of Gadchiroli. The couple has been booked under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with Sections 20 and 38 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) by the anti-terrorism squad. The two are also facing a case under UAPA registered by Chandrapur police. The prosecutor, Ujjwala Pawar claimed that Dorpate is a surrendered Naxal, as is mentioned in his written statement recorded in 2015. He claimed that he joined the movement in 2003, gained “divisional committee member” status in 2010, and quit along with his wife in 2014. Questioning Dorpate’s authenticity, Nahar said, “It was the time when the state had started offering incentives like cash and land for surrendered Naxals. The people there are very poor. He only claims to be inside the jungle.” In his statement under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) recorded on January 11, 2015, Dorpate had allegedly said that Bhelke was known to Teltumbade who is believed to be among the leaders of the Naxals in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, Ujjwala Pawar cross-questioned him in court about the claims that he allegedly made to an officer of the Anti-terrorism squad (ATS) in 2015. He reiterated his statement about Bhelke being in contact of Teltumbade. “It does not affect the case in any way just because he is claiming that it happened. What is the evidence that he is speaking the truth,” asked Rohan Nahar representing Bhelke. The 2015 statement also claims that Nanaware worked in the capacity of a nurse while suffering a heart ailment. He also had recorded that she was actively involved in an armed struggle between police and Naxals in Padiyaljob area of Gadchiroli in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/surrendered-naxal-claims-he-saw-bhelke-with-milind-teltumbde-in-jungles-of-gadchiroli-101616003409929.html
17-03-2021||Pune||Boil water notice for city’s eastern residents||Even after two months of kicking off the Bhama-Askhed water supply project, the eastern part of the city is not getting clean drinking water. Now, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has appealed to residents to boil the water before using it. Earlier, a turbid water problem occurred in Yerawada. Now, it has spread to Nagpur chawl, Maharashtra housing society and the Tridal nagar areas. Dr Siddharth Dhende, local corporator of Yerawada ward said, “The PMC has started supplying Bhama-Askhed water in our areas. From Tuesday, we have started receiving turbid water. In our areas, more than 30,000 residents are getting turbid water. We have appeal to residents of Yerawada to boil the water. Turbid water is expected in the next two to three days.” Ashok Dhiwar, a resident of Nagpur chawl said, “We are getting turbid water for the last two days. Earlier, we were getting clean water. On Tuesday, water turbidity was so high we could not drink the water. We purchased packaged water from the market. Today, turbidity is low as compared to Tuesday.” Anirudha Pawaskar, chief superintendent engineer of the PMC water supply department said, “There are some parts of the Yerawada area where people are getting turbid water. We received complaints from local corporators and residents. Now, we have stopped Bhama-Askhed water supply in Yerawada area and started supplying water from the Pune Cantonment water treatment and supply centre from where Yerawada used to receive water earlier.” He further said, “Even if the water is turbid, it is safe to drink. So, we have appealed to residents to boil the water before using it for drinking purposes. We are trying hard to sort out the problems on a war footing. It will take two to three days. We will publish an appeal in social media as well as in print to boil the water.” The long-delayed project to supply Bhama-Askhed dam water through a closed pipe to the eastern part of the city was completed in December 2020. After the inauguration of the Bhama-Askhed water scheme on January 1, 2021, the PMC began a trial run to supply water to the eastern part of the city. After two and half months, the PMC has not been able to supply drinking water to the entire eastern part of the city; the PMC is still facing problems of water turbidity in some parts of the Yerawada area. Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. The material that causes water to be turbid include clay, silt, very tiny inorganic and organic matter, algae, dissolved coloured organic compounds, and plankton and other microscopic organisms. The project was initiated to provide water to Kalas, Sangamwadi, Yerawada, Lohegaon, Dhanori, Kalyaninagar, Vadgaonsheri and Kharadi. The 200 MLD project is expected to meet the water supply needs of the region by 2041 when the local population is estimated to have increased to 14.5 lakh. The project was started in 2013 and has been completed in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/boil-water-notice-for-city-s-eastern-residents-101616003352741.html

PMC property tax department tabled a proposal in a standing committee meeting which passed on Tuesday. Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman said, “The proposal was tabled by the PMC administration to write off property tax on mobile towers in the city. The property tax department has reasoned that some of the towers have double taxation and some of the towers haven’t existed on the ground but, the department has generated a property tax.” “Based on the administration information, the committee has given a nod to waive off property tax on mobile towers,” he added. Meanwhile, the PMC tax department received around 190 fresh mobile tower proposals for the assessment of new tax. The department has estimated around ₹80 crore revenue collection per year from the new mobile towers. As per the 2016 Supreme Court order, the civic bodies can levy property tax on mobile towers attached on rooftops of properties within its limits. The PMC is collecting property tax for towers and also imposing fines on mobile company operators who have installed the towers on illegal constructions. The operators have challenged the penalty decision of the PMC and the matter has been pending in court for a few years. At present, the outstanding amount has reached more than ₹1,500 crore so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-writes-off-rs-13-crore-property-tax-on-mobile-towers-101616003351565.html
17-03-2021||Pune||Edible oil prices reach an all-time high in Pune||After the historic increase in petroleum and diesel prices, Pune is witnessing an all-time high price of edible oils. According to the edible oil traders, the prices of edible oils have increased by ₹800 to ₹1,000 per 15 kg can as compared to the prices in April 2020. These prices have been increasing gradually throughout the year and are not predicted to come down at least for the next two months. “I have been in the business of edible oil trading for the last 40 years. These are lifetime high rates of edible oils. ₹800 to ₹1,000 have increased per can which is 15-kilograms,” said Rajkumar Nahar, wholesale trader of edible oil and owner of MM Nahar traders located at Market Yard in Pune. The price hike of the edible oils is attributed to the shortage of supply in the international market. “There is a shortage of edible oil in the international market. India imports almost 70-80 per cent of edible oil of its total requirement. There is a 40-60 per cent import duty,” said Nahar. The rate of sunflower oil is ₹2400 to ₹2500 per 15 kg. The rate of Soybean oil is ₹2000 to ₹2100, the rate of palm oil is ₹2050 to ₹2100 and the rate of groundnut oil is ₹2500 to ₹2600 per 15 kg can. While in April 2020, the rate of sunflower oil was ₹1,500 per 15 kg, soybean oil was ₹1,300 per 15 kg, palm oil was ₹1,200 per 15 kg and groundnut oil was Rs1,700 to ₹2,000 per 15 kg. The retail price of sunflower oil is Rs165, groundnut oil is ₹170, soybean oil is ₹140 and palm oil is ₹140.“These are the highest prices ever and they have been increasing gradually since last March. For the last 12 months, prices have been increasing every month. In the international market, there is a scarcity of the crop. There are labour problems and hence the supply is getting impacted. Also, the fuel prices have increased,” said Kanayalal Gujrathi, trader of edible oil in Pune. Though the price hike may have started to impact the monthly home budgets, it hasn’t yet caused the price hike in restaurants and eateries. “Food stalls, roadside eateries need more edible oil per day as they have a huge proportion of fried items. In restaurants, 10-15 kg oil is sufficient per day. Though the prices of edible oils have increased by 25-30 per cent, we haven’t increased the rates of the dishes. Our business is already running low, and we want to maintain the existing customer,” said Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Hoteliers Association. On the other hand, agriculture experts think that this price hike is benefiting the local farmers as they are getting good rates for the oilseeds produce. “I look at this issue from the farmer’s perspective. Farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada are getting good rates for oilseeds such as soybean. I will not call this price hike in edible oils, inflation. It is an appreciation of the price, these market rates are necessary for farmers in order to get good prices for their crops,” said Deepak Chavhan, expert and analyser of the agriculture market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/edible-oil-prices-reach-an-all-time-high-in-pune-101616003352202.html
17-03-2021||Pune||PMC extends contract of SWaCH by two months, administration fears slip in cleanliness ranking||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has extended the contract of SWaCH, a non-profit responsible for door-to-door waste collection in the city, by another two months. However, the administration has warned that if SWaCH will continue its work, it will affect the ranking of PMC in Swach Survekshan, a cleanliness competition conducted by the centre every year. While PMC renews the contract with Swach every five years, it ended in December 2020. Due to Covid-19, there was no general body meeting taking place and hence the decision was pending but it was passed in a general body meeting on Wednesday. Covering around 8.5 lakh properties in the city, SWaCH gets ₹4.5 to ₹5 crore from residents every month in addition to ₹2.5 to ₹3 crore paid annually by PMC as supervision fees. However, there are numerous complaints from corporators and some citizens are against SWaCH workers for not lifting the garbage properly.Based on the complaints of corporators, the PMC standing committee was earlier pursing to call bids of other agencies for fair competition in the collection and segregation of garbage in the city. Shiv sena party leader Prithviraj Sutar had written a letter to PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar opposing the appointment of SWaCH once again.However, the non-profit presented to city mayor Murlidhar Mohol a letter with signatures of over 100 corporators and more than one lakh residents in its support. On Wednesday, the standing committee gave an extension for two months when the administration has mentioned effect on PMC Swach Survekshan if Swach stops the work. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar also made a reference to the threat of affecting Swach Survekshan while extending the contract with SwaCH. While giving an extension, the standing committee mentioned in the meeting that the process of calling tenders from other agencies will go on if the committee finds the work done by Swach unsatisfactory. Kunal Khemnar, PMC additional municipal commissioner said, “The Central government’s Swachh Survekshan is going on. It may be affected if SWaCH is going to get the contract again. We have mentioned this in the standing committee proposal.” Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house of Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in PMC said, “We are against Swach organization. However, the organization should have to sort out citizen complaints and improve the system and clear loopholes in the system.” Opposing the privatisation of the waste collection system, SWaCH representatives had issued a statement. It stated that SWaCH is an extension of the PMC’s solid waste management (SWM) department. Informal waste-pickers own SWaCH and provide waste collection services to citizens against direct user fees. In fact, it was established by the PMC in 2007 in line with state government directives in 2002 to integrate informal waste-pickers and pull them out of poverty and promote sustainable waste management.--------------------------------------------------------BoxPMC general body meeting gave approval to erect a saffron flag at the Sinhagad fort, worth ₹1 crore on Wednesday in the online general body meeting.PMC had made budgetary provisions for it and all parties gave approval to the proposal in general body meeting.

The stretch, after crossing the Maruti Sutar underpass, till the High Energy Material Research laboratory, is full of garbage. Residents residing near the highway blame hawkers for dumping vegetables, while the hawkers blame residents of Sutarwadi for throwing the garbage. “It is not only garbage, but on the service road many people have also dumped construction waste material and sand, which keeps coming on to the road,” said Milind Mokashi, a truck driver who uses the highway. “We have received few complaints of people burning garbage as well. I have already asked an official to clear the garbage from the highway. It will be cleaned in the next few days,” said Ajit Desmukh from the PMC’s solid waste management department. “Every day we see the amount of garbage increasing. Dumping is done at night,” said Rohit Mishra who runs a paan shop near the highway. A resident of Sutarwadi, Shailesh Kelkar, said, “Often, I have seen hawkers throwing vegetables after 7pm and if we argue, then they use foul language with us.” Fruit hawker Majid Hussain said, “There are only a few hawkers who come to the highway to sell vegetables and we don’t throw any waste on the road. Many vendors use the service road throughout the day and they might throw garbage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/garbage-stink-irks-commuters-on-pune-bengaluru-highway-101616003292994.html

17-03-2021||Pune||A pedestrian nightmare to walk on Sus-Pashan footpath||Pipes lying between broken tiles and dirt all around the footpath, makes walking difficult for pedestrians on the Sus-Pashan road. Work has been going on for at least a month on the road, and hence all the debris on the footpath. “It becomes a very difficult walk, especially at night. The footpath has benches and an open gym, but we cannot use it, as it is not well maintained. I see workers and officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), but work going on is very slow,” said Mukesh Sinha, who stays at Prime Heights on the opposite side of the said footpath. Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer of the PMC’s road department, said, “70 per cent of the footpath work is completed. In a few patches, the drainage pipeline work is going on, so there is dirt on the footpath. The broken tiles will be replaced. Our official had done spot visits.” Prakash Saxena, who visits ICICI bank next to the footpath, said, “There is a nullah at the rear-end of the footpath, where garbage is dumped. Since the footpath is not kept clean it becomes hard to stand outside the bank.” Ajit Desmukh, who is currently handling the solid waste management department, said, “Every 15 days garbage is cleaned off the footpath. Instead of throwing garbage in bins, people just throw it near the nullah and it keeps on coming on to footpath.” Another resident, Subhash Puri of Maurya residency said, “No hawkers are allowed to set up stalls on the footpath, but in the evening many street eateries occupy space on the footpath. I have not seen any inquiry form the encroachment department ever here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/a-pedestrian-nightmare-to-walk-on-sus-pashan-footpath-101616003291761.html

The process of making model question sets is not yet completed. Despite the warning to the appointed faculties, only 60 per cent of subject paper sets have been sent to SPPU of the total 3,700 subjects. The SPPU administration is now going to take strict action against such violating faculties. Around 8,000 faculties are involved in this important process of making question banks. While it has been instructed by SPPU to the colleges to complete the work in time, faculties appointed by SPPU for this work need to be given free time from their college work. There are a total of 3,700 subjects of SPPU graduate and postgraduate courses and the process of making the question sets bank was started on February 20. For each of the question, a faculty is paid ₹12, and one faculty cannot go beyond ₹1,000 charges for working on this project. It was instructed to colleges to complete this work on a priority basis, but only 60 per cent of the question sets banks are submitted to SPPU. “The remaining 40 per cent sets are yet to come, while now SPPU has asked for the list of faculties who are delaying the work. Action will be taken on those faculties who are found guilty of delaying the work and not submitting the question sets bank in time,” said Mahesh Kakade, SPPU director of the board of examination and evaluation. The overall admission process and examination for the academic year 2020-21 is delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The admission for some of the graduate and postgraduate courses in SPPU is still going on. This has resulted in the delay of first semester exams, and now due to the strict restrictions imposed by Pune district collector all the schools and colleges are closed in Pune district till March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/40-per-cent-of-question-sets-yet-to-be-submitted-to-sppu-101616003291026.html
17-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sports varsity Bill likely to cause furore in Haryana assembly||The Sports University of Haryana Bill, 2021 reintroduced in the Haryana assembly on Wednesday has the potential to cause furore in the assembly on Thursday when it comes up for discussion. Earlier, it was withdrawn on March 8 following an objection by the central government. However, while reintroducing the Bill, the state government has persisted with a provision stating that no special provision for employment or admission of women, persons with disabilities or of persons belonging to the weaker sections of the society, scheduled castes, and the other socially and educationally backward classes of citizens shall be made on the ground of domicile. Since the state government recently enacted a law providing 75% reservation in private sector jobs to Haryana domicile candidates, the provision in the Sports University Bill runs contrary to it. The Bill was initially passed by the state assembly in August 2019 and was reserved by the governor for consideration of the President. Subsequently, the Union home ministry, in December 2019, wrote to the state government citing a Union HRD ministry office memorandum stating that as per the University Grant Commission (UGC) regulations, the chairman of UGC will nominate a member of the selection committee for selection of vice-chancellor of state, private and deemed universities. “Since no member of the search-cum-selection committee is nominated by the UGC, this criteria for appointment of V-C needs to be re-looked. Thus, on central government’s advice, it has been decided to re-look the Bill. Accordingly, the state government has decided to withdraw the Sports University of Haryana Bill,” said a cabinet note. The Sports University is touted as the first full-fledged sports varsity of international standards in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sports-varsity-bill-likely-to-cause-furore-in-haryana-assembly-101616002750416.html
17-03-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to install facial recognition cameras at 10 busy points||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to install facial recognition cameras at 10 busy points in the city to track criminals and strengthen safety measures, officials familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. “We are in the process of installing facial recognition cameras at 12 locations (two already installed) in the city to track movements of criminals in the city and improve security services. The list of locations was given to us by the Gurugram police department. The locations have been selected based on the movement of people, areas where people with difficult crime record are expected (like court complexes),” said a senior GMDA official, requesting anonymity. Facial recognition technology uses facial features to match with existing information on databases to identify a person. But, due to various reasons such as lack of proper lighting and varied angle of the image, there are chances of false recognitions also in these systems. The GMDA’s move comes after two cameras installed at Sheetla Mata Mandir and Bus Stand for a trial were found to be working well. The GMDA’s Smart City division tested the functionality of the cameras before deciding to expand the project. As part of the testing process, pictures of random employees were uploaded on the system managed by the Integrated Control and Command Centre (ICCC) and the persons were made to pass by the camera, which triggered an alarm at the command centre if there was at least a 60% match in the facial features. In the realtime process, the team at the command centre will inform the nearest police control room (PCR) about wanted persons. Experts are wary of the system as many government institutions in the country are adopting public facial recognition without legal restraints. The central government is also working to develop a National Automated Facial Recognition System to help match images captured from CCTV cameras with existing databases. Anushka Jain, associate counsel for transparency and Right to Information at the Internet Freedom Foundation, said, “The issue of facial recognition technology is that it is not 100% accurate, whether in the country or across the world. The testing process for these cameras also cannot be completely relied upon as authorities might be testing them in lab conditions with good lighting where facial features will get easily recognised by the camera, resulting in higher accuracy rates.” “Another concern is that the cameras will capture everyone who comes under their gaze, casting suspicion on everyone. We also don’t know who will have access to this data. The data, if it falls in the wrong hands, can easily be used for extracting personal vendettas as it tracks locations and movements on a continuous basis,” added Jain.When asked about the accuracy of the cameras, the senior GMDA official said, “These cameras are being tested at major airports also, so they have a good accuracy rate. But if 60-70% facial features match, the alarm will ring and a team will have to go on the ground to identify the person.” Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters) said, “In cases of snatching, robbery or firing, these cameras help us in identifying and nabbing the criminals. The positioning of these cameras is decided based on crime records from different areas and the accumulation of crowd. Traffic is also a criterion because these cameras help us with online challans or cases of road accidents.” The official cited above said that the GMDA is waiting for approvals from authorities concerned, after which the additional cameras would be installed. A tentative list of places for installation of the cameras includes three metro stations, the railway station, the bus stand and a government hospital. The Smart City team, at present, is in the process of feeding its system with the data of criminals from the police department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-install-facial-recognition-cameras-at-10-busy-points-101616001731508.html
17-03-2021||Gurugram||Policy soon to provide basic facilities in unplanned industrial areas, says Chautala||To provide basic facilities to industrial areas in nonconforming areas (unplanned industrial zones), the Haryana government will formulate a policy after a topography survey of industrial areas is completed, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala told the state assembly on Wednesday. The policy will be formulated jointly by department of town and country planning, local municipal bodies and industry and commerce department. Replying to a question in the assembly, Chautala, who also holds the portfolio of industries and commerce, said members of different industrial associations had met him and requested that factories established in unauthorised areas be authorised. He said the state government had conducted a survey of industrial areas and now the topography is being done. Once that process is over, the government will formulate a policy and further action will be taken. There are large number of industrial areas that are located in nonconforming areas and are devoid of basic amenities and infrastructure. Units located in such areas have been demanding basic infrastructure for the past several years. In Gurugram, such areas include Daulatabad, Basai, Kadipur, Behrampur and Khandsa that together house around 4,000 small units. Responding to another question, Chautala said a large battery company will set up a project in Nuh district, after which mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic gadgets will be manufactured there. He also said a mega project is being set up by M/S ATL with an investment of ₹7,083 crore in IMT Sohna, which has a capacity to generate 7,000 jobs. The HSIIDC (Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation) has allotted 178 acres for the project and the company plans to invest ₹7,000 crore in the next few years to supply batteries for industries that manufacture smartphones, two-wheelers, and three-wheeler e-vehicles, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/policy-soon-to-provide-basic-facilities-in-unplanned-industrial-areas-says-chautala-101616001730973.html

Officials said that over 350 tenements, around 30 permanent rooms and a service station, all of which were constructed illegally, were cleared from a one-acre plot meant for a primary school.HSVP officials said that an enforcement team reached the site around 11am and started the drive by deploying two earthmover machines, under the protection of a large contingent of police personnel. “There were around 300 illegal hutments and a rent was being collected from them by anti-social elements forcibly. All these, including 30 permanent structures and a service station, were demolished,” said Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP. HSVP officials said that the occupants of the hutments and those in the rooms were allowed to take their belongings but they were asked to clear the area as the land belonged to the authority. Officials said they will construct a boundary wall around the plot, which is worth several crores. Another 1.5-acre plot owned by the authority that is designated for a group housing society, on the opposite side of the government college, was also cleared of encroachments, said officials. “A large number of nomadic families, selling ironware and other items, had established huts on this plot and they strongly resisted the demolition drive. It was only after an intervention by police officials that we were able to remove the illegal structures,” said Lot. Illegal extensions, pertaining to small sheds, extended walls and other violations, carried out by residents of a nearby colony were also removed by the authority. The enforcement team also issued a warning to the violators and said that if violations were repeated, they would face criminal action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-razes-illegal-hutments-constructions-to-reclaim-2-5-acres-101616001729787.html
17-03-2021||Gurugram||No takers for gangster’s plots due to registry issues||Auction of proclaimed offender and wanted gangster Sube Singh’s plots on Wednesday hit a snag as the properties were found to have multiple owners, officials familiar with the developments said.According to residents of Bar Gujjar village, where Singh’s ancestral property is located, he has a 24% share in the property and his siblings and uncles, who also hold a share in the property, were not interested in selling them. Jagdish Chand Bishnoi, naib tehsildar Manesar of revenue department, said that Singh’s share had not been notified and a partition has not been done among the family members. “There is no separate area that belongs to Singh and people do not want shared properties, due which the auction was unsuccessful. We will again finalise a date through court for the auction,” he said. Four bidders from nearby villages who had shown a keen interest in the properties returned after they found that there were complications in the deal and that land registration was pending. “Why would anyone buy a disputed land when one is unaware of which portion belongs to Sube Singh? The village will support Singh and will not let anyone buy this property,” a 70-year-old villager of Bar Gujjar said. The police, tehsildar, and patwari announced the auction and waited for nearly an hour but the villagers did not support them following which they moved to the second auction site in Manesar industrial area. The auction was organised at the chaupal of Bar Gujjar village near Manesar and in Manesar industrial area. Singh is wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Gurugram and Rewari. The police departments of the two districts announced rewards amounting to ₹4 lakh for information leading to Singh’s arrest. He was declared a proclaimed offender by a district court in April 2018. Singh’s properties comprise two plots, one of 1.3 acres in Bar Gujjar village near Manesar and another of 0.8 acres in Manesar industrial area, the police said. In 2019, the district administration tried to auction the properties twice to weaken the financial base of the gangster, who is allegedly on the run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-takers-for-gangster-s-plots-due-to-registry-issues-101616001671729.html

The rapid transmission of the coronavirus in the last two weeks has placed Gurugram among the eight districts of concern in Haryana, as per a union ministry of health and family welfare’s report issued on Wednesday. Health department officials said that the Covid-19 spread is under control but admitted that planning to scale up measures to curb further spread is underway. “The test positivity rate (positives out of the total samples tested in a day), which is almost 2.1%, shows the pandemic is well controlled in the district. As per the World Health Organisation guideline, positivity has to be less than 5%. Testing will be ramped up if Covid-19 cases increase further. Currently, almost 3,500 tests are administered every day. The department has also increased the containment zones to 18,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Data collated from the daily district health bulletins show that the district had last reported its highest cases in a day, 96, on December 30, 2020, after which the daily cases continued to dip. From the beginning of March, the number of daily coronavirus cases has been climbing up, with at least 1,104 new infections detected in the last 17 days. The case count over the first 17 days of March has increased by almost 71% from February, when 786 cases were confirmed. There has been a constant spike in the number of cases across Haryana, placing it among 12 states showing a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. According to the union health ministry’s data based on the seven-day average, new cases increased from 151 on March 1 to over 248 by March 8 in the state. This further increased to 374 by March 15, leading to an overall increase in the test positivity rate from 1.2% (on March 1) to almost 3.3% (on March 15). The overall surge across the state has been a consequence of daily detection of new cases, mainly in the eight districts of Yamunanagar, Karnal, Faridabad, Panchkula, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Gurugram. Most of the affected districts have reported a 150-200% spike in the number of cases, while it is at 71% for Gurugram.The total tally of the Covid-19 cases in the city has reached 60,097, while the active case count reached 635, of which at least 574 are in home isolation and 60 are moderate to severely-ill patients undergoing treatment in private hospitals.

17-03-2021||Gurugram||Expressway concessionaire seeks toll hike||Commuters at the Kherki Daula toll plaza might have to shell out increased toll fare from April 1 as the highway concessionaire on Tuesday wrote to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) calling for an annual revision of fees based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), released by union ministry for commerce and industry. Officials of the Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the concessionaire for the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, said that the final WPI numbers were released on Monday and as per the concession agreement, the fee has to be raised annually. Suraj Bhardwaj, chief executive officer, MCEPL, said, “The toll fee is revised annually as per the concession agreement. We have written a letter to the NHAI but no decision has been taken yet. We are expecting that a decision in this matter will be taken soon.”Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, when asked about the matter, said, “The toll will be revised and new rates will be implemented from April 1. The revision of the fees is based on WPI, concession agreement and NHAI rules and it is an annual exercise.” Kherki Daula toll plaza, on average, collects toll from 80,000 vehicles every day. Last year, the NHAI had increased the toll fees of several categories of vehicles by ₹5, but the fee for passenger cars remained unchanged. At present, the toll for cars is ₹65 per trip, while mini trucks are charged ₹95, trucks and buses are charged ₹200 per trip. The proposed revision of the toll at Kherki Daula toll plaza is going to hit the commuters hard as they were expecting the toll plaza to be shifted in the next few months as announced by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on February 14. Khattar had announced that the process for the transfer of land at Panchgaon to NHAI is underway and the plaza could be shifted in the next six months.On March 5, the union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, after inspecting Dwarka Expressway, cited legal issues and extended the deadline for shifting of Kherki Daula toll plaza to August 15, 2022.

However, these teams often fail to locate the units being run in the wetlands.The large wetlands of the Yamuna and the Ganga are safe havens for bootleggers and illegal liquor manufacturers, boats, camels and milk cans being used to supply hooch to different areas.The banks of the two rivers consist of ravines at many places which become safe hideouts for illegal liquor manufacturers and suppliers. An excise department official said that people involved in illegal liquor and hooch business choose wetlands as their hideouts. In a bid to avoid being spotted, they hide liquor gallons inside rivers and small ponds. Often, they bury the liquor gallons in the sand and take them out as per demand. Being locals, persons involved in the illegal trade are aware of the geography of the wetlands and often dodge the police and excise teams, he added.To supply illegal liquor and hooch to other villages, boats and camels are used which remain out of police sights. Camels are usually used in wetlands of the Ganga to transport vegetables and agricultural produce. Liquor gallons and pouches can be supplied in large quantities on camels to far-flung areas. Bahmalpur, Khaptiha, Kanihar, Phaphamau and many villages in banks of Ganga are notorious for illegal liquor manufacturing while Kanjasa, Arail, Lavayan, Sandwa etc in the trans-Yamuna area are considered hotspots of the hooch business. Ashutosh Mishra, SP, crime said that in a bid to completely crush the menace of illegal liquor, the informer network in remote rural areas will be strengthened. The help of locals will be taken to trace illegal liquor manufacturing units in wetlands and banks of rivers, he added.In many trans-Yamuna areas, bootleggers sell illegal liquor on boats and immediately take the boat in the middle of the river if they spot the police approaching. During the lockdown, the illegal hooch business was at its peak. Illegal liquor manufacturers earned hefty cash by supplying it on boats to different areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wetlands-safe-havens-for-bootleggers-101615999989654.html

17-03-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP trade barbs over Delhi’s ‘most polluted capital city’ tag||A day after Delhi was declared as the most polluted capital city in the world, the ruling AAP and opposition BJP on Wednesday indulged in a blame game over the issue of pollution in the national capital.Delhi BJP spokespersons Harish Khurana and Praveen Shankar Kapoor, in a press conference, alleged that the Arvind Kejriwal government failed to utilise its environment budget.Citing documents, they claimed that during financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21, the AAP government "failed" to utilise the budget allocated for environment. In the current year 2020-21 alone, over 60 per cent of the environment budget is about to lapse, they said.The Kejriwal government should immediately form an expert committee to study various reasons of pollution throughout the year and suggest ways to curb it, the BJP leaders demanded.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai, however, said the “central government had allowed the lapse of the Commission for Air Quality Management, and until the Centre gets serious about combating pollution, nothing could be done".Twenty-two of the world's 30 most polluted cities are in India, with Delhi being ranked as the most polluted capital city globally, the World Air Quality Report, 2020 said on Tuesday.The report, prepared by Swiss organization IQAir, was released globally. It, however, shows that Delhi's air quality improved by approximately 15 per cent from 2019 to 2020.“The recent report of Green Peace Asia saying that 54,000 people lost their lives in 2020 in Delhi due to pollution speaks volumes about the Kejriwal government's incompetence to control pollution,” Khurana charged.Kapoor alleged that instead of working to bring a holistic plan to fight pollution, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders are wasting time on accusing the Centre."Delhi has turned into a gas chamber, but shockingly there is no study report to scientifically tell the reasons of pollution growth in Delhi. Who is stopping the Kejriwal government to launch an effective anti-pollution campaign?" he asked.Defending the Delhi government, Rai said efforts of the ruling dispensation have helped reduce pollution by up to 15 per cent in the city."We are increasing the green belt, brought in a progressive electric vehicle policy and working towards making Delhi more environment-friendly," he said.The Delhi government had submitted a petition to the Commission for Air Quality Management to address stubble burning, but now with the Commission having lapsed, the issue remains unaddressed, he said.The minister reiterated that it was now up to the central government to do its part.“The intention of the central government was clear, which had done nothing to shut down polluting thermal power plants that are still functional in neighbouring states. It also had taken no step to shut down brick kilns, and the result is for all to see," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-trade-barbs-over-delhi-s-most-polluted-capital-city-tag-101615999161628.html

The UP government has set a target of planting 62 lakh saplings in Prayagraj this time with all departments having different individual quota, said district administrative officials. The forest department alone has been given a target of planting 17.50 lakh saplings while horticulture department has been given a separate target. Divisional forest officer, Prayagraj, YP Shukla said saplings for the drive were being prepared and the plantations would be planned in a way that the plants get best watering during the monsoons. Under horticulture department, 3.40 lakh saplings will be planted at the Chandra Shekhar Azad and 1 lakh saplings at the historical Khusro Bagh, officials shared. The government has ordered geo tagging of all new saplings to be planted this year too, officials said. The task of planting around 30 lakh saplings has been entrusted upon the urban and rural development departments. For this, preparations have already started at the departmental level. Planting preparations have started in Chandra Shekhar Azad Park, Minto Park and Khusro Bagh. Azad Park’s superintendent Seema Singh Rana said 3.40 lakh saplings were being prepared in a nursery for the drive to begin once the monsoon arrive. “We believe the saplings would be ready within the next 20 days,” she added. The officials also plan to take help of private nurseries to successfully complete such a large-scale drive. Plants will be purchased from private nurseries. The exercise for this has already started in all nurseries at the set government price, they added. The UP government plans to plant 30 crore saplings during its mega drive in July this year. The government has named this year’s campaign as ‘Vriksharopan Jan Andolan -2021’ to widen the ambit of the progamme and convert it into a mass movement. This year, the plantation figures will be 5 crore more than last year’s target of 25 crore, though the actual number turned out to be 25.8 crore. The state government has resolved to increase the state’s green cover by 15% in its five-year tenure due to which the target for plantation is being increased every year. The government’s target was 25 crore saplings in 2020, 22 crore in 2019 and 11 crore in 2018. Over 5.7 crore saplings were planted in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/preparations-for-planting-62-lakh-saplings-in-prayagraj-begins-101615999509653.html

The Assembly was informed of the cabinet decision by deputy chief minister Renu Devi as the industry minister Shahnawaz Husain was away in poll-bound West Bengal for campaigning. “Bihar has become the first state to bring a special policy for ethanol production,” said the deputy CM. In December 2020, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had approved a modified scheme for extending interest subvention for those setting up grain-based along with molasses-based ethanol distilleries.So far, the government of India has granted permission for ethanol production from B-heavy molasses, C-heavy molasses, grains unfit for human consumption, sugarcane juice, sugar, sugar syrup, surplus rice and maize.The Ethanol Production Promotion Policy, 2021, of Bihar promotes new standalone ethanol manufacturing units by providing them additional capital subsidy at 15% of cost of plant and machinery up to a maximum of ₹5 crore. This capital subsidy will be in addition to existing incentives under Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy, 2016. Under the industrial policy, units are offered exemption from stamp duty and registration fees, exemption from land conversion fees, interest subvention incentive, SGST reimbursement and electricity duty reimbursement, employment subsidy and skill development subsidy. The new policy also provides additional subsidy for special class investors like SCs, STs, EBCs, women, differently-abled, war widows, acid attack victims and third gender entrepreneurs. In their case, the capital subsidy will be 15.75% of cost of plant and machinery up to a maximum of Rs. 5.25 crore.Dovetailing of capital subsidy with incentives under any Central government policy has been allowed. So, investors may avail capital subsidy under the policy even if they are availing incentive under any Central government policy.The policy lays significant emphasis on issuing licences and clearances in a timebound manner for new standalone ethanol units.“Stage-1 clearance will be issued to units in seven working days; application for BIADA land allotment will be disposed of in seven working days and department of industries will hand-hold investors/entrepreneurs in private land registration and land conversion and also in availing all licences/clearances and NOCs required for setting up unit,” industry minister Shahnawaz Husain said over phone.The industry department has also fixed timelines for applying under the scheme. “The willing investors will have to apply for stage-1 clearance latest by June 30 this year and then apply for financial clearance latest by June 30 next year,” the minister said.Policy highlightsTo provide investors additional capital subsidy at 15% of cost of Plant and machinery up to a maximum of ₹5 crore The capital subsidy will be in addition to existing incentives under Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy, 2016 Additional subsidy for SCs, STs, EBCs, women, differently abled, war widows, acid attack victims and third gender entrepreneursWilling investors will have to apply for stage-1 clearance latest by June 30||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-first-state-to-come-up-with-new-ethanol-policy-101615999449593.html

The Speaker told him that online reply to the question had not come to his office. The minister countered it, saying it had been sent to which the Speaker replied, “Only 11 replies had come”. At this point, the minister remarked that “one should not get so restless (etna vyakul hone se kaam nahin chalega)”. The comment by the minister apparently did not go well with the Speaker who asked the minister to withdraw his words, but Choudhary refused to relent, waiving a finger at the Chair. “You cannot run the House in this fashion,” the minister retorted. This apparently angered the Speaker who adjourned the House till 12 noon in the pre-lunch session. After the house reassembled, JD(U) MLA Narendra Narayan Yadav was on the chair and he adjourned the House till post lunch session. Later, when the House sat after lunch, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary told the chair that the minister would like express regret for his “uncalled for comments” at the Chair. “I apologise if my comments have hurt anybody,” the minister said. Later, the House resumed.

The LoP also taunted the chief minister, saying it would be better if Kumar opens a liquor outlet at his official residence and also at residences of other ministers on April 1 (the day Prohibition was imposed in the state in 2016) in case he fails to get the minister’s brother arrested or dismisses the minister from cabinet. “The CM should open an outlet of liquor at his residence as that would check smuggling of liquor and save him the trouble of dismissing ministers,” he said. “Some ministers show their fists in the House to the opposition leaders . What kind of ministers are these? In the House, the Opposition leader is not allowed to speak and put facts. This is unfortunate,” he said.Yadav said investigation into the recovery of liquor consignment on November 8 last year from the school premises at Bochaha in Muzaffarpur had revealed that the pick-up van used for ferrying liquor was in the name of the minister’s brother. “It is mentioned in the police diary,” he said, waving police records at the press conference.He also claimed the police report mentioned another close relative of the minister, Sanjeev Kumar. “I do want to stoop low about making unsavoury comments about one’s family. But this is all there in the police diary,” Yadav said, apparently hitting back at the land revenue minister who had taken sharp jibes at the Opposition leader’s family in the Assembly on Tuesday.The minister, who comes from BJP, has maintained that the school land is a self-acquired property of his brother and not ancestral and that he should not be blamed for his brother Hanslal Rai’s conduct. “It is quite surprising the school principal, Amarendra Kumar, who had informed the police about the liquor consignment on school premises is in jail whereas the brother of the minister has not been arrested. I ask why,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/arrest-minister-s-kin-for-liquor-haul-or-will-lay-siege-to-cm-s-house-tejashwi-101615999389649.html

The list has been approved by the Governor’s secretariat and notified in the gazette. Later in the day, all 12 were sworn in.Those nominated from the Governor’s quota include two ministers, Ashok Choudhary and Janak Ram, who were not members of any House. Upendra Kushwaha, who recently joined the JD-U, has also been chosen for nomination. Others picked for nomination include Prof Ram Bachan Rai, Sanjay Kumar Singh, Lalan Kumar Sarraf, Rajendra Prasad Gupta, Sanjay Singh, Devesh Kumar, Pramod Kumar, Ghanshyam Thakur and Nivedita Singh.Both BJP and JD-U have shared six seats each.Since the much-delayed Cabinet expansion of the Nitish government ahead of the budget session, all eyes were on the nomination for the 12 seats in the Council, which have been vacant since May 2020.On Tuesday, Leader of Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav had even raised the issue of a minister continuing for up to nine months without being a member of any House. He was alluding to building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, who was re-inducted into the new government after his six-month term as a minister expired before the Assembly elections in November last year since he was not a member of any of the two houses. Former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain and former BJP MP Janak Ram are also in the cabinet. Ram is not a member of any House and he needed to be nominated to the Upper House. Hussain was elected to the Council earlier. Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) leader Mukesh Sahni, who is minister of animal husbandry and fisheries, was elected to the Council earlier this year from the BJP seat from the Vidhan Sabha. The nomination to 12 seats of the Legislative Council was stuck due to lack of agreement on its distribution among the three constituents of the NDA, the BJP, JD-U and the LJP. Now, the new government has got four constituents and the equations have changed. Bihar is one among only seven states with a bicameral legislature, having both a Lower House (Legislative Assembly) with 243 members and an Upper House (Legislative Council). The council has a strength of 75 members. BJP, JD-U strike a 50:50 dealUpper House fullThe Council has 75 seats, of which 12 have been lying vacant since May 2020 and have now been filled.

However, his bail was rejected. A Covdi test was done for him and he was sent to Yerawada Central Jail,” said police inspector Sandeep Jore of Samarth police station who is investigating the case.A complaint in the matter was lodged by Madhuri Kulsange (28), a resident of Mangalwar peth who works at the MSEDCL.Sayyed had an unpaid bill of ₹11,481, according to the complainant.Kulsange went to the metre room of the SRA building and cut Sayyed’s connection as per the list of defaulters that she had.As soon as she cut the connection, Sayyed started hurling abuses at her, forcefully approached her and shut the metre room door from outside, the complainant said.The man allegedly refused to open the door until she restored the power supply on his connection.Kalsange then called an office assistant called Shailesh Dhumal from her office and narrated the incident to him. Dhumal arrived at the spot and was allegedly abused by Sayyed before he could open the door and let the 28-year-old woman out of the room.“Until January 31, 2021, not even a single connection was disconnected. As we saw no other option, we have started taking action of discontinuing connections since February 1. The service of complaint redressal about electricity bills is available at all offices of MSEDCL. There is also a facility of paying unpaid bills in parts (EMIs). However, people harassing and abusing employees providing 24*7 service will be penalised,” said an MSEDCL spokesperson.A case under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 352 (assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation), 342 (wrongful confinement), 504 (insult with an intent of provoking a breach of peace), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Samarth police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/msedcl-employee-locked-inside-metre-room-for-cutting-connection-over-unpaid-bills-one-held-101615998489594.html

About 15 high-risk contacts and five low-risk contacts. We are ensuring that each ward tests about 20 contacts for every new case.”On Tuesday, PMC tested reported 1,925 new cases and traced over 19,000 contacts out of which 4,020 are high-risk contacts and 15,366 are low-risk contacts. This brings the number to about ten contacts per new case. Also, 264 contacts of index cases were reported to test positive for Covid.The health ministry secretary Rajesh Bhushan in his letter to the state department wrote, ‘For every positive case, at least 20 to 30 close contacts (including family contacts, social contacts’ workplace contacts and other casual contacts) need to be promptly traced and tracked. The field staff engaged in contact tracing requires training/reorientation and develop skills in interpersonal communication for contact tracing. The contacts of a positive case should be tested strictly in accordance with the ICMR guidelines (five-ten days after exposure).”The team remarked, “The case-contact ratio is more than 1:20. Though it appears high, a deep dive into the methodology of contact tracing revealed that the main concept of contact tracing was not clearly understood by the field level staff, who were mainly listing the immediate family and neighbourhood contacts, for the sake of listing. The high-risk contacts in workplace settings, social settings and family settings were not investigated and listed. The monitoring of the contacts was limited to conveying the message to the high-risk contacts for testing the very next day (and not as per the ICMR guidelines).”The report further said that for every case at-least 20-30 contacts need to be traced and tracked. Contact tracing should focus on family contacts, social contacts, workplace contacts and other casual contacts like vendors among others. The field staff now engaged in contact tracing requires training/reorientation and develop skills on interpersonal communication for contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/contact-tracing-not-done-as-per-protocol-says-central-team-101615994649314.html

We are trying our best to convey the message.”“Frontline workers have to understand that it is not just for their own benefit, but also the fact that they could be super spreaders. They have to get the complete efficacy which is possible only after second dose,” she said.FLW’s are at a greater risk because of their potential exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid infection and could then further spread the infection to their contacts. These include personnel from state and central police organisations, Armed Forces, home guards, prison staff and civil defence volunteers including disaster management volunteers, municipal workers, revenue officers engaged in containment and surveillance activities among others.The vaccination for FLW’s began on February 8, 2021, and the administration of the second dose began on March 2. Pune has been lagging behind Mumbai and Nagpur in terms of coverage for beneficiaries under phase two and so to boost vaccination coverage in the city Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is increasing session sites every day.The central health ministry in its letter to the state health department has written that “The central team could perceive a sense of helplessness by the field level health staff for implementing the test, track, isolate and treat policy, with other departmental staff having been withdrawn and the health staff too also pre-occupied with vaccine administration, there is a limited human resource for the surveillance and contact tracing activities. The district administration must engage the staff earlier appointed on a contractual basis to support the field staff.” It is possible that the administration might engage FLW’s for surveillance in micro-containment zones which are rising each day in the city.As of March 16, the progressive count in PMC stands at 0.228 million and the death toll stands at 4,636, according to the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-1-of-pune-city-s-frontline-workers-complete-two-dose-vaccination-course-101615994229328.html

Harjit told the police that on Tuesday night, he and his son were woken up by noises in their street.When they went to the roof to inspect the matter, they found Amandeep and Paras, along with three more men, hurling abuses at Gurpal, accusing him being involved in the attack on the Jainpur village sarpanch and threatened to kill him. The men suddenly fired shots at their house, but they managed to duck out of their sight and escaped unhurt. Meanwhile, the assailants sped away in a car.“As many as 13 empty bullet shells were found outside the victims’ house. Prima facie, it appears Gurpal and the shooters were friends turned foes. So far, there is no evidence against Gurpal’s involvement in the Jainpur firing,” said assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Harpal Singh, in-charge, Humbran police post.The accused have been booked under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act. A hunt is on for their arrest.The ASI said Amandeep was already facing trial in several criminal cases. He was booked in 2011 for firing shots in Sahnewal, along with gangster Dharminder Singh Gugni and other accomplices. Both Gugni and Amandeep were arrested in the case, but the latter was bailed out in 2016.In the March 14 incident, a group of 25 assailants had opened fire at the house of Balkaran Singh, 30, the sarpanch of Jainpur village. The shooters had also barged into his house and vandalised a car parked in the verandah. The sarpanch had a narrow escape as he locked himself in the house. Following his complaint, PAU police had registered a case of murder bid, house trespass and theft against Gurwinder Singh Gora of Bhatha Dhua village, Inderjit Singh Indra, Harsh Sebi, Manpreet Singh Bhathal and their 20 unidentified accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/historysheeter-accomplices-fire-13-rounds-at-ludhiana-man-his-father-101615989610016.html

It has also reported a mortality rate of 0.58 per cent, one of the lowest in India.Last Monday, the state created a record of sorts when it inoculated 1,73,137 people — the highest in a single day. The state had mobilised “Jeevika didis” and targeted to inoculate over 1 lakh women on Monday.Now, in the face of what is being called the second wave of the Covid-19 infection, Bihar is upping its daily coronavirus testing. To tackle the new wave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today handed out a five-point plan to the states, directing the authorities to "immediately stop" the emerging threat.Reiterating his famous slogan 'Dawai bhi, kadai bhi' (yes to medicine, yes to caution), PM Modi said states will have to step up testing, focus on maximising vaccination and minimising wastage. In his five-point plan, the first is Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. In addition to that, the states will have to scale up RT-PCR tests, creating micro-containment zones, increase vaccination in both private and government hospitals and stop vaccine wastage.About 70 districts of the country have seen an increase of more than 150 per cent in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few weeks, PM Modi said, adding that if the spread can’t be contained now, a situation of a nationwide outbreak can come up.

17-03-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan minister says CM will resign if phone tapping claims are proven||The Rajasthan government informed the state assembly on Wednesday that it did not tap phones of any legislator during last year's political crisis.Rejecting the BJP's allegations on phone tapping, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the saffron party was making an issue in order to protect Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.He said the chief minister would offer his resignation if these allegations were proved right."Not only the chief minister, all of us will resign," Dhariwal added.However, the BJP demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter and created a ruckus in the assembly which led to adjournment of the House twice.The controversy around phone tapping erupted in July last year during the political crisis that was caused due to the rebellion of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's leadership.On the basis of three audio clips in which Shekhawat and Congress leaders could be heard talking about a conspiracy to topple Gehlot's government, Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi had registered FIRs with the Special Operations Group (SOG) and the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).Dhariwal said after the FIRs were registered, SOG officers had gone to the residence and office of the minister in Delhi to collect Shekhawat's voice sample but failed to get the same.He said BJP leaders should tell Shekhawat that their party was facing embarrassment because of him and hence, he should take the voice test.On the allegations by the BJP that the voice clips were prepared and circulated by Lokesh Sharma, the OSD to the chief minister, Dhariwal said the audio clips were received on WhatsApp.He stressed that forwarding an audio clip on WhatsApp was not a crime.Dhariwal apprised the House that the SOG last year intercepted phones of two persons -- Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani -- with permission from the Home Department, after receiving information about illegal arms smuggling and movement of explosives.He said none of them was a politician but during the interception, conspiracy to depose the Gehlot government was exposed and that the SOG inspector lodged an FIR in the matter.The minister said the government did not order any MLA's, MP's or an elected representative's phone-tapping.Dhariwal reminisced that during the 90s, when efforts were being made to topple Bhairon Singh Shekhawat-led BJP government in the state, it was Gehlot, who met then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao and then Rajasthan governor Baliram Bhagat to speak against it.Dhariwal concluded his reply by taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which invited a sharp reaction from the BJP members who stormed to the well of the House and created a ruckus in the assembly.Speaker CP Joshi concluded the debate and adjourned the House for half an hour.The House was adjourned for the second time for another 30 minutes.Prior to the minister's reply, Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria asked if the phones were not tapped, then why was the FIR lodged.He said if the cases lodged were true, then the government should take action against the accused.When the House reassembled, the speaker said it was everyone's responsibility to respect the president, vice president, prime minister, chief minister and other leaders in a parliamentary democracy.Saying that no such comment which may weaken the parliamentary democracy should be made, the speaker directed to expunge the comments of Dhariwal against the prime minister.Earlier in the day, the suspension of BJP MLA Madan Dilawar was revoked after the leader of opposition tendered an apology for his conduct.Dilawar was suspended for seven days for his "unruly behaviour" in the House on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-minister-says-cm-will-resign-if-phone-tapping-claims-are-proven-101615987569023.html

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had called me to reinstate the then suspended police officer Sachin Waze back into the police force. Some Shiv Sena ministers later met me with the same request.""When I received the proposal to reinstate Waze back into police force, I verbally sought advocate general's opinion about it. I was told that Waze was suspended after the Bombay High Court's order. Therefore, I decided not to reinstate him," Fadnavis said.The Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Assembly also alleged that the Shiv Sena even tried to pressurise him over it.The BJP and the Shiv Sena shared power between 2014 and 2019. However, after the 2019 Assembly polls, the Sena parted ways with the BJP over sharing the chief minister's post and joined hands with the NCP and the Congress. Uddhav Thackeray heads the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.Credited with eliminating 63 alleged criminals in 'encounters', Waze, a 1990-batch officer of the state cadre, was suspended in 2004 over his role in the custodial death of a 2002 Ghatkopar blast suspect Khwaja Yunus and was reinstated last year.

17-03-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19 positivity rate in Punjab has doubled, says health ministry as state’s tally crosses 2 lakh||The Union health ministry pointed out on Wednesday that Punjab’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positivity rate has currently doubled to 6.8 per cent from 3.4 per cent previously, which reveals people are not adhering to the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Addressing a press conference, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan compared the Punjab positivity rate with that of India and said, “The country’s cumulative positivity rate is 5 per cent while the weekly positivity is 3 per cent. This is a worrying situation as one state (Punjab) is seeing 6.8 per cent positivity while another state (Maharashtra) has 16 per cent positivity.”Bhushan said the daily average of Covid disease cases in Punjab was earlier at 531 and has now climbed to 1,338 in the last 15 days. The capital city of Chandigarh also saw its positivity rate increase from 3.5 per cent to 7 per cent and the daily average of cases have increased more than twice from 49 (on March 1) to 111(on March 15), he added. “Covid-19 tests in Chandigarh are coming up and going down and hence there is no distinct trend. We would want a distinct increasing trend of tests in which RT-PCR’s share is substantially higher than the present 40 per cent,” Bhushan said.Punjab's positivity rate is now 6.8%; this is worrying. This shows that COVID19 appropriate behaviour is not being followed: Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan pic.twitter.com/MX9az6XHRMPunjab has so far recorded over 2,00,000 Covid disease cases of which 6,137 people have died, 182,283 have recovered and active cases are at 11,942, according to the state’s health department bulletin. On Tuesday, 1,475 fresh cases and 38 deaths were reported. On Monday, 1,843 cases were recorded - which was the highest in more than six months. Currently, nine districts in Punjab are observing night curfew from 11pm to 5am and the state’s education department has postponed board examinations for class 10 and 12 to May 4 and May 24, respectively.Also Read| Maharashtra, UP, Telangana: What PM Modi observed about Covid-19 in these statesAs the overall situation in Punjab has been worsening for nearly a month, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday appealed to the central government to review its immunisation strategy and vaccinate all age groups in selected areas of the state- where weekly testing shows a doubling of positivity rate, according to news agency PTI. Singh, who was a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Covid-19 review meeting with all chief ministers, said the cases have been on the rise in Punjab due to people showing laxity in following Covid-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-positivity-rate-in-punjab-has-doubled-says-health-ministry-101615982853336.html
17-03-2021||Other||Lt Gen DP Pandey takes command of Chinar Corps||Lieutenant General BS Raju on Wednesday handed over the command of the strategic Kashmir-based 15 Corps to Lt Gen DP Pandey. Lt Gen Raju will take over as the director general of military operations (DGMO) of the Indian Army.At a simple ceremony held at the headquarters of the Chinar Corps, the baton was handed over to Lt Gen Pandey, who was earlier serving as the director general of territorial army. He has also served in Kashmir as the general officer commanding (GOC) of the counter-insurgency Kilo Force.Lt Gen Raju commanded the 15 Corps, which guards the Line of Control in Kashmir, in a critical phase in 2020 when the Valley faced twin challenges of terrorism and Covid-19 pandemic.The army in a statement said that Lt Gen Raju’s tenure over the last one year is defined by an improved security environment prevailing both on the Line of Control (LoC) and in Kashmir. “With the civil administration and security forces synergising their efforts to bring normalcy back to Kashmir, terrorism is on decline with assessed residual terrorist numbers being the lowest in a decade. On the LoC, his approach combined a forward heavy deployment enabled by a dense electronic and surveillance grid. Pakistani ceasefire violations were dealt with punitive responses resulting in operational ascendancy by the Indian Army,” the statement said.To complement relentless and successful counterterrorist operations, it read, Lt Gen Raju ensured an improved soldier-citizen connection. “This effort included many successful events all over the Valley. The army effectively used its deployment grid, especially in far-flung areas, to be the first respondent in case of need. Grassroot interactions and Day with Company Commander received overwhelming response,” it added. Having served as Uri Brigade commander, GOC of Victor Force and now as GOC Chinar Corps, Lt Gen Raju reinforced and institutionalised high professional standards and ethical conduct in combat operations, the army said.

17-03-2021||Mumbai||Ambani bomb scare: Maharashtra govt transfers Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh||Amid the controversy over the bomb scare at billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia and the subsequent arrest of former police officer Sachin Vaze, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday transferred Param Bir Singh from the post of police commissioner of Mumbai to the head of the home guard. Acting director general of police Hemant Nagrale has been appointed as the new Mumbai Police commissioner, home minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted.Singh, a 1988-batch officer, has been held responsible for the inept handling of the bomb scare and the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran. Vaze’s arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), too, is said to be the reason behind his sudden transfer. The decision was announced after a slew of meetings were held between key leaders from the three ruling parties (Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party) and top home department officials over the last two days.Also Read | Case cracked, says NIA: ‘Vaze did it for lost glory’“State government’s key decision—Shri Hemant Nagrale to become the new police commissioner of Mumbai. Rajnish Sheth will be the acting director general of police. Shri Sanjay Pandey will be director general of Maharashtra State Security Corporation. Shri Param Bir Singh will head the home guards,” Deshmukh tweeted in Marathi.According to officials from the home department, the Mumbai CP has been replaced with immediate effect. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a meeting with home minister Anil Deshmukh, and officers Nagrale and Singh for over an hour on Tuesday evening. A high-level meeting was held by CM Thackeray with the key leaders of the three ruling parties on Thursday morning at his official residence to apprise them about the decision,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was behind the bomb scare outside billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, which he orchestrated as part of a conspiracy to restore his reputation as a successful cop, senior officers in NIA told HT on Tuesday, contending that the mystery around the explosive-laden vehicle has been solved.Vaze, a former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was initially the lead investigator after a Scorpio car carrying 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, with no detonator or timer) was found near Ambani’s Antilia on Carmichael Road on February 25. The case was transferred to NIA on March 8, and Vaze was arrested on March 13.Vaze’s role first came under the spotlight after the death of Mansukh Hiran, who came forward as the person who had possession of the Scorpio SUV before it was found from outside Antilla. Hiran told police it was stolen from his residence before he was interrogated multiple times, including by Vaze’s unit.Hiran was found dead on March 5, and the police said it was a suicide. His wife, however, said she suspected the police officer’s role in the death, kicking off a chain of events that eventually led to Vaze being questioned and detained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ambani-bomb-scare-maharashtra-govt-transfers-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-101615982709122.html
17-03-2021||Bangalore||Woman allegedly exploited by ex-Karnataka minister abducted, says her father||The woman, who was allegedly sexually exploited by former Karnataka minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, was on Tuesday abducted from a hostel in Bengaluru, her father said in a police complaint in Belagavi. The father alleged unidentified people threatened, sexually harassed, and tortured his daughter. The same people also circulated the unverified video of a person resembling the former minister with the woman, he added.The woman’s family also released a video requesting the government to help them trace their daughter. Her mother said the woman told her that the latter’s pictures were morphed before the video was aired on news channels. “She told us that she had been held against her will. After two days, her phone was switched off and we do not know where she is now,” the mother said.“After seeing the video on television, I called her and told her that there is a video of someone like her on television. But she said it was not her...and they have used her morphed photo. She told me that she had not committed any mistake.”Also Read| ‘Conspiracy, fake videos’: BJP’s Ramesh Jarkiholi on alleged sex tape rowThe mother added she asked her to return home, but she said she cannot since there was a threat to her life. “After that when I called her again, she said she was safe. She used to keep messaging my sons but one day she asked us not to contact her because her phone is being monitored. When my son called her again, the phone was switched off.”The woman also released a video citing the threat to her and her family. Belagavi’s police commissioner, K Thiyagarajan, said the complaint was filed, but no First Information Report has been registered so far. “We are seeking legal opinion on the matter. We are collecting information from the family as of now,” he said. He added since the complaint says the alleged abduction took place in Bengaluru, the case could be transferred to Bengaluru police. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said that so far, they have not received any information from the Belagavi police. Jarkiholi resigned from the state cabinet a day after allegations of sexual exploitation surfaced against the Bharatiya Janata Party legislator from Gokak in Belagavi district on March 3.In his resignation letter, Jarkiholi said the allegations against him were “far from the truth”. “There should be an investigation into this. Even though I am innocent, I am taking moral responsibility and resigning from the cabinet,” Jarkiholi said in the letter, written in Kannada.Also Read | Yatnal doubts transparency of probe by SIT in harassment case against MLAThe resignation came after Dinesh Kalahalli, a social activist, filed a police complaint in Bengaluru as the video went viral.

The move came after Sangita Srivastava, the university vice-chancellor, wrote a letter to officials seeking a ban on Muslim calls for prayer via loudspeakers from the mosque saying it disturbs her sleep in the morning.Kaleem-ur-Rehman, the caretaker of the Lal Masjid, said after police informed them about the problem, the committee immediately took steps to address the issue. “The volume of the system, which was already a decibel less than the norm set by the [Allahabad high] court, has been further reduced by half and direction of one of the loudspeakers has also been changed, so that it points away from the vice chancellor’s home,” he said.Rehman said had she spoken to the members of the management committee, they would have ensured that there was no inconvenience to anyone living near the mosque..Earlier in her letter dated March 3 to district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami complaining about noise pollution, Srivastava said every day at around 5.30 am, her sleep gets disturbed due to the call from the mosque. Copies of the letter were also marked to other top officials.“The sleep so disturbed does not resume even after trying very hard. This also results in a headache throughout the day, causing losses in work hours,” said the letter, a copy of which HT has seen.The letter went viral on social media.Also Read | Action against Prayagraj hospital sought in alleged medical negligence caseSrivastava attached a copy of the Allahabad high court’s May 2020 judgement on azaan, or the call for prayer. The court held that azaan may be an essential part of Islam, but its amplification cannot be said to be integral to the religion, warranting protection of the fundamental right enshrined under Article 25 of the Constitution, which is even otherwise subject to public order, morality or health, and other provisions. Thus, under no circumstances, sound amplifying devices can be permitted to be used between 10pm and 6am, the order said.Goswami said the letter was received and necessary action as per the law would be taken.Prayagraj’s senior police superintendent Sarvashresth Tripathi said orders have been issued for a probe in light of the complaint.Former Allahabad University Students’ Union vice-president Akhilesh Yadav said the concept of communal harmony lies at India’s core and unfortunately speaking against religions has become fashionable. He demanded strict action against Srivastava.The call for prayers is made five times a day.

The Speaker recently called top officials of the industries department for explaining a faux pas made in a reply tabled by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala to an unstarred question by Mullana Congress MLA Varun Chaudhary on action taken by the government on the 2015 Enterprise Promotion Policy. The incorrect reply tabled during the assembly session on November 5, 2020, reads: “Two projects of tool room/technology centres have been set up at IMT Rohtak (19.8 acres), and Industrial Growth Centre, Saha (10 acres), with an approximate investment of ₹150 crore by the Government of India. The land for these projects has been provided by HSIIDC as the state’s contribution.” The Congress MLA had subsequently complained to the Speaker about the incorrect and misleading bits of information tabled in the House. “The Speaker has asked senior industry department officers to fix responsibility of those who submitted incorrect information in the reply,” Chaudhary said. Rectifying the mistake, Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday told the assembly that courses in the Rohtak tool room were started in 2018. “As far as the proposal of a tool room for Saha was concerned, there were problems regarding land. Also, the Centre decided to fund one tool room for each state. However, we have urged the central government to consider our proposal for a second tool room. The state government has identified 20 acres for the Saha tool room and conveyed the proposal to the Centre,” said Chautala, who holds the industries and commerce portfolios. The minister’s reply came on a starred question by Chaudhary, who also sought a deadline for the setting up the Saha tool room. Chaudhary said there were multiple instances when the executive was found to be misleading the legislature. The Speaker told the House that if any official provided wrong information, a motion of privilege will be brought against him/her in the assembly. He was responding to a statement by Congress MLA Kuldeep Vats, who wanted action against such officials. “If any official provides a wrong report, please let me know,” the Speaker told the MLA.Assembly speaker, Gian Chand Gupta told HT that the industries department officials have tendered an unconditional apology in the matter. “However, I have asked the state government to fix responsibility of the officials responsible for the omission,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-speaker-warns-officials-against-tabling-misleading-info-in-assembly-101615980609047.html

Curious onlookers gathered but nobody dared to go near Vijay.When somebody shouted at Narender, he hurled the club he attacked Vijay with towards the people. He can be seen trying to make a call before fleeing the spot.Also Read | Boy beaten for drinking water in Ghaziabad temple, two arrestedK Chandrasekhar Reddy, a local police officer, cited the preliminary probe and added the brothers had a dispute over some inherited property. “Apparently, the family elders brought about a compromise between the two and settled the matter a few days ago, but still they continued to quarrel.”Reddy said on Tuesday night, the two had a quarrel and traded blows. “Narender, who was in an inebriated condition, picked up a club from a nearby shop and repeatedly attacked his brother on his head.”The police rushed Vijay to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead. “We have taken Narender into custody and are questioning him.

17-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi could have an accessible riverfront in a few years: DDA||Large parts of the 54km-long Yamuna riverfront have been inaccessible for Delhiites for decades, while industrial waste and untreated sewage are continuously dumped into the river.However, there is a change in the offing. While the Delhi government has set a three-year target to clean the river, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is working on rejuvenating and making the riverfront accessible to the public.From cycling tracks, walkways, eco-trails to wetlands and a floodplain forest, the 22km-long rejuvenated urban riverfront between Wazirabad Barrage to Okhla Barrage will not only help people connect with the river (which has long been neglected) but also check the dying ecosystem of the Yamuna floodplains, both flora and fauna, a senior DDA official said. Close to 1,400 hectares of land are being developed by DDA on the eastern and western banks of the river.Also Read | SC rejects farmers’ plea on land acquisition for Delhi-Katra national highwayDDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “The entire stretch has been divided into 10 projects, each spread over 90 hectares and above. The work is moving at a fast pace, and the three projects will be completed in the next few months. We aim to complete large parts of projects by the end of this year.”The project to restore the riverfront was conceived following a National Green Tribunal order in 2015. The work on the riverfront, DDA officials said, started in 2017 and was monitored by the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee that was set up in 2018. The committee concluded its proceedings in January this year after it submitted its final report. DDA officials said that the restoration work on the 22km-stretch in Delhi has been planned as per the committee’s directions. The restoration work is being closely monitored by Delhi lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, who has been taking regular review meetings. A report regarding the status of work was presented to the L-G in February by DDA. One of the biggest challenges in restoring the riverfront, Jain said, is removing encroachments and reclaiming the land. According to a senior DDA official, about 1,000 acres of land have been cleared of encroachment and are being developed, and work is going on in other parts.As for the issue of dumping of debris on the floodplains, DDA officials said they have installed CCTV cameras and deployed staff to keep a check on the menace.Of the 10 projects, three projects—Kalindi Biodiversity, Park Asita East, Asita West—are in advanced stages of construction and will be completed in the next few months, officials in the know of the matter said.Spread over 200 hectares, Asita West, located between the Old Railway Bridge and the ITO barrage, is one of the first areas being rejuvenated. DDA has developed 4.8km of walkways, 1.5km of cycleways, three new water bodies, 300m of green buffer along the river, greenways, etc. on 93 hectares of land. The project is likely to be completed by June this year.A senior DDA official involved in the project said, “In Asita West, we have cleared 140 acres of land of encroachment and developed these facilities. There are floodplain forests, grasslands and buffer areas along the river edge planted with riverine species of grasses like sedges, Saccharum, Cymbopogon etc.”For residents of Walled City and nearby areas, this has become a popular spot. Kishore Kumar (35), who lives and works in Chandni Chowk, said that he often comes here with his children. “While there are parks in the area, there aren’t many such large open spaces. We usually come here on weekends. They have now expanded the park and constructed a water body here.”Also Read | 220 acre Bharat Vandana park in Dwarka sub-city gets green clearanceShambhu Nath Pathak, who works at the park, said, “A lot of people from nearby areas come here for morning walks and exercise. The park is crowded during the weekends. The work is still going on. A small passage has been created for people to walk up to the river.”DDA officials said that as part of all 10 projects, walkways, cycle tracks, eco-trails, as well as wetlands will be developed. DDA also plans to develop the three ghats (Qudsia, Yamuna Bazaar and Sur ghats). While work on Sur Ghat is expected to be completed by September this year, plans for the other two are yet to be prepared.As part of the rejuvenation project, DDA is developing a biodiversity park near Delhi Noida Direct (DND) Flyway. Spread over 116 hectares between DND Flyway and Okhla Barrage, the biodiversity park will have 11 constructed wetlands and will treat sewage from about 25 drains. It will also have 100m-wide greenways, about 6km-long walking trails and recreational parks.CR Babu, who heads the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) at Delhi University, said, “Two of the 11 constructed wetlands are operational. We are treating drain water that has raw sewage from the Kilokri drain naturally via a constructed wetland system before the water is released into the river. A similar wetland system will be soon operational for the Maharani Bagh drain where 500MLD (millions of litres per day) of drain water will be treated. We are also constructing recreational spaces.”However, environment experts say that beautifying the floodplains will serve no purpose if the river continues to be dirty.Faiyaz A Khudsar, a scientist in charge of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park who is involved in the development of Kalindi Biodiversity park, said, “The river has to be clean before you take people close to it. How can people sit near the river if it stinks? Just beautifying the floodplains is not enough, we have to restore the ecology of the area which will help not only rejuvenate the river but become an attraction for the people.”He added, “We are developing grasslands and woodlands, and one can see already restored wetland and established biological communities in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park. We are working on ensuring that sewerage water is naturally treated through constructed wetland systems before it is discharged into the river.”Khudsar and AK Gosain, a professor of civil engineering at IIT Delhi, who submitted a drainage master plan to the Delhi government in 2017, said that just treating a few drains is not enough and efforts should be made to ensure that no sewage flows into the river.Gosain said, “There is a need to ensure that sewage doesn’t flow into the river. There are around 200 natural drain segments in Delhi and most of them are flooded with sewage. We had advised the government to put in a system in place whereby sewage from unauthorised colonies, where there are no sewer lines, is trapped and diverted to nearby sewer lines. The natural drains should be clean and are meant to carry only stormwater.”On the completion of the first year of the Delhi government’s second term, Delhi health and urban development minister Satyendar Jain said after defeating Covid-19, the Delhi government will focus on cleaning the Yamuna in three years.“Nobody believed us when we promised to provide 24×7 electricity, but today, the Delhi government is providing 24×7 electricity to the people of Delhi. Soon, we will also provide 24×7 water supply as well. [Delhi chief minister Arvind] Kejriwal has given clear instructions to complete the Yamuna cleaning project as soon as possible and we are working day and night for this,” Jain said on February 16.While work on the restoration of the riverfront, which was disrupted last year due to the coronavirus disease pandemic, is picking up pace, DDA officials said that a majority of the work will be completed by December 2021.DDA is also planning to send a proposal to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for approval of funding of the project from the Urban Development Fund, which is collected by DDA mainly through conversion charges, said a DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-could-have-an-accessible-riverfront-in-a-few-years-dda-101615977309341.html

17-03-2021||Chandigarh||CAG sees red on Hisar golf greens||The comptroller and auditor general (CAG) has asked the Haryana government to consider fixing responsibility of those who allowed unauthorised use of government land for playing golf. In its report on social, general and economic sectors (non-PSUs) ending March 2019, the CAG said the golf course developed on a piece of government land with government resources at third battalion, Haryana Armed Police (HAP), Hisar, was allowed for use by private persons in an unauthorised manner for more than five years. Also, revenue to the tune of ₹80.87 lakh generated by its management committee was kept outside the government account, the audit said. The CAG said that Section 3(a) of the Public Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Act, states that a person shall be deemed to be in unauthorised occupation of any public premises if he enters into possession thereof otherwise than under and in pursuance of any allotment, lease or grant. Section 3(c)(i) of the Act and rule 3.29 of Punjab Police Rules prohibit the use/lease of public premises without government permission. Rule 4.1 of the Punjab Financial Rules (PFR) provide that the departmental controlling officers should see that all sums due to government are regularly and promptly assessed, realised and credited into the treasury. Govt resources used for paying power and water chargesThe third battalion, HAP, Hisar, occupied 83 acres and imparted training to newly recruited police constables. Of the 83 acres, the commandant, third battalion developed a golf course in 55 acres with the approval of the DGP and formally started the golf course in October 2010 under the name of Haryana Armed Police Green Golf Course. In November 2013, the golf course was opened to private persons by allowing membership. Private persons were made members to make the course self-sustainable and for generating funds for its upkeep. A managing committee, chaired by the inspector general (IG), Hisar range, was also set up for managing the affairs of the golf course like a private enterprise. The managing committee generated and retained revenue of ₹80.87 lakh up to December 2018 as membership and maintenance fee, whereas government resources were used on payment of electricity and water charges and deployment of manpower for operation and maintenance of the golf course, the report said. “Managing the affairs of the golf course through a managing committee and allowing membership to private persons tantamount to leasing it out to a private body as permission from the government was not obtained for constructing the golf course on its land and funds generated by the body were being kept outside the government account and were spent by the body without following the government rules and regulations,” the audit said. In April 2019, the DGP replied that membership fee and maintenance charges were being deposited in a separate bank account and were managed by a committee headed by IG, Hisar range, and the operation of this account was done as per procedure prescribed in the club’s constitution. All expenditures were incurred strictly as per constitution of the club, the DGP’s reply said. Golf course leased out without approval The CAG, however, said the reply was not tenable as funds generated by way of membership and maintenance fee were kept out of the consolidated fund of the state without specific authorisation. Further, government resources were being used for the operation and maintenance of golf course as payments of electricity and water charges were made from government funds and police manpower was deployed for development of the golf course, the audit said. “Thus, the golf course was leased out to a private body without specific approval of the government by violating provisions of the Haryana Public Premises and Land (Eviction and Rent Recovery) Act and was under unauthorised use of a private body for more than five years. More than two-thirds of the area allotted for the battalion by the government was used for the golf course, without payment of any lease money to the government. The action of the police department was in violation of extant government rules and regulation,” the CAG said. The matter was referred to the state government in March 2019 and subsequent reminders were issued in June 2019 and May 2020. The government reply was awaited, the audit report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cag-sees-red-on-hisar-golf-greens-101615974308812.html

The list has been approved by the governor’s secretariat and notified in the gazette. The swearing in is likely soon, said officials.The leaders chosen for nomination from the governor’s quota include two ministers – Ashok Choudhary and Janak Ram, who were not members of any house. Upendra Kushwaha, who recently joined the JD-U, has also been chosen for nomination.Others selected for nomination include Prof Ram Bachan Rai, Sanjay Kumar Singh, Lalan Kumar Sarraf, Rajendra Prasad Gupta, Sanjay Singh, Devesh Kumar, Pramod Kumar, Ghanshyam Thakur and Nivedita Singh. Both BJP and JD-U have shared six seats each.Since the much-delayed cabinet expansion of the Nitish government ahead of the budget session, all eyes were on the nomination for the 12 seats of the council, which have been vacant since May 2020.Top leaders of the alliance said that the two main constituents – JD-U and the BJP were in agreement on the formula adopted for sharing of the 12 seats.On Tuesday, Leader of Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav also raised the issue of a minister continuing for up to nine months without being a member of any house. Building construction minister Ashok Choudhary is not a member of any house. He was re-inducted into Nitish cabinet in the new government after his 6-month term as a minister expired before the assembly elections in November last year since he was not a member of any of the two houses.Former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain and former BJP MP Janak Ram are also in the cabinet. Ram is not a member of any house and he needed to be nominated to the Upper House. Hussain was elected to the council earlier.Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) leader Mukesh Sahni, who is minister of animal husbandry and fisheries, was elected to the council earlier this year on the BJP seat from the Vidhan Sabha.The nomination to 12 seats of the legislative council was stuck due to lack of agreement on its distribution among the three constituents of the NDA – the BJP, JD-U and the LJP. Now, the new government has got four constituents and the equations have changed.Bihar is one among only seven states with a bi-cameral legislature, having both a lower house (Legislative Assembly) and an upper house (Legislative Council).

When DU opened the college for final year students in a phased manner, rumours were rampant on campus ki finally freshers ki mauj hogi, kyunki phase two main pura DU khul jaayega. But aisa nahi hua,” shares a sad Manish Mourya, student of Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College who makes memes using #AbTohCampusKholDo on Instagram to express his angst. Mourya further shares, “Humare mock exams chal rahe hai and many of my friends spammed their exam answer sheets with sentences like - Online teaching and learning has been very horrible because kuch samajh nahi aata! Second semester mein college khulwao, mujhe nahi pata.”Delhi University professors who have been at the receiving end of such answer sheets have been understanding towards students’ frustration. “It’s funny when we read such answer sheets that have requests to reopen campus. As these were mock exams, therefore it didn’t matter what the students wrote as we just wanted to acquaint the freshers with how Open Book Examinations (OBE) are. We understand what the students are going through, the pandemic has put a dampener on all their college fun,” shares a professor on condition of anonymity.Meme lords have been making trending content on #AbTohCampusKholDo on social media. However, they share that while students enjoy reposting these memes, they are also scared of giving offline exams once the colleges reopen. “As a DU student and a meme page admin, I make memes about our online campus life and on how campus should fully reopen. However, offline exams ka darr makes students feel that online exams main toh cheating ho jaati hai magar offline exams mein kya hoga. Most of the students are therefore confused as they want college to open to meet their friends and have fun living the college life but on the other hand they don’t want to give offline exams and have gotten comfortable with OBE. So as a meme page admin I make memes on both these topics ki campus khol do magar exams online hi rakho,” shares Sahil Rajput, student of Shaheed Bhagat Singh College and admin of Instagram meme page, du_memeswale. Rajput concludes, “Asking for campus to reopen through memes, gifs, stickers and reel is a funny yet relevant rebellion we all are undertaking, to reclaim our campus days!”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/abtohcampuskholdo-rebellion-du-students-spam-answer-sheets-make-memes-101615971010853.html

The clash resulted in injuries to 11 persons, including policemen and a couple of senior officials. More than 50 villagers have been arrested for the clash along with the man accused of hiring contract killers to eliminate Gupta. “More than 100 people have been identified, while 54 have already been arrested for their involvement in the clash,” said Navin Chand Jha, superintendent of police (SP), East Champaran, on Wednesday.Sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Areraj, Jyoti Prakash, and sub divisional magistrate (SDM), Sanjeev Kumar, were among the injured in the clash. On Tuesday morning four criminals on two motorcycles, barged into a shop and shot Matiyariya panchayat PACS president Pawan Gupta from a close range, killing him at the spot, said police. PACS are the grass root level arms of the short-term co-operative credit structure.“The local gave a hot chase and caught hold of one of the assailants, while three others managed to escape on a motorcycle,” Shiv Kumar, a local resident quoted eye-witnesses as saying. As the news of the murder spread, a large number of villagers gathered near the Bazaar area, set the motorcycle used in crime on fire and thrashed the captured criminal, identified as Anil Sahni. “They were unwilling to hand the criminal to the police when we reached and tried to rescue him. When we tried to claim his custody, a crowd gathered there and attacked the police team,” said Jyoti Prakash, sub divisional police officer (SDPO), Areraj, who suffered leg injuries. At around 1pm, Matiyariya Bazaar area suddenly resembled a war zone as the protestors fought pitched battle and hurled stones, seriously injuring four police personnel. Normalcy returned only after reinforcements from Areraj, Govindpur and Sagsuli police stations reached the spot and fired several rounds in the air. Victim Pawan Gupta was seen as a contestant for the post of village headman against incumbent mukhiya Surendra Singh for Matiyariya panchayat this year, locals said. SDPO Jyoti Prakash confirmed the arrest of Matiyariya panchayat head Surendra Singh for allegedly hiring contract killers to eliminate Pawan Gupta.“In the course of preliminary investigation, the arrested criminal Anil Sahni accepted to have received a contract from Surendra Singh,” said the sub divisional police officer. The condition of Sahni, who was badly thrashed by the crowd, is stated to be serious, while injured police personnel are undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Areraj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pacs-chairman-shot-dead-in-bihar-angry-villagers-clash-with-police-101615968548639.html
17-03-2021||Other||Expert view: Covid-19 resurgence... Why Pune, again?||For the last two-three weeks we are observing a rising trend of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. Pune is showing this rise more prominently. As of March 13, Pune has the highest number of cases in the country. Why Pune again? As if Covid-19 is just proving the local proverbial saying about the city, Pune tithe kay une? (Everything in abundance in Pune.) Take a look at the statistics. On September 10, 2020, when the state was reporting its almost highest daily tally of 23,446 cases, Pune reported 5,939 cases in a day, approximately 25% of the state tally. Pune’s proportion of Pune of the state’s Covid-19 morbidity figures ranges between 20%-25%, even if you consider the cumulative tally, or the tally of January 31, when Pune reported one of its lowest daily figures of Covid-19. There is nearly a 10-times-rise in the daily reported cases in Pune on March 14, 2021, as compared to its January 31 figures. At any given time, every fourth or fifth Covid-19 case in the state is from Pune district. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO) norms for better containment of Covid-19, the positivity rate should be below 5%. In the last week of January, when the weekly positivity rate of the state was 4.65%, Pune’s positivity was 7.40%; and in the current week of March 2021 when the state’s positivity rate is 14.66%, Pune’s positivity rate is higher than 20%. It categorically explains that Pune district never achieved the desired positivity rate indicative of effective covid-19 containment. We are also doing genomic surveillance as per the Government of India (GOI) guidelines. But, any variant of such concern has not been detected so far. One important observation is case fatality, which is on the decline, indicative of low virulence of the circulating virus at present. Current figures show that Pune district is witnessing a second surge of Covid-19. What are the reasons for this rise, especially after a declining trend since October last year?The first one is related to the weather. In February the state observed a fall in minimum temperature by 5-7 degrees Celsius, due to a cold wave in north India. This fall in temperature is more pronounced in the Pune and Vidarbha regions. Obviously, this is a conducive environment for Covid-19 transmission.In January there were gram panchayat elections in almost 14,000 villages across the state. Voting turnout was more than 80 per cent. This election facilitated state-wide social intermingling. We have observed an increase in cases in blocks like Shirur of Pune district, where these elections were fought vehemently. Family celebrations like marriages were on the rise after unlocking, and started in a phased manner with pre-Covid fervour. The reluctance of the public to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour is an important root cause of the surge. It’s true that many of these factors have been observed all over the state; however, interplay of different variables and local conditions displayed different epidemiological pictures in different areas of the state.Even after discussing these common factors, the question still remains unanswered about Pune’s curious situation. Why is this particular district the most affected in the entire country? Why Pune? A cursory look at the Influenza A H1N1 pandemic will reveal a similar situation. During the 2009 pandemic also, Maharashtra and Pune had topped the influenza morbidity numbers. In the entire last decade, Pune always reported the highest number of Swine flu cases. In their study regarding “Dynamics of Influenza Seasonality at Sub-Regional Levels in India and Implications for Vaccination Timing”, Mandeep Chaddha, et al, emphasised the role of climatic factors and topography in disease transmission. It appears that Pune’s hot semi-arid or steppe climate, with an average temperature of between 20 to 28 degrees Celsius is one of the most important reasons for higher transmission rate of diseases like Swine flu and Covid-19. This difference is more evident when we compare the Mumbai situation with Pune. This factor needs further exploration with inputs from experts in climatology. Approximately 70% of the Pune population is urbanised with nearly 40% residing in slums. The population density of Pune city is 9,400 per square kilometre, which is way ahead of the state average of 603. The decadal growth rate of Pune is 36, which is almost more than double the state’s decadal growth rate of 16. It must be kept in mind that the decadal growth rate of Mumbai is -5.75. As an educational hub and industrial hinterland, Pune is the most preferred migration destination for job seekers from various states. The World Economic Forum’s report of 2017 mentioned that Pune has now emerged as a counter magnet of Mumbai. All these factors have raised huge challenges for urban local bodies in providing essential services adequately to its populace, including public health when there’s a manpower crunch. Surveillance is the soul of outbreak containment. Though Pune managed surveillance activities well in the initial phase of the pandemic with the help of manpower pulled from various other departments, it’s difficult to sustain the tempo once this manpower is withdrawn during the declining phase of the disease. In cities like Pune, it is breath-taking to keep pace with a rapidly growing population in terms of building health infrastructure. Sassoon hospital is the only government tertiary care centre for its four-million population. Even for Covid-19, only 23 per cent of dedicated beds are available in government institutions. Covid-19 pandemic laid open these inadequacies substantially. Though with proactive administration and effective resource management Pune is doing every necessary thing to contain the Covid-19 menace, long-term planning, and action plans to develop urban public health infrastructure are need of the hour. With expanding its hospital and laboratory network and ensuring surveillance activities, Pune managed the August-September surge well. Its surveillance-centric approach will help to curb this second surge too. But, lessons learnt during these phases should not be forgotten. These lessons must be translated into action.The author is state surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Maharashtra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expert-view-covid-19-resurgence-why-pune-again-101615966807793.html

His sons left for Delhi as condolences poured in on social media.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said: “It is a very sad day for all of us. Sharma was very popular among the masses and the party. He was with us 4-5 days back and had assured that he would campaign in the Municipal Corporation election in Mandi.” He added Sharma, 62, was not in good health for quite some time. “It is a great loss for me personally and for the party as well.”Born on June 10, 1958, Sharma worked as a supervisor in the National Hydro Power Corporation before he quit his job in 1984 to join the BJP’s ideological fountainhead, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He later moved to the BJP. Sharma was known to keep a low-profile leader. He first came into prominence when he was chosen to take on Congress’s Pratibha Singh in the 2014 national polls. He won the election by a margin of 40,000 votes. He was re-elected to Lok Sabha in 2019 defeating Congress’s Aashray Sharma by over 40,00,00 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mandi-in-shock-over-mp-ram-swaroop-sharma-s-sudden-death-101615964768557.html

The principal lodged a complaint to the sub-divisional magistrate on February 17 that the complainant was terminated from the services of school on account of her poor performance and lack of documents and was threatening to commit self-immolation if she is not reinstated. The same was forwarded to the SDO(P), Khajuraho, to look into the issue. Thereafter on February 20, the same letter was sent to town inspector Khajuraho police station,” said single bench judge Atul Sreedharan. “The FIR was registered on February 22. It is clear that Ruby Singh falsely implicated the principal Sister Bhagya by levelling the allegations of forced conversion of her and her family,” the judge added before granting her interim bail. Ruby Singh had filed the complaint at the police station against the school principal in the presence of leaders of Vishwa Hindu Parshad stating that she belonged to a lower-middle-class family and was under pressure from Sister Bhagya to convert; she also claimed that the principal used undignified words for Singh’s religion and when she refused to change her faith, her salary payment was stopped followed by sacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-school-principal-framed-under-freedom-of-religion-law-says-court-101615958707982.html

Fake currency notes worth ₹50 lakh have been seized from them, they added.Police said the two allegedly cheated people by tricking them into exchanging genuine currency notes with three fake ones of the same denomination after convincing them that they resembled the genuine currency and can be easily used. The source of the fake notes is being ascertained, they added.Deputy police commissioner RP Meena said the Anti-auto Theft Squad caught Mohammad Shahid and Sayyed Zen Hussain from New Friends Colony on Friday night following information that they would come there on a stolen scooter.

There were just over 17,000 people immunised on average each day during last week’s drive. Meanwhile, 3,223 persons over the age of 45 with comorbidities were immunised on Tuesday, up from 2,834 persons who got jabs on average the previous week.Overall on Tuesday, 38,437 shots of the vaccine were administered. Of these, 27,123 were the first doses, while the rest were the second, thus completing their vaccination against the infection.There was a low turnout on the first day that the drive was opened up for the general public — around 6,100 turned up — due to confusions about the processes and problems faced with the government’s CoWIN portal.There are 2.1 million people over the age of 60 living in Delhi, according to data from the latest electoral rolls. To boost immunisation among them, the district teams have been visiting people door-to-door to motivate them to get immunised, registering those who cannot use the online portal, and allowing walk-ins for unregistered persons after 3 pm.As on Tuesday, nearly 174,700 health care and 266,500 frontline workers in the city have been immunised against the infection. There are around 243,000 health care and 346,000 frontline workers registered in government’s Co-WIN portal in Delhi.“The solution to Covid-19 remains vaccination, along with masking, social distancing and other Covid-19 norms. There is no dearth of vaccines, and although the drive is picking up pace, it is not commensurate with the Indian population,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/38k-get-covid-19-vaccine-jabs-in-capital-experts-call-for-more-inoculations-101615951931053.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||Two dead after 2 shooting incidents in Adarsh Nagar||Two men, one of them a 45-year-old chartered accountant, were shot dead in two separate firing incidents reported between Monday evening and Tuesday morning at two different places under the jurisdiction of north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar police station.While one person was arrested in the first case, the murder of a 32-year-old man in Azadpur village on Monday evening, the police are still working on clues in the CA’s murder, reported on Tuesday morning.There has been a spate of shooting incidents in the city of late. At least four firing incidents were reported between Friday and Sunday from different areas in north-east Delhi. One person was killed, and four others were injured in those shootings. Two back-to-back separate firing incidents took place within an hour at two different places falling under the territorial jurisdiction of the Defence Colony police station last Wednesday. A BSES contractual driver and a policeman were injured in those incidents. The attackers in both the cases were arrested.Recounting the latest incident, police said CA Anil Aggarwal lived with his wife and two children in a rented flat in Majlis Park near Azadpur. The family owns a property on Mahatma Gandhi Road that is less than a kilometre away from their home. A four-storey building is being constructed there and Aggarwal’s murder took place at the under-construction site, the police said.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said on Tuesday, around 10am, Aggarwal and his wife had gone to inspect the construction site. Aggarwal was speaking to a worker on the ground floor, when an unidentified man arrived there on a scooter. “The man was wearing a helmet. He came inside and shot Aggarwal from close range in the presence of his wife and the worker. The bullet hit Aggarwal in the neck and he collapsed. The attacker immediately fled on the scooter,” said the officer, adding that the scooter was later found to be stolen from central Delhi’s Patel Nagar on February 7.Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani said the police control room was informed about the firing and a team was rushed to the crime scene. The injured man was shifted to a nearby private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.“We have registered a case of murder and are probing it from all possible angles. Multiple teams are working on the case. All necessary evidence has been collected from the scene of crime, after proper inspection. CCTV footage has been procured and is being analysed. We have some vital clues and various teams are working on them,” said Rangnani.Police officers associated with the case suspect the possibility of a contract killing as the scooter used in the crime was a stolen one. “Personal enmity and financial dispute are also being looked into,” said another police officer, requesting anonymity.Nearly 16 hours before the CA’s murder, a 32-year-old man, identified as Suresh alias Banwari, was shot dead by a group of four persons outside his home in Azadpur village. The crime took place around 6pm Monday and Banwari sustained at least six gunshot wounds. The prime suspect, identified as Rajnish alias Raja, 21, was arrested on Tuesday, the police said.Police said Banwari, who had a criminal background, was standing outside his home when four persons arrived there and fired on him. Banwari sustained gunshot wounds to the chest and head. He was rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.A case of murder was registered. Raja was caught following searches at his possible hideouts, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-dead-after-2-shooting-incidents-in-adarsh-nagar-101615951744208.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||Was showdown over assembly panels a precursor to standoff?||An exchange of letters between Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel in 2017 may have been the precursor to the Union government’s decision to bring in a new law that may tilt the balance of power in the Capital away from the legislature, the speaker said on Tuesday.The Union home ministry on Monday introduced a bill in Lok Sabha to amend the government of National Capital Territory act (GNCTD act). The bill, among other things, said “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in context of all legislation, and the assembly “shall not make any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration or conduct inquiries”.“The part of the amendment that talks about Delhi assembly committees and rules clearly has its origin from the 2017 message from the L-G,” Goel told HT, referring to the confrontation that took place when the assembly, in May 2017, inserted four clauses in the house business rules that allowed it to set up department-related standing committees, or DRSCs.Four months later, on September 13, 2017, L-G Baijal sent a letter to the speaker asking him to withdraw the rules since it gave more powers to the assembly committees compared to the ones formed under the Lok Sabha rules.Baijal said the Delhi assembly’s new rules did not include a specific clause found in the Lok Sabha rules, which state that the committees “would not consider matters of day-to-day administration of the departments concerned”.The L-G tabulated a comparison of both rules, while particularly objecting to the Delhi committees having the power to take up matters of “public importance concerning the respective departments and carry out scrutiny, inquiry and investigation”.Replying to this, on September 20, 2017, the speaker asked L-G to revisit the matter with the help of “true constitutional experts”. HT has seen copies of both letters.“I remember telling the L-G that his message was based on a fundamentally flawed premise that the Delhi assembly rules have to be identical to those of the Lok Sabha rules. In fact, the rules of no two legislative bodies are identical. Not even those of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha,” said Goel.“Just because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unable to win elections in Delhi, it is now trying to take control over Delhi by hook or by crook. In that case, what is the need to conduct elections in the first place and waste the taxpayers’ money?” Goel added.The L-G’s office did not respond to queries seeking comments.Delhi’s administrative framework is unlike any other region in India. As a Union territory, it is governed by the 1991 GNCTD Act that provides for an elected assembly and an L-G appointed by the Union home ministry. But unlike full states, several important departments, such as land, police and personnel appointments, don’t come under the purview of the city government.The leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly, BJP’s Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said that the AAP has been misusing its huge majority in the House. “They drafted new assembly rules in a fashion which allowed them to form committees empowered to inquire into day-to-day administrative functions. Now, the Delhi government does not have the services department directly under it and, hence, they cannot transfer officers. So, the AAP government is using these committees to build pressure on officials who refuse to break protocols. The L-G should have the last say on the matter of formation of such committees. The central government, through the new Bill, is heading in the right direction,” Bidhuri said.PDT Achary, former secretary-general of Lok Sabha, said Goel’s contention that no law states that the rules of a legislative assembly need to be similar to Lok Sabha is correct. “The independence of every legislative assembly to frame its own rules is guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Each legislature is the master of its proceedings and is free to frame its rule, but the only condition is it should be within the Constitution,” he said.Achary asked if the assembly or its committees are not able to enquire into administrative matters, how will accountability of the executive be ascertained.A senior government official said under the Aam Aadmi Party government, the assembly committees came to the limelight as they started enquiring into matters relating to municipal corporations, the 2020 north-east Delhi riots, and alleged scams in state-run cooperatives.On December 4 last year, the House committee on municipal corporations issued a notice seeking certain information regarding the accounts of the three MCDs.This was challenged by the standing committee chairperson of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation in the high court. The MCDs got a stay order on the House panel’s notice, and the case is ongoing.“Similarly, the assembly committee on peace and harmony, which is probing into the northeast Delhi riots of February 2020 had summoned Facebook India’s CEO, the social media giant then moved the Supreme Court, which gave a ruling in the company’s favour,” said the official, who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/was-showdown-over-assembly-panels-a-precursor-to-standoff-101615951022695.html

17-03-2021||Kolkata||Anti-BJP 'storm' spills out of cup at Kolkata’s iconic Coffee House||The iconic Indian Coffee House at Kolkata’s College Street is in the news since Monday when the tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and activists of an anti-BJP movement spilled beyond the electoral arena and entered the premises of the cafe which started its journey in 1876 and became a melting pot for political and cultural thoughts.Since last month, the Indian Coffee House and College Street have been witnessing a flurry of activities by followers of the new “No Vote for BJP” campaign that has the support of a section of intellectuals and pro-Maoist groups. On Monday, the campaigners were locked in a face-off with BJP workers inside the nation’s oldest outlet of the Indian Coffee House.The Bengal BJP headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane is located close to College Street.Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, spokesperson of the BJP’s Delhi unit, told HT that he was having a cup of coffee when followers of the movement misbehaved with the BJP workers accompanying him.“We were having coffee when they stormed at us. This is unacceptable in a civilised society,” he said on Tuesday night. Bagga also tweeted photos.The activists, on the other hand, alleged in a statement and numerous messages on the social media that the BJP activists had come to the Coffee House wearing T-shirts with party symbols and tore posters put up by the anti-BJP campaigners. The activists have already held a rally in Kolkata and several more in the districts.Also Read: 'TMC colludes with bureaucracy to smuggle girls': Adhir Ranjan ChowdhuryWhen told that activists of the “No Vote for BJP” campaign have said they would stage an agitation outside the state BJP headquarters, Bagga said, “In a democratic country, all people have the freedom to express their opinion. They are welcome.”Bengal BJP leaders remained silent on the incident.Incidentally, the CPI-ML (Liberation), which is contesting some assembly seats in Bengal in the upcoming polls after its success in the Bihar elections, has said that Bengal’s Left parties, headed by the CPI(M), should consider the BJP its first political enemy. This has been opposed by the CPI(M) which says the BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress should both be opposed and treated as enemies of democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/antibjp-storm-spills-out-of-cup-at-kolkata-s-iconic-coffee-house-101615945042726.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Momos in Paharganj||According to logic, the city’s best vegetable momos should be found in Majnu Ka Tila. After all, which other place can be more idyllic to enjoy this Tibetan dumpling than Delhi’s Tibetan refugee camp?Well, don’t rely on logic only.Some of Delhi’s best and most affordable vegetable momos are to be found in the touristy backpackers’ district of Paharganj. At Appetite German Bakery.Yes, Germany is far from Tibet, and yet.The cook here fills his momos with a variety of chopped veggies, and paneer (you might ask the waiter to avoid the latter though, for the momos are superior without it).True, only a Tibetan or somebody extremely familiar with the native cuisine could tell if these momos are authentically Tibetan, but… they are so light on the palate, and so delicious! You feel the flavours intensely and yet the presence of each individual ingredient remains elusive. A single bite is like inhaling an air perfumed with the aroma of fresh carrots and cabbage.The cafe also used to serve another version of momos, crammed with spinach and mushroom, but they weren’t as good—and anyway they’re no longer available. Like most businesses, the coffee shop suffered during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown months. Most of its cooks have left, and the only one still there, politely explains, that it is not possible to make spinach momos.In the pre-pandemic era, the waiter would take a long time (20 minutes at least) to serve this dish, but nobody would complain. The momos were a lunchtime hit among the foreign backpackers of Paharganj, who would be so commonly spotted in its lanes. But this afternoon no foreigner is to be seen in the hotel district. The coffee shop itself is empty, though open. The cake counter has no cake—the yummy almond cake with the white frosting is but a memory. Each table, however, still has a sauce bottle, a cruet set and paper napkins—strongly evocative of the recent past, when you would always see foreigners here, busy with their book, mobile or guitar.For one plate you will get 10 momo pieces, along with tomato and cucumber salad.The accompanying chilli sauce is ear-burning but super-yummy. End the meal with honey ginger lemon tea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-momos-in-paharganj-101615940823522.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||AAP heads to Jantar Mantar against Centre’s move to define L-G’s powers||The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will organise a protest on Wednesday against a Bill introduced by the Union government on Monday in Parliament that seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functions to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor (L-G).“The AAP will organise the protest tomorrow [Wednesday] at 2 pm at Jantar Mantar over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Aam Aadmi Party MPs [members of Parliament], Cabinet ministers in Delhi, and party MLAs [members of legislative assembly] will be present,” said Delhi minister Gopal Rai.“The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has been left baffled by the recent loss in the municipal bye-polls to five wards and the AAP’s popularity across states. By bringing this Bill in Parliament, the BJP has made it clear that it wants to rule Delhi through back door by making the L-G more powerful,” Rai said.Rai called the Bill a conspiracy to make an administrative mess in Delhi again. “The BJP will act as an obstructionist in implementation of the policies in this year’s Delhi budget which focuses on patriotism and aims to further improve governance in Delhi.”AAP said in a press statement that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will be attending Wednesday’s protest at Jantar Mantar.Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said, “It is difficult to understand why AAP government is protesting against the central government’s move. It is only aimed at strengthening checks and balances in Delhi’s governance. Also, Delhi is not the responsibility of Mr Arvind Kejriwal alone. The central government too has its own share of responsibilities. Whenever AAP government has failed in any aspect of governance – from combating air pollution to ensuring water supply across the city – Kejriwal and AAP leaders have often blamed the central government. With the intervention of the L-G, such blame game will reduce. Also, the crux of the 2018 Supreme Court judgment was to bring more clarity in Delhi’s governance and the central government is trying to ensure that with the new Bill. AAP leaders are deliberately misinterpreting it to mislead people.”Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy introduced the Bill in the Lower House on Monday. The Bill says the “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly. It makes it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-heads-to-jantar-mantar-against-centre-s-move-to-define-l-g-s-powers-101615931753294.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||Case cracked, says NIA: ‘Vaze did it for lost glory’||Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was behind the bomb scare outside billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, which he orchestrated as part of a conspiracy to restore his reputation as a successful cop, senior officers in the National Investigation Agency (NIA) told HT on Tuesday, contending that the mystery around the explosive-laden vehicle has been solved.Vaze, a former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was initially the lead investigator after a Scorpio car carrying 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, with no detonator or timer) was found near Ambani’s Antilia on Carmichael Road on February 25. The case was transferred to NIA on March 8, and Vaze was arrested on March 13.Also Watch: Maharashtra ministers on Sachin Vaze’s arrest, NIA probe & Ambani case“Vaze himself was driving the Scorpio car on February 25, while an Innova that belongs to Mumbai police tailed it. After parking the Scorpio on Carmichael Road, Vaze sat in the Innova and left,” said a senior NIA official, who asked not to be named.To be sure, the officials did not give details of how these conclusions were made, and if Vaze had admitted during interrogation to the details and motive behind the crime.The investigators have ruled out a “terror angle” in the incident, particularly after certain crucial pieces of evidence was recovered Mumbai during hours-long raids. These helped NIA piece together the sequence of events and the purported conspiracy, the official said.In Mumbai, the NIA confirmed the recovery of these items. “We have seized a Mercedes and during the investigation, it was made clear that the car was used by Sachin Vaze, but owner is not identified yet. During the search we recovered more than ₹5 lakh cash, a counting machine, clothes and the original registration number plate of the Scorpio that was found parked near Ambani residence carrying gelatin sticks,” said inspector general Anil Shukla. NIA also recovered couple of containers with kerosene and diesel that the agency believes was used to burn the oversized clothes worn by the Scorpio driver, as seen in the CCTV footage recovered from near Carmichael Road, the first official said.Vaze was suspended in 2004 over the death of a suspect in custody. He was brought back into the force in 2020.“He wanted to prove to Mumbai Police brass that he is still as good by solving a bomb conspiracy so he planned this whole episode to plant explosives outside Antilia. He wanted the limelight again,” said the first officer.“He had in fact got what he wanted. In CIU, he was made the investigating officer of the Scorpio case and during the four days he handled the probe, Vaze tried to cover the loose ends he left on February 25, including destruction of some CCTV footage,” a third officer said, asking not to be named.Vaze, 49, was once a renowned “encounter specialist” alongside officers like Daya Naik and Pradeep Sharma. He was suspended after being arrested for the alleged custodial death of Khwaja Younis.“He probably never thought that investigation would reach the NIA and that his plan to regain his lost glory would tank,” said the third officer.Vaze’s role first came under the spotlight after the death of Mansukh Hiren, who came forward as the person who had possession of the Scorpio SUV before it was found from outside Antilla. Hiren told police it was stolen from his residence before he was interrogated multiple times, including by Vaze’s unit.Hiren was found dead on March 5, and the police said it was a suicide. His wife, however, said she suspected the police officer’s role in the death, kicking off a chain of events that eventually led to Vaze being questioned and detained.Vaze’s brother Sudharm moved a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay HC on Monday, saying that the case by Hiren’s widow, in which the Mumbai cop had been arrested, included certain “false, frivolous and concocted allegations”. The petition also said that “surprisingly”, the very next day an FIR was registered by the NIA — and that this suggested political conspiracy.The ruling Shiv Sena and the opposition BJP have been trading allegations of wrongdoing and conspiracy over the case.Since the weekend, NIA officials purportedly came across several pieces of evidence. The team recovered the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) of CCTV camera footage from a Thane housing complex where Vaze lives, which was obtained by Mumbai Police following a letter from Vaze’s unit. The DVR was not mentioned in the list of Muddemal (seized evidence), and the central probe agency suspected that it was collected to destroy evidence which could implicate Vaze, a Maharashtra police official said, asking not to be named.“Vaze was heading the CIU so he issued an official letter that he required DVR of his residential complex and collected the same from his building but did not show the DVR and the CCTV footage as collected evidence in official record of the case,” the official added.(With inputs from Manish K Pathak & Anamika Gharat in Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/case-cracked-says-nia-vaze-did-it-for-lost-glory-101615931020288.html

The two were demonstrating in solidarity with the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws at Delhi’s borders for the past four months.Shiv Kumar, the president of Majdoor Adhikar Sangathan, was picked up by police on January 16, illegally detained for seven days before being produced before the magistrate, according to the plea in the high court filed by his father, Rajbir Singh, seeking a CBI probe.Senior advocate RS Cheema, appearing for Shiv Kumar, argued that the comparison of the initial medical report when Shiv was arrested by police and the subsequent report, conducted by a panel of Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh at the instance of the court, speaks for itself. An inquiry should be ordered and in the meantime the investigation should be stayed, he said. The medical examination found two fractures on his hand and foot and broken nail beds on his toe. The report listed out seven injuries of which two were termed as grievous caused by a blunt object. He was sent to Sonepat jail on February 2. Additional advocate general, Deepak Sabharwal told court the state was not averse to an inquiry. He further added that SIT is probing the FIRs.“No comment is made on comparison of two sets of medical reports, lest it would affect any further proceedings or inquiry, it would be suffice for this court to say that a probe is required,” the bench said. It added that the Constitution guarantees protection to life and personal liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-orders-probe-into-custodial-torture-101615923123181.html

A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by ARG Outlier Media – which runs Republic TV – and Goswami, seeking quashing of the FIR and charge sheet against some of the key employees of the media house, was informed by senior counsel Ashok Mundargi that the police has not named Goswami in their charge sheet because they want to keep the criminal prosecution open-ended. Mundargi submitted that the ploy adopted by the police was to name ARG Outlier Media employees, which included chalak-malak and sambandhit vyakti (operator, owner and other persons concerned), but not Goswami, so that the probe can be open-ended and people connected with the channel can be harassed. Mundargi added that Singh told media that the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) had implicated Republic TV. However, BARC had not initiated any inquiry against Republic TV, and no material was provided by them to the police either to show that the media house was involved in TRP manipulation. When the court sought to know if the police could hold such press conferences to reinforce public trust in the police machinery, Mundargi responded, “There was no public outcry. No one knew about the alleged TRP scam and then the senior police officer comes before the media. The action on part of the police officer is with mala fide. There is no sufficient material to substantiate whatever was being said by him.” He summarised that the act reeked of malice, malafide and an unnatural way of collecting evidence by Mumbai Police. There was an effort to somehow name the petitioner’s channel by hook or crook. The court asked chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare how long the investigations would continue, as two charge sheets had already been filed. Thakare said the probe would be completed as soon as possible. HC will continue hearing ARG’s plea on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/charge-sheet-by-mumbai-police-in-trp-case-solely-targeted-at-arnab-his-counsel-tells-hc-101615924564095.html

On Tuesday, only 19 out of 50 vaccination centres in Thane were operational, which led to confusion among residents.

17-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai recorded 31,106 new Covid-19 cases in one month||Between February 15 and March 15, the city has recorded 31,106 new cases of Covid-19, of which 18,903 were reported in March alone. Mumbai’s Covid growth rate shot up to 0.42% on March 15, from 0.15% reported on February 15. The doubling rate — the number of days it takes for the number of cases to double —was 165 days on March 15 compared to 455 days on February 15. On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 1,922 new cases of Covid-19 and four deaths from the infection. The total number of cases is 3,47,597 and the Covid death toll stands at 11,543. The case fatality rate is 3.3%. There are 13,862 active cases in the city, with a recovery rate of 92%. Experts and doctors have attributed the spike in Covid-19 cases to the public not observing precautionary measures like social distancing and wearing masks as well as patients delaying seeing a doctor in case of symptomatic Covid-19. Dr Om Shrivastav, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The main reasons for increase in cases is not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing or Covid-19 hygiene, such as frequent washing of hands.” Other factors include resumption of local train services and increased testing and contact tracing. As of March 13, an estimated 62% of Mumbai’s active Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body’s data shows 35% of the cases are symptomatic but stable, while 3% are critical. In the past month, BMC has increased testing from 15,000-16,000 tests to 21,000-22,000 tests per day. As of March 15, Mumbai had conducted 35,93,065 tests, of which 19,009 tests were done conducted in the last 24 hours (until Monday evening). The positivity rate in the city has also increased. BMC’s data shows the average positivity rate in March as 7.58%, up from February’s average of 4.54%. In January, the positivity rate was 3.98%. Positivity rate is the total number of positive cases recorded compared to the total number of tests in a fixed time period. Dr Rahul Pandit, another member of the Covid-19 task force, said, “The high number of cases reported daily is a reflection of what is happening on-ground. The increase in the number of daily tests conducted over the past month is one of the factors why we are seeing a high number of cases.” He said the number of tests needs to increase further, and pointed out that Delhi conducts approximately 50,000 tests a day, though most of these are antigen tests and considered less reliable in comparison to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. In Mumbai, 75% of the tests conducted are RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for Covid diagnosis. “If we do more tests, the positivity rate will come down. High testing numbers will help us identify the population which is at risk or has been exposed,” said Dr Pandit. Contract tracing up to 30 high-risk contacts per patient within the first 24 hours would also help reduce the number of cases, said Dr Pandit. Mumbai had seen a spike in reported cases in September and October last year, with 59,724 cases of Covid-19 and an average positivity rate of over 15% reported in September. In October, Mumbai had 53,147 cases and an average positivity rate of 14.7%. The highest single-day caseload was recorded on October 7, 2020, with 2,848 cases. The highest daily caseload this month was on March 14, when the city recorded 1,963 new cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-recorded-31-106-new-covid-19-cases-in-one-month-101615924083447.html

The court also rejected his claim that no sanction of the government prior to his arrest was obtained as his actions were part of his police duty. Special NIA judge Prashant Sitre, while rejecting Vaze’s plea, observed, “It is an admitted fact that the accused was a police person, and hence, is in the knowing about his right. The entry in the station diary clearly reflects that intimation was provided to the accused and the police station concerned, so also, the information about his arrest. It means the grounds of arrest were provided to accused.” “This is the type of case where the prosecution must be given an opportunity to establish its case by evidence and an opportunity given to the defence to establish that he [Vaze] had been acting in the official course of his duty. The question whether the respondent 1 [Vaze] acted in the course of performance of duties and/or whether the defence is pretended or fanciful can only be examined during the course of trial,” the court held. The judge allowed Vaze’s lawyer to remain present during the investigation, but at a distance. Vaze’s lawyers had claimed: “The applicant was not produced within 24 hours after his arrest, nor was he provided an opportunity to take the opinion of his advocate. The ground of the arrest was also not provided to the applicant’s family.” The lawyers also submitted that no sanction prior to the arrest was obtained. As per the notification dated May 23, 2019, consent is required under section 45(1) (protection of members of the armed forces from arrest) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). NIA prosecutor Sunil Gonsalvis contested the plea and argued that Vaze was arrested on March 13 at 11.50pm, while he was produced before the court at 2.45pm the next day, within 24 hours after the arrest. “The accused is a police person and is well aware about his right. Also, the accused never expressed to meet an advocate of his choice, and hence, there is no question of denying the opportunity,” Gonsalvis argued. The NIA prayed for the rejection of the plea, claiming that when Vaze was called for probe, he came from his office and had intentionally not carried out any mobile phone, and hence, was unable to inform his family. “But the IO (investigating officer) informed the police station concerned accordingly. When the accused was arrested, due process of law was followed,” NIA claimed. The agency also claimed that no sanction is required to arrest the accused, because he has not acted in discharge of his official duty. There is no nexus between action and duty of the accused and hence it prayed to reject the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-illegality-in-ex-mumbai-police-cop-sachin-vaze-s-arrest-nia-court-101615923963339.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Omitted syllabus appears in SSC, HSC question bank||The state education department’s recent move of releasing question banks for Class 10 and 12 students has not gone down well with many students and parents who say the question bank has served to increase confusion. On Monday, the education department released the subject-wise question bank for state board aspirants on its official website (maa.ac.in). The department said this was done to help students who will write their secondary school certificate (SSC) and higher secondary school (HSC) certificate exams, which will be held between April and May. However, several students have pointed out discrepancies in the question bank. Many said the question bank contains questions on topics that were omitted after the education department reduced the syllabus by 25% last year. “There are several questions from omitted topics and the entire material consists of questions on each topic and theme. What is the point of the question bank if it is not different from the existing study material?” asked a student. Parents said students felt more unsure about what to expect in their exams. “Now they don’t know whether to study from the questions given or from the textbook. The department should have instead marked a few topics as important so that students would have accordingly studied,” said a Borivali-based parent of a Class 12 student. Officials from the education department did not respond to calls and messages. A senior official said the department will release more papers in the coming days and the questions should only be considered guidelines. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will conduct HSC (Class 12) examinations between April 23 and May 29. SSC (Class 10) examinations will be held between April 29 and May 31. Due to the pandemic and resultant lockdown, the education department has announced a 25% reduction in the syllabus for Classes 1 to 12, for the current academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-omitted-syllabus-appears-in-ssc-hsc-question-bank-101615923664564.html

His wife and daughter, however, used public transport, claimed the residents. “I have known Vaze and his family for the past 20 years. His wife and daughter mix well in the society, but he was very reserved. We have seen him using different cars on most occasions. We have seen a Scorpio car too, but are not sure if it is the same SUV involved in the case. However, those cars were never used by his family, as they used public transport,” a society resident said. The resident said they were shocked to know that the security contractor was abruptly sacked by the chairman and secretary without informing them. “They had never done this before. Also, they had not informed us about providing the NVR and CCTV footage to the CIU team. They must be under some pressure but we are unaware of so many things. However, we have told the chairman and secretary that if they are right, we will stand by them.” The chairman and secretary of the society were not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sachin-vaze-used-different-cars-thane-society-residents-101615923663488.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Consider income loss of families before applying for fee hike, FRA tells institutes||In a recent meeting, the state Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) has requested colleges to consider the economic repercussions of the past year upon students’ families before applying for hikes in annual fees. The authority is currently in the process of approving fee structures for the upcoming academic year of 2021-22. “College managements should appreciate that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, incomes of several households have suffered and their capacity to incur expenditure has been affected. Therefore, the same should be contended with the approved fee structure,” states the minutes of a meeting held on March 12. Established in 2004, FRA is the quasi-judicial body responsible for regulating fees of unaided private professional colleges in the state. Every year, institutes submit proposals to change their fee structures to FRA. Based on several indicators, including the nature of the course, number of students, teaching and non-teaching staff, infrastructure and other facilities at the college, changes in fees are approved. Colleges must display the approved fee structure on their website for students to check at the time of admission. Institutes are usually allowed a 10% fee hike. They also have the option of continuing two years or more with the same fee structure based on FRA’s approval. This year, FRA is hoping for fewer applications. “We have made a request to institutes. Now it is their decision to whether or not apply for the fee hike,” said a senior official from FRA who said the authority will take into consideration the decrease in expenditure for institutes as their campuses were not in use all of last year. “The fact that they incurred less expenditure last year will reflect in their balance sheets that they have to submit along with their proposal. This too will help reduce the fees that will be approved for the upcoming academic year,” added the official. Colleges have pointed out that since online classes were conducted regularly, the staff was paid in full. The director of a private medical college in Pune told HT, “No staff was sacked and neither was their salary deducted because not only was our staff conducting classes, but were also running the hospital for several hours at a stretch, fighting Covid-19. We also need to take into consideration the considerable expenditure institutes will incur in sanitisation of classes and hostel. So the only way to meet expenditure is by charging fees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-consider-income-loss-of-families-before-applying-for-fee-hike-fra-tells-institutes-101615923484465.html

Vaze headed CIU till he was transferred to the citizen facilitation centre of Mumbai Police on March 12. On Monday, he was suspended from the force after his arrest.The police officer added that NIA’s search at CIU office started late on Monday night and went on till the early hours of Tuesday. The NIA team has also seized a laptop, an iPad, a phone and many documents. Confirming the development, an NIA officer said the agency has also seized a Mercedes Benz, which was intermittently used by Vaze. However, they are yet to ascertain its ownership.Inspector general Anil Shukla of NIA said, “We have seized a Mercedes, and during investigation, it was confirmed that the car was used by Vaze. However, the owner of the car has not been identified yet.” While conducting search in the car, we recovered cash worth over ₹5 lakh, a counting machine, some clothes and the registration number plate which was on the Scorpio found parked near the Ambani residence with gelatin sticks,” added Shukla.According to the residents of Saket Complex – Vaze’s housing society – a team of four CIU officers visited their society on February 27 around 8.30pm and took the society’s NVR without informing its committee members. The four officers, according to Thane police, included Vaze’s colleague assistant inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, who had written a letter (a copy of which is with HT) to the society chairman and secretary, demanding the footage for investigation into the explosives case. “For the purpose of investigation, this office needs to check the CCTV installed in the premises of your society and the adjoining area. Therefore, I’m directing to provide us the DVR (digital video recorder) which stores the CCTV footage to facilitate the said investigation,” Kazi’s letter read.Two days after the CIU seized the NVR, the society sacked its security contractor. “The [CIU] team asked for the CCTV footage. So the contractor was called, to hand over the NVR to the officers. Two days later, he was sacked, claiming that his work was not satisfactory. The other committee members were not aware that the NVR was handed over to CIU,” a member said. The society’s chairman and secretary then submitted a letter to Rabodi police in Thane about the NVR and CCTV seizure on the evening of March 4 – the day when businessman Mansukh Hiran went missing. Hiran had claimed that the SUV found outside Antilia belonged to him. His body was found from a Thane creek on March 5. “The chairman and secretary had given us in writing that on February 27, the CIU took their CCTV footage for some probe. They said they were being responsible citizens and informing the police about it,” said an officer from Rabodi police station. The society chairman and secretary were not available for comment. According to crime branch sources, NIA has recorded the statements of Kazi as well as of three other officers – assistant commissioner of police Nitin Alaknure; inspector Milind Kathe; assistant inspector Prakash Howal – and three constables in connection with the case.NIA is, however, yet to recover DVR and CCTV footage of the shop from where fake number plates were allegedly made for the SUV as well as an Innova, which was seen tailing the SUV parked near Antilia. Vaze and his team had allegedly visited the shop, located around 500 metres away from that of Hiran’s, and collected its DVR and CCTV footage, said the Mumbai Police officer. A second Mumbai Police officer, who is privy to the investigation, said the Innova – in which the SUV driver fled after abandoning the SUV outside Ambani’s home – had entered Mumbai again 30 minutes after exiting the Mulund check post. “The Innova again went to the same place where the SUV was parked, as the driver had forgotten something in the SUV. The Innova driver is seen again in the footage found near the spot. But the driver is in a PPE kit, perhaps to hide his identity,” said the second officer, adding that Vaze and other suspects would be made to walk in a PPE kit to ascertain the identity of the Innova driver by trying to match their comparative movements.Meanwhile, three deputy inspector general level officers of NIA have arrived in Mumbai to join the ongoing investigation in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nia-recovers-cctv-footage-of-cop-s-building-seized-by-mumbai-police-ciu-101615923243547.html

The PPSC had advertised 75 posts on December 12, 2020 for which the exam was conducted at various centres across the state on February 13, 2021.Joshi had pleaded that reservation for differently abled persons should have been as per Section 34 of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016 and accordingly 4% seats were required to be reserved out of the total seats advertised. However, the same was not done, it was stated. He had demanded that PPSC be directed to amend its notification as it has violated the rights of the petitioner by not reserving seats for the physically handicapped/disabled per the Rights of persons with disabilities Act, 2016 and further violated rules about exemption in fee for this category.The court was told that the petitioner is a disabled person and a practicing lawyer in Jalandhar. He had submitted a representation with PPSC in December and demanded for rectification of the said mistake. However, the PPSC has not acted.The court, while posting the matter for July, directed the PPSC to consider his case for providing appropriate reservation and also examine his representation of December 29, 2020.“It is further directed that till the representation is decided, further process in pursuance to the advertisement shall remain stayed,” the court directed. The stay order was passed as it came to light that on January 28, response was sought on a similar matter and PPSC and the state were directed to file a status report by March 1. However, no reply was filed. Also response was not filed on March 16 even as HC had granted a last opportunity during the hearing on March 1, said the court while staying the further process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-stays-pcs-exam-process-asks-punjab-for-reply-on-reservation-for-differently-abled-101615923063164.html

However, his 31-year-old father Sagar Meshram is struggling to get an appointment with the US Consulate in Mumbai for the emergency visa, considering the huge number of applications, due to stringent restrictions imposed by the US government in granting visa.Priyanshu needs to be admitted to the Boston Children’s Hospital in the US on March 22 for pre-surgery diagnostics.A wall painter by profession, Meshram did not have the money to treat Priyanshu, who was diagnosed with a heart condition when he was four months old. When doctors in MP could not help to improve Priyanshu’s condition, the family shifted to Mumbai in 2018, to undergo treatment at Kokilaben Hospital. Later, Priyanshu was referred to Boston Children’s Hospital. The treatment would cost an estimately ₹2 crore. “I work as a wall painter and I did not have so much money. It took us almost over three years to arrange for the money through crowdsourcing,” said Meshram, who is currently residing in Pune.Meshram said that he deposited ₹1.68 crore at the hospital in the US and that the surgery is scheduled for April 5. He now fears that if he fails to reach Boston by March 22, he may lose his son after six years of fighting. “The pandemic has become the biggest obstruction in saving my son,” he said. Documents available with HT show that the hospital has acknowledged it and also requested the US embassy in India to issue a visa to the child immediately for his surgery.“Due to the pandemic, the embassy has kept very limited dates for appointment dates for emergency visa. So, even before we log into the website for the process, all the dates get filled up. I have also written to the US Consulate General, Mumbai, to expedite the process for my son, but it hasn’t been fruitful,” said Sagar. In reply to an email sent to Sagar on March 12, the Consulate responded, “...(sic) The consulate cannot guarantee when it will be able to resume limited visa services or consider requests for expedited appointments.”The US consulate in Mumbai did not respond to HT’s email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-father-struggles-to-get-us-emergency-visa-for-6-year-old-s-surgery-101615922827535.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||Times when politics caught the fancy of Mumbai and Maharashtra’s policemen||While police officer Sachin Vaze’s political career did not take off, one of the reasons why he returned to the police job after taking retirement, there were many police personnel who took the political plunge while in service or after retirement. A few of them succeeded, but most did not make it big. Former chief minister the late Sushilkumar Shinde and Bharatiya Janata Party MP Satya Pal Singh are among the very few who succeeded in creating their niche. Shinde, who was also the union home minister, started his career as a constable, was promoted to the post of sub-inspector and later became a successful politician. Similarly, former Mumbai police commissioner Satyapal Singh managed to bag the union ministership in his very first attempt after being elected to the Lok Sabha in 2014. Arup Patnaik, former Mumbai police commissioner, lost the recent 2019 Lok Sabha elections to a political newcomer from the Bhubaneshwar constituency. “I have faced a lot of ups and downs as a policeman and take this defeat as one such setback in my political career,” said Patnaik who contested on a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) ticket. A fellow police officer of Vaze and another “encounter specialist” Pradip Sharma joined the Shiv Sena ahead of the 2019 elections and contested from Nalla Sopara constituency on a Sena ticket. He however lost the election. Retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Shamsher Singh Pathan, who formed his own party Avami Vikas Party (AVP), blamed citizens for his political failure. “I wonder why the people who loved me so much during my career as policeman did not support me politically,” said Pathan who formed his outfit on May 1, 2012, a day after his retirement. “The failure is not mine, but of citizens who did not support a genuine and upright person like me.” The AVP has not been able to win a single seat despite contesting all elections since its formation. Former additional director general (ADG) of police Prem Krishan Jain who was appointed the vice-president of Ramdas Athawale-led Republican Party of India (RPI-A) is no longer associated with politics. “I had joined the RPI to serve the poor, but then I resigned as I was selected as the member of the State Police Complaints Authority,” said Jain. Elaborating on the link between the police and politicians in the backdrop of the Vaze controversy, Patnaik said police tend to curry favours with an eye on post-retirement assignments. “In case of joining politics, the policemen tend to start compromising with favoured political parties. Even politicians tend to exploit the situation to the hilt,” said Patnaik. Political experts called it a dangerous phenomenon, which has an impact on the law and order.“These policemen go out of their way to serve their political masters. They dilute cases against guilty party workers, which encourages them to take the law in their own hands,” said political commentator Hemant Desai. Desai said one of the factors which encourage cops to enter politics is their association with politicos in their career. V V Lakshminarayana, who served as the additional director general of police, planning and coordination, said, “Given their wide experience, the police personnel should join politics and work towards reforming it.” Lakshminarayana had helmed the investigation in the infamous Satyam scam. He had joined the Jana Sena party floated by South Indian film star Pawan Kalyan and had contested the Lok Sabha polls from Vishakapatnam on the plank of zero budget politics, where he spent within the prescribed limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/times-when-politics-caught-the-fancy-of-mumbai-and-maharashtra-s-policemen-101615922826409.html

Two others, Vijay Kumar and Gaurav Khajuria were found guilty and sentenced to two years’ rigourous imprisonment with a fine of ₹11,000. Besides Yadav, another accused, identified as Nand Kishore, has been acquitted. Narpal Singh Dhaliwal, the counsel for Yadav, said the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Prashant Verma acquitted Yadav as there was no evidence against him. Police had registered a case under Sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli¬gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli-gious beliefs), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 124A (sedition), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Malerkotla City-1 police station. The court, however, dropped the sedition charges in the case.Vijay Kumar, the main accused in the 2016 incident which had triggered violence in the Muslim-dominated Malerkotla, was a former Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer. He had claimed that he had desecrated the Quran at the behest of Yadav, who, he claimed, was his friend.The Mehrauli MLA was arrested for his suspected role in the case. However, later, Vijay Kumar took a U-turn and alleged that the police had forced him to name Yadav in the case.Yadav welcomed the verdict, stating that the SAD-BJP government had nominated his name in the FIR as they felt threatened by AAP’s rising popularity ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly elections.Walking out of the Sangrur court with Punjab leader of opposition and Dirba legislator Harpal Cheema, Yadav said, “I got justice.

17-03-2021||Chandigarh||Foodgrain procurement: Existing quality norms to apply but land record a must, FCI tells Punjab||The Food Corporation of India (FCI) on Tuesday conveyed to the Punjab government that it would require farmers’ land records for wheat procurement, expected to begin from April 1, but the crop will be procured as per the existing quality norms fixed by it. At a meeting attended by top officials of the state food department and the FCI, it was clarified that a move for tightening quality checks was at a proposal stage and a nod from the Union food and public distribution ministry was awaited. “We have received directions from the Centre to procure wheat as per the existing norms,” said a deputy general manger-rank official of the FCI. “There is no change in the condition for giving farad (land record) at time of selling the produce, which we plan to introduce from this year in the upcoming procurement,” he added. “Most of the issues related to the procurement were settled in today’s meeting, however, what goes pending is land record issue, as to procure farad by 10 to 12 lakh farmers is a big exercise and a cost is also involved. There are other technicalities such as the land division has not taken place in a large number of cases. Original owners are not alive and land division has not taken place in name of the legal heirs and at least one-fourth agriculture land in state is given on ccontract,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Ashu said he would take up the issue with the CM at a meeting scheduled on March 22. “Procuring farad (land record) from the state’s revenue department involves a lengthy process and it comes at a cost (of ₹20 per page). Who will bear the cost?” asked Ashu, adding that it was not practical to handle pressure of giving farads to a large number of farmers in a short span of time. FCI not willing to procure big stocks The FCI has shown reluctance to procure big stocks of produce in the upcoming rabi procurement season. As per reports, the Punjab government, while dividing share among the FCI and four state procurement agencies (Pungrain, Punsup, Markfed and Punjab state ware housing corporation), asked the former to purchase 20% of the total stocks but it insisted on cutting down quota to 15%. “Actually, they will procure even lesser,” said an officer from state food department. As per an estimate, 132 lakh tonne of wheat is expected to come for procurement in the upcoming season. FCI’s regional head Arshdeep Thind represented the corporation and principal secretary state food department KAP Singh and director Ravi Bhagat alongwith the food minister was also present. New proposal for quality norms As per recommendations of the FCI sent to the Union food and PDS ministry for approval, the reduction in moisture level in wheat crop has been proposed from 14% to 12% has been proposed. It has recommended to permit damaged grain from 4% to 2%. In paddy, reduction in permissible limit of foreign matter from 2% to 1% has been proposed, discoloured grain from 5 to 3% and reduction in add mixture of lower-class paddy to 5 from 6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/foodgrain-procurement-changes-in-quality-norms-at-proposal-stage-but-land-record-a-must-says-fci-101615922524694.html

From the Palghar district mob lynching case to actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case to allegations of crime against women on two cabinet ministers, including a Sena minister who resigned, to the Vaze case, the Sena has faced repeated attacks from its former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sena leaders said the Opposition has been “setting the agenda” for the government. Senior party leaders, including Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who were steadfast in their defence Vaze, have now not spoken on him. The party line on the controversial cop echoes the government’s – “Nobody would be shielded”. Amid series of meetings between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and senior ministers within the MVA for the second day, Raut met NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Delhi on Tuesday evening. Emerging from the meeting, Raut told reporters that “everything is alright” and dismissed speculations that Pawar was unhappy with Thackeray’s backing for Vaze last week. “Nobody is supporting anybody. Maharashtra is a land of law-and-order, no matter who the person is,” he told reporters. Raut also denied that there would be any “big changes” in Maharashtra amid speculations that home minister Anil Deshmukh may be replaced.“I believe it is not appropriate for me to speak on this. Sharad Pawar or the chief minister can speak on this. But as of now, I do not think that there are going to be any big changes in the state.” Sena minister Eknath Shinde too said Vaze was not being shielded. “The matter is being probed by the NIA and ATS and the truth will come out. The Vaze issue has become a part of the investigation and therefore there is no question of shielding anybody... NIA has arrested him and legal process is on so there is no question of backing him,” he said in Delhi. A senior Shiv Sena MP said the BJP aims to get back in power, which is why it leaves no opportunity to attack the Sena. On its part, the Shiv Sena has decided to take on the BJP-led central government for trampling on the rights of the state. “Law-and-order is a state subject, right? Then why did the CBI descend to Mumbai after the actor died. Now, after the state blocked CBI’s entry, they entered Maharashtra through NIA,” he said, requesting anonymity. A senior Sena leader said, “The opposition has been setting the agenda and the government is chasing it. If you see the Palghar lynching episode, what role did Shiv Sena have in it? The opposition has built a public perception through incessant yelling and through their social media cell. But the government has also countered it. Over 100 people have been arrested in that case. What more can the state government do? Don’t such cases happen in other states?” “After Palghar lynching, a sadhu (seer) was killed in Uttar Pradesh. Around the same time, when gelatine sticks were found in a car near Ambani’s home, Mohan Delkar committed suicide naming people close to BJP. It is nature’s counter them. We are not bothered by what they throw on us, we do not intend to respond to each and every allegation they make,” the MP said. With less than year for the prestigious Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation election, Sena’s dented image in this case could become the fodder for the BJP which is aiming to wrest control of the civic body from Sena. “People are intelligent. The opposition thinks they are better Sherlock Holmes, lawyers, or even judges.” The leader added that the party, as it nears the BMC polls in the second half of the year, the Sena will take to various platforms to counter the BJP on all these issues. “As a party, we are aware of what is being done. With respect to the BMC election, let time pass, we will take up all these issues at appropriate stage,” he said. The BJP, meanwhile, alleged that the government backs their “close ones”. “The government’s close ones are being protected. The current issue of Vaze is front of us. He is involved in conspiracy and many things are going to come out. He was constantly supported and the CM made a statement asking if he was Osama bin Laden,” said Keshav Upadhye, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson. “Maharashtra and police force are being defamed by such stories.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-all-set-to-counter-bjp-s-attacks-101615922403965.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||21ha more for Mumbai coastal road: Green panel gives nod||An expert committee of the Union environment ministry has approved an amendment in the coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) clearance granted to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s coastal road project. Once ratified by the Centre, this approval will give legal sanctity to the BMC’s move to reclaim an additional 21 hectares (ha) of land for a stretch of coastal road between Marine Lines and Worli. This was revealed in the minutes of the 257th meeting of the MoEFCC’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) overseeing CRZ clearances, held on March 5. The BMC had, in 2016, stated it will reclaim only 90ha for the project, which got CRZ in May 2017. However, the BMC subsequently tabled a requirement for another 21ha in two affidavits before the Supreme Court, on August 28 and September 7, 2020, taking the total quantum of reclaimed land to 111ha. It is this additional requirement that has now received the sanction of the EAC. “The committee after detailed deliberations and submissions made by the PP (MCGM) recommended for granting the CRZ clearance,” the minutes state. Of the 21ha, 14.49ha will be used for building a sea-wall toward the Worli-end of the coastal road, which “had not been factored in” at the time of seeking CRZ in 2016, as per the minutes of the aforesaid meeting (which have been reviewed by Hindustan Times). The BMC had also tabled a requirement for another 6.51ha for the road in two affidavits before the Supreme Court, on August 28 and September 7, 2020. However, the Supreme Court in October directed the BMC not to undertake reclamation beyond the 90ha, as mandated by the earlier CRZ clearance. Environmentalists pointed out that construction of this partially submerged seawall, which officials say is necessary to protect the road against wave action and erosion, is already underway in variance with the Supreme Court’s directions. “For the EAC to recommend approval now is essentially a post-facto regularisation of work that began without the needed clearances,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust and applicant in the matter before the SC. Goenka also pointed out that the EAC has not, as per the minutes of its March 5 meeting, considered various objections put forward by citizens and interest groups at an MCZMA hearing held last year. An assistant engineer in the BMC’s coastal roads department who is privy to the development, said, “The added land requirement has not been given CRZ clearance yet, but it is now a step closer to reality. The final step is for the MoEFCC to accept the EAC’s recommendation, after which the additional land requirement will have legal sanctity and the reclamation work on the additional 6ha can proceed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/21ha-more-for-mumbai-coastal-road-green-panel-gives-nod-101615922283447.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Power firms paid ₹42 lakh for Congress minister’s trips, alleges BJP||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) media cell chief Vishwas Pathak has alleged that energy minister and Congress leader Nitin Raut used chartered flights for several trips between Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad and Delhi, for which debt-ridden power companies were made to pay more than ₹42 lakh, during the lockdown. Raut has said he would react to the allegations after going through the same.“As per the details obtained under RTI (Right to Information), MSEB Holding Company Limited paid ₹14.45 lakh for two trips and Maharashtra State Power Generation Company paid ₹29.10 lakh for three trips between Mumbai, Delhi, Aurangabad and Hyderabad. Two other companies have paid more than ₹60 lakh for several such trips between June and October, but they have been hiding the information under RTI. This means the minister has spent more than ₹1 crore of the public money on his air travel by making the bleeding companies pay for it,” Pathak said.Pathak said that the payment made by the companies is illegal. “No statutory corporations or the boards affiliated to the state government are allowed to bear such expenses on behalf of the minister who heads these bodies. Secondly, every private flight journey by the minister should have approval from the chief minister. In these cases, no such approval was taken by the minister. Most of these trips appear to be private ones and there was no reason to make the companies to foot the bills,” he alleged.When contacted, Raut said, “I have not heard about the allegations. I will react only after going through them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-power-firms-paid-42-lakh-for-congress-minister-s-trips-alleges-bjp-101615922103184.html
17-03-2021||Mumbai||MVA distances itself from controversial police officer Sachin Vaze||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Tuesday — comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress —distanced itself from controversial police officer Sachin Vaze who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the recovery of explosives from an SUV parked near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said officers who misused their powers must face the music. In contrast to the stance taken by Sena earlier, the NCP wants the government to maintain its distance from the officer. Pawar as well as his nephew and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar made it publicly clear on Tuesday. Vaze was also suspended by the Mumbai Police on Monday following the arrest.Senior Pawar also sought to justify the probe by the NIA into the case and said the state government should cooperate with the central agency. Ajit Pawar said that the state would not shield anyone and the guilty, whoever it is, would be punished. He made the government’s stand public after a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and senior ministers of the ruling coalition.Senior Shiv Sena leader and urban development minister Eknath Shinde, too, said they have not shielded Vaze and do not intend to do it even in future. State Congress president Nana Patole said no one is shielding Vaze, but they are opposing the attempts made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “ to defame the Maharashtra and Mumbai police.”The day saw hectic activities and parleys over the controversy that has dented the image of the MVA government. “The MVA government handled the case very well. This is the reason all (culprits) were exposed. The one (Anil Deshmukh) having the responsibility of the home department has done a good job. Those involved in wrongdoing were located and exposed and proved that stern action can be taken,” Pawar told reporters in Delhi.“Action in the case was started by the Mumbai Police, then NIA requested for transfer of the case and it was done without any hesitation… I don’t believe there is any impact on the government because of a sub-inspector,” he added.Justifying the NIA probe, the veteran leader said, “There is no difference of opinion within the MVA government over action by NIA against those who have misused their position… It is the responsibility of all of us to cooperate with the national agency if it is investigating a case.”Here again Pawar took a different stand from Sena as the party has been opposing NIA’s taking over the Antilia bomb scare case.Thackeray held a meeting of senior ministers from all the three ruling parties on Tuesday morning at ‘Varsha’, the official residence of the chief minister in south Mumbai. Ajit Pawar, home minister Anil Deshmukh, water resources minister and state NCP chief Jayant Patil, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, transport minister Anil Parab and Shinde were present.Deshmukh briefed the issue in the meeting and it was decided that the government’s stand should be made clear that they have never defended Vaze and whoever is guilty will be punished, said an MVA insider.The change in the MVA stand is being seen as an attempt to control the damage done over the past week in the case that has dented the government’s image.State Congress chief Nana Patole and Thorat also met the chief minister to discuss the matter. Later, in the evening, senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut met Pawar and his Delhi residence. The meeting took place for more than half an hour. Raut later clarified that Pawar is not upset over the handling of the case.“I didn’t find him (Sharad Pawar) upset. He only takes information, brainstorm and makes decisions. Everything is alright. Why do you think there is any trouble in the Maharashtra government?, Raut said.The statement assumed significance as the NCP supremo was believably not happy with the way the Vaze case was handled by the MVA government and lack of efforts put in to control the damage. He had expressed his displeasure over an attempt made by the chief minister and home department to shield a controversial police officer even though there were indications that he could be involved in some way. He had met the chief minister on Monday.“Since the beginning the government took a stand that the investigation should be completed and the guilty will have to face the consequences. No one is going to be shielded and there is no reason to take any such step. I want to make it clear as the deputy chief minister,”Ajit Pawar told reporters.“The law and order of Maharashtra has to be the best. Whoever is found guilty will have to face action, irrespective of the party he belongs to. If there is a mistake then action will be initiated… The chief minister and we all are of the same opinion… No interference was made in the ongoing investigation,” he added.“The MVA government took action in the case without any delay and Vaze was removed as soon as his name appeared in the case. The case was also transferred to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) immediately. NIA came in picture because of explosives found in the car… Now both the investigation agencies — NIA and ATS — are probing the case at their own level,” the deputy chief minister clarified further.“MVA’s stand is clear, no one tried to shield Vaze and the truth will come out by the end of the probe,” Shinde told reporters in Delhi. He also stated the central agencies will start losing credibility if they continue to take over different cases in non-BJP ruled states. “NIA should investigate matters that come under their jurisdiction, but if Central agencies such as NIA, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) will continue taking over all the cases in the states then definitely they will lose their credibility,” he said.Patole said they have not taken a stand to shield Vaze. “But the way BJP is portraying Mumbai and Maharashtra police as villains, we are against that. We are not concerned about Vaze, whoever is guilty should face action. The Congress will not tolerate targeting the police,” he said after meeting the chief minister.There is a buzz that the home minister may be shunted out in due process of reshuffle of the cabinet in the near future. The MVA may also transfer Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh, holding him responsible for the controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-distances-itself-from-controversial-police-officer-sachin-vaze-101615921924784.html

17-03-2021||Mumbai||Second Covid wave in Maharashtra, admits govt||Days after the Central team’s visit to six Maharashtra districts and municipal corporations, the state government admitted that it is witnessing a second wave of Covid-19 infections and has begun taking measures to contain the spread of the virus. After witnessing the peak of the first wave on September 17 with 24,619 cases, the daily caseload in Maharashtra had dropped to as low as fewer than 2,000 cases in the first week of February. After reporting 1,927 infections on February 2, cases started rising to 17,864, the highest single-day spike after 167 days (18,317 cases were clocked on September 30), on Tuesday.As of March 15, 65.72% of the daily caseload (85,696 out of 130,547) and 65.64% of the active cases (9,893 of the 15,051) were from eight districts — Pune (14.5% of total and 20.27% of active); Nagpur (16.26% of total and 13.88% of active); Thane (3.41% of total and 9.71% of active); Mumbai (11.38% of total and 10.19% of active); Nashik (6.66% of total and 6.15% of active); Jalgaon (4.65% of total and 3.80% of active); Ahmednagar(3.64% of total and 1.74% of active) and Aurangabad (5.22% of total and 6.05% of active) — which are being closely monitored by state authorities.On Tuesday, the state also reported 87 deaths, taking the tally to 2,347,328 and toll to 52,996, while its active case count surged to 1,38,812. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stands at 2.49% and the recovery rate at 95.66%..A team of three senior officers attached to central institutions from the public health sector visited Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Aurangabad districts/cities between March 7 and 12. The Central team has observed it to be the beginning of the second wave in Maharashtra and has also expressed displeasure over the handling of the spike in the state. In a letter sent by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, the Centre has pointed at limited contact tracing, poor rate of institutional isolation, fewer tests. The Centre has also asked the state to ramp up its health infrastructure, earmark the most infected areas as containment zones and chalk out a strategy for the better clinical management of patients.“Any suggestions for the betterment of the system are welcome and should be taken positively. It is true that cases are on the rise in a second surge in Maharashtra and the infectivity rate has increased, which is a cause of worry. But at the same time, our CFR is around 0.5%, which used to be 2.5% last month. We have enough number of beds, ICU beds available in the hospitals. 90% of the patients are asymptomatic, leading to a speedy recovery,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Tope said that according to the recommendations by the Centre, the state has increased number of tests to around 125,000 per day and Maharashtra’s per million tests rate is one of the highest in country.“As suggested by the Centre, we have been earmarking containment zones with perimeter control. At the same time we have been taking efforts to reduce the crowding at public places by banning social, religious and political programmes. Establishments have been told to operate their offices at half their capacity and encourage work from home. On the other hand, I am meeting Union health minister Harsh Vardhan with the request of releasing 20 lakh (2 miilion) doses per week as we want to speed up inoculation,” Tope said in Delhi on Tuesday.Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said that the state has been witnessing the second wave and the cases are likely to cross the peak witnessed during the first wave. “There are no two opinions that we have been witnessing the spike in the cases. But we have started ramping up our health infrastructure and are taking to the level of capacity we had in September. We have also been facing the paucity of the manpower in the urban areas for the tracking, tracing of the contacts. We had pulled on manpower engaged in various government departments and included teachers, home guards to drivers-conductors in public transport as they were free owing to the lockdown then,” he said.Dr Awate said that the district and city administrations have been told to ramp up their health infrastructure. “Nagpur has been reporting more cases than Pune and Mumbai, which have comparatively better infrastructure. The tracing, testing has been increased in the areas with high number of cases. They have also been told to better the monitoring of the people in home isolation. We have only 30% patients in home isolation, and have enough beds and isolation wards to take up more number of people, if need be,” he said.Civil surgeon Dr Devendra Patulkar, from Nagpur, said that several factors have contributed to the rise in cases. “Most importantly, after December 2020, the public had put their guard off. They didn’t follow precautionary measures like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Soon, the chain of infection started, which is now spreading across the district,” he said. “However, so far, we haven’t received any case of virus mutation in the district,” he added.Dr Sundar Kulkarni, civil surgeon from Aurangabad, also blamed the public for the rise in cases in the district. “The public would go to roadside crowded eateries and remove their masks. Also, we have observed large gatherings of people in marriages and family functions. With the relaxation of the lockdown, hundreds of marriages took place,” he said. “We are also conducting tests in large numbers, which is also contributing to the overall numbers,” he added.Meanwhile, Tope met the Union health minister and requested to release 2 million doses of vaccine per week, enabling Maharashtra to inoculated 1.77 crore people from the priority groups that are being vaccinated. “We will need 2.20 crore doses to inoculate health care, frontline workers, senior citizens above 60 years of age and comorbid people above 45 years. We have planned to complete their inoculation by June-end. In the backdrop of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, we have decided to ramp up the vaccination programme,” he said. Tope said that the union health minister has said more doses will be released for Maharashtra.Tope also has requested the Central government to allow 158 more private and public hospitals to set up vaccination centres. Of the 367 hospitals for which the demand was raised, 209 have been given permission, while the remaining are still awaiting the centre’s approval. He also has requested to relax the norms of compulsion of the 100-bed capacity at the vaccination centre by bringing it down to 50 beds to facilitate opening of more such centres.Interestingly, the daily caseload in Amravati, where a sharp spurt was witnessed at initial stage after cases started rising last month, has reported fewer cases in the past few days. Amravati clocked 351 cases on Tuesday, a sharp fall from 773 two weeks ago on March 2. Amravati was the first district to impose complete lockdown last month amid the spike.(with inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/second-covid-wave-in-maharashtra-admits-govt-101615921803264.html

The state cabinet, at a meeting presided over by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday, approved amendments to the old reservation policy, as proposed by the panchayati raj department in this regard, after the High Court on Monday struck down the old policy. The HC, while quashing the old reservation policy, had said, “1995 cannot be the base year since the government had not deleted the old reservation policy.”The state government is likely to issue the revised reservation policy on Wednesday, after which reservation for all posts of zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons and members, and village pradhans and members, will be done afresh. “The cabinet has cleared the amendments, we proposed, to take 2015 as the base year to reserve posts for various castes for the three-tier elections,” panchayati raj minister Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said.“We expect to issue the GO (government order) on the revised policy by Wednesday evening or Thursday morning,” the minister said. The government’s move comes in the wake of the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court directing it to take 2015 as the base year for the panchayat elections. The court on Monday quashed the UP government’s February 11 order that took 1995 as the base year to reserve posts for panchayat elections. The government had already reserved posts under all the categories taking 1995 as the base year and taking categorization done in all the previous polls since 1995 (1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 1015) into consideration. “Now, we will have to carry a fresh reservation exercise, taking 2015 as the base year as directed by the court,” the minister said. The exercise is bound to change the reservation category of a majority of the posts that were reserved earlier, he said. He said the government would complete the reservation exercise and submit the lists of all the posts to the state election commission by March 27, after which the commission could announce the election schedule. “The fresh reservation exercise will not impact elections that will be held as planned earlier by the commission,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-okays-2015-as-base-year-for-reservation-of-all-posts-101615921203384.html

The incident took place in Raigarh district. The boy was missing for the last five days and his body was recovered on Monday.As per the Superintendent of Police (SP), Raigarh, Santosh Kumar Singh, the body of the minor was recovered from Bharrikhar jungles in Sarangarh block of the district.“The deceased, Laxendra Khunte (17), was in the habit of playing online games and for that, he had taken ₹70,000 from one Chaman Dubey (25) who was his close friend. Five days ago, he and his friend had an altercation when both were consuming liquor. Suddenly, Dubey hit him due to which the victim sustained serious injuries on his head. Dubey thought that if Khunte regained consciousness he will be exposed hence he killed him with a razor and buried him,” said the SP.Khunte had gone missing from his home on February 10, 2021.“When we started investigating the case, Dubey started helping the police to mislead us. He also sent messages of ransom to the victim’s father who works as a labourer. On suspicion, we detained him and then the messages stopped. When grilled, he confessed the crime,” said the SP.Dubey told us that Khunte was addicted to online mobile gaming and had taken money from him and refused to pay it back.“The victim had also taken money from others because of his addiction to the game and was in huge debt,” said the SP.Meanwhile, the police have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and have arrested the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teen-takes-money-from-friend-for-online-gaming-gets-killed-on-failing-to-repay-101615920963026.html

Bengaluru recorded 710 new Covid-19 on Monday, registering almost a 30% increase from the day before. Six more people succumbed to the infection in the state on Monday, taking the toll to 12,403. K Sudhakar, state’s health & family welfare minister on Tuesday said that strict measures will be implemented if government-mandated guidelines on safety are not followed by the public. “The chief minister has given a clear message regarding this. Covid-19 cases are increasing in the state. There is (a) spike in the cases in the neighbouring states as well. The CM has issued strict instructions to follow guidelines, otherwise (the) government has no option but to take tougher steps,” Sudhakar said.He added that the government was printing advertisements to create awareness.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to hold a meeting with chief ministers on the escalating Covid-19 situation in the country on Wednesday.While the technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 in Karnataka told the government that the spike was an indication of a possible second wave of infection, the administration is yet to acknowledge this as official.According to the daily bulletin of the state health department, Bengaluru accounted for 6,832 out of the total 9,428 active cases across Karnataka.Experts and medical practitioners, however, believe that a high number of asymptomatic cases was likely to result in lower than actual positives in the state.“There is definitely an element of underestimation because many are asymptomatic,” said Dr C.N Manjunath, Director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru, and a member of the state’s technical advisory committee on Covid-19.The rise in Covid-19 cases has also been attributed to the large public gatherings like marriages, political rallies and protests with no safety precautions like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing, experts and lawmakers said.A total of 33,251 persons have been fined for not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing across Karnataka, including 11,624 in Bengaluru alone.Dr Manjunath said that contact tracing efforts have taken a backseat in the last few months.The health minister said that at least 20 primary and secondary contacts have to be traced for every infected person. However, according to a performance review by the state Covid-19 war room, till Monday evening, Karnataka has recorded an average of 4.5 contacts per patient in the last seven days with just 0.1 contacts per patient in Bengaluru.Several other districts like Mysuru, Kalaburagi, Dakshina Kannada, Tumakuru and Bidar have also registered a spike in cases.Karnataka has made it mandatory for those coming from Maharashtra and Kerala to produce Covid-19 negative certificates as a measure to contain the migration of new cases. “Spike in the cases is due to (an) increase in the number of cases at bordering districts,” Sudhakar said.The government has also emphasised on the need to accelerate the vaccination drive.The health minister said that primary hospitals were instructed to conduct at least 100 tests per day and 500 tests per day was the target for general hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-records-jump-in-covid-cases-101615919882989.html

This comes 4 days after the CID registered an FIR against him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He has also been booked under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act.A team of CID officials went to the residence of Naidu at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad in the morning and handed a notice to him, under Section 41 (C) of the Criminal Procedure Code. “Failure to attend comply with the terms of this notice, you are liable for arrest under section 41 A (3) and (4) of Cr PC,” the notice said. The CID also issued a notice to another senior TDP leader P Narayana, who was municipal administration minister in Naidu’s cabinet. In the notice, CID deputy superintendent of police A Lakshminarayana Rao has asked Naidu to appear in person before him at 11 am on March 23 at the CID office in Vijayawada. He said it was necessary to examine Naidu to ascertain facts which are within his exclusive knowledge. The CID official asked the former chief minister not to interfere with the process of investigation either directly or indirectly and not to contact or influence or intimidate or induce or threat the witness or any other persons acquainted with the facts of the case. “You should also not tamper with the evidences in any manner whatsoever and appear before the court whenever your presence is required,” the DSP said in the notice. The CID registered the FIR following a complaint lodged by YSR Congress party MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy, who represents Mangalagiri assembly constituency which is part of Amaravati, on February 24. According to the FIR, a copy of which was seen by HT, farmers of Reddy’s Mangalagiri constituency in Amaravati told him that influential people in the previous Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government cheated them by taking away their lands illegally. The farmers have alleged that some middlemen created insecurity stating the government might take away their assigned lands without giving any compensation, it added. The FIR said Reddy verified the orders issued by the then government and found several irregularities in acquiring assigned lands, thereby “causing irreparable loss” to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes (ST) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). The CID authorities led by deputy superintendent of police S Surya Bhaskar Rao conducted a preliminary inquiry before registering the FIR on March 12. TDP leader K Atchannaidu dismissed the allegations as a political witch-hunt. He wondered how the CID could register the case against Naidu on the basis of a complaint by a ruling party lawmaker. “Ramakrishna Reddy is not an SC or ST. How can the CID file a case against Naidu under the SC/ST law?”Atchannaidu said the lands were acquired for the capital under a pooling scheme after taking the farmers’ consent. He added there have been instances in the past when the government has acquired land for public purposes. “The [YS] Jagan [Mohan Reddy] government, too, acquired assigned lands for the house sites distribution scheme and also for solar power companies. Even during the [chief minister] Y S Rajasekhar Reddy regime, the [Andhra Pradesh] Assigned Lands ((Prohibition of Transfers) Act was amended for acquiring lands for public purposes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cid-serves-notice-to-naidu-in-amaravati-land-scam-101615919882265.html
17-03-2021||Chandigarh||No violation of statutory provisions in Kishor appointment by Punjab: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has ruled that there is no violation of constitutional and statutory provisions in the appointment of political strategist Prashant Kishor as principal adviser to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. “The chief minister, being an elected representative, has manifold constitutional duties to discharge, including good governance towards the residents of the state. In fulfilment of the said obligation, the chief minister has complete authority to choose his advisers. Since an adviser to chief minister is not a post but an office which is not regulated by any statutory rules, the argument that an advertisement should be issued is completely misplaced,” said the division bench of justices Jaswant Singh and Sant Parkash. The high court was dealing with a plea from one Labh Singh and Satinder Singh who had demanded that the appointment be quashed. Labh Singh is a boxing coach based at Khanna and Satinder Singh, a lawyer and former councillor of the Chandigarh civic body. They had argued that without issuing any advertisement or conducting any interview after framing criteria, the post was filled up. In the matters of appointment to any office under state, no post can be filled without following Article 16(1) of the Constitution that provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office. He has been appointed with a status of a cabinet minister and will be provided for all pay, perks and facilities from the state exchequer, therefore it was imperative for the state to issue an advertisement, they had argued. State’s advocate general Atul Nanda had argued that the petition suffered from lack of locus and maintainability as in service matters, no PIL is maintainable. The bench, while dismissing the plea, said that it was of the firm opinion that the petitioners had no locus to challenge the appointment. The appointment in question is not a civil appointment but for the purposes of perks and rank only, and thus, Article 16(1) of Constitution is not attracted, it said, adding that in case the appointment, as argued by petitioners, is only to accommodate some person which will put burden on ex-chequer, then it is for the public to take its call during the next elections. The court further said that the petitioners have not been able to point out violation of any constitutional or statutory provision. They have filed a writ of certiorari (judicial review of a decision of a lower court or government agency) while seeking to espouse public interest. In a number of judgments, the courts have held that in service matters no Public Interest Litigation is maintainable. Even if a challenge can be laid to any appointment, then only a writ of Quo Warranto (by what authority) can be maintained and that also if it is against statutory rules, the bench said, referring to various judgments in which it was held that a writ of Quo Warranto would be maintainable if challenge is laid to any appointment which is contrary to statutory rules. It is an admitted fact that no violation of any statutory provision has been pointed out in the appointment of Prashant Kishor, the bench stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-violation-of-statutory-provisions-in-kishor-appointment-by-punjab-hc-101615919703037.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||PWD told to stop revamp on Ring Road stretch||The Delhi forest department has asked the agency to stop work on redesigning a portion of Ring Road between Moti Bagh and Mayapuri, a project that is part of an ambitious state government plan to convert over 500km of the city’s roads on the lines of those in European countries.“...It was found that violations under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, has been done by executive engineer (north/west), PWD, at Road-I, Brar Square, Ring Road and Moti Bagh...it is hereby directed to stop all work till proceedings under DPTA is completed by south forest division,” read a notice issued to PWD on March 12 by deputy conservator forests (south division) Amit Anand.Senior forest department officials said the notice was issued after a complaint regarding digging and trenching on the stretch was forwarded to the south division from the west division, saying that work around the trees was damaging their roots.Ring Road also features in the original list of areas identified as deemed forest land in an affidavit submitted by the Delhi forest department in 1997 before the Supreme Court in the TN Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India case.In Delhi’s context, “an area above 2.5 acres having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches along roads and drains having a length of one kilometre,” are considered ‘deemed forests’, according to the affidavit.For any “non-forest related activity” to take place in such an area, permissions have to be sought from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change under the Forest Conservation Act (1980).A senior PWD official said the work for which the notice was served by the forest department is part of Delhi government’s ‘redesigning and street-scaping of roads’ project. The official said objections have been raised for work taking place between the Moti Bagh and Mayapuri stretch of the revamp.“There is no violation on our part, and we were executing our work following all the guidelines. Forest department officials did not visit the spot to check if there were any violations. They directly served a work stop notice. Following the directions, work on the project at the stretch has been stopped,” the PWD official said, requesting anonymity.He added that the stretch is one of nine that are to be redesigned on a pilot basis. In January this year, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal conducted a review meeting and directed officials to finish the project by 2023.The official said under the project, road geometry is to be improved along with enhancing its aesthetics and introducing user facilities like kiosks, benches, decorative lights and water ATMs on the roadside.The PWD official said the project aims not only at making streets look more appealing, but also envisions to make them more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/forest-dept-tells-pwd-to-stop-revamp-work-on-ring-road-section-between-moti-bagh-and-mayapuri-101615919342282.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||MCDs are failing to hit waste treatment targets at Delhi landfills: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi of failing to achieved its targets in reducing the scale of waste in any of the three landfills in the city.The BJP, however, refuted this claims, and called the allegations “misleading”.“The amount of garbage hasn’t reduced in either of the three landfill sites. BJP leaders’ false claims stand exposed. Of 2,800 metric tonnes of garbage generated every day in east Delhi, 1,300 metric tonnes are treated (processed with trommel machines to break down solid waste components). In south Delhi, of the daily 3,600 metric tonne garbage, a mere 1,600 metric tonnes are treated. Of the 4,000 metric tonne garbage from North Delhi, just 2,000 metric tonne is treated. The remaining untreated garbage is left behind at the landfill sites — the sizes of which are expanding every day,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s municipal affairs in-charge.While the AAP is in charge of the Delhi government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations in the city, which are due to go to polls next year.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, hit back at the AAP’s allegations.“Leaders of the AAP including Durgesh Pathak are misleading people with such allegations. All three MCDs use trommel machines to reduce the heights of garbage dumps at landfill sites quite effectively. Simultaneously, the MCDs are working on bigger scheme for faster disposal of garbage by setting up new treatment plants which should be ready by next year. In public interest, the AAP should quit engaging in petty politics and help MCDs financially set up the new waste treatment plants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-says-mcds-failing-to-hit-waste-treatment-targets-at-delhi-landfills-101615919284358.html

This is very shocking and disappointing at the same time. It is very important to ensure gender parity in the force,” Maliwal said on Tuesday.“We have issued a notice to the police in the matter and sought answers. We are taking this issue very seriously and will try to bring about a change.”In a statement released on Tuesday, the commission said, “Reports also state that while there are already rules in place guaranteeing 33% reservation for women in the force, women participation in the force remains particularly low.”Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said, “We are examining the letter and necessary information will be shared in due course.”A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said that postings are done by the establishment board after following all the procedures and on the basis of eligibility and merits.“There is no criteria of being male and female officer in matters of posting. Presently, two women IPS officers are heading two separate police districts, besides two women DCPs in crime and PCR. There have been many women inspectors who served as SHOs in Delhi’s police stations,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dcw-issues-notice-to-police-seeking-to-know-number-of-women-shos-in-city-101615919222312.html

17-03-2021||Delhi||Metro to monitor vibration levels at 80 spots on Yellow, Violet lines||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will soon start monitoring the vibration levels at 80 locations in the Capital to ensure that they stay within permissible limits in the underground sections of the network, said DMRC officials.The monitoring of vibration levels will be done on two corridors: Yellow Line (Huda City Centre to Samaypur Badli) and Violet Line (Kashmere Gate –Raja Nahar Singh).“This type of vibration monitoring helps in ensuring that track and rolling stock systems are performing within the defined parameters. The samples will be randomly collected from different locations to assess whether the vibration levels are within acceptable limits. If any variation is reported, then accordingly necessary steps are taken to mitigate the same,” said a DMRC official.With the expansion of its network in the Capital, the agency has in the past received complaints from residents that they feel the vibration every time a train passes in the tunnel. In the past, residents of Saket, Hauz Khas, Begumpur, Shahbad Mohammadpur, Sarvpriya Vihar have raised the issue. Vibration is caused due to the interaction between the wheel and the rail track in underground stations.According to Dr Nasim Akhtar, principal scientist at transportation planning and environment division, CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) vibration above 72VdB (vibration decibel) can cause some discomfort to people. Akhtar said vibration on underground tracks is usually between 70-80 VdB, but on a soil base it gets killed. The vibration is amplified where the track has been laid on a rocky surface.Akhtar said, “It is good that they are checking the vibrations at different locations. It is needed, especially in old systems, to identify areas on tracks or wheels, which require repair. The vibration levels are high in underground tracks near the curves. If the tracks are on rocky surface, then it will amplify the vibration level.”DMRC officials said that the Metro has been regularly monitoring vibration levels.“In the past, such monitoring has been carried out at locations such as Saket, Malaviya Nagar, Begumpur, Hauz Khas, Khan Market, Golf Links, Azadpur, Palam, Dashrathpuri, etc. DMRC since its beginning has taken adequate care to ensure that vibration levels in its underground section remain within permissible limits.”DMRC officials said efforts have been taken to reduce vibration in the underground network constructed in Phase-I and II.Anuj Udhrain, secretary of Hauz Khas Central RWA, said, “There are around 60 houses in the area which are affected by the vibration caused due to trains passing underground. The problem has aggravated over the past two years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-to-monitor-vibrations-at-80-locations-101615918983083.html

17-03-2021||Pune||From life of social work, and dreams of civil service... Dhanashri fights for her life||Dhanashri Kumbhar, a 27-year-old civil service aspirant, was hit by a speeding auto-rickshaw on March 2 in Shivane when she was crossing the road on her way to library as part of preparations for competitive exam next week. During the mishap, Dhanashri sustained serious head injuries, leading her to slip into coma. After 14 days, journalism graduate and a social worker is battling for life at Navale hospital with her family struggling to collect the funds for her treatment. Dhanashri who had started to prepare for competitive exams after completing a master’s in journalism and mass communication from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)’s department of journalism (Ranade Institute) also used to teach poor students without charging any fees. Neurosurgeon Dr Nikhil Talathi’s team at Navale hospital is conducting the treatment of Dhanashri. “She has Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI). She has suffered a severe head injury. She has been in a coma stage. After 14 days, her condition has not deteriorated which is a good sign according to me. She has shown slow improvement in these 14 days. It is difficult for me to say when she will she recover completely,” said Dr Nikhil Talathi. The doctors have now pegged expenditure for her treatment at around 15-20 lakh, something the family is not able to raise on their own. Dhanashri, an eldest among three siblings, is a daughter of cab driver. Owing to the family’s economic condition, her friends and classmates have started crowdfunding to raise the funds for her treatment. “It has been 14 days since she has been comatose. Doctors have told us that it is uncertain how much time will be required to recover. The minimum expenditure of 15-20 lakh is estimated for her treatment. We cannot afford this much expenditure. We have been trying to get financial help for her treatment,” said Omkar Kumbhar, Dhanashri’s younger brother. After completing her journalism course in 2016, Dhanashri used to teach in Aadishakti Career Guidance Centre in Pirangut. She was about to appear for the state civil service preliminary exam which was earlier scheduled on March 14 which was later deferred to March 21. However, her dream has hit a roadblock due to injuries, felt her friends. This was her second attempt at this exam. She was also an active in the student rights movement. “Dhanashri is a brave girl and a fighter. We are hopeful that she will fight with this situation as well. We have been trying to collect help for her,” said Sharad Bodage, Dhanashri’s classmate from Ranade Institute. Dhanashri’s family alleged that police have not taken the investigated case properly and even after 14 days have failed to nab the reckless autorickshaw driver. “I have personally tried to gather information about that autorickshaw, but police still haven’t arrested anyone,” Kumbhar said. Police officials however said that the investigation has been going on. “We are conducting the investigation. There were 10-12 auto-rickshaws on that road during the time of the accident. So now we are trying to investigate who has hit her,” said Shivdas Gaikwad police sub-inspector Ramnagar Police Chowki under Warje Malwadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/social-worker-civil-service-aspirant-dhanashri-now-fights-for-life-101615915922829.html
17-03-2021||Chandigarh||CAG findings: HSIIDC fails to provide encumbrance-free site to allottee in Gurugram||The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) failed to provide encumbrance-free site to an allottee in Gurugram within the prescribed time frame, resulting in deferment of payment schedule leading to loss of interest of ₹45.96 crore.The observations were made by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report on public sector undertakings (social, general and economic sectors) ending March 2019.The CAG observed that revision of the schedule of regular letter of allotment (RLA) resulted in deferment of payment schedule of allottee by 113 to 354 days.“Had the company received payments as per original RLA, it could have saved interest of ₹45.96 crore paid on its borrowings as HSIIDC has obtained various loans for its operations,” the audit said.The audit said that the corporation should have initiated the process for vacation of land well in advance so that clear and encumbrance-free site could have been provided to the allottee as per bid document to avoid any losses.The cash-strapped corporation had in February 2018 auctioned a 11.76-acre commercial site in phase 5 of Gurugram’s Udyog Vihar for ₹1,496 crore. The reserve price of the site was fixed at ₹686 crore.“Four parties participated in bidding for the site - Beech Projects Limited, Experion Developers, Parmida Constructions Ltd, and Aadarshini Real Estate Developers. All four were found technically qualified. Aadarshini Developers emerged as the highest bidder with a quote of ₹1,496 crore as compared to the bid of ₹1,446 crore made by Beech Projects,” a HSIIDC spokesperson had said.The CAG in its audit pointed out that as per clause 2.3 of bid documents, the site was clear and free from all encumbrances.“The HSIIDC offered the site as free from all encumbrances, but the building having two tenants and mobile tower on the land, were not vacant. Notices to vacate the premises were issued to the tenants in September 2017, though the corporation had decided to sell this land in November 2016 itself. Since the building on the land was not vacant, HSIIDC initially extended the due date for deposit of first instalment from April 8, 2018 to April 30, 2018.The allottee apprehending non-removal of encumbrances moved high court for extension in payment time and deposited ₹224.40 crore with the HC.The court, in May 2018, ordered the corporation to remove all encumbrances and issue the revised RLA. Accordingly, the corporation issued revised RLA on July 3, 2018 with revised payment schedule.The allottee again requested the corporation to provide encumbrance-free site as it was still not clear and there were still some issues relating to allotting of parking slot, underground water tank, sewerage lines, demarcation points which were not as per zoning plan.HSIIDC, however, in March 2019 served a notice to the allottee for balance payment upon which the allottee again moved the HC.The state government, in its reply, stated that the allottee had been raising different issues at different times and did not approach the corporation for taking possession of the land pre-supposing that the land was not free from encumbrances.The reply was not acceptable as the corporation could not provide the encumbrance-free land to the allottee till March 2019 upon which the HC directed it for revision of schedule of the RLA commencing from March 26, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cag-findings-hsiidc-fails-to-provide-encumbrance-free-site-to-allottee-in-gurugram-101615906981738.html
17-03-2021||Pune||Restoration of 135-year-old British-era iconic Shivaji Market building remained on paper||The Shivaji Market, a Grade I heritage structure, has been a bustling marketplace since its construction in 1885 by British army officer Lt Gen John Ross as per the design by Gen Cecil D’Urban La Touche and WM Ducat. According to historical records, the structure was one of the highlights of Pune city during the pre-Independence era and served as platform to feed servants and the quarters of the then “white population” in the Pune cantonment area. Conservationists and heritage lovers have written about its Victorian Gothic style with high ceilings. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) in 2014 had asked its engineers to conduct a detailed evaluation of the structure and suggest mandatory steps to fix damaged stones and roof replacements due to leakage during the monsoon season. It had recommended repair and re-plastering of walls. The revamp of Shivaji Market was discussed at length during the general body meeting under the title “Repairs and Renovation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Market” without disturbing the existing façade and roof structure in 2018. The PCB administration in its note on the agenda item stated that Chhatrapati Shivaji Market building has heritage value and its identity is acquired over the last 126 years as a prime market for Pune cantonment. The building needs repairs to be preserved. However, according to officials, only minor maintenance works have been carried out since the last four decades. In order to undertake a renovation project, it is necessary that the market may be closed to the public for six months, the administration had stated on record. The board asked the chief executive engineer to present its report. The engineering section told the board that annual repairs were never done for Shivaji market. They said the structure needs immediate repairs and renovation to extend its life for 25-50 years. The engineers recommended repairing of roof by providing same tile i.e. Mangalore tiles, internal wooden structure and painting, walls, floor tiles and drains and replacement of miscellaneous items, if required. PCB resolved to carry out repairs in phased manner. In phase I, the vegetable and fruit section was scheduled to be vacated and stall holders were given permission to continue business on the roadside. The dilapidated old non-vegetarian shops and sheds near the beef market and closed dilapidated storeroom needed immediate repairs and facelift. It was agreed to repair and auction the shops for sale of chicken. However, the old structure has seen no major repairs or renovation over the years. Conservation plan Conservationists Anjali and Kiran Kalamdani had prepared a report (2012) on protection and preservation of the historic structure and submitted it to the PCB. In view of the safety of inmates certain portions of the building should be declared unsafe. The users and tenants of such portions should be asked to vacate and work should be taken up immediately. The increasing levels of roads and poor maintenance of water drainage have led to knee deep ponding. Emergency maintenance and permanent solution for the problem should be worked out after thorough investigation and a practical approach. The health and hygiene condition has reached appalling levels. Pieces of meat are scattered inviting scavengers, bandicoots and rodents. Services of lighting, public address, signage, parking, water supply, pest control, public toilets and drainage need to be reviewed and overhauled. The heritage features of the building such as bargeboards, coping stones, turrets, arches, trusses carvings, stained glass panels are largely in a good condition. In places where they show a need for attention, repairs or replacements may be made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/restoration-of-135-year-old-british-era-iconic-building-remained-on-paper-101615906561077.html
17-03-2021||Delhi||2 stabbed in Paschim Vihar road rage, 2 held||Two men were stabbed to death early on Tuesday in Delhi’s Paschim Vihar by a Class 10 student and a 19-year-old scrap dealer following an argument after their two-wheelers brushed against each other in a secluded lane, police said. The crime was recorded on CCTV, and the footage was shared widely on the social media.The footage shows an incident of road rage escalating into murder -- one of the victims appears to slap one of the attackers, leading to a scuffle that ends in the attackers taking out knives and stabbing them.Police identified the victims as 23-year-old Rohit Aggarwal, a resident of Shiv Ram Park in Nangloi, who worked at his father’s utensils shop in Najafgarh and also as a civil defence volunteer; and Ghanshyam Ratan, 20, a labourer at a dairy in Nihal Vihar. The two were friends.A senior officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said the incident took place when Aggarwal and Ratan were returning on a scooter after attending a wedding. When they reached near Udyog Vihar Metro station, a motorcycle brushed past their scooter.“This led to an argument between Aggarwal and Ratan and the 19-year-old Pradeep Kohli and his juvenile associate aged 17. The two victims left the spot, but Kohli and the Class 10 student caught up with them in a lane and picked a fight. During the fight, Kohli and the juvenile took out a knife and stabbed both Aggarwal and Ratan multiple times. As soon as the duo collapsed, the attackers fled the spot on their bike,” said a second senior police officer who asked not to be named.Locals and passersby reported the matter to the police, and the injured victims were rushed to Sanjay Gandhi hospital, where they were pronounced dead. Their families were informed, and bodies were sent for a post-mortem examination.While Aggarwal has one visible stab wound near the heart, Ratan was stabbed at least 20 times in his chest, throat and abdomen, police said, quoting initial medical reports.Also Read | Road rage: 3 men held for attempt to murder in Mumbai Deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan said with the help of technical surveillance and local intelligence, the two suspects were identified and nabbed within three hours of the incident. “Both of them were caught following a raid.

17-03-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder, Sidhu to meet over tea today||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has invited former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu for tea on Wednesday. The two leaders will meet over tea at 4pm at Amarinder’s farmhouse near Chandigarh amid speculation about the former minister’s rehabilitation, according to sources. Earlier, the CM had invited Sidhu for lunch, but the programme was changed due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Covid meeting at 12.30pm. The meeting will be the second between the chief minister and his former cabinet colleague, who have not been on the best of terms for a long time, in four months. They had met in November 2020 to break the ice. The party circles have been abuzz for the past several weeks with talk of behind-the-scene attempts to ensure the estranged leader’s return to the state cabinet or make him the state unit president. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat, who has been batting for an “important role” for the cricketer-turned-politician, had met Amarinder and Sidhu separately in Chandigarh last week and sounded hopeful of “positive developments soon”. Though the former minister is said to be keen on the Punjab Congress president’s post as the assembly polls are now less than a year away, Amarinder has not been amenable to having him as head of the state unit. Sidhu had quit the state cabinet in July 2019 after the chief minister divested him of the local government portfolio, blaming his “inept handling” of the department and for the poor performance of the party in urban pockets during the Lok Sabha elections. Sidhu kept a low profile thereafter, staying away from most party events till Rawat cajoled him and ensured his presence at former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally against the farm laws five months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-amarinder-invites-navjot-singh-sidhu-for-luncheon-meeting-today-101615861312749.html
