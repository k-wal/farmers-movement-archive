The move will facilitate the commute of thousands of people travelling from Delhi to Ghaziabad using the stretch.Earlier, commuters from Delhi were forced to use various alternate routes such as through Sector 62 in Noida and the Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border. According to officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the UP Gate stretch caters to anything between 80,000 to 100,000 passenger car units per day. “It is a big relief for thousands of commuters as they had to travel an additional 5 to 10km each day and waste 30-45 minutes for taking different alternate routes to reach home in evening. The Hindon canal road is also serving as alternate route, but proper traffic management is needed to ensure smooth vehicular movement,” said Kuldeep Saxena, an Indirapuram resident and a daily commuter to Delhi. In Delhi, the additional deputy commissioner of police (east), Vinit Kumar, said in a statement that the decision to open the Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway was taken in view of the prevailing law and order situation at the Ghazipur border and keeping in mind the public convenience. “The carriageway of the national highway going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi has been opened in due consultation with the police officials of Ghaziabad district in public interest,” the statement said. Officials of the Ghaziabad police said that the other carriageway from Ghaziabad to Delhi still remains blocked as protesting farmers are camping at the site. Gyandendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said that Delhi to Ghaziabad side of the highway was made operational on Monday . “The carriageway from Delhi to Ghaziabad is operational now and vehicles are plying normally. The Ghazipur to Vaishali slip road is still closed. So, commuters are using the Hindon canal road to move to Ghazipur in Delhi but there are some traffic snarls as it is a small road and catering to heavy traffic which is meant for the expressway/highway. We have deployed our traffic personnel to manage the traffic and other diversions are still continuing,” Singh said.The farmers are camping at the UP Gate since November 28 last year and blocked the carriageway on December 3. They have maintained that some “outsiders” resorted to violence during the tractor rally on the Republic Day. The farmers are demanding repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws and also urging the government to bring in a new law on minimum support price.“One side of the highway has been opened up. It was our demand that road barricades should be removed for daily commuters who were facing issues. Our protest is going on at the other carriageway,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a member of UP Gate farmers’ committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/relief-for-commuters-as-delhi-ghaziabad-carriageway-at-up-gate-opened-after-48-days-101615832993279.html

Of 1,711 people who have tested positive in the district in the past 15 days, 1,141 are from Mohali city alone.Even on Monday, as 164 cases surfaced in the district , 97 were from Mohali city, followed by 24 from Kharar, 18 from Dhakoli, 17 from Dera Bassi, five from Kurali and three from Lalru.Within the city, maximum cases have surfaced in Sector 68 and Phase 10. In fact, the district administration on Monday declared six areas as micro-containment zones, including two in Phase 10. The remaining are at Shivalik Vihar in Zirakpur , Dharamgarh village in Lalru , Vikas Nagar in Nayagaon and National Dental College in Dera Bassi.Though the daily tally dropped from Sunday’s 206 to 164 on Monday, it was sixth consecutive day that witnessed 100+ cases in the district. Meanwhile, one patient died, taking this month’s toll to 18 and the total to 403. The total number of cases has climbed to 22,026, of which 1,338 are active, up from 636 at the beginning of the month. With 184 people being discharged, the number of those cured has reached 20,285. The recovery rate stands at 92%, down from 95% on March 1. Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, said: “We were expecting such numbers in the second surge, which has taken place as people are not taking precautions, especially in urban pockets. In rural areas, people are still maintaining social distancing and wearing masks due to fear.”In view of the surge, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has advised all private and government hospitals to avoid elective surgeries as far as possible and dedicate all the necessary resources towards treating Covid patients. He has also asked all L2 and L3 hospitals to provide an inventory of their beds (including ICU) and ventilators to the district nodal officer and update the occupancy and vacancy numbers daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-city-accounts-for-67-cases-in-district-this-month-101615832992761.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh at tipping point of second Covid wave||The Chandigarh health authorities have said that the city is on the tipping point of a second Covid-19 wave as infections continued to rise for the fourth consecutive week and the number of fresh cases reached 148 on Monday, highest in almost five months.In the week that ended on March 14, the city reported 778 cases, 42% jump from the preceding week. However, the number of tests saw a marginal dip, one of the reasons for the high weekly positivity rate, which went up from 4.5% to 6.4%.“The infection numbers being reported in this surge are around a fourth of what were reported in the first wave that occurred in September. To suggest this is the second wave, we have to wait for some more time to see where the trajectory goes. The daily infection numbers should at least be half of what we saw in September,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, UT health department.In September last year, single-day Covid-19 cases peaked at 449 while the active case load reached 3,171. In comparison, Chandigarh has been reporting 120-150 cases in a day, while the number of active cases stand at 1,166. In November, too, active cases had gone up to 1,190 after the festival season, but there was a steady downfall thereafter.Hereon, the adherence to Covid-19 protocol and enforcement of restrictions will determine the course of this surge, said Dr Kang.“The impact of not following Covid appropriate behaviour is witnessed after four to six weeks. So, the rise in cases that started in February was due to not adhering to the protocols in December and January,” said Dr GD Puri, chairman of Covid-19 management committee at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. “We had warned of a new surge back in early February, as we had more than 100 patients with severe condition from across the region admitted in Covid-19 wards. The numbers are expected to rise further.” Meanwhile, the total number of cases has reached 23,244. While 21,720 patients have recovered, 358 have died so far. Amid the surge, the health department is set to start testing in educational institutes, starting with Post Graduate Government College in Sector 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-at-tipping-point-of-second-covid-wave-101615832751865.html
15-03-2021||Kolkata||Shah promises development, forest rights in Bengal tribal belt; CM hits back||Sparks flew fast and thick in poll-bound West Bengal on Monday when Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Mamata Banerjee targeted each other from back-to-back rallies in the tribal belts. While Shah’s chopper suffered a technical snag, Banerjee’s ankle injury didn't deter her enthusiasm. The day also witnessed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers add to the rising political temperature as they protested against the choice of candidates in several districts.At a rally in Ranibandh in Bankura district on Monday, Shah said the BJP will fully implement the Forest Rights Act in the tribal belts of West Bengal, buy all forest products at maximum support price, provide local employment to all and spend a few thousand crores of rupees for the development of tribal people if it wins the coming election.On a two-day tour of the tribal belt in the western part of Bengal, where the BJP performed very well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Shah arrived at Kharagpur in West Midnapore district on Sunday night. His adversary, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, was on a tour of the same region. The statements they made at back-to-back rallies added to political heat in the poll-bound state.Significantly, while Shah was flying from one district to the next in a chopper, BJP workers staged an agitation at several places in Bengal, including the central election office in Kolkata, opposing the fielding of some Trinamool Congress (TMC) turncoats whose names were announced on Sunday for the third and fourth phases of polling.Also read: Adhikari seeks rejection of Mamata Banerjee's nomination, cites pending CBI case“Some supporters are unhappy. This is not a major issue. We will sort it out through discussions,” said BJP state vice-president and Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh even as police were deployed to maintain law and order at the BJP’s new election office in the Hastings area of Kolkata.Shah, who left for Assam in the afternoon, returned to Kolkata on Monday night after convening an emergency meeting of the party's core committee. BJP national president JP Nadda was also summoned to Kolkata. The two met senior BJP leaders at a hotel in New Town on the eastern outskirts of Kolkata.Shah was supposed to address his first rally on Monday at Jhargram district. However, his helicopter could not land because of a technical snag. Shah was flown to Ranibandh, his second destination. A few hours later, Shah virtually addressed the people of Jhargram through a live video.The BJP leader did not let go of this opportunity to target the TMC chief who was addressing rallies in the adjoining Purulia district where tribal voters are equally important for both parties. In 2019, the BJP won a Lok Sabha seat in Purulia, one in Jhargram and two in Bankura district.“My helicopter developed a snag but I will not say it is a conspiracy. There can be a snag in a helicopter. That is why I got late,” Shah said in his virtual address to Jhargram residents.While physically addressing the Ranibandh rally, he said, “We saw Mamata Didi (elder sister) got hurt in the leg. A probe is on to find out how it happened. The TMC says it was a conspiracy to assault her. The Election Commission says it was an accident. God knows what is true. Didi you say you are hurt and sad. Do you feel the pain of the mothers of those 130 BJP workers who were killed in political violence?” said Shah.Banerjee, who sustained an injury in her ankle at Nandigram in East Midnapore on March 10, hit back at Shah from her rally. She said no conspiracy or injury can stop her from taking forward her battle against the BJP.Without naming Shah or the BJP, she quipped, “I heard that a rally in Jhargram had to be cancelled. Had they told me, I could have sent some people.”Her nephew Abhishek Bannerjee, who addressed a rally in West Midnapore district, also took potshots at the BJP, saying very few people are attending the saffron camp’s rallies. “You will find more people at road construction sites or tea stalls in the morning,” he said.Shah promised a plethora of projects for the tribal belt, saying these would figure in the BJP’s election manifesto. His promises included a fund of ₹250 crore for the development of places that tribal people consider holy, schools for children in all community blocks, ₹3,000 crore for an irrigation dam on Gandheswari river in Bankura and a university in Jhargram in the memory of tribal scholar Pundit Raghunath Murmu.Shah also announced ₹10 core each for the various tribal communities and implementation of the recommendations of the seventh pay commission for state government employees and a commission to revise the salaries of teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/shah-promises-development-forest-rights-in-bengal-tribal-belt-cm-hits-back-101615831764205.html
15-03-2021||Jaipur||BJP corners Gehlot govt on phone tapping; demands resignation, CBI probe||The BJP cornered chief minister Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government on Monday for allegedly tapping phones and misusing the government machinery to curb the rebel inside the party. The party even demanded Gehlot's resignation on moral grounds.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, posted a series of tweets with the hashtag RajasthanCrisis, after news reports emerged stating that phones were tapped during the time of political crisis in Rajasthan.Months after the political crisis in Rajasthan, the Gehlot government admitted that the phones were intercepted to maintain public order and in the interest of public safety.Amid the political crisis, senior BJP MLA Kali Charan Saraf, in August 2020, had put up a question, "Is this true that phone tapping cases have come up in the last days? If yes, under which law and whose orders? Place complete details on the table of the House".Saraf had raised the question during the special assembly session called by the government to prove its majority through floor test after 18 MLAs led by then Deputy CM Sachin Pilot rebelled against the leadership.An alleged leaked telephonic conversation between a Union minister and Congress leaders in Rajasthan had triggered the political crisis in the state, which also gave rise to the charges of illegal phone tapping.Also read: Rajasthan govt to terminate police service officer for demanding sexual favoursIn the reply to the question raised by Saraf, the home department replied, “In the interest of the public safety and public order, and to prevent the occurrence of a crime which might risk public safety or public order, the telephones are intercepted under the provision of section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and section 419(A) of the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007, and section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 – after an approval by a competent officer.”The department further stated that the telephone interception had been done by the Rajasthan Police under the above provision and after obtaining permission from the competent officer. “Interception cases are reviewed by the chief secretary as per rules and all cases till November 2020 have been reviewed,” the reply stated.“I had asked these questions in the last assembly session. The questions were raised in reference to the political crisis. I haven’t received the written reply to the questions asked,” said Saraf.In a series of tweets, Shekhawat said, “This is what the BJP said in July last year - 'Emergency is going on in Rajasthan'. The Gehlot government denied it at the time and is now accepting that the phones were tapped. This is a violation of privacy, the murder of democracy!”“Gehlot had remained a saint on the phone tape case then, he will have to answer today. I am questioning him because he made the internal fight within his party administrative!”“I feel sorry for the helplessness of the Congress! The legislators, including the young leaders of his own party, were caught in the trap of phone tapping! But such a culmination of insult has been the tradition of the Congress! How should Rajasthan trust a government that does not trust its MLAs only,” he tweeted.State BJP chief Satish Poonia tweeted saying Gehlot crossed all limits to save his chair. "They conspired against the people of their own party and even tapped phones of leaders of the opposition party in an unethical manner and even spied," he said.Poonia demanded a CBI inquiry in the phone tapping matter. "It has become such a serious matter that lies were spoken in the House and facts were tampered with. The chief minister, who holds the home portfolio, is guilty of this,” he told reporters. He said that that the chief minister should resign from the post and the matter should be investigated by the CBI.Leaders of the Gehlot camp had alleged that BJP leaders were involved in horse-trading of Rajasthan Congress MLAs to topple the government. The state government had rejected allegations last year that phone tapping was done.Gehlot had categorically stated in the last assembly session that no illegal phone tapping of any elected representative was done in the state.Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi said in the reply by the government, the process of conducting phone tapping has been told. After permission from the competent authority, phone tapping is being done. The Rajasthan government has not tapped any phone of MLA or Minister. “If Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is so confident that phones were tapped, why doesn’t he give his voice samples, which will prove whether the phone was tapped or not,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/bjp-corners-gehlot-govt-on-phone-tapping-demands-resignation-cbi-probe-101615830397131.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Kiran Choudhry seeks privilege proceedings on distortions in budget speech||Former Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Kiran Choudhry on Monday sought initiation of privilege proceedings against those responsible for distortions and inconsistencies in the 2021-22 budget speech delivered by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in the assembly last week.Speaking on the budget estimates in the House, Choudhry said it was rather unfortunate that the budget speech had so many errors and inconsistencies.“Who is responsible for this? There are so many conflicting aspects in the English and Hindi versions of the speech. Also, there is more than one English version of the speech. We would like to know which is the correct version. The matter should be referred to the committee of privileges of the assembly. Presentation of budget estimates is a serious business but the speech is misleading,” Choudhry said.She added that the budget estimates were nothing but an illusion of statistics. “Numbers have been manipulated and cloaked,” she said.Quoting a number of inconsistencies including paragraph numbers, the Tosham MLA said that even the statistics have not been presented in a transparent manner.“The allocation for health and wellness included an amount of ₹394 crore for the sports department. It has been appended to the health sector allocation to jack up figures,” she said.The former minister said that increasing debt liability and revenue deficit is a cause of concern. “Borrowings for the next fiscal have been pegged at 38.41% of the consolidated fund and 30.8% of the borrowings will be used for repayment of debt and interest,” she added.The Congress MLA said that while the financial mismanagement of the government was written large, a fact substantiated by declining revenue receipts, the government unabashedly is self-patting.Choudhry questioned as to why the rural electrification (RE) subsidy in 2021-22 has come down to ₹5,600 crore from ₹6,040 crore in 2020-21.0Also, Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) MLA Ram Kumar Gautam, an ally of the ruling BJP, slammed the enactment of 75% private sector job quota law during his address.“It is one nation and it should stay united. Do not turn the nation into a small municipality. Such laws will break unity of the country,” Gautam said.The JJP MLA urged the state government to end the deadlock with protesting farmers as the farmers’ agitation will spell doom for politicians.“Even people like me, who are against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre, are not allowed to enter villages,” he said.Gautam praised former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda for undertaking development in the state during the Congress rule, particularly in Rohtak.“I call a spade a spade. I always value good deeds whether they are by present CM Manohar Lal Khattar or his predecessors,” Gautam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kiran-choudhry-seeks-privilege-proceedings-on-distortions-in-budget-speech-101615830350969.html
15-03-2021||Lucknow||Expose Opposition canard on farm laws: Yogi to party||: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath strongly backed the Centre’s new farm laws, saying that the farmers were being misled. He urged the party cadres to expose the “canard” being spread by a “frustrated Opposition” on the issue. He tasked booth level cadres at all the party booths to tweet and retweet achievements and initiatives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure maximum mileage and awareness to the various pro-poor schemes. He unveiled plans to distribute tablets to students of economically weaker sections and also referred to the Abhuday free coaching scheme in which, he said, 10 lakh students had joined so far. The image of the state had undergone a sea change over the last four years, he said and flagged the state’s jump to second spot in ease of doing business rankings, no riots and zero tolerance on crime and corruption as the key achievements. Addressing the concluding session of the UP BJP state working committee, Adityanath also referred to the issue of stray cattle in the state and how his government dealt with it. “Can any BJP cadre tolerate this that excess stray cattle be sent to the butchers?” he asked as the party workers responded with a resounding “no”. At this, Yogi said that his government had set up cow shelters across the state to address the issue. “As many as 5.5 lakh stray cattle are in various cow shelters. An additional 75,000 cattle have been given to people who are being given ₹900 for their upkeep. Now, we are also setting up cow shelters in villages,” he said. Referring to how 2.42 lakh farmers had benefitted from the Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme announced by PM Modi, Adityanath asked the cadres to “expose the Opposition claims.” “The Opposition is instigating farmers on contract farming when the fact is that in many parts of the state, like in Jhansi, contract farming has been going on for long, without any problem and to farmers’ advantage,” he said and referred to “record purchase” of food grains under the minimum support price (MSP). “Just see how since 2017 the state’s revenue has increased manifold. For instance, when we assumed office in 2017, there was value added tax (VAT) that fetched the state ₹49,000 crore. The same year GST (Goods and Services Tax) was introduced and the state’s revenue jumped to nearly ₹1 lakh crore. Similarly, the excise revenue that was just about ₹11,000 crore is now around ₹36,000 crore. The same is true for stamp and registration duty, mining and others,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/expose-opposition-canard-on-farm-laws-yogi-to-party-101615829990404.html
15-03-2021||Lucknow||FOUR YEARS Yogi govt’s achievements galore, but faces challenges ahead of 2022||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath completes four years in office this week and he has a long list of achievements, to claim, but his government faces several challenges on various fronts ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. A 64-page booklet titled “Chunotiyon main talaashe avsar” (Challenges turned into opportunities) has been brought out listing the achievements of his government in various fields in the “four years of service and good governance.” Besides referring to the presentation of its first paperless budget (2021-2022) with largest ever size of ₹5.5 lakh crore for all round development of Uttar Pradesh, the booklet lists efforts to make the state a trillion dollar economy and bring about improvement in law and order situation, among major achievements. “Uttar Pradesh is ahead of other states in the country in implementation of 44 development schemes… this record of development has been achieved when the world is fighting Covid-19. By making arrangements for controlling Covid-19, the state turned this challenge into an opportunity,” it says. Even the World Health Organisation has appreciated the state’s Covid management. It claims that the state’s GSDP has gone up in the last four years from ₹10.9 lakh crore to ₹21.73 lakh crore, taking the state from the list of ‘Bimaru” states to second largest economy in the country. It says the per capita income has doubled. It quotes a report of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) to make a point about the rate of unemployment coming down from 17.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent in the state. It says the state government had adopted zero tolerance towards criminals and Mafiosi, and their illegally accumulated assets worth about ₹1,000 crore have been demolished or confiscated. It said work on metro rail project has already started, while Meerut is soon going to get a gift of metro rail. Light metro will soon be launched in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj and Jhansi. The chief minister will want that the major development projects are completed in next few months. He reviewed progress of expressway projects and launched drinking some water projects for Bundelkhand region in recent weeks. The state government will, however, have to further expedite action and closely monitor the progress of projects close to his heart before the state goes into poll mode in the next few months. According to professor SK Dwivedi, former head of department, political science, Lucknow University, “The Yogi government has performed well in the past four years. There is no doubt that UP’s performance has been better than other states in various sectors. The state government is working for all sections of society. In recent months, the Ram temple construction has begun and led to a positive mood among the people.” Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, economics department, Lucknow University, said: “The government is making the state an attractive destination for both foreign and domestic investors. This should push up the growth of economy in the state. In terms of GSDP, UP may have attained the status of the second largest economy in India but its rank in terms of per capita income is second from the bottom. The state government should not be sitting on its laurels but continue to make investment in areas like education, health and social welfare so as to improve its rank in human development. With a population of about 24 crore and having a youth bulge, UP has both big challenges as also opportunities to harness its vast ‘demographic dividend’ to usher in an era of sustained, accelerated development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/four-years-yogi-govt-s-achievements-galore-but-faces-challenges-ahead-of-2022-101615829870418.html
15-03-2021||Lucknow||Filling work of Ram temple foundation starts||The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust on Monday started filling work of Ram temple’s foundation after performing vedic rituals at Ram Janmabhoomi. Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust and its other members performed the rituals, after which engineered material was spread over the foundation. The remaining work related to spreading of engineered material, a mixture of several buildings’ material, in the foundation will be done from April 9 when the trust is expected to receive supply of the requisite material. Till then, rollers will be used to level the 13,000 sq metre dug-up area of the temple’s foundation. “Around 40 feet deep foundation of Ram temple will be filled by August this year,” Rai told media persons at Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya, on Monday. “The National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad, had informed us about the presence of 12 feet debris at the foundation site after carrying out technical survey of the ground,” said Rai. The NGRI experts had suggested removing this debris to make the temple’s foundation strong, Rai added. The temple’s foundation, which will be 107 feet above sea level, will be made by layers of stones. For filling the foundation, gitti (pebble) of Banda, coarse sand, fly ash and asbestos will be used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/filling-work-of-ram-temple-foundation-starts-101615829690387.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Cong walks out of Khattar’s trap indirectly seeking support to condemn boycott of BJP-JJP leaders||The growing worry of the ruling BJP-JJP coalition government leaders about their inability to move freely across Haryana and hold public functions due to the ongoing boycott call by the agitating farmers echoed in the Vidhan Sabha on Monday.Ever since the farmers’ protests began against Centre’s three contentious farm laws, now put on hold by the Supreme Court, different villages and unions have not been letting the BJP-JJP leaders to hold functions.This boycott by a section of the public has left leaders of the ruling party red-faced.The continuous boycott and protests being held outside residences of BJP legislators has been dominating the discourse within BJP and the party has been reaching out to Congress to defuse the situation.In this backdrop, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar moved an impromptu resolution in what was a ‘well-crafted move’ to seek Congress’ support to officially condemn those giving a call to boycott to “leaders of any political party”.Before the CM floated the idea of resolution, BJP’s Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel informed the House that some people with vested interests held a “highly abusive” demonstration outside his residence.He accused the Congress of backing such protesters drawing sharp reaction from the Opposition.Parliamentary affairs minister Kanwar Pal also persuaded the Congress to intervene and defuse this “critical situation prevailing in state” where BJP-JJP leaders cannot hold functions.“Will the Opposition keep mum and do nothing,” he asked, even as Speaker Gian Chand Gupta reminded the principal Opposition party about its responsibility towards democracy.“The resolution is in favour of the democracy. Both the ruling party and the Opposition have equal responsibility when the issue is about saving the democratic setup,” Gupta said, pleading that the resolution doesn’t mention name of any political outfit.The Congress was, however, unmoved and refused to entertain the desperate pleas of the ruling party.Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader and former two-time chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda dismissed Khattar’s move terming it “unnecessary” and questioned the need of bringing in such a resolution in the House.The single line resolution reads: “This House passes a resolution condemning if any section of the society or any organisation announces to boycott leaders of any political party.”Amid din, the resolution was adopted with voice vote, while the Congress staged a noisy walk out from the House against the resolution.Earlier, the CM had targeted the Congress for instigating people behind the call to boycott BJP-JJP leaders - a charge that Hooda stoutly refuted.While moving the resolution the CM said that voting will be carried out in this regard if required. He said that the responsibility of the ruling party is as much as that of the Opposition to protect democracy.“Stop instigating protesters. Congress will have to come forward and stop what the protesters have been doing,” Khattar said.“Neither has any Congress MLA instigated any organisation or class to boycott political leaders, nor will they do this,” Hooda said, asking the CM to withdraw the resolution as it was “unnecessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-walks-out-of-khattar-s-trap-indirectly-seeking-support-to-condemn-boycott-of-bjp-jjp-leaders-101615829635665.html
15-03-2021||Lucknow||Fund collection for Ram temple now ₹3,000 cr||The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust has received ₹3,000 crore in the fund collection drive for construction of Ram temple, till now. The figure is expected to increase as audit work of the money deposited in banks is still going on. “In the ongoing audit of the fund collection drive, till date, the trust has received ₹3,000 crore. The figure is expected to go up as audit is still going on,” Champat Rai, general secretary of the trust, told media persons in Ayodhya on Monday. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had launched, from January 15, a 44-day, nationwide campaign spread over two phases, to connect with people and raise funds for the construction of the temple. In the first phase from January 15 to 31, the VHP, which has been at the vanguard of a campaign for construction of the Ram temple, contacted eminent people who were identified by its local cadre. The second phase of the campaign, which involved reaching out to the common people, started from February 1 and ended on February 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/fund-collection-for-ram-temple-now-rs-3-000-cr-101615829570398.html

15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Petition challenging Haryana’s 75% job quota withdrawn from HC||A petition challenging the Haryana law that provides 75% reservation to locals in private sector jobs was withdrawn from the Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday.The plea was filed by a Rohtak-based firm AK Automatics last week. Detailed order from the HC is awaited; however, counsel for the firm, Vishal Sharma said that the plea was withdrawn with a liberty to file it afresh.It was withdrawn after the judges observed that government is yet to enforce the Act, so the petitioner industry is not adversely affected by the law at this stage, Sharma said.The Rohtak-based firm had challenged the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020 on grounds that by introducing the policy of “son of soils,” the government wants to create reservation in the private sector.The law which provides for 75% reservation of seats in all private sector jobs with gross salary under ₹50,000 per month for those born in the state or living here for five years was notified by the government earlier this month.It was argued that the law is an attempt to introduce a domicile methodology for securing job in the private sector rather than on the basis of a prospective employee’s education skills and IQ, which will create chaos in the current industrial employment structure.“The law is an infringement on the constitutional rights of the employers because private-sector jobs are purely based on skills and an analytical bend of mind of employees, who are citizens of India having constitutional rights on the basis of their education to opt for jobs in any part of India,” the plea said.It was further argued that the law is unconstitutional and cannot stand the legal scrutiny as it violates the principles to meet the requirement under Articles 14, 15, 16 (2) and 16 (3), 19 (1)(g), 21 of the Constitution.The law notified by the state government is an act of unfair competition between deserving employees and local residents claiming to have a right as an employee on the basis of local residence, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petition-challenging-haryana-s-75-job-quota-withdrawn-from-hc-101615829270915.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Coronavirus continues to infect in Haryana but positivity rate under check||Haryana registered an increase of 881 coronavirus infections last week (March 8-14) in comparison to the week before.The continuous increase in the number of cases has been on for the last five weeks even as the sample positivity rate has declined.Health department officials said that 2,617 infections were reported last week (March 8-14) as compared to 1,736 the week before (March 1-7).However, the sample positivity rate stayed put at 4.7%, officials said. The recovery rate was 97.8% and the mortality rate was 1.1%.Mega vaccine driveThe state government, however, seems to be going full steam as far as vaccination is concerned.On Monday, vaccinators in state inoculated above 1.58 lakh individuals under a mega vaccination drive across state. The vaccination coverage numbers thus crossed 6.72 lakh.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that structural planning and proactive initiatives ensuring wide mobilisation of the people resulted in such an overwhelming response to this special vaccination drive.“We have decided to hold a mega vaccination day every Monday,” Arora said.The ACS said that most of the beneficiaries who were administered vaccine on Monday were above 60 and persons between 45 to 60 years with co-morbidities. The department ensured that the vaccination centres are in close proximity to people’s residences even in rural areas and they do not have to travel for which the number of vaccination centres has also been enhanced, he said.Sampling continues to be lakh plusArora said the health department tested about one lakh persons last week. The health department had tested about 1.27 lakh persons the week before (March 1-7) and about 1.15 lakh persons between Feb 22-28.A large majority, about 99%, of the sampling is being done using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits, the gold standard test for detecting Covid-19, he said.Data showed that only three districts - Faridabad (8.5%), Gurugram and Rewari (6.8% each) have a critical positivity rate of more than 6%.There are 16 districts in state which have a positivity rate in the range of 2.5-5.5%, thereby meaning it is lower than the critical positivity rate of more than 6% but higher than the desirable positivity rate of less than 2 %.Three districts - Nuh (0%), Charkhi Dadri (1.2%) and Jhajjar (1.8%) continue to have a desirable positivity rate of less than 2% for last several weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coronavirus-continues-to-infect-in-haryana-but-positivity-rate-under-check-101615829094771.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||CAG report: Audit slams HSIIDC for imprudent loan for MRTS||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has slammed the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) for imprudent resource mobilisation for financing the Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS).In its report on public sector undertakings (social, general and economic sectors) for year-ending March 2019, the CAG said that HSIIDC availed Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) loan carrying higher rate of interest despite availability of cheaper cash credit or term loans for financing of MRTS, which resulted in an avoidable expenditure of ₹11.24 crore.“It is recommended that being a commercial organisation, the HSIIDC should act with prudence to safeguard its financial interests,” the CAG said.The report stated that HSIIDC, in June 2006, entered into a joint venture agreement with the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Project Implementation Trust Fund for development of MRTS between Gurugram to Manesar and Bawal.The detailed project report put the approximate cost of the project at ₹17,328 crore to be funded through loans raised from multilateral agencies, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, World Bank – IBRD and domestic market.The state government was to contribute ₹1,313 crore in cash and land valuing ₹1,368 crore as equity towards the project.“The company, in April 2016, approached HUDCO for term loan of ₹1,313 crore for land acquisition and allied uses. However, before sanctioning the loan, the company had acquired 452-acre land for MRTS in Gurugram, Manesar and Rewari (for Bawal) at a cost of ₹1,220 crore and transferred this amount from other available sources to land acquisition collectors for making payments to landowners,” the audit said.“In the meantime, HUDCO sanctioned a loan of ₹876 crore bearing interest at the rate of 10.15% per annum subject to HSIIDC providing government guarantee and budgetary provision in the state government budget for repayment of dues and released first instalment of loan of ₹250 crore upon receipt of the state government guarantee,” the audit added.“Thereafter, HUDCO repeatedly insisted the HSIIDC to provide budgetary provision in the state budget and stated that non-compliance thereof shall be treated as an event of default. The HSIIDC, however, decided to repay the HUDCO loan as budgetary provision could not be arranged and even the interest charged by HUDCO was considered higher as compared to other loans. It repaid the loan in February 2018 along with pre-payment charges of ₹5.04 crore,” the audit said.The CAG observed that before drawl of HUDCO loan, the HSIIDC had already made payment of ₹657 crore to the LACs concerned and an amount of ₹562 crore was payable in March 2017.The HSIIDC had sufficient amount of unavailed loan or cash credit limit in the range of ₹916 crore and ₹3,337 crore between February 2017 and February 2018 (excluding HUDCO loan) at cheaper rates of interest ranging between 8.1% and 9.65% per annum for making balance payment of ₹562 crore.The government, while granting guarantee to the loan in December 2016, had desired that as the rate of interest of HUDCO loan was higher, the HSIIDC should raise minimum amount of loan as per actual requirement. Thus, the company could have avoided drawl of HUDCO loan, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cag-report-audit-slams-hsiidc-for-imprudent-loan-for-mrts-101615828910799.html

The day’s event was also telecast live through local TV channels and DIPR Manipur Facebook/YouTube.

The Chief Minister chaired a meeting with senior officials and members of the Covid-19 technical advisory committee, comprising health experts to assess the situation. "We have been informed that the Covid-19 scenario is on an increasing trend over the last fortnight. The positivity rate has increased, but by God's grace, the mortality rate is low," Yediyurappa said. He said the positivity rate has increased in districts like Bidar, Kalaburagi, Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Udupi Tumakuru and Dakshina Kannada. "Experts see this as an indication of Covid-19 second wave.. The technical advisory committee have advised strict enforcement of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19," he added. The state has been logging over 900 new cases over the last three days. Cumulatively 9,61,204 Covid-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 12,397 deaths and 9,39,928 discharges. The total number of active cases stood at 8,860. Yediyurappa requested citizens to wear masks and maintain social distancing at public places to balance economic activities and to avoid any further lockdown. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would chair a meeting on March 17 with Chief Ministers of various states on the Covid situation, where Karnataka would seek advice and take necessary strict measures, if required. "I appeal to the people of the state, especially Bengaluru... if you don't want lockdown once again,take strict measures by yourselves," he said,regretting that people don't wear masks, awareness has gone and the situation has gone back to what it was earlier.

"It was also decided to make the RT-PCR test report compulsory for those entering the state at Maharashtra and Kerala borders. I have held discussions with all the district Deputy Commissioners and strict instructions have been given to follow the measures from tomorrow itself," he said. Noting that officials have advised to increase vaccination in districts with more positivity rate, he said a good number of health workers have been vaccinated, but only 58 per cent of the frontline workers have taken the shots so far. "Experts have advised to conduct vaccinations in big apartments and also inoculate senior citizens by identifying them, based on the electoral rolls," he added. Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing is compulsory and violators would be fined, Yediyurappa said. "We will see for a week..if people don't cooperate and don't wear masks, we will start imposing fine of ₹250... don't push us to take this step." The CM said officials have been directed to ensure that not more than 500 people attend social, religious and other events, including weddings. To be prepared for any eventuality, it was decided to make arrangements at Covid hospitals for oxygenated beds, availability at Intensive Care Units and setting up of Covid care centres. The meeting also decided to hold discussions with private hospitals for providing treatment to Covid patients like in the past, Yediyurappa said.

So we have now asked for a review from all the deans of SPPU and accordingly, to complete the second semester in time, we are planning to cut down the syllabus,” said N S Umrani, pro-vice chancellor of SPPU.A review of all the graduate and post-graduate courses was done by the SPPU on Monday, and now the process of cutting down the syllabus for this academic year has been started.As first semester examinations have been delayed, the SPPU administration took this decision to ensure the syllabus of future courses was not affected. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic the academic year 2020-21 began late.From July-August online classes were held for all the years. It is necessary to have a 90 day period of classes per semester. This was difficult to maintain online, due to various issues like connectivity and students not having access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sppu-cuts-syllabus-for-final-year-courses-101615825910181.html
15-03-2021||City||Day after tonsuring head, Kerala Mahila Congress leader announces candidature||A day after tonsuring her head at the party headquarters in the state capital over denial of a seat, Kerala Mahila Congress president Lathika Subhash on Monday announced her decision to contest as an independent candidate from Ettumanoor constituency in Kottayam district.Her action invited enough embarrassment to the party and attracted national attention as well. Though the party is yet to take action against her, senior Congress leaders said she had closed all avenues for discussion and the party will take disciplinary action if she contests against the UDF candidate.But Subhash said she had quit all party posts and challenged the party to expel her.“I have cut all my ties with the party. Let leaders take any action, I am least bothered. I will go by the decision of my followers,” she said after addressing a convention of her supporters in Ettumanoor. She said she will file her papers on Tuesday.Meanwhile, party leaders are divided over her action. While some supported her, others said her action crossed all limits and she portrayed the party in a bad light. “We have sympathy for her. But she should have taken it to the party forum instead of this open defiance. Her action was in bad taste and it damaged the party’s image,” said PCC vice-president Lali Vincent. Another woman leader KC Rosakutty supported her.Also read: Kerala Congress list has 55% new faces, party calls it ‘generational shift’Communist Party of India (CPI) national leader Annie Raja said all three formations in the state, including the Left, failed to give proper representation to women. “I feel all three fronts, including the Left, failed women. In Subash’s case, some leaders even questioned her right to protest but they all conveniently forget what prompted her to take such an action,” she said in Delhi. Out of 85 seats declared, nine women figured in the Congress list while its rival CPI(M) has given tickets to 12 women this time.Similar dissent is brewing in other parts of the state and efforts are on to quell it. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has rushed to Kalpetta in Wayanad to talk to local leaders who opposed the candidature of T Siddique. Congress candidate in Wayanad had to make way for party leader Rahul Gandhi in the last Lok Sabha elections. In Kannur also, the candidate list kicked up a big row. Party strongman K Sudhakaran MP criticised it openly saying seats were distributed on faction lines and winnability criteria took a back seat. Disgruntled leaders have called a convention in Kannur on Tuesday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also suffered a setback after a tribal candidate it announced in Wayanad with much fanfare backed out from the race saying his name was announced without his consent. C Manikandan, a research scholar from the Paniya community later took to social media quoting BR Ambedkar. “Even if I am hanged upside down, I will not betray my people,” he wrote in his Facebook post. He said he was not interested in electoral politics and will devote his time to the betterment of marginalised people.In Kuttiyadi in north Kerala, the CPI(M) has decided to field party leader Kunahamad Kutty after party workers took to the streets protesting over the party’s decision to hand over the seat to the Kerala Congress (Mani). For a change, dissension rocked all parties this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-after-tonsuring-head-kerala-mahila-congress-leader-announces-candidature-101615823707936.html

Quoting a couplet by Sant Kabir, the President remarked, “Sant Kabir said: Kabir mana nirmal bhaya jaise Ganga neer (The mind has become pure like Ganga water). It means, Ganga jal (Ganga water) was considered the biggest benchmark of cleanliness. Today, it becomes the responsibility of all of us to take Ganga once again to the same level of cleanliness, which we find in the words of Sant Kabir, Sant Ravidas and the sages of ancient times.” “Keeping the river Ganga clean, preserving the environment and enriching our culture and heritage is not only the work of governments, but also the social and personal responsibility of all countrymen,” the President said and added that this thought needed to be adopted and assimilated nationwide.“For cleaning the Ganga and environmental conservation, the government launched Namami Gange, the Integrated Ganga Conservation mission, in 2015. I am satisfied that this mission has begun showing good results. But we haven’t achieved the goal of complete Ganga cleaning yet. In addition, large capacity sewage treatment plants are being set up from Rishikesh to Gangasagar to make the Ganga clean,” he observed. The President also said, “I believe that the Ganga and our culture have been based on each other. The cleanliness of the Mother Ganga is an important criterion for the cleanliness of our environment. The preservation and promotion of the Ganga, the environment and culture are the basis of the development of our country.” It was not enough to see the Ganga just as a river as it was the lifeline of Indian culture and the conduit for spirituality and faith, he said.The civilization of the Ganga River Basin can be called an aquatic civilization, he said, adding that “Ganga jal is really the water of life.”“Therefore, water conservation in the Ganga river basin and reducing flood and erosion are both necessary. With both these objectives, the goal of the cleanliness of the Ganga and the protection of the environment are also connected,” he added. “In fact, the Ganga is the identity of the people of India and this public sentiment is reflected in a popular song,” the President said. The area of the Ganga and its tributaries is spread over 11 states and has been named the Ganga River Basin. According to an estimate, the region is inhabited by 43% of the country’s population. It is also the most densely populated area, he said.Amazing examples of attachment to the Ganga were found in the memoirs of Bharat Ratna Shehnai maestro (the late) Bismillah Khan saheb, President Kovind said.“During his visit to Mumbai, many music lovers requested him to settle there. Khan saheb used to say, ‘Mujhe to le jaaoge, main yahan bas bhi jaunga, lekin yahan Mumbai meain, Ganga maiya kahan se laaoge (Even if I settle down in Mumbai, how will you bring the Ganga there)’. Such was his bond with the Ganga.” Strike balance between antiquity, modernity Expressing happiness over transformation of Kashi, the President said the changing form had also preserved the city’s antiquity.“However, antiquity does not mean inertia. The inertia of any country and society causes its decay and decline. That is why I urge the people of Banaras to strike a balance between antiquity and modernity,” he said. “Banaras has a wonderful confluence of spirituality, literature and music. Gautam Buddha gave his first message in Sarnath, located in the same area, about 2600 years ago. Adi Shankaracharya had received the knowledge in Kashi itself that there is only one Brahma in all beings,” he remarked. PM Modi’s efforts praisedPrime Minister Narendra Modi, the MP from Varanasi, had taken the initiative to increase the cleanliness of the Ganga and the splendour of Kashi, the President said.He added that the people of Kashi would remember that the Prime Minister launched the campaign to clean the ghats of Varanasi by cleaning the Assi Ghat. He used a spade to remove silt deposited at the ghat.The President said he was informed that the ghats of Varanasi were now clean and tidy.“The emphasis on cleanliness of the Ganga river, the ghats and the city of Banaras has not only given a boost to environmental protection but has made the journey to it more enjoyable for the tourists,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cleaning-ganga-the-responsibility-of-all-citizens-says-president-101615823810861.html

However, PMC has decided to allow only one vaccine to be administered at a hospital, to avoid any confusion. The district administration got one lakh additional doses of both, Covishield and Covaxin, which will be distributed to PMC, PCMC and Pune rural. Dr Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer in charge of the vaccination drive at private hospitals, said, “We are creating session sites for Covaxin at the 41 private hospitals. We have also asked the private hospitals to ensure that they have 100 or more doses of Covishield, to continue vaccinating on Tuesday. Those hospitals that do not have enough Covishield doses should buy Covaxin doses and not continue with Covishield. “We are in fact getting requests from multiple hospitals to allow the option to use both the vaccines, however, this could lead to confusion during vaccination,” she added.Although both the vaccines have proven their efficacy against the Covid-19 virus, the government is promoting Covaxin, an indigenously developed vaccine, by NIV and Bharat Biotech. Covishield has been developed by Oxford University and is being mass produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). On March 11, the Drug Comptroller and General of India (DCGI), declared in a press conference that Covaxin, which was earlier approved in its “clinical trial mode”, would now be for “regular” emergency use. This decision came after Bharat Biotech published the phase three clinical trials which showed its efficacy and significant immunogenicity against the rapidly emerging variants. Following the announcement the government increased its procurement of Covaxin. On Monday, the district administration received one lakh doses – 50K of Covishield and 50K of Covaxin. Of the 50K doses of Covishield, 20K will be with PMC, 10K with PCMC and 20K with rural Pune. Of the 50K Covaxin doses, PMC will get 25K, PCMC 10K, and Pune rural 15K. Rural Pune will allow both the vaccines to be administered at hospitals in distant locations. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad said, “In rural areas we would prioritise Covishield for the second dose, and Covaxin as the first dose from here onwards. Each hospital will get both the doses are per their requirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/each-pune-hospital-to-administer-specific-vaccine-dose-covishield-or-covaxin-not-both-101615823810135.html

The initiative is timed with the completion of four years of chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s government in office. A broad consensus in this regard was reached at the UP BJP working committee meet here on Monday, where the party appeared keen to placate the farmers who are agitated over the Centre’s three new farm laws. While the farmers’ protests are being supported by the Opposition parties, the BJP’s farmer outreach initiatives come just ahead of the panchayat polls in UP. The BJP has decided to field candidates for 826 block pramukh posts and for 3051 district panchayat members’ posts, party leaders said. It has also decided to back candidates for the post of gram pradhan and block development council (BDC) posts in these panchayat polls.“Between March 19 and 25, the party would run a series of campaigns, primarily focused on rural UP. These include a farmer-specific contact campaign, possibly on March 21, where we will hold dialogue with farmers and tell them that the party has always cared for them and that it is always willing to hear them out on their concerns on farm laws and address all the issues,” a BJP leader said. On March 22, the party would hold a dialogue with youths, a party leader said, adding that the BJP would be talking about the various initiatives of the four-year-old Yogi Adityanath government touching all sections of the people though the campaigns would be largely aimed at the rural areas. “We also plan to hold campaigns simultaneously in all 403 assembly constituencies of the state. Nearly 300 assembly segments are fully or partially rural and hence the dialogue is aimed at rebutting the Opposition build-up against us,” a BJP leader said. While inaugurating the state working committee meet, defence minister Rajnath Singh had given a hint of the party plan when he had appealed to the farmers to call off their stir and invited them for a dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjpto-woo-farmers-rural-segments-ahead-of-panchayat-polls-in-up-101615823630143.html

The civic body has now decided to ensure that no hospital provides both the vaccines at the same site. The civic body’s current stock of the vaccine – Covaxin and Covishield - is enough for only a week, if the current daily rate of vaccination remains the same. Ironically, the Serum Institute of India, which has manufactured and supplied the Covishield vaccine to multiple countries across the world, is located in Pune. After a meeting with divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, the civic body decided that Kamala Nehru hospital and the Rajiv Gandhi hospital, both run by the PMC, would provide only a second dose of Covishield. This will mainly include health care workers who started getting the vaccine from January 16, and frontline workers who began getting inoculated on February 8. Phase two of the vaccination drive began on March 1, and second doses will only begin from March 28, onwards. Until now, PMC has vaccinated a total of 1.46 lakh beneficiaries, of which, 11,911 have completed their vaccination course after the second dose. The PMC still needs 1,34,872 doses of Covishield, as both vaccine doses have to be the same as per government guidelines. A senior PMC official said, “We currently have about 60,000 doses in the pipeline, of which 33,000 are with government hospitals and the rest with private hospitals. We are expecting more doses, but they would probably be Covaxin and so now, we are awaiting Covishield stock which will be given as second doses.” The PMC returned 15,000 of a 20,000 stock of Covishield doses received on Monday evening from the PCMC, as the PCMC is also seeing a huge response to the vaccination drive from its citizens. On Monday, many beneficiaries did not get the vaccine as their scheduled slots were cancelled, or hospitals put up notices stating that vaccinations have been temporarily suspended. One such citizen, PS Gadkari, 82, who lives in Wadgaonsheri, registered three of his family members, which was later cancelled. He said, “I had registered myself and two of my relatives, Nanda (61) and Bapu Kamble (64) for vaccination on Saturday at PMC’s Meenatai Thackeray health centre. However, on Monday afternoon I got a message that the registration has been cancelled and that we will have to re-register.” Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer, PMC, said, “We asked for one lakh doses which would be enough for 10 days, given that we have 60,000 doses currently and about 15,000 people are vaccinated daily. However, we only got 50,000 doses of Covaxin. We will now keep two of our hospitals exclusively for a second dose of Covishield and rest only for Covaxin to avoid confusion. If we allow both the vaccines to be administered this could lead to a lot of confusion and also possibly a mix- up of the vaccines, since the doses are administered by auxillary nurses and midwives.” He further added that the civic body will now pull back all its Covishield stock from hospitals and divert it to two designated hospitals, while the remaining civic hospitals and clinics would be supplied with Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shortage-of-vaccine-doses-forces-pmc-to-cancel-registrations-101615822850201.html

Pawar met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray earlier in the day."There is no question of home minister Anil Deshmukh being replaced. There is no cabinet reshuffle happening," Patil said.Action would be taken against those found guilty in the case of the recovery of SUV as well as the mysterious death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, he said.While the NIA is probing the SUV case, the state ATS is probing the death of Hiran, who had claimed that the vehicle had been stolen from his possession.The Sachin Waze case was not discussed in the meeting with Pawar, said Patil, the state Water Resources Minister.Ruling allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress were of the view that whosoever is guilty in the two cases should not be spared, he said."The government doesn't intend to save anyone," Patil added.Elsewhere, state Congress president Nana Patole also told reporters that a cabinet reshuffle was not on cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-bomb-scare-no-question-of-maha-home-minister-being-replaced-says-ncp-101615821941518.html

The accused’s name was also Mamata Banerjee.“Under the circumstances, we humbly pray that the nomination of the candidate Mamata Banerjee be forthwith rejected,” Adhikari wrote in the letter sent to the returning officer of Nandigram assembly constituency on Monday.He alleged that while at least five cases are pending against Banerjee at various police stations in Assam including Geeta Nagar, Pan Bazar, Jagiroad, North Lakhimpur and Udharbond, a CBI case is also pending against her.“I have informed the ECI. Now they would search for the cases and find out. Let’s see what actions they take,” Adhikari had told media earlier in the day.He referred to three news articles in his letter which say that in 2018 Assam Police registered five cases against Banerjee for making provocative remarks regarding the Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC).Also read: ‘Pishi and Bhaipo are going’ - Smriti Irani’s jibe at Mamata Banerjee in WB rally“It is shameful. The BJP is trying to malign the chief minister and casting aspersions against her by linking her to a case in which another person has been named. He knows very well that he would lose, and his security deposit would be forfeited. So he is resorting to such malicious propaganda,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.A few days ago Banerjee was injured while she was campaigning in Nandigram. That the TMC is not letting these two opportunities go and was planning to go all out against the BJP on both issues was evident from the party spokesperson’s statements.“While the people of Bengal would respond to this, the TMC as a party would also think whether any further steps could be taken,” said GhoshWhile the crucial West Bengal assembly elections would take off from March 27 and would be held in eight phases, Nandigram goes to poll in the second phase on April 1.A CBI official in Kolkata, however, said that the woman who has been named in the charge sheet in a disproportionate asset case is not the chief minister but the wife of a central government employee with a similar name.“The central government employee was employed in Asansol Durgapur zone at that time. Even though his wife Mamata Banerjee was not named in the FIR her name was included in the charge sheet later. This is not the chief minister,” said an official.“The returning officer hasn't forwarded it to me yet. It hasn’t reached my office. I would be in a position to comment on it only after the RO forwards me the letter with his views after examining the merits of the complaint,” said Smita Pandey, the district magistrate who doubles up as the district election officer.Meanwhile, the state BJP unit has also moved the ECI with the same letter.With Banerjee contesting the polls against her protégé-turned-adversary Adhikari, West Bengal is likely to witness one of the most high-pitched poll battles in recent times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/adhikari-seeks-rejection-of-mamata-banerjee-s-nomination-cites-pending-cbi-case-101615821443414.html

The court has also imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on him. The CBI had arrested the doctor for demanding and accepting a bribe of ₹4,000, in July 2014. Dr Jassi had taken the bribe from Dolly Rani, mother of a prisoner named Sandeep and had been convicted on March 10, with the sentence announced on Monday. The doctor’s counsel pleaded in court that Dr Jassi had been facing mental agony for the past seven years on account of this case, and, hence, a lenient view may kindly be takenPublic prosecutor KP Singh, however, said that taking a lenient view in such matters sent a wrong message to undesirable elements in the society, therefore, stringent and deterrent punishment may be imposed upon the convict.Observing that the “court should not show leniency”, Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge, CBI, stated: “While imposing sentence in corruption cases, society’s cry for justice should also be kept in mind. When such a medical officer does not act with integrity, the whole society will suffer. Corruption deserves no sympathy and leniency.”It added: “It is proved that the convict Dr Rajiv Jassi has demanded and accepted a bribe amount of ₹4,000.

The number of people allowed to be present at a wedding reception, or any other marriage-related celebration, cannot be more than 50. This has dropped from the erstwhile number of 200. The spike in Covid cases in Pune district, on average, 2,500-3,000 new cases a day, has led to these new rules, among others. According to the wedding hall association of Pune, most bookings, especially those in the March to May period, are getting cancelled. According to the association, the industry, with an annual turnover of ₹2,000 crore, has taken a hit on it revenue earnings. Sripal Oswal, association president, said, “After reopening, January saw some booking and things were looking better. With the restrictions being enforced, customers want to book for July now, and the situation is bleak for wedding hall owners.” Sudam Jagtap, owner of a prominent marriage hall in Hadapsar, and association office-bearer, said, “The industry is in need of government funding. How will we meet our expenses? We had to lay off many of our employees. People prefer small halls and low budgets and it is destroying our economy.” Jagtap added, “Currently, only 10 per cent of the business is back, but that too will be eliminated if a fresh lockdown is implemented.” The guest-reduction directives have impacted the entire industry, with band managers, caterers, and decor companies, claim that clients have already to cancel.

15-03-2021||Pune||Owners, managers of four restaurants in Koregaon Park booked for flouting Covid norms||Pune: Four restaurants in Koregaon Park have been raided by the Pune police on Sunday night, and the owners and managers have been booked for flouting rules in place to curb Covid-19. Talli, Murphies, The Daily, and Publiq, are the four night-life destinations in trouble, according to a statement issued by the Pune police. The four restaurants allegedly housed more customers than the permitted capacity, in light of social distancing norms. While social distancing has been mandatory in the light of the pandemic, stricter norms were introduced after Pune district, and Maharashtra, saw a spike in the number of Covid19 cases in the past three weeks. On March 14, Pune district recorded 3,267 new cases, according to district information office records. The Pune Municipal commissioner’s office issued orders on March 12 that required restaurants and eateries to display their seating capacity and number of customers at any given time, according to the police statement. However, no such display of information was made outside these restaurants, the police claimed. “Those booked, include owners and managers of the four businesses,” according to senior police inspector Dilip Shinde. Subsequently, a case under Sections 188, 269 of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 51(b) of Disaster Management Act, 2005 has been registered at the Koregaon Park police station. Who? We? Pubs deny flouting of norms The owner of Murphies, one of the pubs raided, said he was not aware of the action. “I am out of the city on business and am unaware of any such action. We have been diligently following all the norms laid down by the PMC,” said Aman Talreja. Daily All Day confirmed that the police visited their premises, but denied any action as taken. “In fact, we have been following rules from the beginning. We have a sitting area of 162, but we allow only for 100 tables. The police were here at 8pm because someone complained that the music was loud and they took away our music console,” said manager Abhijeet Biswas. Karan Bhandari, owner of Tulli said, “We have been following social distancing and had 50 per cent capacity, when suddenly the police came in and many of the guests ran away without paying. It is a loss for us and we have done nothing wrong. We have sanitisers in place too.” Publiq owner Anuj Agarwal does not deny the police action, but adds, “We strictly adhere to rules and follow all Covid norms. In fact, a fortnight ago we had a team from the PMC visit us and applaud us for ensuring social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/owners-managers-of-four-restaurants-in-koregaon-park-booked-for-flouting-covid-norms-101615820810083.html

Party workers will also hold 'gherao' of the chief minister house in Dehradun on that day, party leader Ravinder Jugran said on Monday.Jugran, who joined AAP from BJP about a month ago, said the party decided to hold the above-mentioned events as the "BJP government failed the people of the state in its four years of the rule so far"."The party will observe March 18, the day when the BJP government will complete its four years in the state, as a 'Black Day' as it failed in every aspect. We would also hold protest rallies in all the 70 assembly seats and gherao CM house in Dehradun under the leadership of our party state president SS Kaler on that day," said Jugran.Alleging the government of doing nothing for the development of the state, he said, "Today, the unemployment rate is at an all-time high with unemployed youths protesting on roads demanding jobs. The women protesting on the road in their area are being lathi-charged. Government employees protesting for their rights are being booked by the police. This sorry state of Uttarakhand has been caused by this BJP government."Also read: Uttarakhand BJP leaders flock to CM Rawat's 'political guru'. It's a strategyCiting the recent leadership change, he said, "With only a year left for the next assembly elections, the BJP has changed the CM in an attempt to cover up its failures in the past four years of its tenure. But people know everything and will throw them out of power in 2022 elections."The BJP, meanwhile, refuted the allegations made by the AAP and said it is a "non-existent party in Uttarakhand.""The AAP is a non-existent party in Uttarakhand's political scenario and has no right to accuse our government after what their government did with the people of Uttarakhand during the lockdown in Delhi. Our government has done many developments works for the people of Uttarakhand in the last four years for which the people have been overwhelmingly supportive toward us. With their support, we will again win the next elections," said Manveer Singh Chauhan, BJP state media in-charge.The BJP government had planned programmes across all 70 assembly seats to celebrate the completion of four years of their government.

All RTO inspectors in the Pune region are been given a list of schools to conduct the checks.“There are 400 driving schools in Pune, of which only 152 have proper permissions and legal documents. The rest have either not renewed their permissions, or they are running illegally. The number of such driving schools risking the lives of people is high, so we decided to check the verification of each and every motor driving school,” said Sanjeev Bhor, deputy regional transport officer, Pune RTO.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic for the 10 months driving classes were closed, but since January classes restarted. Fees for driving classes are around ₹8,000 per person in Pune, for a period of two weeks.“Till this drive is completed our appeal to the public is that they should verify the permissions and then only take admission,” said Bhor.Welcoming this decision of the Pune RTO, Kaushik Mhatre, a driving school owner said, “It is good that RTO is checking the schools’ authorisation. There are several such illegal schools that do not have any permission and any person without proper training experience is giving training to new drivers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rto-launches-drive-to-check-and-verify-registration-of-motor-driving-schools-in-pune-101615819490059.html

While beneficiaries have to wait for their turn, officials cite a problem with the system as vaccine slots are opened only till March 17. Speaking on unavailable slots, Vikas Apte, 65, said that he has however registered online. “The online application status shows no slot available till April 6. When I visited the local government hospital and private hospital in my area, they refused to give me vaccination stating that the pending beneficiary list,” said Apte. Sarang Shintre, 57, who was waiting at Sanjeevan hospital for his turn also noted that many nearby hospitals do not have on-spot inoculation facility due to the rush. “We are waiting at the centre since 9:15 am. While booking for slots, only two options — forenoon or afternoon — are available. The afternoon slot is extended till 6 pm. How can senior citizens manage to wait in queues till those long hours during the summer season,” said Shintre. Manjushree Gole, who was at the vaccination centre with her 77-year-old father Anile Gole, said that she had booked her spot on March 15 (Sunday). “But we were asked to come and take the jab on Monday. I had to take a day off from the office because of their change in vax day. Also, there is confusion about which vaccine will be given to us and whether we will get the second dose after 28 days. Do we have to visit the same centre to take the second jab?” said Manjushree. Speaking about the booked slots, Dr Ashish Bharti, chief of the health department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said that the slots are open only till March 17. “Beneficiaries should refresh and check for slots in their areas. It may be a minor glitch which will be solved soon. If beneficiaries keep checking for slots they will be able to get a vaccination centre nearby. If not, many government-run hospitals have on-spot vaccination after you have registered. Beneficiaries can also avail this facility,” said Dr Bharti. Meanwhile, the Chemists Association of Pune District has submitted a letter to the PMC health department seeking their inclusion as frontline workers for the ongoing vaccination drive. As per the association, there are about 8,000 chemists and druggists in Pune district who are waiting for free vaccination drive as Covid frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/some-vaccination-sites-in-pune-have-no-slots-till-april-6-admn-admits-tech-glitch-101615819370031.html

The report documents poor implementation of schemes as the key reason for what it says was ‘avoidable loss’ for 2019-20.Even as the major focus of the report on poor implementation of the Re-structured Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (R-APDRP), a Centre-funded programme, it does record that low billing and collection efficiency in 21 and 19 towns respectively, resulted in revenue loss of ₹206 crore to the company.The CAG says that undue waiver of interest and allowance of rebate to arc furnace industrial consumers, in violation of the Supply Code and Electricity Supply Instruction Manual 2018, resulted in undue financial burden of ₹12.8 crore.Interestingly, even the media had reported chinks in the way the government was implementing the R-APDRP, which was launched in September 2008. The scheme envisaged reduction in Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C1 ) losses, establishing reliable and automated systems for collection of base line data, adoption of Information Technology (IT) in the areas of energy accounting and customer care and strengthening of power distribution network in urban areas with population of more than 30,000. It was implemented in 47 towns of the state.Initially, 100% of project cost was taken as loan from the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). The loan, along with interest, was to be converted into grant after the establishment of IT systems and verification by an independent agency that the PFC appointed.CAG found, however, that the PSPCL could not implement the R-APDRP scheme within the timelines that the Centre had stipulated. The conversion of loan into grant remained pending, leading to the company being deprived of conversion of interest of ₹179 crore into grant and tranche of grant of ₹116 crore. Against the target of reducing the AT&C losses to 15%, the AT&C losses of 22 towns were higher, which would result in non-conversion of loan of ₹7.7 crore into grant. The report also pointed out that the lack of co-ordination between operational wings of the company, during the construction of Stage-II of Mukerian Hydel Project, resulted in avoidable loss of generation of power, valued at ₹15.2 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pspcls-poor-handling-of-schemes-caused-it-rs-529cr-loss-says-cag-101615818831178.html

She said, “The state government has started the process of including 23 new villages in corporation limits. These villages need primary health centres, water supply, solid waste management, sanitation, street light and sewerage treatment plant. However, the government has not allocated a single penny for these villages.” The BJP MLA said that the government is yet to provide financial help to Ambil odha affected families despite many assurances.

15-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP leaders flock to CM Rawat's 'political guru'. It's a strategy||Former Uttarakhand chief minister Major General BC Khanduri (Retd), who had been away from any political limelight since the last couple of years, seems to be in the news again ever since Tirath Singh Rawat, who calls Khanduri as his "political guru", took charge as the new CM of the state.After taking oath as the state's head, Rawat paid his first visit to Khanduri on the morning of March 11 during which he cited him as a father figure and the reason behind his present political stature. Since then, BJP state leaders, including new party state president Madan Kaushik, have been paying visits to him with many suggesting that the party leaders have figured out that if one needs to get close to CM Rawat, the passage will go through Khanduri.Major Gen Khanduri (Retd), a five-time MP from Pauri Garhwal seat, had been the CM of Uttarakhand twice from 2007-09 and 2011-12. Known as a tough taskmaster as a CM, he was widely considered a leader of integrity and honesty by the public. He had also been Union minister of state with independent charge in the then NDA government from 2000-2003.After losing the 2012 state assembly elections, he then contested the 2014 general elections from Pauri Garhwal which he won with a margin of over 1.85 lakh votes. However, in the 2019 general elections, he refused to contest again citing ill health following which present CM Rawat contested from the seat and won against his son Manish Khanduri who fought the elections from the Congress. Following that, he went dormant in the state politics with the state BJP not involving him in any party activities until March 10 when Rawat took charge as the new CM.Also read: Govt did not permit any new hydel project in Upper Ganges region in last 6 yearsPolitical experts say that, with the affinity of CM Rawat towards Khanduri known to all and proved by his visit next morning, BJP state leaders are now trying to gather brownie points from Rawat by paying visits to Khanduri."This is obviously a visible change in the strategy of the BJP leaders from a corporator to a senior leader. Since March 11, all have been visiting him at his residence in Dehradun, including newly appointed party state president Madan Kaushik to newly inducted cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi," said political analyst SMA Kazmi.Kazmi said the visit paid by the CM the very next morning with his wife to Khanduri, during which he immensely praised his role in his political life as was well as personal life, has "hit a chord with other party leaders.""The visit has again pulled him in the political limelight because a CM meeting him is obvious to send some message down the ranks. Also, being an ex-army man, Khanduri is widely respected in the Garhwal region even today. All the party leaders are now trying to cash in that," he said, adding that CM Rawat has again made him politically alive in the state.Another political expert, Anoop Nautiyal, who had been keeping a close eye on the recent major political developments said, "Not only is CM Rawat close to him politically but personally too."Nautiyal said, "During his meeting with Khanduri, he heaped praises on him by calling him a father figure. But what made the news was Khanduri speaking of him like he is speaking of his son, which grabbed the attention of other party leaders who had now figured that if they want to get close to the new CM, they have to go through Khanduri. Hence, the recent spurt in visits by BJP leaders and rise in his importance."New party state president Madan Kaushik tried to play it down by saying, "Gen Khanduri has been a respected leader in the party and will always remain one.""There is nothing political in visiting one of the tallest leaders of the party in the state. He has been the CM twice and MP five times. So, there is nothing wrong if the party leaders are seeking his blessings," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-leaders-flock-to-cm-rawat-s-political-guru-it-s-a-strategy-101615816514868.html

Those living at Aundh road, Bopodi, Sangvi, Pimple Gurav, Vishrantwadi, Mula road, Bopkhel and Khadki cantonment areas are the worst affected by the mosquito havoc. Residents living near Katraj and Pashan lakes have also complained of insect issue as civic authorities have only partially cleared the water bodies of the aquatic weed. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Girish Bapat has instructed PMC and PCMC commissioners to take immediate action to remove the weed. The MP has written to the civic administration of inaction despite repeated complaints from residents. He sought urgent meeting of Pimpri-Chinchwad, Khadki Cantonment Board and heads of three local self-governing bodies of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to relieve citizens of the problem. After receiving the letter, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar has promised action. “No action has been taken by PMC despite many letters to the commissioner. The problem is that water hyacinth is removed and dumped in the river. So, it stays and remains breeding ground for mosquitos till the monsoon season,” said SK Patil from Mantri Rivera Society, Bopodi. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) corporator Vasant More said, “Though the weed is removed from big lakes, the problem persists at small water bodies.” “After 6 pm, it becomes inconvenient to sit at the courtyard facing the lake because of the mosquitos. We also don’t allow children to play outside during the evenings,” said Rupesh Ahuja, who stays near Pashan lake. “The administration gets money to clean rivers every year, but monsoon waters clear most of the weed and authorities take credit for it,” said Sachin Kalbhor, president of Rotary Club Walhekarwadi. Ashok Ghorpade, chief garden superintendent and incharge of Katraj and Pashan lakes, did not respond to calls or messages. Sanjay Wavare, head of insecticide department PMC, said “We have not received any case of dengue or mosquito-borne diseases till now this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mosquito-woes-sting-pune-residents-as-civic-bodies-overlook-water-hyacinth-menace-101615815889968.html

The strength of the SGPC general house now stands at 162. While 21 members have died since the last elections in 2011, two have resigned from membership. The general house originally had 170 elected and 15 nominated members. The SGPC, which celebrated its centenary in November 2020, looks after the management of gurdwaras across Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. It runs the world’s largest community kitchen service or langars, feeding hundreds of thousands of people daily. On March 10, Gurtej Singh Dhade, the SGPC member from Maur Mandi, passed away. He had been a member of the SGPC executive committee also. The next day, another member, Bikkar Singh Channu, died. On March 13, Sukhdarshan Singh Mrar, also a former Muktsar MLA, breathed his last at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot. All four SGPC members were ailing and belonged to Bathinda and Muktsar, the home district of the Badal family. They were senior members of the SAD and remained on key posts in the party. Expressing grief over the passing away of the members, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur extended condolences to their families. She led a gathering of SGPC members and staffers at the committee’s headquarters at Teja Singh Samundri Hall in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar during which tributes were paid to the departed souls by reciting Gurbani and offering ardas (prayers). During the condolence meet for Kolianwali on Monday, members paid tributes to the departed soul by reciting the Moolmantra and Gurmantra. Bibi Jagir Kaur termed Kolianwali’s death as a loss to the panth (community), while SGPC general secretary Bhagwant Singh Sialka recalled the late member’s service to the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-kolianwali-s-death-sgpc-loses-fourth-member-in-a-week-101615814570902.html
15-03-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt to terminate police service officer for demanding sexual favours||In a rare move, the Rajasthan government on Monday initiated the termination process of Rajasthan police service (RPS) officer Kailash Bohra, who allegedly demanded sexual favour from a rape survivor for taking action in cases lodged by her.The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had arrested Bohra on Sunday.The government has also appointed a new investigating officer for the seven cases probed by Bohra. The cases investigated by the accused officer in past will be also re-examined to ensure whether they were fairly investigated or not.Bohra is a 1996 batch sub-inspector who was promoted to the post of deputy superintendent of police two years ago. For over a year, he was posted as an ACP in Jaipur city.Terming the case as “rare of the rarest”, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal in the state assembly said it was a blot not only on the reputation of the police alone but also on the government and entire system.Dhariwal informed the House that Bohra was initially suspended but now the process to terminate him under the Rajasthan civil services rules 1958 has been started.The minister also said that sometimes victims turn hostile which gives benefit to the accused.Also read: Woman, 30, allegedly gang-raped in front of husband in Rajasthan’s BaranEarlier, during the 'zero hour', the Opposition BJP demanded stern action against Bohra.Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore raised the matter through an adjournment motion and said it was a shameful incident. “The accused officer was facing a CBI inquiry in a case and despite that, he was given posting in the special investigation unit for crimes against women,” he said.The BJP leader said such officers should be terminated from service and CCTV cameras in police stations should be installed, adding that the government should take exemplary steps in the case.Leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria also demanded stern action in the matter. “If no action is taken against him despite a discussion in the House, then the public will not forgive us. People should get the assurance," Kataria said.Speaker CP Joshi asked Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal whether he has anything to say on the issue. Dhariwal said there was a ruling of the Speaker that ministers would not reply to an adjournment motion. The Speaker gave a ruling that the minister would later give a statement in the House on the issue.Bohra, who was posted as the assistant commissioner of police (special investigation unit for crimes against women) in the DCP East office, was caught by the ACB team on Sunday.Informing the House, Dhairwal said Bohra first demanded money from the woman who had lodged three complaints, including one of rape, and then began demanding sexual favours from her after she expressed her inability to give him money.“No notice or reply has been sought from the accused officer – this shows the government's seriousness and sensitivity,” said Dhariwal.Regarding the case, DG, ACB, BL Soni said on March 6, a 30-year-old woman filed a complaint against Bohra in the ACB stating that she had lodged three cases, including rape, cheating against a man and others, at the Jawahar Circle police station. The ACP was investigating these cases.Two weeks ago, the accused RPS officer demanded a bribe to take action against the accused and when she refused, saying that she doesn’t have money, the police officer demanded sexual favours from her.“The victim alleged that the investigating officer, Kailash Bohra, first demanded a bribe from her to take action in all the three cases. When she did not give the money, he started calling her office repeatedly in name of investigation. Eventually, he started harassing and demanding sexual favours as a bribe. The woman also alleged that Bohra pressured her to meet him even after office hours,” added Soni.In order to trap the ACP, the anti-graft body had applied chemical on the victim's clothes, which is generally applied on currency, to verify any undue favour taken by a government servant.Additional director general (ADG), ACB Dinesh MN, said that along with a case of corruption, cases under section 376C (government official taking advantage of his official position to seduce any female at a workplace), 354 (outraging modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code have been lodged against Borah.Bohra entered the Rajasthan Police in 1996 as a sub-inspector. He has been an inspector at many other police stations including Bajaj Nagar, Sadar, Shivdaspura in Jaipur. The CBI is investigating a 10-year-old Arms Act case when the accused was posted in Sadar police station of Jaipur city. Bohra had arrested two youths, including a jeweller, in two Arms Act cases.In this case, a few months ago, the High Court had ordered a CBI inquiry against half a dozen policemen including Kailash Bohra.Big catches of ACBTwo union services officers, seven state services officers have been caught by the ACB in the last two months.

A team of scientists belonging to National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), Hyderabad, and their counterparts from Denmark are busy concentrating on the stretch of land lying between the Ganga and the Yamuna: the land between Kaushambi and Kanpur, officials said. The important survey, involving high-precision gadgets, follows a similar survey undertaken earlier by the team in 2018. That survey had found a third paleochannel (a dry river bed) beneath the surface from Prayagraj to Manjhanpur between the Ganga and the Yamuna. The team of scientists has returned to trace and identify sources of this water and to discover new ways of water conservation. This survey is being carried out by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under the Namami Gange Project. The basic objective of this survey is to look for new ways for water conservation by inspecting the quality of water, they added, distancing the work from being seen as an effort to find the mythical Saraswati. During phase-1 of this survey, a water stream was found between Prayagraj and Kaushambi. It was about 14 kilometres long and five kilometres wide. The water stream thus found in the earlier survey is extinct in contemporary times, but scientific survey found evidence of its existence many years ago. In phase-2 of the survey being undertaken now, the scientists are conducting an aerial survey from Kaushambi (Manjhanpur) to Kanpur. CGWB scientist Shashi Kumar said that the aerial survey is being carried out to a depth of 300 metres (around 1000 feet) beneath the earth surface. “The primary objective of the second phase of research is to find how far the paleochannel goes so that water can be conserved, and its resources can be enhanced,” he explained. The experts will study various components including soil, pebbles etc. These vital components give a fair amount of information about the amount of water in that particular area or in what proportion, he added. Carbon-dating of the soil, collection of pebbles, sand and water specimens will be carried out by the team of scientists, who will be joined by scientists from the National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, in this effort. Investigations are expected to conclude by the end of this month, findings of which will be forwarded to the Central Ground Water Board. The equipment used by the team can extract relevant information from 200-400 metres beneath the earth crust and similar work has already been done in six districts in the country including Patna, Tumkur, Dosa and Nagpur among others. The main equipment— transient electromagnetic sensors (TEM)—would be attached to a chopper which would fly along pre-decided longitudes between the two rivers, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/namami-gange-project-phase-2-of-search-begins-for-third-stream-on-kaushambi-kanpur-stretch-101615812349953.html
15-03-2021||Lucknow||Maya defends sale of state-run sugar mills in BSP regime||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday reiterated her party’s decision to contest all forthcoming polls, both in Uttar Pradesh and other states, alone. She also broke her silence on the controversial sale of 21 sugar mills run by a state corporation during 2007-2012, when she headed a majority government in UP.“There was nothing wrong with the sale of these mills. I didn’t head that department. A minister of mine did. But even that minister wasn’t responsible for the decision was taken by the cabinet. And as you know, a decision taken by the cabinet is a collective one,” she said after paying tribute to her mentor and BSP founder Kanshiram on his 87th birth anniversary on Monday. The Yogi Adityanath government had in 2018 recommended a CBI probe into the sale of those sugar mills. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had subsequently taken over the probe and in 2019 registered FIR in the case. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), in its report, had estimated losses to the tune of ₹1,179.84 crore due to the sale of these sugar mills. However, Mayawati said the sale was made as per rules and regulations, saying that there wasn’t any foul play in the matter.“I think such things happen in all governments which decide the issues on the basis of existing rules and regulations,” she said, refuting allegations of corruption. No pre-poll alliance with any party now Mayawati said she had decided against having an alliance with any party for any polls, whether in UP or outside. “We won’t have any pre-poll alliance with any party, whether in poll-bound West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry or the 2022 UP assembly polls,” she said and explained that it was because such tie-ups had not benefitted her party in the past. “It has been seen while we manage to get our base vote transferred, the same doesn’t happen for us. So, there is no point in entering into an alliance which doesn’t benefit us,” she said. Asked if the decision to go it alone in several poll-bound states like West Bengal would be to the BJP’s advantage, she said, “Who benefits, who doesn’t is not our outlook. We take decisions on the basis of their utility for the party and the people.” Mayawati had entered into a pre-poll tie-up with the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but the alliance ended after it failed to make an impact as the BJP again emerged triumphant at the hustings. No comment on Priyanka’s meeting with Bhim Army chiefMayawati refused to comment on Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s political activities in UP and her previous meeting with Bhim army chief Chandrashekhar. “We are a democratic country and, in a democracy, each one is free to contest elections. So, who meets whom is none of our concern,” she said. Recall of new farm laws demandedMayawati appealed to the BJP government to recall the three new contentious farm laws and said that the BSP fully backed the farmers’ stir. “I would urge the BJP government to recall the three farm laws. I would also appeal to the government to provide adequate compensation to the family (members) of those farmers who died during the stir,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/maya-defends-sale-of-state-run-sugar-mills-in-bsp-regime-101615811871227.html

Here are the excerpts from the interview.Q: How many people have been vaccinated in J&K so far?A: Till yesterday, 3,63,450 people have received their first dose of vaccination after J&K began the inoculation. Among the 10,0591 health care workers, 76,964 have received the first dose which is around 77 per cent and 28,732 have also received the second dose which amounts to 29 per cent. Of 2,76,559 Front Line Workers (FLW) 198,655 received the first dose which is 72 per cent and 22,060, which is 8 per cent, got the second dose. Among those comprising people over 60 years, so far 81,064 have received their jabs which is around 7 per cent.Q: How is the response from people? Are people reluctant?A: So far, the response from people have been good and in the coming days we are further going to step up the vaccination drive in J&K. We first started with 5,000 jabs then 6,000 and 10,000 and on the last working day on Saturday, we gave 43,000 vaccine shots to people. Even the percentage of the second dose is going up gradually. In the second dose, people have a choice if they want to get the shot after six, eight or twelve weeks. Many people want to get more immunity so they delay the second dose. Currently, we are getting an overwhelming response as people ask about the address of the vaccination centres.Also read: Health minister gives ‘main reason’ for recent spike in India’s Covid-19 tallyQ: How many centres have been established in J&K for vaccination?A: We started with some 250 vaccination sites which have been increased to 350. Currently, we are running 772 sites across the UT. We increased the number of vaccination sites after we started giving jabs to people ageing 60 years and above. We don't want our senior citizens to face any sort of problems to locate these centres. We have even established centres at far off places in different regions.The best thing about our vaccination drive is that our wastage is far less than the national average because of the hard work and the expertise of our staff. We have set up two control rooms in Jammu and Srinagar, besides, post immunisation control rooms to monitor any adverse effects in beneficiaries are at every place. We didn't have any major adverse case in J&K due to immunisation.Q: Are people still afraid or reluctant to get the vaccination?A: Whenever any new vaccination drive is started anywhere, initially people are always apprehensive. Here also people were afraid but once we launched this program, the senior J&K health officers and heads of medical institutions were first to get the vaccination, besides, we also launched a social media campaign which worked and our vaccination program is going nicely. Near about 4 lakh people have been vaccinated in our UT, not a single case of death was reported due to this, unfortunately, some people exaggerate things.Q: Do we have a dearth of vaccines?A: In the coming days or weeks, we will require more and more vaccines, the government has promised us adequate stocks as the number of people coming for the vaccination is going up day by day and we are definitely prepared to meet any target. We have an adequate supply of vaccines in all the districts. The centre has asked us not to stock any vaccine as there will be adequate supply coming to our sites.Q: Do you think with an increase in vaccinations, the protection against the Covid-19 virus will go up in J&K?A: Yes, its really going to help to bring down the numbers. This time also in J&K the disease is well under control but people and the officials have to be vigilant, especially about travellers. We should devise a mechanism that will help us to prevent the entry of new strains of the virus in the UT. So far, our health system and administration have remained successful in bringing down the numbers what it was three to four months ago.Q: Are covid cases rising in J&K?A: As of now, we don't have any evidence which will suggest that the cases are rising in the UT. We have increased testings which were already there. Even the hospitals meant for Covid-19 patients have vacant spaces. Still, we are keeping a close watch on the data daily, especially we have to do more testing on travellers to ensure that the new strains don't enter our place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid19-vaccination-drive-on-track-j-k-dg-family-welfare-tells-ht-101615808893498.html

Addressing the SAD’s Punjab Mangda Jawab rally at Amarkot village in Tarn Taran district, Sukhbir asked the people at the gathering who they wanted as their candidate from Khemkaran and they raised their hands in favour of Valtoha. During public meetings over two days in Khemkaran last week, Kairon had announced that one of his family members would be fielded from the assembly constituency, revealing the rift in the party. Without naming Kairon, Sukhbir said that leaders should stop groupism and work for strengthening the party. “I want to request the entire leadership here to stop groupism. Your group is the SAD. Your mother party is the SAD. Today, the power you have got is because of the party. If you have been given honour and are sitting on the stage, it is because of the SAD.” Turning towards his supporters, he said: “The SAD is the property of the people. It is our responsibility to make the state progressive. Everyone has to obey the decision, whatever it is, of the party. If the SAD is powerful then we are all powerful.” Later, he announced Valtoha’s name from the constituency.

The boys were punished by the sarpanch and panchayat members of Bhasaur village. Their families were fined ₹5,000.The incident took place on March 7, but came to light on Sunday when the family members of the boys submitted a complaint to Sangrur senior superintendent of police (SSP) and sent a letter to the state commission for protection of child rights.According to the complaint, the boys of Bhasaur village went to Banbhori village and stole the ₹300 from a tomb located in a field. The residents of the village caught them and called the sarpanch and panchayat members of Bhasaur and handed over the boys to them. The sarpanch and others allegedly forced them to walk in front of their motorcycles. The boys belong to Dalit families. Gurmeet Singh, the father of one of the boys, said: “One of them has suffered a fracture on his wrist when he was beaten up. I have filed an application with the police and child rights commission. We want justice and punishment for the accused.” Sarpanch Gurnam Singh said that the boys were involved in theft for the past few months and the panchayat just wanted to teach them a lesson. “Our rivals have made a mountain out of a molehill. When we reached Banbhori village, their hands were already tied with a rope. We asked them to walk and imposed a fine to teach them a lesson. We did not assault anyone,” the sarpanch said.Dhuri Sadar police station in-charge Deepinderpal Singh said that the police had booked four men, including sarpanch Gurnam Singh.

15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ stir finds echo in BJP-ruled HP as apple growers demand repeal of farm laws||The ongoing agitation against the three farm laws found an echo in BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh on Monday as farmers, mainly apple growers of the hill state, held a statewide protest, demanding the Centre repeal the contentious legislation and bring their produce under the minimum support price (MSP), too. Representatives of the state’s farm organisations, including fruit, vegetable and milk associations, which formed the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha last week, submitted a memorandum of their demands, addressed to governor Bandaru Dattatreya, to the authorities at the district and block levels. Kisan Sabha activists staged a protest at Mashobra, 10 km from Shimla town, and submitted the memorandum to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur. New farm laws favour corporates: Growers In view of the rising input cost and competition from apples imported from China, Iran and Turkey, HP Fruit and Vegetable Association president Harish Chauhan said: “Himachal Pradesh’s ₹4,000-crore apple economy is facing a crisis due to the unfavourable policies of the state and Centre. We want MSP to be fixed for the apple produce and the crop should be given special category status. The import duty on apple should be raised from 50% to 100%. This will help growers get remunerative prices.” Nawar Valley Apple Society president Mahijit Rathore said the input cost of apple cultivation has risen manifold over the years, but the government’s market intervention scheme has failed to help farmers. “The import of apples from Iran and other Saarc Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) countries have affected the prices and hit the interest of farmers of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Kashmir,” he said. Lokinder Singh Bisht, the president of Progressive Growers Association, said besides facing competition from duty-free import of Iranian and Turkish apples, apple growers of the state are burdened by the increase of diesel prices, rates of packaging material, fertilisers and other inputs. “Now with the new farm laws that favour corporatisation and monopolisation, the apple economy will be further hit. It’s imperative that the government fixes the MSP for apples and other horticulture crops to ensure sustainability,” he said. Unlike other states where farmers can grow two to four crops a year, Bisht said horticulturists of Himachal have no other source of income other than the single crop that they get in a year, battling nature’s vagaries, changing climatic conditions and labour shortage. Farmers seek FCI centres for maize in HP Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, the president of the Himachal Kisan Sabha, said while farmers have been on a protest for more than 100 days, the Centre was unfazed by their plight. Sanjay Chauhan, a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Manch, demanded that the government repeal the anti-farmer laws as the legislation would do no good to farmers and only result in high input cost and the corporate sector controlling food supply. According to the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, MSP should be implemented as a law, he said. The state’s farmer leaders said that the government should set up Food Corporation of India centres to procure maize in Himachal Pradesh besides fixing the MSP for apple, tomato, garlic, ginger and milk. They also want the Electricity Amendment Act to be withdrawn as it would result in privatisation of power distribution and the cost of electricity will impact the farm input cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-stir-finds-echo-in-bjp-ruled-hp-as-apple-growers-demand-repeal-of-farm-laws-101615802750205.html

15-03-2021||Other||From investigators to accused: Rise and fall of officers on the police force||PUNE The arrest of Sachin Vaze, a Mumbai police officer, by the National Investigating Agency (NIA), may have shocked some, but is it the first time Maharashtra is witnessing a serving cop getting arrested in a sensational case such as this? Around 18 years ago, Maharashtra’s police department was startled when a battery of police officials – junior and senior– were arrested by a special investigation team probing the multi-crore stamp paper scam, of which Abdul Karim Telgi was mastermind. With more than 20 convictions, imprisonment to which count up to 40 years if calculated separately, and fines slapped on him crossing ₹250 crore, Telgi died in Bengaluru, after a prolonged illness in October 2017. From former Mumbai police commissioner RS Sharma and ex-joint commissioner Shreedhar Vagal, to the then deputy commissioner Pradeep Sharma, were arrested in the case that hit headlines in 2003-04, when Maharashtra being ruled by the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). RS Sharma, who first served as Pune police commissioner before taking the charge as top cop in Mumbai, was arrested the day after his retirement, sending shockwaves in police circles. Later, during the course of the trial, those named above and some others were discharged in the case by the courts. The irony was, many of the police officials arrested in the Telgi case were also involved in probing the same scam. Their arrests also pointed to conspiracy theories about how actions were the fallout of internal rivalries between officers in the state police force. The case reverberated nationally with names of some politicians also being dragged into it. No senior politician was arrested or booked though.While Telgi scam was mostly about money, the cases that hurt the Maharashtra police most were some of the alleged fake encounters or custodial killings. Back in 2002, an investigation carried out by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) established that bomb- blast accused Sayyed Khwaja Yunus was killed in custody. It was similar to the Sachin Vaze case, and other encounter specialists like Praful Bhosale, who arrested later. Like Vaze, another Mumbai police officer who rose to fame through encounters was Daya Nayak. Nayak too faced allegations of disproportionate income and his alleged links with criminals, and was suspended from the service before being reinstated in 2012. Closer to Pune, the arrest of BR Andhalkar, a former inspector attached with the rural police in RTI activist Satish Shetty’s murder brought a fresh twist to the case. Those whom CBI has chargesheeted, includes former assistant inspector Namdeo Kauthale and former Andhalkar, even as the agency has filed a closure report against nine others, that include Ideal Road Builder (IRB) chairman and managing director Virendra Mhaiskar, and others, in the absence of evidence. Shetty, 38, an RTI activist from Pune district was working on exposing alleged irregularities in land dealings pertaining to plots alongside the Mumbai-Pune expressway, when he was stabbed to death on January 13, 2010, not far from his Panchvati Colony home in Talegaon Dabhade, while on his morning walk. If some of these policemen were held to account for their actions because of a slew of petitions in courts, judicial activism or pressure from opposition, there was no denying the rivalry among policemen. Most of these policemen were ambitious. Some of them even aligned with politicians and senior police officers for their vested interests. Some of the encounter specialists amassed disproportionate assets, while others parked their ill-gotten wealth in philanthropist activities. Unfortunately, some were suspended or dismissed and jailed, to allow them join with the same criminals they had once arrested. Many on the other hand managed to clear their names through the judicial process and rejoined duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/from-investigators-to-accused-rise-and-fall-of-officers-on-the-police-force-101615798609503.html

With some metered cab operators also extending support to the strike, commuters were in for a tough time during the morning rush hours as only a few buses and mini buses were plying. “I had booked an app cab to reach office but the surge in fare was nearly three times over the normal fare of ₹90 – ₹100. The waiting time was also around 30 minutes. Normally, it takes five minutes,” said Rita Dey, a school teacher in east Kolkata. Striking cab operators also have a set of eight demands, including uniform fare. “We want a uniform rate, like that of other AC cabs, as fixed by the government. The high rate of commission and rise in fuel prices are draining us,” said SK Manu, secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions-affiliated app cab operators union. App cab operators affiliated to the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) have also joined the strike. “We have already started a sit-in demonstration outside the transport office in Kolkata. This is a 24-hour strike,” said NK Srivastava, convener of app-cab operators forum affiliated to AITUC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/online-cab-operator-associations-on-day-long-strike-in-kolkata-today-101615794350235.html

Gazipur Border, Delhi to Gazipur is open for traffic movement,” they tweeted.“In view of prevailing law and order situation at the Ghazipur border and considering public convenience, the carriageway of NH-24 going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi has been opened after consultation with police officials of Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh,” the police were quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Traffic AlertGazipur Border, Delhi to Gazipur is open for traffic movement.COVID PRECAUTIONS :WEAR MASK, MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING, KEEP HAND HYGIENEApart from reopening briefly on a few days, traffic on Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remained closed fully or partially as agitators have been demonstrating at the sites since late November last year against the three farm laws.As the UP border was closed, commuters were advised by the Delhi Police to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders. The Delhi-Noida Chilla border, however, was open for commute on both carriageways. The entry and exit points between the national capital and neighbouring Haryana, passing through Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Manyari and Saboli and Mangesh, continued to remain closed.Farmers have been protesting at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu for more than 100 days now. While the farmers are demanding a repeal of the new agricultural legislation, the government has ruled out the complete rollback and has offered to make amendments. The protesters, however, have vowed to continue camping at the borders till the laws are taken back. Several rounds of talks between the central leadership and farmers' union leaders have failed to break the deadlock over the legislation.As the matter reached the Supreme Court, it has put on hold the implementation of the three laws that were cleared during the Monsoon Session last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghazipur-border-reopens-for-traffic-movement-tweets-delhi-police-101615776062667.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Monument of ‘love’||It could be any of its cousins. This Lodhi-era tomb is looking as ignored and unremarkable as any other Lodhi-era tomb of Delhi, its centuries-old stones blackened with time.The impression dissipates on closer survey. The tiny monument—Kali Gumti, in south Delhi’s Deer Park — has something that makes it stand out. It is like a lovers’ notebook. Every inch of the monument’s surface is scratched over with I-Love-You scrawls, along with the names of what one presumes to be people in love. Some of these names are ornamented with heart-shaped drawings. A few scrawls seem to be mobile phone numbers.Here’s a sample:Swati loves SahilI love you MahiSimran love (sic) SumitThe walls of the monument are covered with such bold declarations. They haven’t been made with a pen or pencil, but rather seem to have been scratched on the stone with pebbles, or perhaps, in some cases, with fingernails. One exception is “I love you Shiva”, written with a piece of coal.The tomb is tucked within a cramped enclosure, smaller than a badminton court. The western side has a wall with beautifully sculpted niches, and large hearts haven’t spared them either. Some drawings are so deeply embedded into the stone that one wonders how much pain and time the lovers took to immortalise their romance into this relic.While reading these pairs of names, you might feel upset about the treatment given to this monument by fellow citizens. You might also be curious about how these love stories ended. There is no way of knowing, of course, unless you decide to risk dialling the phone numbers listed on the tomb.Now a man and woman appear. They must be a couple for each is in the same kind of red T-shirt, except that his has “Sher” printed on it, and hers has “Sherni.” They enter the tomb, take a selfie and exit.The tomb is again empty but it doesn’t feel empty. As if the lovers on the wall remained in the vicinity, in spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-monument-of-love-101615762201159.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Water supply hit in East Delhi for 48 hours||Several parts of east and north-east Delhi continued reeling under an acute water shortage for more than 48 hours on Sunday, as the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) carried out repair work of an interconnection pipeline.A statement issued by the DJB on Sunday said that the work on a 1,200mm main pipeline, supplying water to the east and north-east parts of the national capital, was completed by 4pm on Sunday and the evening supply was restored in many parts.“Repair work was successfully completed by 4pm on Sunday. Pumping of water also began immediately after the work was completed and by evening, water with appropriate pressure will be available in most areas. Further, by late evening or early tomorrow (Monday) morning, the entire east and north-east Delhi will get supply in full swing,” the Delhi Jal Board’s statement read.Despite the assurance that the evening water supply will be resumed in most parts, residents of most localities said that water was not available till at least late Sunday.Water supply in some of the areas started getting impacted from Friday, after the Delhi Jal Board began interconnection work on 1200 mm diameter main lines at Jal Vihar and Greater Kailash.The work was started after complaints received by residents of Vikas Kunj, reporting major leakages in the GK main lines, which resulted in water entering the basements of their houses, posing a threat to the building structure.Delhi Jal Board on March 11 had issued an advisory to people that due to the repair work of pipeline, water supply would be affected from 10am on Friday to 10am on Saturday.However, on Saturday the water utility agency issued a fresh advisory, extending the timing of the water shortage till Sunday morning.The worst impacted by the repair work were areas such as Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Chitra Nagar, Ghazipur, Mayur Vihar phase-I, II and III, East Azad Nagar, New Kondli, Shahdara, Mandawali, Patparganj, Shalimar Park and Vishwakarma Park.Mujid Alam, a resident of Mandawali, said that the water supply in his colony has been hit for three days now.He said that by Saturday evening, the last drop of water that was stored had been exhausted, and at least for two hours on Sunday morning he went around with empty buckets for search of some water to meet basic household requirements.“We went to the local shops and even they did not have water. I heard that in some shops in Pandav Nagar, drinking water bottles are being sold for R100 per bottle. People are desperate and some shopkeepers are taking advantage of that,” Alam said.Many people also took to social media to reach out to the DJB, desperately trying to get some information on water availability.Some also highlighted that while the supply was impacted, no efforts were made by the Delhi Jal Board to ensure the availability of water tankers or other sources.“No water supply in Mayur Vihar, East Delhi since the past two days. No water tanks available, no bottled drinking water available on shops today morning. Emergency situation Please do something urgently @DJB, (sic)” tweeted Ruchi Kokcha.A senior DJB official, however, denied the allegation and said water tankers were running late because of the increased demand, but was being made available wherever supply was hit.Abhishek Dutt, Congress party spokesperson and municipal councillor from south Delhi’s Andrews Ganj, said that the water shortage was also being experienced in parts of south Delhi.“Over the past few months, the only message that the Delhi Jal Board has been posting is ‘repair/breakdown/ammonia will impact water supply in Delhi’. Every week they come up with one such excuse. Residents of Lajpat Nagar-4 and Andrews Ganj are suffering for the past two days,” Dutt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-hit-in-east-delhi-for-48-hours-101615757464290.html

I have come here today to fulfil my promise. Despite the shortage of funds, I instructed officers to arrange funds from anywhere and start the sewer project as soon as possible because I had made a promise to you,” said Kejriwal, addressing a gathering in Kirari on Sunday.According to a statement released on Sunday, the government plans to lay 423km of sewer lines across the areas, as well as set up wastewater pumping stations in three areas.He further said, “We have already provided water to every household in Kirari, and we now aim to provide sewer lines to every household as well as good roads and lanes. I continue to face huge backlash from opposition parties for providing free services such as water and bus rides to people, but the support of the people keeps me going. In the last 70 years, no other party has worked for the development of unauthorised colonies, as much as AAP has have worked in the last five years.”The Delhi government in a press statement, issued later in the day, said, “The sewer scheme for Kirari and Mundka has been prepared to facilitate the public at large residing in these colonies and villages and achieve better sanitary conditions and further reduce the pollution of the River Yamuna. Under the scheme, there are provisions to lay the sewer lines in the length of about 423km. The scope of work also includes the construction of waste water pumping stations at Prem Nagar, Bhagya Vihar, and Pratap Vihar with capacities of 6.5, 9.0, and 41 MGD, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/made-a-promise-cm-kejriwal-flags-off-work-on-sewer-lines-in-kirari-mundka-101615756800886.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 407 new Covid cases, 2 deaths||The Capital reported over 400 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the fourth day in a row on Sunday. The city added 407 cases to its tally of over 643,000 infections so far since March 2 last year, when the first case was detected.The city has seen an increase in the number of people hospitalised with the infection as well — from 400 people across city hospitals on February 26 to 582 as on Sunday evening, according to the state’s daily health bulletin.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe number of deaths reported each day has also increased slightly. On average, 2.2 deaths were reported each day during the first 14 days of March as compared to 1.3 deaths during the second half of February. The numbers were higher – 2.6 deaths a day on average – during the first half of the month.So far, 10,941 persons have died of the infection.With over 68,000 tests conducted on Saturday – reported a day later in Sunday’s health bulletin – Delhi’s positivity rate stood at 0.60%. The positivity rate is the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested and is indicative of the spread of the infection in a region.Experts believe that a positivity rate of 5% or less maintained over two weeks indicates that the spread of the infection is under control. Although, Delhi’s positivity rate is much lower than this it has been inching upwards since mid-February.The average positivity rate over the first 14 days of March has been 0.49%. In comparison, the average positivity rate during second half of February was 0.28% and 0.23% during the first half of the month, data shows.“The situation is exactly like it was during Diwali when people were out and about, leading to a lot of asymptomatic spread of the infection. The euphoria of having low number of cases in Delhi was short-lived because people have stopped following Covid-19 norms such as social distancing and masking,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.He added, “With the number of cases going down, people stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The city also has a huge floating population — people travelling to other states and other countries. There is still a significant proportion who haven’t developed immunity against the infection. The problem is compounded by the emergence of new variants — some we know of, others we don’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-407-new-covid-cases-2-deaths-101615755976213.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Acquisition of donated land in Mohali’s Aerocity sparks dissent in SGPC ranks||The acquisition of 13 acres of donated land near the Aerocity area by Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has sparked dissent in the local Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) ranks.As the SGPC is said to have already chalked out a resolution for the land acquisition, some members are opposing the same, raising concerns over the rationality of the move.The land in question is part of the 24-acre chunk located in Sainimajra village which was donated around six decades ago by a woman to Gurdwara Amb Sahib in Phase 8 here for the promotion of religious activities and benefit of the local Sikh community. In 1998, the gurdwara came under the jurisdiction of the SGPC.In 2012, with the SGPC’s facilitation, GMADA had acquired 11 acres of land at the cost of ₹19.36 crore, despite stiff opposition from the local SGPC representative. In lieu, the SGPC purchased 59 acres of land in Bagrian village in Malerkotla for ₹19 crore.SGPC member from Mohali, Hardeep Singh, said, “It is sad that the SGPC is again allowing the acquisition of 13 acres of donated land in a prime location of Mohali. Earlier too, they got a compensation of ₹19.36 crore and bought land in far-off Malerkotla, but its value has decreased to ₹9 crore from ₹19 crore. The land swapping should take place within the same locality, else there is no real benefit of the move.”The value of the prime land now is ₹66 crore, he added.SGPC manager for Amb Sahib Gurdwara, Rajinder Singh has already prepared a resolution for giving the 13-acre land to GMADA under the land pooling scheme.Former sarpanch of Sainimajra village, Avatar Singh said that the SGPC should plan a hospital on the remaining 12.5-acre land instead of going for land pooling. “In land pooling, the gurdwara will lose 9.5 acres of land. SGPC will get residential and commercial plots. What will it will do with them? Such plots would be ultimately sold causing further loss of hundreds of crores to the gurdwara,” he said.Gurcharan Singh, a member of Amb Sahib gurdwara body, said that when he SGPC sold 11-acre donated land in 2012, the gurdwara faced a loss of ₹57 crore, and such a mistake should not be repeated as the land purchased in Malerkotla is of no use to the Mohali area sangat.When contacted, SGPC additional secretary Sukhdev Singh said, “We are trying to stop this and will soon hold a meeting with the authorities concerned.”About the local SGPC panel having already prepared the resolution, he said that the final decision would be taken in the executive committee meeting of the SGPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/acquisition-of-donated-land-in-mohali-s-aerocity-sparks-dissent-in-sgpc-ranks-101615751928300.html
15-03-2021||Mumbai||'Sachin Vaze had business partnership firms with Shiv Sena leaders': BJP leader||BJP leader Kirit Somaiya on Sunday alleged that the controversial Mumbai cop Sachin Vaze, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), had business partnership firms with Shiv Sena leaders. Somaiya also demanded the sacking of Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh saying he was backing the tainted cop.Somaiya said that Vaze had more than six businesses in which some of his partners were Shiv Sena leaders. “Vaze had a very close relationship with a top Sena leader. In addition, he has formed partnership firms dealing in construction and infrastructure with Sena leaders,” said Somaiya. He alleged that Vaze was a partner in firms like Multibuild Infraprojects Limited, Techlegal Solutions Pvt Ltd, DGNe Multimedia Limited, of which the first two had folded up and only the last one is functional.He also named local Sena leaders like Sanjay Mashilkar and Vijay Gawai as partners in these firms. “How can an assistant police inspector form so many companies? Where did he get the resources from? This needs to be checked by the NIA,” said the BJP leader.Mashilkar, who headed the Sena’s local unit for 13 years, defended his partnership in Multibuild Infraprojects Private Limited. “It was a legal private limited company and we fulfilled all the norms. It is not a crime to partner with a cop and we even disclosed it,” he said. “We however could not get business and hence wound up the company within one-and-a-half months of its formation,” added Mashilkar.Similarly, Vijay Gawai, who had contested the BMC polls in 2017 on Sena ticket from Mulund, said there was no wrong in tying up with a cop. “Kirit Somaiya’s is just playing dirty politics and trying to mislead the people. We formed a firm but this company was shut down, it did not work well,” said Gawai.Somaiya also said it was also surprising that a cop from such a lower rank can get direct access to the police commissioner. “This all seems too suspicious,” he added.The NIA on Saturday arrested Sachin Vaze, who is at the centre of the investigation in connection with the mysterious death of Mansukh Hiren, an auto parts dealer linked to the SUV found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 with 20 sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter. On Sunday, the NIA court remanded him in NIA custody till March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-had-business-partnership-firms-with-shiv-sena-leaders-bjp-leader-101615750097136.html

Addressing the gathering, PSGPC general secretary Ameer Singh appealed to the Akal Takht jathedar to resolve the issue and call a group of Sikh scholars to implement the calendar’s original version which he termed as a “symbol of distinct identity of the Sikh religion”. The SGPC had rolled back the original version introduced in 2003 under pressure from Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Khalsa-led Sant Samaj, which was in alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) during the 2010 SGPC polls. In the name of amendments, the original version was replaced with the new one which was modified as per the Bikrami calendar, but its nomenclature ‘Nanaksahi Calendar’ was not changed. “Giani Harpreet Singh during his visit to Pakistan had assured us that he would constitute a committee of scholars to address the issue. If he is facing any problem, we are ready to host a meeting of scholars at Nankana Sahib. The issue has to be resolved at the earliest possible,” said PSGPC chief Satwant Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-follow-original-nanakshahi-calendar-not-amended-version-says-pakistan-gurdwara-body-101615750968787.html

The commission will take a strict note in case of a complaint, he asserted. The issue rocked the budget session of the Vidhan Sabha that concluded recently. Nearly 7,000 students are awaiting handing over of their degrees by their colleges, the House was informed. Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh, Sampla said, “The national commission works independently of the state panel as the SC students can take up their cases directly. Also, efforts are made to being bring to an end manual scavenging that is going on with impunity in some parts of Punjab. Besides, there is a pendency of 67,000 cases of atrocities on Dalits with the national commission. We will make sure the cases are settled in a time-bound manner. The pendency of different cases in Punjab is 5,000 and I am sure the state panel will also expedite redressal of these cases.” The national commission has a regional office in Chandigarh which caters to Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Chandigarh. ‘Farmers heckling me are anti-Dalit’On opposition he is facing in Punjab from the state farmers, Sampla said heckling him as chairman of the commission means that farmers and their leaders are opposed to the Dalits. “I was chased and gheraoed by farmers and others. This is not the right way to protest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/institutes-can-t-withhold-degrees-of-dalit-students-over-pending-fee-sampla-101615750912852.html

Thus, the elected councillors have yet to take oath.The elections were held on February 14 and the results were announced on February 18.In the absence of a House of representatives, decisions for several development works and approval of MC budget for the year 2021-22 remain pending.In the results declared, Congress registered a landslide victory by winning 37 of the 50 seats. The Azad Group-Aam Aadmi Party combine clinched 10 seats, while the remaining three were bagged by independent candidates.When contacted, local bodies principal secretary Ajoy Kumar Sinha said, “We are hopeful of issuing the notification in a week’s time. It got delayed due to the assembly session.”Newly elected councillor Harjinder Kaur Baidwan (Azad Group) said it has happened for the first time that the state government has not issued the notification even after 25 days. On the other hand, people are suffering as civic works are not being done, she said.The two front runners for the post are Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, brother of Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, and former senior deputy mayor Rishiv Jain, who won the elections for the third time in a row. While Amarjeet succeeded from ward 10, Rishiv swept ward 20, both on Congress tickets.For Amarjeet, who is into the liquor business and director of SAS Nagar Central Cooperative Bank Limited, it is a first win.“As of now, we have not decided on any name. We are waiting for the notification and will comply with whatever all councillors and party high command decide,” said Sidhu.A senior Congress councillor, wanting anonymity, said, “Most of the party councillors are in favour of Amarjeet Singh Sidhu, while Rishiv Jain will be again given charge as senior deputy mayor.

DSP (HQ) Sultan Singh further recommended that a departmental action should be taken against inspector Hamir Singh posted as SHO PS Baldev Nagar for not taking any legal action against leaders and members of Bharatiya Kisan Union. For the above misconduct and negligence, Singh is hereby placed under suspension with immediate effect,” read the order issued by Ambala senior superintendent of police Hamid Akhtar.Singh was among several other station in-charges, along with DSP Sultan Singh, who were on duty during the protests that took place from Inco Chowk to the MLA’s residence in Prem Nagar. The protesters had allegedly raised objectionable slogans and burnt the MLA’s effigy outside his residence, for his alleged derogatory remarks about farmers and for voting against the trust vote moved by the Congress in the assembly on Wednesday.Sources said the MLA, who had issued video statements clarifying his statement, was miffed with the police for letting the protesters reach his residence.

15-03-2021||Chandigarh||To push pending works, Chandigarh MC allots ₹80 lakh for each ward||Pending development works in various wards are likely to get a push as the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has earmarked ₹80 lakh for each ward for the financial year 2021-2022.In the 2020-21 fiscal, the councillors were not granted any funds for ward development owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent MC financial distress. Due to this, several works were hit.Confirming the development, municipal commissioner KK Yadav said, “The MC has allocated ₹80 lakh each under ward development funds for the coming fiscal.”In 2019, the ward development fund amount was doubled from ₹40 lakh per year to ₹80 lakh per year. The mayor gets ₹2 crore per year, which can be spent on the development of any ward. While the councillors’ funds are carried forward for five years, those of mayor’s get lapsed each year.The MC has even started the tendering process for carrying out works under the ward development funds, said chief engineer Shailender Singh. Last week, for instance, the MC floated tenders for providing and fixing outdoor gynmastic equipment in Sector 46 parks besides installing benches in various green belts of sectors 39 and 40.While these tenders were floated in this fiscal, the work would be completed in the next fiscal. “The tendering process takes time and works are likely to be started this fiscal. But, the bills for these works will be generated in the next fiscal,” said the MC chief.However, the councillors are not so hopeful of getting much work done even after the fund allocation.“The MC is yet to even complete the works which were requested in 2019. In January this year, we had submitted a priority list of works having a budget of ₹30 lakh. But even those couldn’t be carried out. It is also questionable that with a ₹700 crore deficit budget for the 2021-2022 financial year, how the MC plans to allocate ₹80 lakh ward development fund,” said Congress councillor Satish Kainth.Councillors have also come under repeated criticism for failing to spend the allocated money. Only three councillors could spend the funds allotted to them in 2019.“The councillors either don’t utilise their funds or spend the money on frivolous items, which doesn’t benefit the residents. With elections due this year, we expect them to speed up the spending, but they must focus on the projects which are pending for several years despite of persistent demands from the residents,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/to-push-pending-works-chandigarh-mc-allots-80-lakh-for-each-ward-101615750429159.html

15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Coming up in Chandigarh, a policy to push cycling as a habit||Hoping to push cycling as a preferred alternative to driving in a city teeming with cars, Chandigarh Smart City Ltd has readied a Cycling Policy.To be notified only after approval from the UT administrator, the policy envisages major upgrade of the city’s cycling infrastructure, including creation of dedicated cycle underpasses, mandatory roof-covered cycle parking in offices and giving priority to cyclists in traffic.A range of incentives will also be given by government departments, such as leave credits, monetary benefits and facilities to employees, who opt for cycling.“Cycling Policy can be a powerful tool for the government to encourage citizens to take up cycling. The city has the highest per capita ownership of motorised vehicles in the country, which is creating severe parking and environmental issues. Promotion of cycling as a means of travelling can contribute towards sustainable urban travel,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL), which has formulated the draft policy.Chandigarh currently has cycle tracks running across 200km. About 60km of the cycling network has been identified for underpasses near V-2 (like Madhya Marg, Dakshin Marg and Jan Marg) and V-3 roads (roads around sectors). In addition, the existing cycle tracks along V3 roads will be improved and provided with proper integration, along with zebra crossings near intersections, the draft policy states.MORE PARKING SPACE FOR CYCLESProvision of a large number of cycle bays will be made at every station and parking lot, much more than those for cars. “The parking will be created in such a manner so as to enable a quick and comfortable flow of bicycle traffic. This will include provision of cycle boxes at all signals, along with four-second head start for cyclists every time the signal turns green, facilitating their safe movement across junctions,” Sharma said.INCENTIVES, SUBSIDIESEach government office will have a separate policy for their office to encourage commuting to work by cycle.Employees, who adopt cycling, will get special incentives like half-day leave for every seven days cycled. Monetary incentives for particular distance travelled by cycle will also be offered. The policy also advocates commendation certificates, awards and other recognitions for cycle users in every department. The private sector firms will also be encouraged to give similar incentives to their workforce.Employer-based health and wellness programmes will be created, which will incorporate subsidised annual memberships for employees. Besides, the policy advocates cash incentives, shower rooms, space for drying cycling clothes and borrowable cycles for short trips from the office. Every office will also have to provide covered parking space.INTEGRATING ROAD NETWORK, TRANSPORT ROUTESThe draft policy lays emphasis on integration of cycle tracks with various modes of public transport for better connectivity. “An integrated payment system that allows use of both transit and bicycle-sharing system will be the way forward. By providing real-time information to commuters about multiple public transport modes at bus stops, railway stations and public bicycle sharing stations, integration can be achieved,” said Sharma.“Cycle tracks should be set up in such a manner that they are well connected with work, entertainment, commercial and green areas, so that cyclists have a facility for smooth/easy/safe access to above spaces,” reads the draft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/coming-up-in-chandigarh-a-policy-to-push-cycling-as-a-habit-101615750128254.html

Somaiya also claimed that Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh was backing the tainted cop and thus must be sacked.“Vaze had a very close relationship with a top Sena leader. He has also formed partnership firms dealing in construction and infrastructure with Sena leaders,” said Somaiya, adding that the cop was a partner in firms such as Multibuild Infraprojects Limited, Techlegal Solutions Pvt Ltd and DGNe Multimedia Limited, of which only the last one is currently functional.He also claimed that local Sena leaders such as Sanjay Mashilkar and Vijay Gawai are Vaze’s partners in these firms. “How can an assistant police inspector form so many companies? Where did he get the resources from? This needs to be checked by NIA,” said the BJP leader.Mashilkar, who headed the Sena’s local unit for 13 years, defended his partnership in Multibuild Infraprojects Private Limited and said, “It was a legal private limited company and we fulfilled all the norms. It is not a crime to partner with a cop, and we had even disclosed about it,” he said. “We, however, could not get business, and hence wound up the company within one-and-a- half months of its formation,” added Mashilkar.Gawai, who had contested the civic polls in 2017 from Mulund, said there was no wrong in tying up with a cop. “Somaiya is just playing dirty politics and is trying to mislead the people. We formed a firm, but it did not work well and later shut down,” said Gawai.Somaiya also said it was also surprising that a cop from a lower rank can get direct access to the police commissioner. “This all seems too suspicious,” he added.Vaze, who is at the centre of the investigation in connection with the mysterious death of Mansukh Hiran, an auto parts dealer whose SUV was found parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home on February 25 with 20 gelatin sticks and a threatening letter, was remanded in NIA custody till March 25 on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kirit-somaiya-mumbai-cop-ran-firms-in-partnership-with-shiv-sena-leaders-101615750009638.html

The suspects, according to the BSF officials, were roaming near the barbed wire fence, ostensibly to clear a consignment of drugs that was to be thrown from across the border by Pakistani smugglers. One of the accomplices of the arrested accused managed to flee, said the officials, adding that “one of the arrested men was injured in the firing”. The arrested men were identified as Bikramjit Singh, Vijay Singh and Sarabjit Singh of Kakkar village and Navjot Singh of Dug Dogar village in Amritsar. Sarabjit received a bullet injury in his left thigh, said the officials. “At around 12.30 am, the personnel of 22 battalion observed some suspicious movements near border outpost (BoP) Fatehabad. Five persons were noticed approaching towards the fence. The accused were challenged to stop by our troops, but to no avail. Sensing danger, a shot was fired by our constable, which hit to one of the accused. After this, our team arrested four of the five persons, including the injured one. The firth person managed to flee from the spot,” said a senior BSF official. He said the injured was rushed to a hospital for his treatment. “Our troops had also observed two suspects across the barbed wire fence. Five rounds were fired towards Pakistan side, but the suspects managed to retreat,” he said.“Our search operation is still underway. It appears the arrested men had come to collect some drugs consignment that was to be push in from Pakistan side,” he said, adding that the accused would be handed over to the Amritsar-rural police for the further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-nabs-4-suspected-drug-smugglers-near-pak-border-in-amritsar-101615749890574.html

Members of one of the groups had been admitted in the emergency ward, after getting their medico-legal report (MLR), when the other group barged in and started firing indiscriminately. A bullet hit Dr Bhavneet on the left thigh, but he is out of danger. Police said about 10:15pm on Saturday, quarrel over an enmity started between Rahul Nagi group and Sunny Sahota, Gattu, Raju, Gayin in the Islamabad area. Rahul and his brother approached the cantonment police station for the registration of a case. The police had then sent the duo to the civil hospital for preparing their medico-legal report (MLR). Rahul and his brother were admitted to the civil hospital’s emergency ward after their MLR had been prepared.“The accused Sunny Sahota, Raju alias Bhindi, Vijay Pardhan, Aman alias Chinu, Gattu, Barinder Singh alias Raghu and some six-seven unidentified persons reached the hospital and started fighting with Rahul and his family again. Our guards at the hospital and Dr Bhavneet tried to stop the accused. Sahota fired from his pistol and another of his accomplices also fired. During the firing, Dr Bhavneet got injured,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) investigation, Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar.Bhullar added that three accused, Aman, Vijay and Barinder, had been arrested. “Due to the red-alert, only one guard was present on duty in hospital on Saturday night. Our DCP-law and order has assured doctors that we will step up security.” Police added Sahota had been facing several cases under the Excise Act. The DCP said, “It is yet to be ascertained whether the two weapons used for firing were licensed. Preliminary inquiry suggests that no arm license was issued to the accused booked in the case.”Punjab Civil Medical Services Association member Dr Jaspreet Singh said the incident raised questions about how miscreants can get the courage to carry weapons at public places. The doctors association of Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts have condemned the incident and held responsible to the police administration for failing to ensure the security of the district hospital. They have threatened to go on strike, barring providing emergency services, until the issue of security of the hospital is sorted out.Rakesh Sharma, chairman, Employees’ Welfare Association of the health department, said police had ignored their pleas for security a number of times. “When the police commissioner had to visit the hospital for covid-19 vaccination, over 20 police guards were deployed, but hospital staff has no security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doctor-injured-in-firing-during-clash-at-amritsar-civil-hospital-101615749889392.html

Beginning with Palghar mob lynching to the death case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, to the allegations against its two ministers in connection with alleged crimes against women, the government has been at the receiving end. Now it is facing flak over the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, whose SUV was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home with explosives last month. Hiran’s death came at a time was Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis in the Assembly said that the businessman needed to be protected, as he could throw some light on the case. The issue has become the latest headache for Uddhav Thackeray after Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was arrested for his alleged involvement by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday night. The Palghar lynching case, in which two seers and their driver were beaten to death, as well as Rajput’s death, led to an uproar in social media over the state’s handling of the cases, with Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing MVA it of suppressing the facts. While the government kept insisting that the probe in both the cases was being conducted in an impartial manner, it was the allegations against its two ministers that caused it major embarrassment. Social justice minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde, in the second week of January, faced allegations of rape by a budding Bollywood singer, who was also younger sister of a woman with whom the minister had admitted to be in a relationship. Though the singer later withdrew her complaint amid much political drama, the minister had almost lost his chair. A month later, Shiv Sena leader and forest minister Sanjay Rathod’s name cropped up in a case related to the suicide of a 23-year-old Pune woman. About a dozen audio clips of the mobile conversation related to the case went viral with the Opposition alleging that one of the voices in the clips was that of Rathod. The minister had to resign from the cabinet on the eve of the budget session that started on March 1. The 10-day long session ended under the shadow of the controversy over Vaze’s alleged involvement in the explosives case, with Fadnavis alleging that the cop was directly connected to Hiran’s death. Buckling under Opposition’s pressure, the assistant police inspector was shunted out of the crime branch, though chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had defended him by saying that Vaze should not be “hanged” before the trial. Fadnavis had taunted Thackeray and said Vaze does not need any lawyer as CM has himself taken up the job to defend him. Three cases in two months The three cases – two pertaining to the ministers and Vaze – have damaged MVA government’s image, according to its own ministers. The government faced many controversies during its 15-month tenure, but these two months are believed to be really troublesome for it, they said. “The wounded BJP left no opportunity to corner the Thackeray government ever since it was formed on November 28, 2019, after the decades-long Sena-BJP alliance came to an end. Be it Rajput’s death case, the Palghar lynching, handling of the Covid-19 pandemic or loan waiver, power bills, BJP leaders were very aggressive while raising the issues. However, in Rathod and Vaze’s cases, the Opposition succeeded in pushing the government to the wall. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar had to admit that it was the pressure from the Opposition that led to Vaze’s transfer, said a senior NCP minister. The minister said that Munde could save his ministership because of the political strategy adopted to turn around the perception against him. “At one moment, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had admitted it to be a serious case, hinting that the minister will have to resign. But as more people, including a former legislator, coming to Munde’s rescue by claiming that the woman had blackmailed them too, helped the minister save his chair.” Some behind-the-curtain damage control was reportedly done by NCP and Munde, which helped him retain his position. However, Rathod’s damage control management was poor, and getting linked in a woman’s death case proved to be problematic for him. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The immoral relations of politicians outside their wedlock are not accepted by women in the society. Women voters have been playing a major role in elections, as was seen in Bihar and other states. These two [ministers’] cases may cost dear to ruling parties in the coming elections. The Vaze case was mishandled by the state government. There was no reason for CM to give loaded statements like ‘Vaze can’t be hanged before trial’. Secondly, in Rathod and Vaze’s cases, the action appeared to have been taken only after Pawar’s intervention. This has been creating a poor picture for Thackeray, who is behind the steering wheel.” Shiv Sena’s south Mumbai parliamentarian Arvind Sawant said: “I do not think the MVA government has suffered any setback because of these cases. There have been more serious cases in the country, be it Karnataka minister’s latest sex scandal or Hathras-Unnao cases in Uttar Pradesh. Rathod and Munde’s cases are their personal matters. In Vaze’s case, NIA is conducting a probe. Let the truth come to the fore and action will be taken. Also, why are questions not raised on [MP] Mohan Delkar’s suicide, which is a more serious case? We should also remember that there was ruckus created in Rajput’s death case, but the CBI found nothing.” State minority affairs minister from NCP Nawab Malik said Munde’s case was a family matter and it had nothing to do with public perception. “The case was withdrawn by the complainant. In Rathod and Vaze’s cases, the investigations are on, and truth will come to the fore once the probes are completed. In a democracy, the Opposition has its own importance, but Vaze’s transfer was not because of the Opposition’s pressure.” Poor handling, lack of coordination Insiders said that the major difference between cases related to Munde and Rathod was their handling and that the former forest minister’s case was an example of the poor crisis management by the ruling parties. Leaders from the ruling alliance said that Munde responded to the allegations within hours and ensured that the charges were withdrawn in the next few days. “On the contrary, Rathod sulked for two weeks after the controversy broke out and emerged only to commit another mistake by gathering a huge crowd at Poharadevi temple [a religious place of his Banjara community] when his party chief and CM Thackeray had banned social gatherings. BJP raked up the issue in these two weeks to a level that the general perception went against the government, said a former Sena minister.The three ruling parties are also not found to be on the same page on many occasions, and it was made evident during Vaze’s case. When Fadnavis levelled allegations of Vaze’s involvement in Hiran’s case on Tuesday, NCP leaders had initially agreed for Vaze’s transfer, but the CM put his foot down and refused any action against the officer. This led to several adjournments in the Assembly and pandemonium. The house proceedings resumed only after the government announced Vaze’s transfer. Insiders feel that the criticism and controversy could have been avoided had the officer been shunted out immediately after the issue came up. “The ruling parties, in retaliation, raised the suicides cases of interior designer Anvay Naik and Delkar, who was Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP. In the 2018 Naik case, the victim’s family had blamed the Fadnavis government of suppressing the case, while Delkar had named a BJP leader from Gujarat, holding him responsible for the suicide. This may have helped us in pushing BJP on the back foot, but the seriousness of the Hiran case does not recede,” the former Sena minister said. The leader said that ruling parties fail to pre-empt the controversies and plan accordingly. “BJP has an edge over us in picking up the issues. They miss no time in strategising and attacking the government. Be it Palghar lynching, Rajput or Rathod’s cases, the Opposition has always been aggressive. But the over-aggressive approach seems to going against them, and is playing as an advantage of the MVA government,” he said. The Congress, the third MVA partner, has distanced itself from all these issues to avoid any embarrassment. A Congress leader said that the damage to MVA’s image is unlikely to be reflected as there are no major elections anytime soon. “Moreover, these cases are mostly related to the other two ruling parties. By maintaining distance, we made sure that they directly do not hamper us,” the leader said. Malik said that the ruling parties will take more precautions for better coordination in future. “Some of the issues such as the one related to Rathod are to be tackled at the party level as it’s their internal matter. But yes, when it comes to MVA, we need to have better coordination in future,” he said. Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “We have been raising issues of public interest from beginning, be it Palghar lynching, SSR death or but till then the general public had sympathy for this government. Now, the people have realised the failure of the MVA government. They have realised that people here are not safe and the government is not interested at all to ensure it. Vaze’s is not the only case to establish that the law and order in the state has completely collapsed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/spate-of-criminal-cases-puts-maharashtra-govt-in-tight-spot-leaders-wary-of-image-101615749650516.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Radiology diagnostic services in a shambles in HP’s medical colleges||Radiology and imaging services in different medical colleges of Himachal Pradesh are in a shambles as several machines remain dysfunctional despite the management spending crores on equipment repair. Interestingly, in some cases, the cost of repair has exceeded the actual cost of equipment.A computed tomography (CT) scan machine was installed at Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College and Hospital in 2008 for ₹3.31 crore. However, so far, around ₹2.61 crore has been spent on its repair and the machine is still out of order. This was pointed out by Palampur legislator Ashish Butail, who had raised a question in this regard, in the assembly. The government had tabled a detailed answer to his question.Similarly, a Colour Doppler machine worth ₹29.25 lakh was installed in 2008 and its repair cost has reached ₹20.86 lakh. However, it has been lying dysfunctional. Of three 500-MA x-ray machines installed at a cost of ₹64.40 lakh, only one is functional despite ₹34.87 lakh being spent on repairs.In the state’s biggest health institution, Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC), Shimla, all radiology equipment is in working condition but authorities have spent more on the repair of some machines than their actual cost. For instance, the management has spent ₹30 lakhs on the repair of the diagnostic 1000 MA x-ray machine purchased for ₹5 lakh in 2009.In 2010, ₹2.76 crore had been spent on repair of a CT Scan-64 whose cost in 2010 was ₹55 lakh. Similarly, an MRI scan machine was installed at a cost of ₹70 lakh, while its repair cost has mounted to ₹2.68 crore.A similar pattern was seen at Nahan Medical College. So far, authorities have spent ₹1.67 crore on repairing a CT scan machine that was purchased in 2007. However, the machine has been lying defunct since it malfunctioned in September 2020. It had been purchased for ₹95 lakh.The CT scan machine at Hamirpur Medical College has been out of order since October, 2020. So far, ₹96.56 lakh has been spent on the repair of the machine that cost ₹95.27 lakh.In Chamba Medical College, the CT scan machine has not worked since 2016 despite ₹82.74 lakh being spent on its repair.Butail said that this was enough to reflect the crumbling health services in the state and the problems faced by the people, who have either spent lakhs of rupees on diagnostic services in private hospitals or have been forced to go to other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/radiology-diagnostic-services-in-a-shambles-in-hp-s-medical-colleges-101615749649458.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir announces to contest assembly polls from Jalalabad||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday announced to contest from Jalalabad segment in the forthcoming assembly polls.Sukhbir, a sitting MP from the Ferozepur Lok Sabha seat, announced it after launching a political programme “Punjab Mangda Jawab” organised at the grain market of Jalalabad town in Fazilka district.A former deputy chief minister, Sukhbir, had represented Jalalabad segment thrice in 2009 byelection, 2012, and 2017. In 2019, he quit as MLA after being elected to the Parliament.Meanwhile, the party leadership announced to escalate political drive against the Congress regime at a rally. It was the first major political programme after Punjab witnessed a surge in Covid-19 cases.At the event, pandemic norms were violated as hardly any leader or audience was wearing a face mask and social distancing was not followed.Blowing the poll bugle with a blistering attack against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sukhbir said four years of the Congress was a period of brazen misrule and unkept promises.Farmers, who had been promised a complete loan waiver for farmers worth ₹90,000 crore, ended with an additional burden of ₹15,000 crore loan because they did not pay their instalments believing the electoral promise made by the CM.“Similarly, youth have been tricked into filling forms for jobs which materialised. No one received ₹2,500 per month unemployment allowance promised by the Congress party in the run up to the 2017 assembly elections,” he added.Addressing the gathering, the SAD chief charged the Congress and AAP for fabricating charges of sacrileges against the Badal family under a political conspiracy.He said the party would introduce minimum support price (MSP) on milk, fruits and vegetables, besides paying commission to arhtiyas for crop procurement if the Centre abolishes the traditional system.Sukhbir counted development projects initiated by him to nurture Jalalabad constituency during the Akali regime.“Congress MLA Raminder Awla had promised to start projects from family-managed industrial houses in Jalalabad but people feel cheated by the leader. Congress could not count any major development initiated by it in the last four years,” said Sukhbir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-announces-to-contest-assembly-polls-from-jalalabad-101615749648363.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda Fort: Life, glory to return to historic Rani Mahal before monsoon||The maiden restoration work of the historic Rani Mahal, a principal area of the 1,500-year-old Bathinda or Govindgarh Fort, is expected to be completed before the onset of monsoon in July.Popularly known as Quila Mubarak, considered as the oldest surviving fort in the country, it is believed to be the place where Razia Sultana, the only woman emperor to rule Delhi, was imprisoned by Malik Altunia, the then governor and her husband.Archaeological Survey of India’s (ASI’s) conservation assistant at the fort Tarak Singh said on Sunday that ₹17 lakh has been spent to conserve Rani Mahal, located above the only entrance gate, in the last one-and-half-years.“It is believed that Razia (who ruled Delhi from 1236 to 1240) had escaped from the same Rani Mahal. The roof of the Mahal, with its beautiful murals, collapsed after the rain a few years ago and outer walls have been eroding extensively during every monsoon. Work had to be suspended during the lockdown, but now restoration has been expedited,” said Singh.The fort is located in the heart of the city and according to popular belief, a river used to flow in the modern-day Bathinda city that is now a semi-arid region. The fort was considered essentially a military outpost used by rulers at different times of history.The ASI-protected heritage site was built by Raja Dab in the sixth century AD as a defence measure against the invading Hunas. The fort was visited by the 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh in 1705. To mark this event, two gurdwaras were built inside the fort, including one built by Karam Singh, the erstwhile ruler of Patiala.“It would not have possible to construct a massive structure without a huge water source in the vicinity of Bathinda. The monument is made of mud bricks and with rain, the exposed parts erode, thus posing threat to the monument,” said Singh, in-charge of the heritage building.“Since the fort was located very strategically, rulers used and conserved the fort for their armies. However, alteration in the basic design of this mud fort was not possible and it has made the structure vulnerable to deteriorate with the passage of time,” he added.There are 32 bastions and seven of them have crashed in the absence of restoration activities.“A comprehensive conservation plan has been made and it will be executed in a phased manner. Availability of expert masons for conservation is a huge challenge in such projects but we are working to complete to protect the heritage,” said the ASI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-fort-life-glory-to-return-to-historic-rani-mahal-before-monsoon-101615749528545.html

15-03-2021||Mumbai||Antilia security scare: Opposition is trying to destabilise Maharashtra: Govt||The politics over the security scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and arrest of Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze heated up in Maharashtra on Sunday, with the ruling Shiv Sena calling the takeover of the case by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) an attempt to “destabilise the state”, while the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged a deeper conspiracy that needs to be investigated and called for resignation of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Shiv Sena MP and chief spokesperson of the party Sanjay Raut said repeated attempts were made to take over cases being investigated by city or state police to demoralise the police force. Raut said there was no need for a central agency to take over the case when the city police, which has dealt with several key cases, was investigating it. Congress leaders also expressed concern if there was politics behind NIA’s entry. “The manner in which the NIA came to Mumbai for just 20 gelatin sticks [begs the question] – Did they want to investigate a terror angle or just wanted to arrest an officer called Sachin Vaze and settle their political score? Because, this officer, some months ago, had arrested their dear TV anchor in connection with a suicide-death case and investigated the TRP scam,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai. The Sena leader said such tactics by the Centre are to put pressure on the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. “The Mumbai Police is capable of investigating any case. But they want to enter the state and try to destabilise it, demoralise the police and display that there is terror and pressure of the Centre… There was no need for a central team; Mumbai Police can unearth a conspiracy, if there is one,” Raut said. Meanwhile, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said both NIA and anti-terrorism squad (ATS) are probing the case and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings. “The bomb scare case related to industrialist Mukesh Ambani and murder of Mansukh Hiran is being probed by the NIA as well as the ATS,” Deshmukh told reporters. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar chose not to comment on the issue. “I can’t speak much about it, as it is a small and local issue. It is also not about the state government’s policy,” Pawar said in his response at Baramati in Pune on Sunday. BJP leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis alleged that those backing Vaze should be investigated thoroughly. In Pune, he said many other names are expected to come out in the investigation, as it is a big plot. “I am of the opinion that the case is not limited to Sachin Vaze… It is a big plot and many more names will now be revealed during the investigation… It is just the beginning…Now, the NIA has sought Vaze’s custody for parking the car [outside Ambani’s residence], but the agency has got evidence and links on Hiran’s murder as well and I am expecting action on that front soon,” he said. Fadnavis also questioned reinstatement of Vaze from suspension. “Shiv Sena leaders were asking for his reinstatement when I was the chief minister and also holding charge of the home department. I sought AG’s opinion and he orally told me that it would lead to disrespect of the high court as Vaze was suspended as per their order. This (MVA) government reinstated him after coming to power on the grounds that they even required suspended officers to fight the Covid-19 pandemic,” Fadnavis said. He also said that unwarranted support and trust by the state government led Vaze to think he could do anything and so he allegedly planned and executed this incident near Antilia. “The crime intelligence unit is the most important wing of the Mumbai Police and the post of its head is being led by a police inspector level officer. But as soon as Vaze was reinstated, the existing police officer was transferred as Vaze, a junior level officer, was appointed to that post. I don’t know why he was getting so much support from the government. Was that because he had joined Shiv Sena or there was some other reason behind it,” he asked. He denied making any demand for President’s rule in the state. “Who is making the government unstable -- those executing such a plot or those [the Centre] taking action against it?” Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said they suspect the entry of the NIA is part of politics on part of the BJP. “Governments keep changing, but the police force remains the same everywhere. Maharashtra and Mumbai Police are famous for its work, world over. Mumbai Police is equated to the Scotland Yard. Care should be taken not to make their morale low. We trust our police force and they are capable… With the Central agency taking over, we suspect if there is politics in it. We are concerned about it, but since the investigation is on, we would not like to comment further,” he said, in Ahmednagar. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole alleged that Maharashtra Assembly was “used or misused” by the BJP on behalf of Ambani. “Like I said [in the Assembly], they want permission for a helipad on the rooftop. Secondly, they want Z plus security for each of their family members. And thirdly, they want to create a wave of sympathy for them, as they are at the forefront of the farmers’ stir.” He further added that the car found near Antilia was a kilometre away and there were no active explosives in it. “The Centre is expert at diverting any issue… The manner in which Sachin Vaze is made a villain and he is being investigated... they can do any tests they want on him; they don’t need the state’s permission,” Patole said regarding the BJP’s demand to carry out a narco-analysis test on Vaze. BJP leader Prasad Lad said, “The chief minister should take moral responsibility and tender his resignation. He had asked if Sachin Vaze was Osama Bin Laden. The NIA should also take over the Mansukh Hiran case and get to the bottom of the conspiracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-security-scare-opposition-is-trying-to-destabilise-maharashtra-govt-101615749228566.html
15-03-2021||Chandigarh||Corporation polls litmus test of Jai Ram govt’s popularity||Seen as a precursor to the Assembly elections, the municipal corporation polls scheduled for April 7 will be a litmus test for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and will help gauge the popularity of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur . The Himachal state election commission has announced its schedule for the four municipal corporations — Mandi, Solan, Palampur and Dharamshala. The saffron party recently amended the Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, to allow elections on party symbols. This will be the third time that MC polls in the state will be held on party symbols. MC elections were held on party symbols in 1997 in Shimla and then again in 2012. Despite being in power, BJP lost both seats of mayor and deputy mayor to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). However, when Congress came to power in 2012, it did away with holding elections on party symbols. This time, BJP’s cadre and leaders suggested that elections be held on party symbols despite factionalism within the party making waves. The ruling party, which had begun its preparations well in advance, was quick to amend the Municipal Corporation Act. Saffron party’s national president Jagat Prakash Nadda had attended the party’s three-day meeting in Dharamshala in February. It is learnt that Nadda had emphasised on the importance of winning elections to the corporation. The party, too, seems to be taking the elections seriously as chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who had been on an inauguration spree in Mandi, laid the foundation stone of projects worth ₹17 crore. Rifts within the party a challenge There has been a rift within the Mandi chapter of the BJP since local legislator Anil Sharma was compelled to give up his cabinet berth after Congress fielded his son Ashray Sharma in the Lok Sabha elections. The heavyweight has distanced himself from the party’s activities and the CM since then. Leaders owing allegiance to former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal have begun asserting themselves. Dhumal, who had been lying low after his unexpected defeat in the Assembly elections, is reportedly touring his home district Hamirpur. Dhumal’s camp is unhappy with Jai Ram as they feel they have been sidelined . The BJP has deputed its stalwart leaders, known for their organisational skills at the forefront of the election campaign. They include Mahender Singh for Mandi, Rajeev Bindal for Solan, Rakesh Pathania in Dharamshala and Vikram Thakur in Palampur. BJP has not been able to deliver: RathoreNot one to be left behind, the Congress too has deputed its vanguard to oversee the elections. Congress’ Himachal chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore said, “The MC elections are certainly a litmus test for the ruling party. They have not been able to deliver. Congress has deputed its observers for selecting candidates and a decision on candidates will be taken at a meeting of the Pradesh election committee.”  “BJP claimed victories in elections to the Panchayati Raj Institutions though elections were not held on symbols but this election will be the real litmus test for them. We welcome elections on party symbols,” said Rathore . Congress is likely to announce its candidates on March 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corporation-polls-litmus-test-of-jai-ram-govt-s-popularity-101615749108282.html

They claimed to have recovered multiple fake identify proofs and anti-national literature from his possession.According to a statement by the UP STF, the accused Mohammed Rashid Ali of Siddharthnagar was arrested from Basti’s Moodghat crossing when he was about to board a bus to Lucknow to move towards Mumbai with the intent of meeting other members of his organisation and plan out nefarious activities against the country.The STF was trying to trace his location after his name surfaced as the training commander of the PFI’s hit squad following the arrest of Asad Badruddin, the alleged national head of the hit squad, and his accomplice Feroz Khan, from Lucknow’s Gudamba area on February 16, said an official of the STF. “Earlier, the STF had information that Rashid was about to move to Mumbai on March 11. But we failed to locate him as he had changed his plan. On Sunday, we were tipped off again about his movement from Basti and he was arrested,” he said, adding: “A bundle of pamphlets containing anti-national content, two Aadhaar cards (including one fake) and a CD containing anti-national content was recovered from him.”The official said Rashid was involved in the selection of youths for the hit squad and trained them in handling firearms and explosives. “We are investigating about his background and other people who were in touch with him for the past few months, as the hit squad was planning to trigger blasts in different parts of the state and the country,” he stated.The official said Rashid had been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 121-A (planning to commit terror blasts), 420 (fraud), 467 (forging documents), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy). He said an FIR had been registered with the city kotwali of Basti.Earlier, the STF had claimed to have foiled a plan to carry out terror attacks after the arrest of Asad Badruddin and Firoz Khan and recovery of 16 high explosive devices, a pistol and live cartridges from them. Badruddin and Khan were natives of Kerala and had planned to carry out explosions near functions of Hindu organisations on Basant Panchami, and other strategic locations in UP, said officials.The PFI, which claimed to be a social youth organisation based in Kerala, had been on the radar of UP police since 2019 when many of its members, across the state, were arrested in connection with the violent anti CAA-NRC protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pfis-training-commander-nabbed-in-basti-101615748987565.html

Such structures could be seen everywhere in Ayodhya – even in narrow lanes and bylanes. After clearance from the state government, these will be demolished, said officials of the district administration. The Ayodhya Municipal Corporation also helped the district administration in identifying religious structures blocking roads. It may be pointed out that the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court had ordered the UP government to remove all religious structures (constructed after January 1, 2011) causing hindrance to traffic. In compliance of the HC’s order, the state government ordered that no religious construction be allowed on roads, lanes, footpaths or along national and state highways. Last week, in a communiqué to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates, all police officers, the government ordered that all such religious constructions made on public property after January 1, 2011 be identified and removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/list-of-religious-structures-on-public-roads-in-ayodhya-sent-to-up-govt-101615748747536.html

AIADMK promises free washing machines, cable connection||The ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) released its election manifesto on Sunday to seek a third consecutive term in Tamil Nadu’s April 6 assembly elections by promising free washing machines, offering dual citizenship to Sri Lankan refugees and pledging free housing to people.The AIADMK, an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said it would urge the Centre to scrap the Citizenship Amendment Act and work to bring education to the state list from the concurrent list of the Constitution.Also read: MK Stalin says DMK would continue to urge Centre to scrap CAAWhile the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has vowed to abolish the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), the AIADMK has offered providing training to students appearing for competitive exams such as NEET, UPSC and JEE. NEET is an emotional issue in the state as several students have died by suicide either because they failed to clear the exam or they feared they couldn’t realise their aspirations of studying medicine.The AIADMK manifesto, coming a day after the DMK released its poll promises, bore several similarities. Both parties have tried to appeal to youngsters, women and the Tamil sentiment.Increase in maternity leave for women government employees from nine months to one year and construction of new buildings with modern medical facilities for about 2,000 Amma Mini Clinics also found mention in the AIADMK manifesto.To those who don’t own houses, the AIADMK has promised building and providing houses free of cost in rural and urban areas under the ‘Amma Illam Thittam’ (Amma Housing Scheme) and interest on housing loans availed from cooperative housing societies would be waived on loan repayment.It also said that ₹1,500 per month would be disbursed to all ration card holders and the amount would be credited to bank accounts of woman family heads, senior AIADMK leader C Ponnaiyan said.While the DMK retained its 2016 assembly poll promise of free tablets with internet for students, the AIADMK has promised 2G data to students. The AIADMK has also promised to lower fuel prices.Keeping the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils alive, the AIADMK manifesto promised steps to ensure dual citizenship and voting rights for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees.“Both manifestos are meant to attract voters which they have but compared to DMK’s manifesto, the AIADMK has more sops,” said J Jeyaranjan, who researches political economy of Tamil Nadu.After releasing the manifesto, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said the party has ensured protection for farmers and students through loan waivers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiadmk-promises-free-washing-machine-dual-citizenship-for-sri-lankan-refugees-101615748096949.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||407 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, 2 more deaths||The Capital reported over 400 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the fourth day in a row on Sunday. The city added 407 cases to its tally of over 643,000 infections so far since March 2 last year, when the first case was detected. The city has seen an increase in the number of people hospitalised with the infection as well — from 400 people across city hospitals on February 26 to 582 as on Sunday evening, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. The number of deaths reported each day has also increased slightly. On average, 2.2 deaths were reported each day during the first 14 days of March as compared to 1.3 deaths during the second half of February. The numbers were higher – 2.6 deaths a day on average – during the first half of the month. So far, 10,941 persons have died of the infection. With over 68,000 tests conducted on Saturday – reported a day later in Sunday’s health bulletin – Delhi’s positivity rate stood at 0.60%. The positivity rate is the proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested and is indicative of the spread of the infection in a region. Experts believe that a positivity rate of 5% or less maintained over two weeks indicates that the spread of the infection is under control. Although, Delhi’s positivity rate is much lower than this it has been inching upwards since mid-February. The average positivity rate over the first 14 days of March has been 0.49%. In comparison, the average positivity rate during second half of February was 0.28% and 0.23% during the first half of the month, data shows. “The situation is exactly like it was during Diwali when people were out and about, leading to a lot of asymptomatic spread of the infection. The euphoria of having low number of cases in Delhi was short-lived because people have stopped following Covid-19 norms such as social distancing and masking,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He added, “With the number of cases going down, people stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. The city also has a huge floating population — people travelling to other states and other countries. And, there is still a significant proportion of people who haven’t developed immunity against the infection. The problem is compounded by the emergence of new variants — some we know of, some we don’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/407-new-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-2-more-deaths-101615747427585.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Don’t build permanent structures at protest site: SKM||The farmers’ collective Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday called on farmers to stop constructing permanent structures at sites where they were protesting the Centre’s farm laws.The protesters had been building shelters using bamboo, tin, plywood and even bricks at the Tikri and Singhu borders over the last two weeks to beat the summer heat and rain.On Saturday, Kundli police had registered two FIRs against farmers for constructing brick and mortar houses and digging borewell along the highway at Kundli on the complaint of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).“On March 12, 32 Punjab farmer unions decided that protesters should not get into building any permanent structures at the protest sites. This decision was taken against the backdrop of some such structures coming up at Singhu border,” said SKM leader Darshan Pal on Sunday.At many of these structures, protesters had installed air conditioners, refrigerators, fans and coolers.“The building material was crowd-sourced from villages or bought from nearby stores,” said Kishan Pal Singh, 47, a farmer from Jind in Haryana. “We have seen people questioning us on social media for using fans and coolers. It is sad that they are more concerned about this than the deaths of 200 farmers in the agitation.”Anil Malik, 41, leader of Kisan Social Army that has been volunteering at the Tikri protest site, said farmers had no idea how long the 109 days old agitation would continue.“If it had been a matter of 10-20 days, we could have stayed on the roads. We have elderly protesters and many are at risk of heat stroke. Plus, there is the rain,” said Malik who is from Chakhi Dadri in Haryana. “If our leaders have asked us not to build any structure, we will respect that. But they have to suggest alternatives.”SKM’s media coordinator Harinder Singh said that they would come up with temporary arrangements. “We are thinking of having more tents or temporary bamboo structures as trolleys are not suitable for these weather conditions,” said Singh.Farmers at the protest sites said along with the heat, the dust and mosquito menace added to the woes of staying in the open.Through the protest’s trilingual weekly Trolley Times, volunteers and youth activists at Tikri border had also given the call for architects and designers to submit eco-friendly low-cost summer houses for farmers sitting at the protest spot last month.Suchetna Singh, 26, an architect who hails from Ludhiana and has been in Delhi for two years, was among those who volunteered to design these low-cost structures for the farmers. “We had to keep in mind that these structures could be disassembled and taken back to the villages if needed. Many farmers had already made their own structures using their knowledge and experience and those who were still building one came to us and asked for inputs on if we could make it easier.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-build-permanent-structures-at-protest-site-skm-101615747370016.html
15-03-2021||Other||Door-to-door network across Delhi districts to boost Covid vaccination turnouts||New Delhi: With Covid-19 vaccination turnouts in the city consistently below the government’s expectations, district teams have fanned out across the Capital in a bid to convince people aged above 60 and those over 45 with serious illness to get inoculated against the infection, which has steadily inched up in the city over the past few days.A senior government official said the teams have also been entrusted with helping people register and book vaccine slots through the Centre’s CoWin system and arrange conveyance for them if required.“We want to scale up the vaccination drive by increasing capacity as well as turnout. This cohort mobilisation exercise is an important step in that direction. We have to ensure that a large number of people are protected against the disease at the earliest,” said Vijay Dev, Delhi’s chief secretary.Since January 16, when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country starting with health care workers, 664,620 people in Delhi — roughly 3.3% of its total population — have received the first dose of the vaccine. These include 173,408 health workers, 264,282 front line workers, 196,007 people aged over 60 years and 30,923 people between ages 45-59 who have comorbidities, government records showed.Out of 900,000 health workers and front line workers in the city, around 600,000 registered for the vaccine. Delhi has around 2.1 million individuals aged over 60, according to election data which the government has used to record vaccination estimates. There is no clear estimate of people aged between 45-59 years who have specific comorbidities as listed by the Union health ministry.“We are using booth-level machinery to reach out door-to-door, meet eligible beneficiaries and speak to them about the benefits of the vaccine, help reduce hesitance and assist them with the registration process,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, district magistrate (East Delhi).Delhi currently has 438 vaccine sites across 192 health care facilities. Of these, 56 are government facilities, where the vaccines are administered for free and 136 are private that charge up to ₹250 for a single dose.“The focus of the drive is on potential beneficiaries who live in slums and low-income group colonies, where people are generally less aware about the programme. Many of them are too poor to afford conveyance or are less comfortable with technology to register themselves on CoWin. Another focus group is elderly people who have no relatives,” said Dharmendra Kumar, additional district magistrate.Each district has between 25 and 50 teams depending on its size and population.The government’s initiative comes amid a nationwide resurgence of infections. The seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases across India has risen by 67% from lows seen after the end of the first wave of the pandemic (from 10,988 cases a day week ending February 11, to 18,371 cases a day for week ending March 12), underlining what clearly appears to mark the start of the second wave of infections. On that parameter, Delhi has seen around 140% rise from the lows around mid-February. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 407 new Covid-19 cases – with a test positivity rate of 0.60% -- and two more deaths. The number of new cases recorded each day has been higher than 400 for four days now. So far, government records showed, 643,696 infections have been recorded in Delhi – of which 630,493 have recovered and 10,941 individuals have died. Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department, Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination taskforce for India, said: “Door-to-door drives is crucial for speeding up the vaccination drive and ensuring that more people are protected against the disease at the earliest, especially in the light of uptick in cases in some states. During visits by health officials, people should clearly share information regarding age and comorbidities. The government, on its part, should ensure that health officials engaged in the drive are briefed thoroughly about the communication modules drafted by the Union health ministry. The government should also monitor and evaluate how such drives contribute to turnout.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doortodoor-network-across-delhi-districts-to-boost-covid-vaccination-turnouts-101615747369433.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Tihar has no jammers that can block 4G signals||In Tihar, the country’s largest prison which houses close to 18,000 undertrials, there is not a single mobile phone jammer that is capable of blocking 4G signals, HT has learnt from prison officers.Last week, two smartphones were recovered from Tehsin Akhtar, last known chief of the now dormant homegrown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), in Tihar’s jail number 8, one of which reportedly sent out a message that claimed responsibility for the explosives found in the SUV outside Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25.Central intelligence agencies had discovered a chat on phone app Telegram, through which a terror group that called themselves Jaish-ul-Hind had claimed responsibility for planting the explosives laden car outside Ambani’s house. The Telegam group was found to have been created inside Delhi’s Tihar jail, after which Delhi police were informed. They in turn informed the prison department. On Thursday night, the Tihar prison authorities conducted a raid inside jail 8 and seized two phones. Delhi police have said that Akhtar created the group — Jaish-ul-Hind — on Telegram, on February 26, and claimed responsibility for placing an explosives laden Mahindra Scorpio car.At least two prison officials, who did not wish to be named, said though there is a need for more than 100-120 cell phone jammers that block 4G signals within the prison complex, they have less than 45 jammers. Also, those jammers were installed more than 4-5 years ago and are only capable of blocking 3G signals. Taking advantage of this fact, prisoners freely use 4G internet to make calls, said a prison officer.On Monday, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal is likely to hold a meeting with the prison’s director general Sandeep Goel, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla over the issue of jammers and cell phone use inside the jail. Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava is also likely to be present in the meeting. The lieutenant governor is mostly likely meeting the senior officers to try and find a way to stop all internet services being currently used by the prisoners.“We have seen in multiple cases that prisoners are freely using voice over internet call facility. They use WhatsApp, Facebook messenger and Telegram to make calls. The existing jammers were installed before 2014 and mildly work only against 2G and 3G signals. They are not at all effective in blocking internet calls, which is being used by every prisoner with a phone inside the jail. Another problem is that the prisoners know the corners inside the prison, where the jammers do not work. They use those spots to make calls,” said a mid-level prison officers, who did not wish to be named.When contacted, the prison’s director general Sandeep Goel said that the department will soon be doing away with jammers and adopt, what he said was, Dominant Tower Technology. “The jammers may work at some places and not work at some spots. They have certain limitations. We have found a better solution. With permission of department of telecom, we have installed one cell phone tower, at Mandoli Jail complex. Using Dominant Tower Technology, this tower blocks all signals from that particular area. We tested and found that this was effective at blocking all cell phone services from three jails in Mandoli. We will use this technology and install similar towers in Tihar too. This will cut off all signals. Delhi prisons will be the first prison to adopt this technology.”A cell phone is a prohibited item inside prison, but it is smuggled by prisoners when they go out for court hearings. The prisoners even hide the phone in their body cavities and take it inside. There are many instances of prisoners swallowing cell phones to smuggle it inside. Apart from this the phones are also thrown by accomplices of the prisoners from the main road, outside the prison complex, inside the prison.Cell phones were banned inside Tihar to ensure that prisoners do not continue their criminal activities and run their operations from behind bars. To ensure that prisoners stay connected to their families, each prisoner is allowed 5 minutes of phone call daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tihar-has-no-jammers-that-can-block-4g-signals-101615747368895.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Toying with our fears: Dummy guns a real threat in Delhi heists||What is a common link connecting a nearly successful 30-minute-long bank robbery, a phone snatching near a busy metro station, extortion by a man posing as a police officer, and a fake heist at a jewellery showroom orchestrated by its owner?All the four crimes, officers investigating the cases in the last two years found, had the suspects using toy guns or air pistols.As odd as it may sound, toy guns are not uncommon “weapons” in the hands of criminals in Delhi. Over the last two years, there have been at least 14 recorded instances of dummy firearms being used in crimes, ranging from bank robberies to street crimes, such as snatching, and extortion to fake robberies.In fact, two of the last four bank robberies in the national capital involved toy guns – in one instance it served as the lone weapon, and in the other as a back-up weapon.And this year, in a span of three days in January, there were three separate toy guns seized by the Delhi Police. In one of those cases, it was used for extortion by a club singer posing as a crime branch inspector and using the fake gun to extort people not wearing masks in Govindpuri. In another, a dummy gun was used to rob a mobile phone from a cab driver near the busy Jamia Nagar Metro station. In a third case, two brothers were found using a toy gun as a secondary weapon along with a real pistol.In none of the 14 known instances, did the victims suspect that they were being threatened with a fake gun.When a mobile phone trader, who lost money in gambling, decided to target a bank in outer Delhi’s Prashant Vihar in March 2019, the only weapon he took with him was an air pistol — that is usually used to shoot balloons. Yet, operating alone, he was able to hold a dozen staff hostage for good 30 minutes and collect ₹40 lakh in cash, until the bank manager decided to challenge him and tackle him down.Till the time he was brought down, everyone in the bank believed he was wielding a real gun. In fact, the bank manager on duly even submitted the robbed cash and the gun to the police believing it was a real weapon. It was only when the police were examining the weapon, that they noticed it was a dummyweapon.Then in September, the same year, two men barged into a bank in east Delhi’s Farsh Bazar and briefly made away with nearly ₹9 lakh in cash. Police said that of the two weapons they brought along, one was a toy gun that looked real.While the toy guns in none of these 14 instances aroused suspicion, an incident in which a woman mocked some robbers for threatening her with “toy guns” took a tragic turn. In the robbery that took place in New Friends Colony, the robbers shot her in her foot to prove that they were carrying real weapons.Experts say that a host of reasons prompts criminals to opt for toy guns. Prakash Singh, former Uttar Pradesh Police chief, says that toy weapons are able to inspire the same kind of fear in victims that real guns do. Sometimes, a toy gun is used as a back-up of a real firearm as it comes at only a fraction of a cost of the genuine weapon.“A criminal knows that with a toy gun, he won’t be able to kill someone, even if the situation turns ugly. Moreover, he won’t be tried under the Arms Act,” says Singh.The Delhi Police does not maintain data on the use of toy guns in crimes, or the seizure of such “weapons”, but their use could be more prevalent than what the police records show. When it comes to real guns, there were at least 672 cases last year when firearms were used in Delhi. The police went on to recover 2,735 illegal guns through last year.RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east Delhi), says that the offence cannot be deemed non serious just cause a toy gun was used in it. “We do not apply the Arms Act, but it is still a robbery, and the charges stand the scrutiny of the court,” says Meena, whose team recovered two of the last three toy guns in Delhi.But Prakash Singh believes that the use of toy guns falls in a grey area. “It is less serious than using of a real gun, but more serious than snatching without the use of a weapon,” he says.While these dummy guns maybe not capable of causing deaths, they are not entirely harmless either. Four years ago, a boy in Shahdara lost his left eye after being hit by a pellet fired from a toy gun being playfully wielded by his neighbour.Meena says that these dummy guns are found in normal toy shops, online shopping platforms, sold as Diwali crackers and even in the form of cigarette lighters. “They look as good as real. And there is no ban on them,” says Meena.If convicted for a robbery using even a toy gun, the punishment remains imprisonment for up to 10 years.Delhi Police spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal, attributes the use of toy guns by some criminals to the “difficulty” in procuring a real gun. “It is not so easy for criminals in Delhi to obtain a real gun. The non-habitual criminals may find it easier to use a toy gun rather than find a real gun,” says Biswal. “We ensure that using a toy gun doesn’t reduce the gravity of the crime in court,” Biswal adds.The toy guns, sometimes, even catches the police by surprise. A notorious vehicle thief, when surrounded by the police in Shahdara, chose to attack them only with an iron rod, despite possessing a pistol. The mystery was solved only when the suspect was overpowered. An examination of the gun revealed it was only a toy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/toying-with-our-fears-dummy-guns-a-real-threat-in-delhi-heists-101615747368292.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal flags off sewer work at Kirari, Mundka||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday flagged off work on a sewer project slated to cover 114 unauthorised colonies and six villages across Kirari and Mundka assembly constituencies in the northwestern periphery of the Capital.“Before the last elections (February 2020), I promised you all that I will resolve all the sewer issues in Kirari and road-repair work. I have come here today to fulfil my promise. Despite the shortage of funds, I instructed officers to arrange funds from anywhere and start the sewer project as soon as possible because I had made a promise to you,” said Kejriwal, addressing a gathering in Kirari on Sunday.According to a statement released on Sunday, the government plans to lay 423km of sewer lines across the areas, as well as set up wastewater pumping stations in three areas.He further said, “We have already provided water to every household in Kirari, and we now aim to provide sewer lines to every household as well as good roads and lanes. I continue to face huge backlash from opposition parties for providing free services such as water and bus rides to people, but the support of the people keeps me going. In the last 70 years, no other party has worked for the development of unauthorised colonies, as much as AAP has have worked in the last five years.”The Delhi government in a press statement, issued later in the day, said, “The sewer scheme for Kirari and Mundka has been prepared to facilitate the public at large residing in these colonies and villages and achieve better sanitary conditions and further reduce the pollution of the River Yamuna. Under the scheme, there are provisions to lay the sewer lines in the length of about 423km. The scope of work also includes the construction of waste water pumping stations at Prem Nagar, Bhagya Vihar, and Pratap Vihar with capacities of 6.5, 9.0, and 41 MGD, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-flags-off-sewer-work-at-kirari-mundka-101615747367684.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Man killed, 2 injured in separate shootings in N-E Delhi||A man was killed and two others were injured in three separate shooting incidents in North-east Delhi on Friday and Saturday.The first incident was on Friday evening when two men shot at a motorcycle mechanic who police identified by a single name as Tasleem from Chauhan Bangar. The previous day Tasleem allegedly had an argument with a man named Mohammad Sohail who wanted his vehicle to be repaired before others. On Friday, Sohail allegedly returned with another man named Mohammad Ghazi and shot at Tasleem five times.Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Sanjay Sain said, “He has suffered bullet injuries to his shoulder and hands but no vital organs were hit and his condition is stable.

Police said people in the area saw a few masked persons flee the area.“Sharma was shot rushed to Jag Pravesh Chandra hospital from where he was referred to Max Patparganj,” a police officer, requesting not to be named, said. DCP Sain said they had sine arrested one person for the attack. “Our teams obtained CCTV footage from inquired into it. Prima facie, it looks like that the attack was fallout of personal enmity and we arrested one person. Sharma’s condition was said to be stable,” he said. Police did not divulge details of the arrested men as more arrests are expected in the case. The third incident was reported on Saturday between 8 pm and 9 pm when garments shop owner Shoiab Ansari was gunned down in his Khajuri Khas shop.

15-03-2021||Delhi||Sewer work affects traffic in Patparganj||What started as a routine sewer laying work by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has led to residents of east Delhi’s Patparganj suffering long traffic snarls and dust on the Narwana Road for the last two years.The road connects Patparganj with Laxmi Nagar and Pandav Nagar. Along it is the Mother Dairy headquarters near the Laxmi Nagar Metro station. The sewer line was laid in 2019 but the road was left unpaved.“Then last year they dug up the road again to lay some more sewer lines and left it unpaved again. Vehicles on both carriageways were forced to squeeze by. In January this year, we met senior Delhi Jal Board officials who assured us that the work will be completed in 15 days, but it is March now and they are yet to open the road for traffic,” said Navneet Nayyar, president of the Ekta Garden residents’ welfare association.Suresh Bindal, founder and former president of IPEX Societies Mahasangh, an umbrella body of 119 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in IP Extension, said, “We have had meetings with the agencies informing them of the delays and how it is causing grave inconvenience to the of residents in the area. Since this is a development work, and this will ease of lot of the area’s water problems, we are also not saying much.”Officials from the Delhi water utility did not respond to repeated calls and messages asking for a completion date for the project.On Saturday, when Hindustan Times visited the area, large sewer pipes were on the road side, soil from the excavated road and other construction material was set aside.Sunil Kumar, a shop owner in Pandav Nagar, said that the closure of road had not only resulted everyday traffic jams and pollution, but also made the road unsafe.“One carriageway is closed, so commuters from both sides are having to more on just the one available carriageway. Especially after sundown, there have been incidents of minor accidents,” Kumar said.A senior traffic official of the district said that more than the traffic volume, it was the construction on the road that was causing the traffic snarls.“It’s becoming a safety hazard more than anything. In the morning and evening rush hours, because of the chaotic movement on this road, cascading jams are causing on the main road near the Mother Dairy and also in internal roads,” the above-mentioned traffic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/unfinished-djb-work-strangles-patparganj-traffic-101615747308641.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Water shortage cripples life in part in east, N-E Delhi as DJB undertakes repairs||Several parts of east and north-east Delhi continued reeling under an acute water shortage for more than 48 hours on Sunday, as the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) carried out repair work of an interconnection pipeline.A statement issued by the DJB on Sunday said that the work on a 1200mm main pipeline, supplying water to the east and north-east parts of the national capital, was completed by 4pm on Sunday and the evening supply was restored in many parts. “Repair work was successfully completed by 4pm on Sunday. Pumping of water also began immediately after the work was completed and by evening, water with appropriate pressure will be available in most areas. Further, by late evening or early tomorrow (Monday) morning, the entire east and north-east Delhi will get supply in full swing,” the statement read. Despite the assurance that the evening water supply will be resumed in most parts, residents of most localities said that water was not available till at least late Sunday. Water supply in some of the areas started getting impacted from Friday, after the DJB began interconnection work on 1200 mm diameter main lines at Jal Vihar and Greater Kailash. The work was started after complaints received by residents of Vikas Kunj, reporting major leakages in the GK main lines, which resulted in water entering the basements of their houses, posing a threat to the building structure. DJB on March 11 had issued an advisory to people that due to the repair work of pipeline, water supply would be affected from 10am on Friday to 10am on Saturday. However, on Saturday the water utility agency issued a fresh advisory, extending the timing of the water shortage till Sunday morning. The worst impacted by the repair work were areas such as Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Chitra Nagar, Ghazipur, Mayur Vihar phase-I, II and III, East Azad Nagar, New Kondli, Shahdara, Mandawali, Patparganj, Shalimar Park and Vishwakarma Park. Mujid Alam, a resident of Mandawali, said that the water supply in his colony has been hit for three days now. He said that by Saturday evening, the last drop of water that was stored had been exhausted, and at least for two hours on Sunday morning he went around with empty buckets for search of some water to meet basic household requirements. “We went to the local shops and even they did not have water. I heard that in some shops in Pandav Nagar, drinking water bottles are being sold for R100 per bottle. People are desperate and some shopkeepers are taking advantage of that,” Alam said. Many people also took to social media to reach out to the DJB, desperately trying to get some information on water availability. Some also highlighted that while the supply was impacted, no efforts were made by the DJB to ensure the availability of water tankers or other sources. “No water supply in Mayur Vihar, East Delhi since the past two days. No water tanks available, no bottled drinking water available on shops today morning. Emergency situation Please do something urgently @DJB, (sic)” tweeted Ruchi Kokcha. A senior DJB official refuted the allegation and said water tankers were running late because of the increased demand, but was being made available wherever supply was hit. Abhishek Dutt, Congress party spokesperson and municipal councillor from south Delhi’s Andrews Ganj, said that the water shortage was also being experienced in parts of south Delhi. “Over the past few months, the only message that the DJB has been posting is ‘repair/breakdown/ammonia will impact water supply in Delhi’. Every week they come up with one such excuse. Residents of Lajpat Nagar-4 and Andrews Ganj are suffering for the past two days,” Dutt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-shortage-cripples-life-in-part-in-east-n-e-delhi-as-djb-undertakes-repairs-101615747307529.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Argument over music led to murder, say cops||The death of a 36-year-old man during a birthday party in a farmhouse in outer Delhi last Thursday turned out to be a murder over music rather than the celebratory firing as was initially believed.Police on Sunday arrested victim Anuj Sharma’s friend 28-year-old grocer Naveen Kumar for the murder.“Initially, some people tried to pass off the murder as a case of celebratory firing, but that wasn’t the case,” said Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka).Kumar, a resident of Jharoda Kalan, near Dwarka, had been absconding since the murder until police received a tip on his location. He was arrested from Dwarka and police recovered the murder weapon, allegedly illegal, and two live bullets.During questioning, Kumar’s allegedly told police that he was drunk at the time and was miffed with the music selection. “He took it up with Sharma. The petty issue snowballed into an argument and he shot Sharma in his chest,” the DCP said.What threw police off the murder scent initially was the confirmed celebratory firing during the party for Sharma’s younger brother. Nine spent bullets found at the crime scene were taken as evidence that someone had fired in the air and accidentally hit Sharma. Police said they had identified the person who had fired in celebration and was on the lookout to arrest him.At least 12 guests had been present at the function.Last year, there were 672 instances when firearms were used, slightly fewer than 736 such cases in 2019. Through last year, the police also recovered 2,735 illegal firearms and at least 5,138 bullets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fatal-shooting-during-celebration-at-farmhouse-was-over-playing-music-there-was-celebratory-firing-too-at-the-venue-101615747308050.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||NGO to help homeless people get vaccinated||A Delhi-based NGO is helping vaccinate people living in government-run shelters against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Centre for Holistic Development (CHD) is registering eligible people on the CoWin government portal. Sunil Aledia, CHD executive director, said, “There are a lot of people in shelters who meet the criteria, either above the age of 60 or are at least 45 years old with co-morbidities) but left out of the vaccination drive unintentionally.”“We will be taking them for vaccination on March 16. We are hoping to register 100-150 people from across the city. We have also discussed this with district administrations and the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (which runs the shelters) to find a way to get homeless people vaccinated,” said Aledia.There are close to 200 government-run shelter homes, which are under DUSIB and managed by various NGOs.Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters in Delhi, said, “The government should have a special drive to get the homeless, including those are not living in shelters, vaccinated. While most may have identity cards, several may not and some measure should be devised to inoculate them too.”A senior DUSIB official said, “We are working on a plan to get these people vaccinated. So far, no decision has been taken.”Those running the shelter homes say that while identifying vulnerable people as per the criteria is not difficult, but the real challenge is to take them to the vaccination centres. “A lot of us don’t have the resources to take these people to the inoculation centre. Also, some of the people, especially those who are above 45 years of age, have to be examined by a doctor for comorbidities before they can be registered for vaccination. There is a need to arrange a medical screening of these people,” said Rajesh Kumar, national executive director of Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses (SPYM).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ngo-to-help-homeless-people-get-vaccinated-101615747247635.html

Delhi goes to municipal polls next year.“Despite exceeding the cost by 409% on the Rani Jhansi flyover, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is not disclosing names of the people who are behind this corruption. They are BJP saving leaders. We question the inordinate delay and wastage of public money on construction of the flyover,” the AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said on Sunday.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. People are well aware that the Rani Jhansi flyover got caught up in several legal hurdles. He should rather question his government about the inordinate delay and excess expenditure in the construction of Signature bridge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-alleges-corruption-in-rani-jhansi-flyover-construction-bjp-hits-back-101615747248259.html
15-03-2021||Delhi||Only around 3% in Delhi have got at least one vaccine dose: Govt data||Just over 3% of Delhi’s population has received at least a single dose of the coronavirus vaccine so far, government records show, with experts calling for the government to expedite the vaccination programme in the Capital amid a steady spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases.As on Sunday evening, 638,438 people have received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine in the city, marginally more than 3% of Delhi’s nearly 20 million population.Over 178,000 persons over the age of 60 have received at least one shot of the vaccine since the drive opened for them on March 1, state government data showed. This accounts for over 8.5% of the 2.1 million people in this category living in Delhi as per estimates based on electoral rolls.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOver 28,000 persons above the age of 45 with 20 specified co-morbidities have also received the shot so far in the city. With the Centre releasing the list of eligible illness — such as severe heart condition, cancers, and complicates diabetes and hypertension — soon before the drive opened up for this category, the city does not have estimates on the number of such persons living in Delhi.Over 70% of registered health care and frontline workers, who started getting the shots in mid-January and February beginning respectively, have received at least one dose of the vaccine.Additionally, 114,564 persons have receiving both doses of the vaccines, 28 days apart, thus completing their immunisation from the infection. Both vaccines approved for use in India — Covaxin and Covishield — need two doses given four to six weeks apart.Nearly three crore vaccine doses have been administered across the country till Saturday evening, according to Union health ministry data, around 2.5% of the total population of the country.“We are already conducting vaccinations six days a week. We have also fixed 50,000 vaccine slots per day, and the number will keep increasing,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. With the number of cases of the viral infections on the rise, district officials have been asked to focus on increasing the pace of immunisation along with contact tracing and testing.“In addition to what we were doing in March and April last year — tracing contacts and testing people at risk of getting the infection — we have an effective vaccine this time around. We are focussing on encouraging more and more people to come and get immunised. We have been in touch with several resident welfare organisations (RWAs) in the city to increase awareness about the vaccines and the vaccination drive and motivate people to get the shot,” said one senior district official, on the condition of anonymity.Another official said, “We are also using our network of ASHA and Anganwadi workers to find beneficiaries over the age of 60 or those with comorbidities and encourage them to go to their nearest vaccination centre. We have allowed walk-ins after 3pm to ensure that more people turn up, just like it happened initially with the drive for health care workers.” The official said the district officials were also helping in registering those who do not know how to register on CoWIN portal to increase the numbers.On Sunday, Delhi recorded 407 cases of Covid-19, seeing over 400 cases for four days in a row. With just over 68,000 tests having been conducted, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – stood at 0.60% on Sunday.The seven-day average positivity rate has increased to 0.55% from 0.42% last week.This, experts say, is an indication of the increasing spread of the infection in the city.“When there is a fire somewhere, should we throw all the water we have at it or distribute it equally. What are the vaccines for? The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait for it,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-around-3-in-city-have-got-at-least-one-vaccine-dose-govt-data-101615747187513.html

However, in 2014 he shifted from Four Bungalows to Amboli where he had been living on rent in a two-storey bungalow owned by Micheal Manterio. “Since I knew Khandekar as an estate agent, I used to meet him regularly as I was searching for a property to buy,” said Devda, who stays with his parents while his younger brother shifted to Japan.In 2014, Khandekar had informed Devda that Manterio wanted to sell his house for ₹36 lakh. As Devda showed interest in buying the property, Khandekar arranged for a meeting between Devda and Manterio’s sister Lucy Sores, 55, who agreed to the purchase. A few days later, Devda gave her the token amount of ₹1.1 lakh in the presence of Khandekar and Sheetal Kotian. Over a period, Devda gave Sores ₹36 lakh and got the agreement of the house, which he handed over to Khandekar to transfer the electricity bill etc on his name since the latter was staying there on rent. “We had drafted an agreement that Khandekar would be staying in the house as a tenant,” said Devda in his statement to the police.In 2019, after Khandekar stopped paying rent, Devda found out that the electricity bill was not on his name but in Kotian’s name. “That is when I found out that Khandekar had forged the documents of the purchase and made fake purchase copy on his name,” Devda.When Devda realised that he had been cheated, he approached the police and a case was registered for forgery and cheating under sections 465, 467, 468, 471 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.“Based on the complaint, we arrested Khandekar and presented him before the court which remanded him in police custody,” said an officer from DN Nagar police station.Upon investigation, the police found out that Khandekar had cheated many people using the same modus operandi. “We are now finding out how many people were cheated by Khandekar,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-48-year-old-held-for-forging-pilot-s-sign-to-grab-his-house-101615746829527.html

The arrests were made by a team from the Sector 58 police station.Four people, including prime suspect Mohit Goel, had been arrested by Sector 58 police in January while a fifth was nabbed in February. Goel was the alleged mastermind of the 2016 Freedom 251 scam which offered the world’s cheapest smartphones to the public. He was arrested in 2017 in connection with the Freedom 251 case and nabbed again on January 11 this year along with an accomplice for allegedly duping wholesalers by purchasing dry fruits and spices from them at cheap prices and then not paying them. The police said that a case was registered in this regard at Sector 58 police station in December 2020 and another at Phase 2.According to Noida police, the suspects would allegedly start a firm and then shut it within a few months after duping people, following which they would start another firm at a separate location.“We had inputs that associates of the gang had started another company in Gurugram’s Sector 57 from January 15, four days after the mastermind was arrested, following which a team was sent there and the duo was taken in police custody,” said assistant commissioner of police, Zone 1, Rajneesh Verma.The suspects arrested March 13 were identified as Akash Deep Sharma and Pankaj Prakash, from Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Police said they have been named in the initial cases and allegedly worked as purchase admin managers in the initial firms. The duo had allegedly already rented a space and applied for GST registration while they were already in talks with potential buyers. Samples of products they allegedly hoped to share with victims were also recovered from the spot. “In 2019 when they were running one such company from Gurugram itself, a buyer had demanded a refund for his investment following which associates of the suspects had assaulted him. The man took his own life by consuming poison and a case was registered regarding this,” said Verma.A total of seven people have been arrested so far regarding this scam while the police are on the lookout for more. The duo was produced before a suspect and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-more-suspects-involved-in-dry-fruits-scam-nabbed-from-gurugram-101615746830029.html

The move comes after the Uttar Pradesh health department on Sunday directed opening of community health centres (CHCs) for six days a week as against three days a week earlier. In Ghaziabad, district health department officials said that the four CHCs at Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Dasna will now open six days a week for the vaccination purposes. Besides, the district women hospital will also remain open for six days in a week, they said. “We have received directions for opening of our CHCs for six days a week. Besides, we have also decided to open the women hospital for six days in a week. Thus, we will be able to vaccinate about 4,800 more beneficiaries every week,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. Overall, Ghaziabad has presence of 45 government facilities and 31 private hospitals which are taking up Covid-19 vaccination for the senior citizens and people aged 45 years and above having comorbid conditions. Recently, the district health officials had set a target of inoculating 10,900 beneficiaries per day in the 45 government health-care facilities. In GB Nagar, the health department officials said that the five CHCs in the district will now operate for six days a week. The Government Institute of Medical Sciences and the district hospital in Sector 30 are already operating six days a week for the vaccination purposes, the officials said, adding that the district also has about 42 private hospitals which are engaged in the vaccination process. “We have also increased the government health and wellness centres for four days a week on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. There are five such centres in Jewar and four each in Dadri and Dankaur. So, with the new arrangement, we will further enhance our vaccination coverage,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. On Sunday, Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), urged the public representatives and government staff, among others, to come out and help improve the vaccination coverage. “We have now changed opening of CHCs from three days a week to six days a week. The idea is to give more coverage to senior citizens and get them vaccinated early so that the effect of Covid-19, in case it rises, is negligible. The primary health centres will operate for three days as usual for vaccination,” said Prasad. As per previous directions of the UP government, the district hospitals and medical colleges in the state were to open for six days while other government health-care facilities were to open for three days on Monday, Thursday and Friday. The private hospitals which are charging for vaccination were directed to open for a minimum of four days a week.

15-03-2021||Noida||Police arrest 2 with 750 illegal liquor bottles in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: Police have arrested two persons and recovered 750 illegal liquor bottles in 15 cartons from their possession, in Greater Noida on Sunday.The suspects were identified as 35-year-old Rajiv Singh and 33-year-old Bhim Singh. Both of them are residents of Tatarpur village in Jarcha. Shripal Singh, SHO, Jarcha police station said that Rajiv is a former sarpanch of Tatarpur village in Uttar Pradesh. “He is also planning to contest the upcoming panchayat elections.

15-03-2021||India||Yatnal doubts transparency of probe by SIT in harassment case against MLA||Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Karnataka, on Sunday raised doubts over the transparency of the newly formed SIT (special investigation team) set up to probe the alleged case of sexual exploitation by his colleague and former minister, Ramesh Jarkiholi.“This is a big conspiracy and an organised plan to finish him (Jarkiholi) off. They (government) have just given the case to the SIT, which has started the investigation. But I have my doubts on how transparent this will be,” Yatnal, one of the staunchest critics of chief minister B.S Yediyurappa said in Vijayapura on Sunday.Continuing his attacks on the chief minister and his son, B.Y Vijayendra, Yatnal said that SIT might not be the right agency to investigate the case and it should instead be handed to the CBI (central bureau of investigation).“There is one official there (in the SIT) who listens to everything (BY) Vijayendra (Yediyurappa’s son) says,” Yatnal said.The statements come a day after Jarkiholi filed an FIR against the alleged conspirators, who he claimed, tried to defame him and end his political career. Jarkiholi stepped down from his post in the cabinet after a social activist filed a complaint of sexual exploitation of an unnamed woman in the guise of providing her a government job.A video of a person, appearing to be Jarkiholi, was seen getting intimate with the unnamed woman. The video was played on loop by Kannada TV channels in the state until the former minister got an order by the court barring most of the news outlets from doing so.An alleged phone call recording between Jarkiholi and the unnamed woman was also played, in which the person who is suspected to be the former minister is heard saying that Yediyurappa indulges in corruption.The unnamed woman has since released a video statement, seeking protection for herself and her family, claiming they become a target of threats and intimidation since the incident.Yatnal said the video came out right after Jarkiholi filed an FIR. He added that there are many such CDs (videos) of other political leaders in the “homes of the son of one BJP leader and one Congress leader”.At least six ministers of Yediyurappa’s cabinet have sought injunctions from the court, prohibiting at least 68 entities, including Kannada news channels, papers, Twitter, Google and Facebook among others, from publishing, broadcasting or circulation of any content defamatory to them.The alleged sex scandal, rise of Covid-19 cases, protests over demands for higher reservation by dominant caste groups have added to the challenges of Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yatnal-doubts-transparency-of-probe-by-sit-in-harassment-case-against-mla-101615746468506.html

In a matter of seconds, everything was destroyed, I have heard from people here,” said 43-year-old Shiv Dutt, who was among the four men who were injured when lightning struck a tree under which they were taking shelter from the rain in Gurugram’s Sector 82 on Friday evening. Dutt, who was discharged from a private hospital in Manesar on Sunday, said that while he has been informed about the events that transpired on Friday, he does not remember much about the incident. “The four of us had just wrapped up our work for the day when it started drizzling. Since our work was over, we decided to take shelter under the tree, hoping that the rain would stop in some time. Lightning must have hit us at a tremendous speed… we didn’t realise what happened. I don’t know anything. What happened and how it happened, I remember nothing,” said Dutt, recapping the moment just before lightning struck him.Four persons, identified as Lali (32), Anil Kumar (32), Ram Prasad (38) and Shiv Dutt (43) were injured when lightning struck a tree they were taking cover under during rainfall in Sector 82 on Friday evening. Prasad was severely injured and died during treatment late Friday. The incident took place in the Vatika India Next residential township and the four men were attached with its horticulture department.While the incident was captured by CCTV cameras and footage circulated widely on social media, Dutt said that he is yet to see the video. “I am yet to see the video. I have only heard about it from my family members and others who have shared information about the video,” said Dutt, who has been working as a gardener with the residential society since last June. “When I regained consciousness, the chain of events was narrated to me. I learned that the staff came to us and got us admitted to the hospital,” said Dutt. He said that he was having difficulty using his left hand properly since the incident. He also complained of chest pain. “My left hand is not moving efficiently since it was affected by lightning. Starting from the neck to the chest, there is pain and stiffness,” said Dutt, a native of Etah in Uttar Pradesh.His wife, Pushpa, said that while Dutt was under the doctor’s watch, she had not left his bedside fearing the worst. “My heart skipped a beat when we got to know about the incident and saw the video. My daughter was crying uncontrollably. Since we reached the hospital, I have not left his side even for a moment. We are poor people. I have no idea what to do now and where to take him next,” said Pushpa.Expressing his gratitude for not suffering a fatal injury, he said that he was thankful to everyone who helped him following the strike. “I am thankful for everything. No one can control or predict a natural occurrence. I was wearing shoes and gloves, but this was destined to happen, so it happened,” said Dutt, who only regained consciousness on Friday night, a few hours after being admitted to a private hospital in Manesar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/everything-was-destroyed-in-seconds-lightning-attack-survivor-recalls-incident-101615744790187.html
15-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covaxin or Covishield? Pick your safe shot||With Covaxin granted the regular restricted emergency use authorisation just like Covishield manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute – and therefore the same licensure status – potential beneficiaries can exercise their choice of being inoculated with either of the two vaccines. Three days after the Centre removed the “clinical trial mode” tag against Covaxin, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gave the nod to its five vaccination centres to administer Bharat Biotech’s indigenously developed vaccine, starting Monday. The civic body will provide Covaxin vials at SevenHills hospital and jumbo centres at BKC, NESCO, Dahisar and Mulund, following which BYL Nair and Dr RN Cooper hospitals will be added to the list next week. Till Sunday (March 14), Covaxin jabs were given only at the government-run JJ hospital at Byculla, which was also the sole Phase III clinical trial site in Mumbai. On March 4, makers of Covaxin said preliminary results showed the first coronavirus vaccine developed in India has an efficacy rate of 81% in phase III of clinical trials. The civic body received 63,000 doses of Covaxin from the central government on Saturday. “Walk-in beneficiaries, during registration, will be given a choice across the table. After two-three days, the centralised Co-WIN site will also add the option to choose between the two vaccines. So, while registering online, people can choose their preferred vaccine,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. Covaxin is one of the two vaccines which has been used as part of the nationwide mass immunisation programme that was rolled out on January 16, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved its emergency use in clinical trial mode. Covaxin uses an inactivated virus paired with an adjuvant – a chemical that boosts immune response. When administered, immune cells recognise the dead virus which prompts the immune system in the body to make antibodies against the virus. Dr Rajesh Dere, in-charge of BKC jumbo centre, said, “Unlike earlier, Covaxin beneficiaries will not have to sign a consent letter to take the vials. Earlier, people had to give their approval as it was under clinical trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covaxin-or-covishield-pick-your-safe-shot-101615741008034.html

15-03-2021||Other||3 waves of migrations that shaped Bengaluru||Bengaluru was a city that was made on a call for migration. Kempegowda, the founder of the city, made a clarion call for traders and other craftsmen to make the new city their home in 1537 after laying its foundation. Centuries later, Bengaluru is one of the most cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual cities in the country. Historians say three waves of migrations made the city what it is today.According to 2011 census, out of 10 people in Bengaluru, four are migrants. A person is considered a migrant if he is staying at a place other than his or her place of enumeration. Since 42.12% of Bengaluru’s population originate from outside the district or the state, after Mumbai, Bengaluru has the second-largest migrant population in India.In Census 2001, inter-district and inter-state migrants constituted 30.27% of the city’s population. Over the next decade the migrant population increased by more than 12% points, making them the fastest-growing community in the city.For historians, these numbers are not surprising because of the waves of migration the city witnessed over the centuries. Historian Suresh Moona said, “It was an equivalent of modern-day investors’ meet. When Kempegowda built his mud fort in 1537, a call was made for traders and other craftsmen to move to the new city. He knew that unless there is no thriving trade, a city can’t grow. In fact, many areas in Bengaluru were named after the occupations such Akkipet (rice), Ragipet (Millet) among others.”He said the tradition continued with Tipu Sultan, who invited craftsmen from different parts of the country to live in Bengaluru. Most of these skill labourers migrated to Bengaluru to support Tipu’s military industry.The remanence of the Tipu era migration still remains in Bengaluru, the Kalasipalaya areas in the heart of the city, was a settlement of Kalsi, the expert tent-pitchers and organisers of military camps of Tipu’s army.However, the first wave of migration that changed Bengaluru’s demography, took place during the time of the British. Even though the British wanted to set up their cantonment in today’s Ramanagaram in Mandya district, the military engineers found Bengaluru’s topography and proximity to other cities strategically important.“When the British started constructing the cantonment area since they had a base in the Madras presidency, they brought in skilled labourers and traders as part of the development of the cantonment. This is one of the reasons why the cantonment area in Bengaluru has a large Tamil speaking population,” said Moona.“While the migration before independence was limited largely to the Tamil speaking region, post-independence the emergence of industry and public sector undertakings changed the patterns of migrations,” said Janaki Nair, a professor of modern Indian history at the Centre for Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.After Independence, Begaluru became the ideal location for strategic industries as it was away from international borders and its proximity to other major cities. The next big wave of migrants hit Bengaluru in the 1950s and 60s when major public sector undertakings — such as Bharat Electronics and Hindustan Aeronautics — made the city their base.A research carried out by Times Research Foundation in the 1980s shows during the peak of Bengaluru’s industrial era in the 1980’s, 14% of Bangalore’s population was engaged in industrial work associated with the large-scale manufacturing economy led by the public sector undertakings.Both Moona and Nair agreed that from having a large migration of Tamil speaking areas, the emergence of the industries resulted in a wider pool of migrants, especially from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha etc. The linguist influences in the city too changed during this period of time.As per the 2011 census, Kannada speaking population is only 46%, while Tamil speakers constitute 13.99% of the population, followed by Telugu (13.89%), Urdu (12%), Hindi (5.4%) and Malayalam (2.8%).As the city was through another cultural metamorphosis, came globalisation. The open markets and globalisation made Bengaluru the world’s back office. The city which has an ecosystem developed by the industries and the institutes of science and technology, soon became the hub of Information Technology, finding itself a spot among the global cities known for innovative technologies.The strong public sector presence led to private sector manufacturing that began in the late 80’s said Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. “Remote software development was again invented in Bengaluru which led to the growth of the IT industry, which today is close to 190 billion dollars in size. That again created huge technology, which then attracted more capital units and that in turn brought in the venture capitalists who brought young talent from these companies,” he said.As Bengaluru became Silicon Valley of India, the migration patterns in the city too changed. “From having a large Tamil population post-independence, the service industry now witnesses a large migration of the citizens from north-east India,” added Nair.“Bengaluru is one of the few cities where you could survive without knowing the local language or with your mother tongue. That is because the migration has made the city a multilingual and multicultural city. These concepts are common in the new globalised worlds, but Bengaluru had such a culture even before many other cities,” said Moona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-waves-of-migrations-that-shaped-bengaluru-101615660544003.html
