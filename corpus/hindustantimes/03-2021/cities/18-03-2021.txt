We will continue with our protest and our party chief Arvind Kejriwal will be addressing a gathering at Huda Maidan in Jind on April 4 in this regard. It will be a mahapanchayat and we demand that the central government repeal the three laws,” Gupta said in a press conference.Last month, Kejriwal addressed a similar farmers’ gathering in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut.Thousands of farmers from states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have gathered at Delhi’s borders for nearly three months now, protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which were passed in the Parliament in SeptemberWhile the government said the new laws are supposed to reform the agriculture sector, the protesting farmers fear that the laws will do away with agricultural markets, favour industrialists, and affect prices of crops which would further bring down their income.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-to-address-farmers-in-haryana-s-jind-on-april-4-101616092097303.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||12-year-old girl kidnapped, tortured and forced into prostitution rescued by police; 4 held||A 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped from south-west Delhi in January, burnt with cigarette butts, forced into prostitution, and raped by several men, was rescued by the Delhi Police on Tuesday. Police also arrested two men, Sanjay Rajput and Anshu Sharma, and two women, Sapna Goyal and Kanika Roy, who allegedly kidnapped and forced the girl into prostitution. Police said there could be a wider prostitution racket run by the four persons ,who operated through WhatsApp groups and had clients across the country. The police are now probing the racketeers to know if they had kidnapped other children and forced them into the sex trade. The identities of the men, who allegedly raped the minor girl, are also being ascertained as it appears that some of the men knew that the girl was a minor and that she had been forced into prostitution. According to the police, the child lived with her mother in south-west Delhi’s Kapashera. Police said her father had died and she was an only child. Her mother reported her missing on January 21 after which a kidnapping case was registered at Kapashera police station.The police probe has now revealed that the girl was kidnapped when she went out to buy chips from a local shop. The four kidnappers -- two of them from her own neighbourhood -- took her to a nearby house on the pretext of offering her a piece of a birthday cake. The cake, however, was spiked and the girl fell unconscious after eating it, said Urvija Goel, deputy commissioner of police (west). Thereafter, to force the girl into prostitution, they tortured her and offered her pills and drugs, the details of which are yet to be ascertained, the DCP said. “There were cigarette burns on her arms. She was forced to drink alcohol,” said another investigator who did not want to be identified. Once the girl was not in a position to resist, she was pushed into prostitution and raped by men in Delhi and Bihar. “There are text messages to reveal that some men looking for young women were offered the child and informed that she was a minor,” said the unnamed investigator quoted above. The prostitution gang dealt with their customers through WhatsApp. “There were over 150 WhatsApp groups of this racket and had a thousand customers from across India,” Goel said. Police said a team from Rajouri Garden police station in west Delhi was trying to trace some missing children when this girl’s name cropped up. Sometime last month, the police team got in touch with the girl’s mother and realised that the girl was kidnapped by traffickers. “About a month after her disappearance, the kidnappers allowed the girl to make a 30 second phone call to her mother. Her mother wasn’t told about her location,” said a second investigator, who did not want to be identified. A subsequent phone call followed in which the kidnappers urged the mother not to pursue the girl’s disappearance any further. Police said the kidnappers were worried that the police would track them. “They offered her any amount she wanted. But we were in touch with the mother and she only demanded that her daughter be returned to her,” the officer said. Eventually, the police used the communication between the mother and the kidnappers to pursue an online trail left by the suspects. The police traced the girl to Majnu ka Tilla in North Delhi on Tuesday from where she was rescued and her captors arrested. Last year, on average, eight cases of kidnapping of women and children, six incidents of molestation and over four rapes were reported daily in Delhi. There were also 65 cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. However, according to Delhi Police data, all crimes under these particular heads, were considerably lower than in 2019.Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said local police as well as the crime branch, have been pursuing prostitution rackets, particularly those suspected of trafficking women and minor girls. “We also take every missing complaint related to children very seriously. Even this child was traced due to our constant efforts to trace all missing children,” he said.The officer said anyone suspecting the trafficking or abuse of any child must immediately call the police control room on 112. “The aim should be to bring such crimes to the notice of the police immediately,” Biswal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/12yearold-girl-kidnapped-tortured-and-forced-into-prostitution-rescued-by-police-4-held-101616092039280.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||Ministry issues guidelines to keep pollution from making Covid-19 infections worse||In a bid to prevent high levels of air pollution from increasing the severity of Covid-19 infections, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) released a set of guidelines and best practices to be adopted by state governments and citizens to control the spread of infections. RP Singh, secretary, MoEFCC, said Covid-19 is known to seriously impact human health, especially a person’s respiratory system. With Covid-19 cases rising again in several states, Singh said it was important to come up with guidelines to keep vulnerable sections of the population such as senior citizens and children safe. “Creating awareness about air pollution sources, indoor as well as ambient, and associated health impacts in Covid-19 times has become crucial. Addressing the issue of air pollution will lead to a decline in morbidity and mortality, as well as a decline in respiratory related illnesses during the pandemic,” Singh said. Listing in detail the link between high pollution levels and the severity of coronavirus infections, the guidelines said, “Poor air quality affects our lungs and other body organs. It increases the risk of chronic diseases such as COPD, asthma, pneumonia etc.” It added, “Air pollution can exacerbate respiratory and circulatory diseases in patients and vulnerable populations, and can also increase the severity of development of more serious illnesses.” The guidelines have been prepared by Suman Mor, associate professor and chairperson of the department of environment studies, Panjab University, and Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor of environment health department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, PGIMER. This document will also be circulated among state governments and agencies so that the awareness message is disseminated to the public, ministry officials said. In a list of things that citizens can do to control emissions indoors, the guidelines suggested keeping indoor plants, avoiding smoking in closed spaces, using cleaner fuels for cooking, avoiding use of mosquito coils, incense sticks and room freshners, and using micro fibre cloths for dusting furniture. The document also reiterated that people need to ensure proper ventilation in homes and the city administration must ensure strict adherence to the graded response action plan (Grap)—a set of emergency measures to tackle air pollution. Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said that it extremely important that people adhere to all Covid prevention norms to prevent cases from rising further. “Such guidelines are important because cases have started rising again in several states. We should take lessons from other countries, where the moment people and the governments let their guards down, another wave started. Vulnerable groups are still at risk and it is everyone’s duty to protect them,” Dr Maurya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ministry-issues-guidelines-to-keep-pollution-from-making-covid-19-infections-worse-101616092038663.html

The teachers’ body took out a protest march from DU Vice Chancellor’s office to the L-G office on Thursday against the introduction of a new pattern of funding in these 12 colleges.Delhi government’s higher education department last week had asked the governing bodies of these colleges to pass a resolution stating that the pattern of assistance, as suggested by the Delhi government, and not that of the University Grants Commission (UGC), will be followed for the release of grant-in-aid.The resolution was also to state that colleges can use “surplus funds” available with them for the purpose of paying salaries. The student society fund was to be excluded from “surplus funds”, since a legal case on whether student funds may be used for salary purposes is pending before the court. The governing bodies of two colleges, out of the 12, last Saturday had passed such a resolution.Earlier on Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal held a meeting with the principals of these colleges and assured that the government will meet the DU officials to discuss the matter. He had also ordered to release of all pending funds to these colleges. “The strength of the teachers’ collective came to the fore when DUTA protests and mass action programs forced the chief minister to release the much-delayed grant-in-aid to the 12 colleges. He has also promised to release the pending amount in a meeting with principals and chairpersons of these 12 colleges. However, the danger is far from over. The Delhi government is forcing these 12 colleges to adopt in their governing bodies the pattern of assistance issued by the directorate of higher education...The pattern of assistance document needs to be immediately withdrawn,” DUTA said in a statement.The DUTA appeals L-G to intervene and resolve this matter at the earliest, the statement added. A senior government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The government has already assured the principals of 12 colleges that it will take every effort to resolve the matter and discuss it with the university administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-teachers-march-to-l-g-office-over-govt-s-pattern-of-assistance-101616092037502.html
18-03-2021||Other||AAP-BJP trade barbs over air pollution report||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre of failing in its fight against air pollution, while citing the World Air Quality Report 2020 published earlier this week by IQAir – a Swiss organisation – which said that 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities are in India.In a press conference, the AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said that Delhi’s air quality has witnessed some improvement, which he said was due to the AAP government’s efforts. He also thanked Delhi residents for their contribution in combating pollution.In a series of tweets, Union minister Prakash Javadekar, however, dismissed the claims and hit back saying pollution levels in Delhi reduced because of the Central government’s intervention. In a separate statement, Delhi-BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor accused the AAP of complete failure in combating air pollution.“Delhi was once the most polluted cities in the world. Because of the AAP government’s efforts in fighting air pollution, Delhi is now in the tenth spot. I congratulate Delhi residents for their fight against pollution. However, 22 Indian cities rank among the 30 most polluted in the world because the BJP-led Central government has failed,” said Bhardwaj.He further said, “Whenever it comes to air pollution in Delhi, the Central government has always conveniently washed its hands-off. Only a person who knows and understand the importance of environment should head the concerned ministry.”Javadekar, however, hit back and said, “AAP is equal to advertisement and plagiarism… Reduction in pollution in Delhi is largely due to Central government initiatives like leapfrogging to BSVI, Eastern and Western express peripheral ways, closing the Badarpur plant, shifting 3,000 industries on PNG and many such efforts.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Kapoor said, “The AAP government in Delhi does not have any concrete study on the causes of air pollution in Delhi. They have been a complete failure on this front. They should focus on scientific studies and developing strategies, instead of engaging in such misleading things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aapbjp-trade-barbs-over-air-pollution-report-101616092036370.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to double vaccination centres, extend their timings to cover 125,000 people daily||Keeping vaccination centres open for 12 hours and increasing the number of inoculation sites across the city are two of several measures that the Delhi government is taking to increase the daily vaccination numbers from the current nearly 40,000 to 125,000. “Currently, we are vaccinating 30,000 to 40,000 people a day and are planning to increase this to 125,000 soon. The number of centres will also be doubled from the existing 500. At present, Covid-19 vaccination centres operate daily from 9am to 5pm, but their timings will be extended to 9am to 9pm daily,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press conference on Thursday. Towards that end, the Delhi government on Thursday also ordered all its hospitals to extend the timings of their centres from Monday. “It is hereby ordered that with effect from 22.03.2021, all Delhi government hospitals will operate vaccination sites functioning on their premises up to at least 9pm. All facilities will ensure deployment of adequate manpower at these sites to ensure proper functioning of vaccination sites. Non-compliance shall be viewed seriously,” read the order from special secretary (health) SM Ali. In addition, all Delhi government-run hospitals have also been asked to increase the number of sites on their premises to at least six. Even the Lok Nayak Hopsital currently has five vaccination sites while the Rajiv Gandhi superspeciality hospital has four. One of the vaccination centres at the 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, which was the biggest Covid-19 treatment facility in Delhi, already runs round the clock. But, it is only meant for front-line workers who can get shot once their duty time is over. “Currently, we get around 30 to 40 people each day after hours at the centre. Now, everyone in the priority group will be allowed to come between 9am and 9pm to get the shots. From Friday, the hospital will start assessing the space needed for the additional centre and the manpower to keep it open till 9pm,” said a senior administrative official from the hospital, requesting anonymity.INCREASING CENTRESTo increase the number of centres, Delhi will start the immunisation drive at all its dispensaries from next week. “Inspection of dispensaries has been completed and in the next couple of days, all of them will start the vaccine drive -- people will have centres closer to their homes,” said a senior district official, on condition of anonymity. There are around 260 dispensaries run by the Delhi government in the city and currently, they operate only between 9am and 5pm. “We have to see about staff availability and other logistical issues before extending the timings of dispensaries,” the official said. There are, at present, 550 vaccinations sites -- in 208 hospitals and 40 dispensaries -- in Delhi, according to the CoWIN portal. Of them, 325 are in government facilities and 225 in private centres. When the vaccination drive was opened to the general public at the beginning of March, most of the centres (136) were given to the private sector. The government is now looking to bring on board several private sector hospitals as well. “One round of inspection has been conducted at several small hospitals and they are likely to be added to the centres’ list next week. Additionally, we have received requests from private hospitals to keep centres open on Sundays. That is also likely to happen soon,” said another senior district official, also on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-double-vaccination-centres-extend-their-timings-to-cover-125-000-people-daily-101616091979448.html
18-03-2021||Noida||Special surveillance to start in residential areas showing a rise in cases||Ghaziabad: Fresh Covid-19 cases have started to emerge in several residential clusters of Ghaziabad in March, according to data of the district health department. Officials said that they have started with a plan to contain the spread of infection and that five surveillance teams will be deployed in each cluster showing increasing trend of positive cases. According to the data, Raj Nagar residential segment had nine Covid-19 cases in February, but has seen a spike with 38 cases till March 17. Likewise, Ghookhna near Delhi-Meerut Road stood with one case last month, but it has witnessed 16 new cases till March 17. In Sahibabad (II), there were five cases last month and the tally in the current month has gone up to eight till March 17. The officials said that the cases have failed to decline in segment of Shastri Nagar which now has 32 cases as against 38 in February. They further said that Vaishali is also under scanner with 10 cases as against 14 last month. “We have identified the five clusters in which we will deploy five surveillance teams to take up door-to-door surveillance and find out cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness, besides tracking other persons having comorbid conditions. This will help us detect early the suspected cases,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “For immediate testing, we have decided to deploy one mobile van each to these localities. These will be apart from the static testing booths,” Gupta added. The officials said that the plan to deal with rising cases will also be put forward before the chief minister who will take up video conferencing of Covid preparedness on Thursday night. According to the official records, trans-Hindon localities like Indirapuram and Vasundhara which were among the high incidence localities have started to show decline. The records indicate that there were 41 cases in Indirapuram last month while the fresh cases stood at 10 till March 17. In Vasundhara too, the cases were 20 last month and only seven in first 17 days of March. On Thursday, district nodal officer Senthil Pandian C also took a review meeting and directed officials to take up enhanced testing of people coming from other states. “The nodal officer has asked us to undertake testing outside the railway station. We have one booth which was working during the day. Now, we will have two booths on two exits of the station, and they will operate round-the-clock. Further, we have also decided to rope in two teams to track passengers at ISBT Kaushambi. They will be deployed during peak hours and will take up testing,” Gupta said. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. During the first 17 days of March, the district has conducted average of 2,035 tests per day while they conducted about 1,936 average tests per day during the same period in February. The district has a daily target of conducting 3,500 rapid antigen tests and 1,700 RT-PCR tests. The officials said that testing will also be expedited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/special-surveillance-to-start-in-residential-areas-showing-a-rise-in-cases-101616091796175.html
18-03-2021||Noida||Covid crisis: Sample positivity rate starts to rise in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The reducing trend of fresh Covid cases in the district has reversed in March as the sample positivity rate stands at 0.44% in the first 17 days of the month as against 0.31% in February, according to data of the district health department. Officials said that they have taken up measures of increased testing and surveillance in order to check the rise in Covid-19 cases. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials explained. According to the official records, the positivity rate saw a constant decline since November last year when it was 4.14% (4,822 positives out of 116,399 total test reports) and came down to 2.99% (3,034 of 101,496 reports) in December and further to 0.74% January (501 of 67,847 total reports). The records indicate that the trend has reversed with rise in positive cases in the month of March. During the 17 days of March, the district had 173 positive reports out of 39,336 taken up for testing, while in February the number of positive reports was 171 (out of 54,800 total reports).“The trend is somewhat increasing in March and we are trying to track areas where more cases have started to arrive. Recently, 30 positive cases were detected at the national academy of the Central Public Works Department and the area is now contained. We will increase surveillance as well as testing to detect suspected cases and will also resort to micro containment in order to control spread of the infection,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The data also indicates that the overall positivity in the district from March last year to March 17 this year has stood at 3.81% with 29,810 positive test reports resulting from a total of 782,659 test reports. “On one hand we are trying to keep check on the rising cases, while on the other we are trying to increase our vaccination coverage for senior citizens and persons with comorbidities as they are highly susceptible to Covid infection,” Gupta added. Experts are of view that even if the cases may rise in future, the best strategy is to start implementation of measures and strict enforcement. “We already know what actions need to be taken up. So, they must start implementing them immediately, along with strict enforcement. Contact tracing becomes vital in present conditions, along with tracing, testing and treatment,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). So far as the vaccination is concerned, Ghaziabad’s overall coverage is about 2.01% with 90,819 persons receiving the shots from January 16 to March 17, according to the figures of the health department. The district has an estimated population of 4.5 million.In the first phase, the district vaccinated 20,282 beneficiaries out of 27,280 health-care workers while 15652 have also received their second dose till March 17. similarly, 11,756 of 20,259 front-line workers have received their first dose till March 17 and 3,047 have also taken up their second dose. For the vaccination of the third category -- senior citizens and people having comorbid conditions -- that started on March 1, the figures indicate that 35,398 of senior citizens and 4,684 of beneficiaries having comorbidities were given shots till March 17. The overall target for the category is 93,480 for the month of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-crisis-sample-positivity-rate-starts-to-rise-in-ghaziabad-101616091736225.html

18-03-2021||Gurugram||Rural areas account for only 13% of vaccinations under second drive||Rural health facilities of the district account for only 13.2% of the 76,699 Covid-19 vaccines administered between March 1 and 16 under the second phase drive, for people aged above 60 years and those aged 45-59 having comorbidities, according to the data available with the health department.Officials cited obstacles like lack of awareness, the distance between villages and vaccination sites, poor internet connectivity as well as limited sites to administer the shots has hindered the overall turnout in rural blocks of Sohna, Farukkhnagar and Pataudi.There are almost 14 facilities, including two subdivisional hospitals and 12 primary health centres (PHCs) that cover rural areas. As per the data, from March 1 to 16, over 10,172 people took the shot at rural facilities. Overall, 33,090 vaccine doses were administered at government set-ups, while 43,609 were administered at private facilities.Ghangola, a health centre that covers over 50 villages in the Sohna block, has administered only 32 doses in the last two weeks, marking the lowest turnout in the district.Dr Mayank Khanna, medical officer, community health centre, Ghangola, said that technical problems such as poor internet connectivity and lack of awareness among people led to poor footfall. “People are not even aware that they have to carry their mobile phone. During the registration process, an OTP is sent on their mobile number that has to be shared with the data entry operator at the site. Therefore, many of them returned without taking the vaccine shot,” said Khanna.“Some frequent problems related to internet connectivity and access to mobile phones have also hampered the vaccination drive in the area,” he said.Likewise, at Garhi Harsru PHC in Farrukhnagar, which covers over 13 villages, the footfall over the last two weeks was 421. Officials cited poor awareness as the main reason.Dr Shalini Goyal, medical officer of the PHC, said, “First, they were reluctant to get tested and now, equally hesitant to take the vaccine shot. There has been a hitch but it is gradually getting loosened. In the early days of vaccination, only 20 doses were administered in a day. This has now improved to nearly 80 doses in the last few days.”According to Khanna and Goyal, healthcare workers have been trying to motivate people in villages. “But the mindset of the people is that they don’t need to be vaccinated as they live in a healthy environment,” said Khanna.Even among the people who took the shots, many feared losing their monthly pension if they didn’t do so. Ombeer Singh, a 70-year-old farmer in Ghangola, said, “Message has been conveyed through healthcare workers that our pension will be stopped if not vaccinated. That’s why I am taking the vaccine.”Since each PHC in the rural areas caters to a large number of villages, the distance between the PHC and villages has also emerged as a problem. According to Goyal, people from distant villages are yet to visit the vaccination site.To address the issue, the health department has been trying to set up subcentres across Sohna, Pataudi and Farukkhnagar blocks. “At least 80 subcentres across the district will be active before the next mega vaccination drive to be held in the city. A few subcentres have been made functional this week to increase turnout in rural areas,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.According to him, the issue will be discussed in the district task force meeting on Friday.In other semi-rural areas like Rajender Park, Gandhi Nagar, Khandsa, Fazilpur, Basai Enclave, Mullahera, Firoj Gandhi Colony, Laxman Vihar and Sukhrali, the cumulative inoculation of the two weeks varies from 100 to 240. Officials at these centres attributed the low numbers to migratory populations not falling in the prioritised groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rural-areas-account-for-only-13-of-vaccinations-under-second-drive-101616089218042.html

18-03-2021||Gurugram||June 30 deadline to revive rainwater harvesting structures||The Gurugram administration set June 30 as the deadline for civic agencies to ensure that all rainwater harvesting structures in the district are made functional. “Departments or agencies concerned will be mobilised from now so that the rainwater can be managed in the district well before the arrival of monsoon. After checking the functionality of the rainwater harvesting system, they should be mapped and their coordinates uploaded on One Map Gurugram,” said deputy commissioner (DC) Yash Garg. In a meeting on Wednesday, deputy commissioner Yash Garg was apprised that 413 rainwater structures are installed in areas under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and that the same would be made functional.“We will be working on cleaning, de-silting and retrofitting of the available rainwater harvesting systems in the city. We will also be working towards developing new rainwater harvesting systems across Gurugram,” said an MCG official who attended the meeting on Wednesday, requesting anonymity.In March first week, the district administration launched a comprehensive campaign for water conservation to improve the groundwater level in the district. As part of the campaign, the district administration will be checking rainwater harvesting structures on priority, especially at large-scale residential and commercial establishments. In May 2020, the MCG had made it mandatory for all residential buildings, group housing societies, schools, hotels and industrial establishments falling within the limits of the civic body to install rainwater harvesting systems. As per clause 8.1(1) of the Haryana Building Code, rainwater harvesting systems must be installed by the plot owner, in buildings having a rooftop area of 100 square metres or more.The campaign will be carried out by a five-member committee, with representatives from the MCG, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the member-secretary of GuruJal Society, who is also the district development and panchayat officer. The DC also said that a target of building 150 more rainwater harvesting systems in rural areas has been set for the upcoming financial year. “First public notice/order would be taken out mentioning the rainwater harvesting campaign. Non-functionality of rainwater harvesting structures or violation of the norm will lead to the cancellation of occupation certificate,” Garg said. The administration also aims to clean drains through which rainwater can be harvested naturally to increase the groundwater table. On March 1, in a meeting between the district town planners for planning and enforcement and GuruJal, officials decided that a legal framework for the implementation of rainwater harvesting structures in Gurugram will be prepared and a rainwater harvesting enforcement drive will be conducted in the city. Between 2014 and 2018, the groundwater table in Gurugram district reduced by two-and-a-half metres. In 2014, the district recorded an average groundwater level of 26.3 metres. By 2018, this level had dipped to 28.9 metres across four monitoring blocks of Gurugram, Sohna, Pataudi and Farrukhnagar. The latest data obtained from the agricultural department’s groundwater cell revealed that between June 2019 and June 2020, the groundwater table in Gurugram district dropped by 0.27 metres and stood at 29.86 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/june-30-deadline-to-revive-rainwater-harvesting-structures-101616089216860.html

18-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG Budget: Highest collections from property tax, water bills in three years||Despite the coronavirus outbreak, the revenue collection of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) from property tax and water bills was the highest in three years, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said during the civic body’s House meeting on the budget presentation on Thursday.According to Singh, in the 2020-21 fiscal, the MCG has so far collected ₹225 crore in property taxes, which is ₹67 crore higher than the previous fiscal. Similarly, in terms of revenue through the generation of water bills, the MCG has so far netted ₹25.5 crore this fiscal, compared to ₹10 crore in 2019-20.“Despite Covid-19, MCG has managed to generate a lot of revenue. In regard to property tax collection, the MCG has had a higher recovery than the three previous fiscals. Last fiscal, the MCG had recovered around ₹158 crore; in the 2018-19 fiscal, the MCG had collected ₹207 crore and in the 2017-18 fiscal, ₹220 crore. Despite two weeks of the fiscal remaining, the MCG has already netted ₹225 crore,” said Singh.Singh told the House that the MCG is in the process of generating more revenue through property tax collections and is aiming to break its highest annual collection of ₹345 crore, recorded in 2016-17 fiscal, in the next fiscal.Singh also said that the MCG has now turned its attention to generating revenue by issuing water meter bills. He said that in 2018-19 fiscal, the MCG had generated only ₹4.5 crore through this, but that it has been increasing. He said that the revenue further increased to ₹10 crore in 2019-20 fiscal.“For 2020-21 fiscal, the MCG had set a target of collecting ₹20 crore through the issuance of water bills. We have already crossed this figure and generated ₹25.5 crore so far. In the upcoming fiscal, we have set an expected collection of ₹40 crore through this mode, however, this is just a safe figure. We are anticipating a final collection of around ₹50 crore,” said Singh.For the 2021-22 fiscal, the MCG has estimated a revenue collection of ₹4,899.26 crore and an expenditure of ₹2,538.31 crore.The maximum allocation of funds has been reserved for solid waste management, garbage clearance and sanitation services category, amounting to a total of ₹250 crore.The allocation for water bodies (bundh/pond) has seen the highest change in the allocation. From an allocation of ₹20 crore in the current fiscal, ₹37 crore has been allocated for the upcoming fiscal. The category of rainwater harvesting was added to the MCG’s budget and the civic body reserved ₹8 crore for the same in 2021-22 fiscal.Besides the approval of the 2021-22 fiscal budget, agendas such as allotment of land in Babupur village for building a new police station in Rajendra Park, regularising city’s banquet halls, MCG’s pending taking over of Maruti Vihar and Saraswati Vihar, constructing MCG’s office on MG Road was also approved by the House.An agenda asking details on the total number of street vendors under MCG’s street vending policy, the revenue collected from vendors by respective agencies, and the steps taken for generating revenue turned out to be a topic of conflict among both MCG officials as well as councillors.The MCG House meeting had commenced with this agenda, with the commissioner seeking details from Dr Vijay Pal Yadav, the deputy municipal commissioner. Yadav said that he had only assumed charge of the street vending project a few months ago and passed the blame on to his predecessor. Singh found his reply on the matter to be dissatisfactory.The discussion became heated when Yadav started speaking out of turn on various occasions and continued to reiterate his stance even after the mike had been taken away from him. Singh cautioned him repeatedly that such type of behaviour has no place in the House meeting and warned that he would be ejected.Finally, Singh told Yadav to submit a report on the street vending policy within seven days and also cautioned MCG officials that any negligence or dishonesty found on their part regarding this project could invite an FIR being registered against them.The agenda has been pushed forward for the next House meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-budget-highest-collections-from-property-tax-water-bills-in-three-years-101616089156716.html
18-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Parents wait for school admission under EWS category||As private school authorities are preparing to start the new academic session from April, parents are seeking admission under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. They are also worried about the lack of clarity regarding the admission schedule.Prospective applicants said, due to the coronavirus crisis, they could not secure admissions under the EWS category last year and are worried about missing out the chance this year too.The EWS students in classes 2-12 can take admission in private schools, under Section 134A of the Haryana School Education Rules (HSER), 2003. As a part of the admission process, applicants are required to fill up a form and sit for an assessment examination, followed by draw lots.The education department starts the admission process every year between February and March. The admission process could not be completed in 2020 due to a sudden coronavirus-induced lockdown.Vikas Kumar, a parent, had filled the forms for admission in March 2020, but was left in the lurch by the lockdown. Kumar said he was keeping a track of the admission portal this year, but there was no information about the process that usually starts in March. “It seems the admission portal has not been updated yet. It’s displaying information about last year’s admission cycle. We are not sure if the process will start this year, since it was called off in 2020, and there was no subsequent communication from the government about it,” said Kumar, who is hoping to secure his daughter’s admission this year.Another parent, Rakesh Kumar, whose daughter is studying in a private school under the EWS category, said his acquaintances have been enquiring about the admission cycle this year. “The department had initiated the admission process last year but couldn’t complete it. The admission notification for the new session is yet to be issued. Many parents, who are waiting for the admission cycle to start, are mired in troubles. The government should issue directions at the earliest, so that parents can plan accordingly,” said Kumar.Officials from the education department, however, said that the academic schedule had been affected due to the coronavirus outbreak, and the timeline of admissions was bound to change.Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer, said admissions under the EWS category would take place only after government schools are done with the annual examinations. “The academic calendar has been disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic. The ongoing session is likely to continue till April/May, after which annual examinations will be held at schools. EWS admissions are conducted on the basis of scores secured by students in the school examination, so we will have to wait for the session to end, after which we can initiate the admission process,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-parents-wait-for-school-admission-under-ews-category-101616089156105.html

18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Election of civic body posts: Cong caught between rulebook and local leaders’ preferences||Some MLAs of the ruling Congress and a few cabinet ministers are upset with the local bodies department’s proposed method for election for the office-bearers of 117 civic bodies that went to polls on February 14. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had categorically conveyed to a sub-committee led by state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar dealing with the election of office-bearers that 50% reservation for the women candidates should be implemented in true spirit. Ahead of the 2017 state polls, the Congress party had promised 50% reservation for women candidates. Of the 2,302 wards that went to polls this time, 1,151 women were elected as councillors. Khanna MLA Gurkirat Kotli reportedly approached the CM on Thursday and apprised him of a tough political situation arising when the roster is being applied and reservation for office-bearers is done on rotation. He demanded that the decision should be taken after clearance from the party’s local MLA. “By rotation, a councillor of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is getting a chance to become an office-bearer. Does this carry any political wisdom,” Kotli asked. “We have to devise a legitimate method so that the there can’t be anything arbitrary,” cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu told HT. Qadian MLA Fateh Bajwa also felt the same, saying politicians’ suggestions should be taken into consideration. The department, according to its director Puneet Goyal, has moved the case as per the law and provisions in the Punjab Municipal Act-1911. Section 8-A of the Act speaks about the reservation of offices of president (and mayors and other office-bearers). “Offices of president (of the municipalities in the state shall be reserved by rotation in the prescribed manner in the following ration: 5% for Scheduled Castes, 5% for women including women belonging to SCs, and 2% for backward classes,” says the Act. The sub-committee met on Wednesday to ponder over the crucial issue and has sought a legal opinion on if the roster for the election of office-bearers can be tweaked. “We have referred the matter to our seniors for advice,” added Goyal. The local bodies department is expected to receive gazettee notification from the state election department this week after which the local bodies department will give a notice of 14 days to hold the elections of office-bearers. The elections are expected to take place in the first week of April. In a municipal corporation, a woman mayor has been proposed as per the rotation roster, however, a cabinet minister is pushing for his brother to lead a particular civic body. Cabinet minister Aruna Chaudhary, who is part of the sub-committee, said a suggestion has been sought from the legal wing of the local bodies department so that the system of rotation can also be followed to the satisfaction of party MLAs and other leaders. The committee is expected to meet next week, before going to the CM for final clearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/election-of-civic-body-posts-cong-caught-between-rulebook-and-local-leaders-preferences-101616087719454.html

Devi alleged that she had purchased this land in 1994 and she was in peaceful possession of the property. But, Anakima Gautam had purchased the same property from two other persons in 2019.Aggrieved by the two FIRs, Gautam moved the Jharkhand high court by filing a petition to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against her.The bench of justice Ananda Sen on Thursday quashed both the FIRs observing that it came to the notice that none of the documents related to registration of land and others were manufactured.“...No offence under different sections of the Indian Penal Code is made out from bare perusal of the FIRs...The dispute, if any, is absolutely civil in nature for which a civil suit is already pending between the parties before a competent court. So, continuation of criminal proceeding is sheer abuse of the process of the court,” the bench said in its judgement.Earlier, Gautam had argued that false and fabricated cases were lodged against her. Moreover, the matter is connected with civil dispute and no criminal offences are made out, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/hc-quashes-two-firs-lodged-against-bjp-mp-nishikant-dubey-s-wife-101616085436671.html

Sushmita Das, associate professor in the department of microbiology, AIIMS-Patna, resigned on March 4, citing personal reasons. The institute’s governing body, which is the apex authority on appointment and termination of services of doctors at AIIMS, had on February 18 ratified a proposal to terminate the services of three senior faculty members for lacking basic qualification on the date of their appointment. Das was one of them. A month on, the institute, was yet to finalise the minutes of the meeting. In her letter to PK Singh, director of AIIMS-Patna, Das cited that she wanted to discontinue her job as she sought to relocate to Kolkata with her family after the superannuation of her husband from government service on August 31, last year. She also requested that her resignation be accepted with one month’s notice period, effective from March 4. As per AIIMS rules, faculty members are supposed to give three months’ notice period. Though her resignation had been accepted, it was still not clear if the institute had agreed to her request for serving only one-month notice period. “Das has tendered her resignation. I’ve sent the file to the dean office. Let it be processed and we will take a call on it soon,” said Dr Singh. Talking about the minutes of the governing body meeting, Dr Singh said, “We are working on it. We expect it to be ready next week.” Show-cause notice with chargesheets will be issued to the three faculty members, in the dock over their basic qualification at the time of appointment in 2012-13, after the proceedings of the governing body meeting are finalised. An inquiry will be conducted before the institute finally takes a call on termination of their services, said Dr Singh. The faculty members were issued show-cause notices three years back as well, on the insistence of the health ministry, but they became infructuous after the ministry constituted a four-member high-power committee, comprising the directors of AIIMS Bhubaneshwar and Patna, the deputy director and the registrar of AIIMS-Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aiims-faculty-facing-termination-charge-quits-101616085316574.html

18-03-2021||Patna||In a first; Rajgir, Bodh Gaya set to be green energy towns||Rajgir and Bodh Gaya are set to become the country ’s first fully green energy efficient towns, as Bihar vies with Delhi, Goa and Odisha to supply 24x7 clean power round the year through the first of its kind renewable energy hybrid model. The Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a central government PSU, which will develop the system in Andhra Pradesh, has agreed in principle to Bihar’s proposal to feed clean power to the two towns and some important government installations in Patna, including the Raj Bhawan, chief minister’s house, Legislative Assembly, MLA quarters, Patna high court, Gyan Bhawan, Bihar museum and the Vidyut Bhawan. It is now in advance stage of deliberations to grant approval, said an official. “Bihar has opted for a bundle power plan, using solar energy during the day and hydel power through pump storage facility in evening to meet its full requirement of clean power for Rajgir and Bodh Gaya,” said Sanjeev Hans, Bihar’s energy secretary and also the chairman-cum-managing director of the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL). The hybrid power will be available to the two towns from June 2023, said Hans. “The excess solar energy generated during the day will be used to run the turbines to pump and store water in the reservoir upstream and generate hydel pump storage power through it in the evening,” he said. Bihar will purchase 200 MW hybrid power through the SECI. It hopes to get 160 MW solar power during off-peak hours (9.30am to 5.30pm) and 39.93 MW hydel pump storage power during peak hour power demand (5.30pm to 9.30am).At an effective cost of ₹ 4.03 per unit (kWh), Bihar will pay the SECI ₹2.77 billion annually for procurement of the renewable energy power, he added. The state pays an annualised average power purchase at the cost of ₹4.90 to ₹4.96 per unit, with thermal power contributing to 78% of the state’s power share. “Purchasing energy through the power market exchange during peak hours invariably results in incurring more expenditure than the ₹2.77 billion required for renewable energy through the hybrid model. The arrangement with SECI will benefit our DISCOMs (distribution companies),” said Hans. The Centre has also waived off the ₹1 per unit inter-state transmission charges to encourage renewal energy projects commissioned by June 2023. It will also bear the transmission and distribution loss, which is generally up to 2%, in ferrying power from the south Indian state. The SECI had floated the tender last year, inviting stakeholders to avail of green power round the clock through renewable energy. Bihar showed interest in February, this year. What is delaying the SECI nod, said officials, was Bihar’s insistence on customised power supply — 160 MW solar and 39.93 MW hydel — as against the SECI formula to give 37.5 MW through hydel pump storage plant in a 200 MW renewable energy hybrid package. “We are waiting for the power sale agreement with the SECI,” Hans said. Non-conventional energy projects in the state were restricted so far to supply of clean power partially, with backup of thermal power.The SECI said it was in advance level of talks for approval. “We are in final phase of approval. We may finalise the document on power sale agreement with DISCOMs in Bihar hopefully within a week or two,” said a SECI official, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-a-first-rajgir-bodh-gaya-set-to-be-green-energy-towns-101616085137811.html

I have directed the investigating officer in the case to file an application for getting an arrest warrant against all the accused in the case,” he said.The school, Arjun Memorial, is named after the minister’s father, Arjun Rai.

This should not have happened. We should have been accommodated,” said HAM-S president and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi. He, however, said, “We joined the alliance without any precondition.” Before the Cabinet expansion, the former CM had demanded one more ministerial berth. On Wednesday, HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan had spoken about “drastic action” after the party’s claim was overlooked.VIP too expressed its displeasure. “We oppose this. VIP should have been consulted on the issue,” spokesperson Rajiv Mishra said, adding that party president Mukesh Sahni had earlier demanded that a person from Nonia community be made an MLC. The two parties are crucial for the NDA government’s survival in the state as they have 126 members in the House.

Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, who was also in-charge of the law department, moved the Bihar Lokayukta (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which proposes to curb fabricated complaints against public servants. As per the Bill, false complaints will lead to punitive action, including imprisonment up to three years and fine, for the complainant. Though many Opposition leaders, including Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma and RJD’s Lalit Yadav, said such harsh punishment could discourage whistle-blowers and embolden the corrupt, the amendments were rejected. “It has come to light that fictitious complaints are also being lodged before the Lokayukta, which leads to wastage of time of the institution. As there is no provision in the present Act under which action could be taken against those lodging false complaints, the amendment Bill has been necessitated in keeping with such provision in the Lokayukta Act of other states,” says the Bill. Another Bill is the Bihar Taxation Disputes Resolution Bill, 2021, moved by deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio. It proposes to identify ways for growth in state’s resources affected due to the pandemic. It repeals the Bihar Taxation Disputes Resolution Ordinance (second), 2020. “In view of Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected economic activities across the country, it was necessary to bring a new taxation dispute settlement bill with some modifications, though a law in this regard was in place since 2015,” he said. The third Bill is the Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which provides greater autonomy to the civic bodies to ensure smooth, transparent and uniform recruitment process on created posts. It also proposes effective curb on encroachment on public roads. The fourth Bill is the Bihar Civil Courts Bill, 2021. So far, Bihar was included in the Bengal, Agra and Assam Civil Courts Act, 1887, enacted during the British rule. “It is a historic day for the Bihar civil courts,” said Bijendra Prasad Yadav.

Rai said the application was filed under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPc). “Impressed by my life and story, Kaushik along with scriptwriter Imtiaz Hussain met me in 2003.

Certain highly objectionable words have been used in the film. These words hurt my sentiments.”He alleged that Kaushik cheated him by getting an agreement signed for his consent for making the movie. “As per promise, I gave consent to Kaushik to produce the film on my life and struggle.

The ROB from Bhagwatpur to Begum Bazaar being constructed at the time at a cost of ₹48 crore was almost 90 percent complete when the Indian Air Force (IAF) objected to it just before the Kumbh 2019, saying that no NOC had been taken from it for the construction and that the ROB would affect take-offs and landings of its aircraft. The construction work had started in 2017.They claim that just a pillar and connected work remains to be constructed of this 850-metre ROB which has a height of 10 metre. Efforts were made by the officials of the bridge corporation as well as the district administration but the standoff continued and the no objection certificate (NOC) needed from the IAF to proceed ahead did not materialise, officials said.Project manager Amit Verma said out of this estimate, ₹70 crore was for the IAF in lieu of the land needed for the construction while the remaining ₹48 crore was for the ROB construction.Either the IAF will have to be given an alternate land or money. The state government would take a call on this, the official claimed.He said completing the ROB was a high priority of the UP Bridge Corporation and state government.Once complete, the over bridge is expected to greatly improve rural and rural connect of Prayagraj region by providing better connectivity to Kaushambi district and also permanently solve the traffic snarls witnessed in the area, the officials add.The issue of delay in completion of the Begum Bazaar ROB was even raised in Parliament by Phulpur MP Keshari Devi Patel last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-118-cr-estimate-sent-for-incomplete-begum-bazaar-rob-101616084715870.html

However, today, more than one-and-a half lakh daughters in the state have got married (so far under the scheme). Most of them are from poor families,” Adityanath said.He was speaking on the occasion of a mass marriage ceremony where 3,507 couples tied the knot at a huge pandal (tent) set up at the Vrindavan Yojana ground in the state capital.Daughters of construction workers registered in Lucknow, Unnao, Lakhimpur, Barabanki , Sitapur, Rae Bareli, and Hardoi districts got married at the Thursday’s ceremony held as per the accepted religious customs and traditions.The CM congratulated the labour department for successfully conducting the most number of marriages at a single venue. Labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya described the mass marriage as a world record.The previous record was set at Moradabad on February 16 when the marriage of 2,754 poor women had been solemnized, according to the state government.Adityanath said, “Kanyadaan in the Indian tradition is the greatest gift.”The government provides financial assistance of ₹55,000 to each registered daughter, whereas monetary aid of ₹ ₹75,000 is given for the women with disabilities. An arrangement of ₹2.10 crore was made to conduct the community marriage in Lucknow. Ninety-six Muslim couples also tied the knot on the occasion.Follow Covid protocols: CMThe chief minister appealed to people across the state to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols and make use of hand sanitisers and masks. Laying stress on social distancing, Adityanath motivated people to focus on both life and well-being for a prosperous and healthy Uttar Pradesh.He said the state government ensured basic facilities like food, water and shelter to street vendors, 54 lakh migrant labourers and destitute persons and initiated the concept of community kitchens during the lockdown.

He has urged the authorities to probe which variants of the Covid are escaping the vaccine.In a letter, Salunke said, for better efficacy, the second dose needs to be delayed. “This is as if the virus is avoiding antibodies among those vaccinated,” said Salunke, now admitted to a government hospital. According to doctors, Salunke has mild symptoms.During the second week of March, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), an advisory committee constituted by the government, reviewed the gap between two doses and decided to continue with four to six weeks of interval for two doses of Covishield or Covaxin, another vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has on the other hand has recommended two doses with an interval of eight to 12 weeks. The report published in the medical journal Lancet on March 6, 2021, also found strong evidence supporting “a longer-interval immunisation strategy.”On the efficacy of the vaccine, Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of the Epidemiology and Communicable diseases Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research and head of CG Pandit National Chairs of ICMR, said vaccines ensure that the infection is not severe.“When we talk about the efficacy of vaccines, it can protect the patient from severe illness and eventually death. This does not mean that the patient will not get mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. To protect oneself from Covid entirely, following Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and social distancing is important. Whether 14 days or beyond 14 days after the second vaccine doses, the risk of infection remains,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.He further added that it is observed globally, that if somebody gets an infection after vaccination, it is likely that the transmission efficiency to affect others is reduced as the viral load is less.“So after a vaccine is taken the transmission of Covid is less. Wearing a mask is the best solution to avoid Covid infection,” said Dr Gangakhedkar.Last week, two staffers from city-based Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital also tested positive after taking both doses of the vaccine. Both the staffers tested positive after 14 days of taking the second jabs.“I am asymptomatic and have isolated myself at home along with my family. I do not have mild symptoms also. I had taken the Covishield vaccine on March 13,” said Dr Bharti.Dr Bharti added that his family also tested positive. “My wife had taken the second dose of Covishield vaccine, but she tested positive in less than 14 days after taking the vaccine,” said Dr Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-health-officials-test-positive-after-vaccination-urge-govt-to-delay-second-dose-101616083395838.html

Amritsar deputy commissioner (DC) Gurpreet Singh Khaira had made it mandatory to have Covid-19 negative reports for all those attending gatherings. On the sideline of the function, SGPC chief Jagir Kaur said more mega events will be organised to mark the birth anniversary of the ninth Guru ahead of Hola Mohalla in Anandpur Sahib. She appealed to the Sikh sangat to take part in huge numbers in the events. She also condemned the orders of the Amritsar and Rupnagar DCs, saying: “How can lakhs of people get themselves tested within 72 hours?” Kaur said she had requested the CM not to “create hurdles in the events” by getting such orders issued. “If he (the CM) wants us not to organise such events, he should himself make an announcement in this regard. Authorities shouldn’t stop the people from coming,” she said. At the event, social distancing norms were violated and there were few people with face masks, not even the organisers. “The organisers of any social, religious, sports, entertainment or culture event shall ensure that any person attending the event should be either tested negative for Covid 72 hours prior to the event, or should have been vaccinated,” the DC had ordered. He had also said that the ceiling of 100 people (for indoor) and 200 people (for outdoor) for all gatherings shall strictly be enforced. There was provision of fine against the violators. The DC said he will enquire about the Baba Bakala event, adding they have already asked the religious bodies to cooperate with the health department’s guidelines. “With 213 new cases reported on Thursday, we have imposed night curfew in the district. We are also going to ensure strictness in the planned functions of all religions,” he said, adding that if need arises, meetings will be conducted with the religious bodies to make them aware about the seriousness of the condition. Meanwhile, addressing the gathering, Akal Takht’s acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh compared the present time with the Aurangzeb’s rule. He termed the “conspiracies” of governments of the times to oppress the minorities as “dangerous”. “Guru Tegh Bahadur’s entire life was an inspiration for the people. The guru had opposed the conversion of other communities into Muslim religion, and martyred for the cause. The people different religions and cultures live in the country. The religious independence and rights of the people should be protected.” SGPC chief said a special religious procession will be organised on March 20 from Amritsar to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/400th-birth-anniv-of-guru-tegh-bahadur-amid-covid-surge-thousands-take-part-in-baba-bakala-event-101616080756310.html

The Opposition — Congress and CPI (M) — strongly opposed the passage of the amendment bill and members of legislative assembly (MLAs) of both parties walked out of the House in protest.The government, however, clarified that FRBM Bill has been amended to regularise loans taken by the then Congress government in excess of 3 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) between 2019-20 and 2012 -2015.In the absence of chief minister (CM) Jai Ram Thakur, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj said amending FRBM was just a technical aspect. “The former Congress government violated the limit of borrowing between 2012 and 2015. Due to lack of recovery of GST in 2019-20, the limit for taking loans for all states, not just Himachal Pradesh, had to be increased as per instructions. The law has been amended to regularise this increased limit,” Bhardwaj said. Act ammended to correct Cong’s mistakes:BhardwajTaking a strong stance against the Opposition’s criticism, Bhardwaj said the FRBM Act has been amended to correct the mistakes of the former Congress government. “Amendment to FRBM has no relation with increasing the state’s borrowing limit in future,” he said, alleging that the former Congress government not only violated the FRBM Act but also did not think it needed to be rectified. Dismissing the Congress’s opposition as political, Bhardwaj said in the neighboring state of Punjab where Congress is in government, the FRBM Act has been amended to increase the borrowing limit during 2019-20.Earlier, Rakesh Singha of the CPI(M) had strongly opposed the amendment in the FRBM Act saying that if Himachal’s share in the collection of taxes due to GST has come down, the Central government should compensate it and not increase the state’s borrowing limit.This will go down as a black day in the history of HP: Agnihotri Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said, “ The government is committing a sin by passing this Bill and the Congress will not be a partner in this sin. This day will be known as a black day in the history of the state.” Agnihotri advised the government to withdraw the bill and send it to the select committee for reconsideration. “To compensate the loss of revenue due to reduction in the recovery of GST, the state government should go to Delhi with the Cabinet and the Opposition, demanding a special economic package from the Prime Minister, finance minister and minister of state in Delhi. It should be done so that the state can be saved from the burden of debt.” Congress’ Jagat Singh Negi, Harshvardhan Chauhan and Asha Kumari opposed the bill saying that the government cannot raise the limit of borrowing forever under the guise of a one-time exemption in the limit of borrowing.Congress and CPI (M) MLA Rakesh Singha walked out of the House before the Bill was passed. Urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj condemned the Opposition’s walkout, saying the government had to bring amendments to the FRBM Act much earlier, but it was delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-passes-budget-management-amendment-bill-amid-opposition-s-walkout-101616078476366.html

All these containment zones are residential housing societies, supposedly, sealed by the civic bodies.However, all evidence points to the contrary. Residents are not following containment rules and moving in and out of the housing societies freely. Some residents of societies declared as micro-containment zones have temporarily shifted residence to avoid the restrictions on movement.Sun Universe society, which has been sealed by the Narhe gram panchayat since March 12, is a huge society located near the Navale bridge chowk.There is a hoarding declaring “micro containment zone”, displayed at the entrance. Movement in and out of the society, however, when HT visited the area on Thursday, was unrestricted.Speaking anonymously, a resident of the society said, “There Covid positive cases found in our society and Narhe gram panchayat workers came and sealed our society. I work in a private office and didn’t want to be stuck inside the society, so I have moved to my relative’s place for a few days.”Sushant Kute, ex-sarpanch and current member of the Narhe gram panchayat, said, “A second wave of Covid-19 is possible, so residents should follow rules strictly. We have found people roaming without masks, social distancing is not maintained properly and so some tough decisions had to be taken. Now there is a close watch on the micro containment zones in our gram panchayat and if needed we will make it stricter.”Similarly, PMC has also sealed several housing societies in the city. One such area is lane number 10 of Rajas Society, under the Kondhwa-Yewalewadi ward office.As per the order issued by Jyoti Dhotre, assistant municipal commissioner and ward officer, “As the number of Covid cases have gone above five in this area, it has been declared a micro-containment zone. Thermal checking of each person living in the area will be conducted and if the oxygen level is found below 94, that person will be immediately sent for a swab test. Residents should strictly follow the containment rules and do keep proper social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/microcontainment-is-mega-covid-test-residents-of-specific-zones-are-failing-101616078055442.html

Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Thursday that Singh was transferred after some of his colleagues committed "serious and unforgivable mistakes"."This is not an administrative transfer (of Singh). Some things have come to light through the probes conducted by the NIA (National Investigation Agency) and the ATS (Anti-Terror Squad)," Deshmukh said at an event in Mumbai, according to news agency PTI.Also Watch: Decoding the fallout of Param Bir Singh's ouster for Maharashtra's ruling coalition"Some of the colleagues of the (former) Mumbai police chief (Singh) committed some serious mistakes. Those are unforgivable mistakes. Hence, he was transferred," Deshmukh further said in his first public comments after Singh's transfer.The minister said that action will be taken against whoever is found guilty in the respective probes by the NIA and ATS.Singh was transferred on Wednesday amid the controversy over last month’s bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and subsequent arrest of former police officer Sachin Vaze.Although Singh, a 1988-batch officer, was transferred in a minor reshuffle of top police posts, it was clear that the ruling coalition - comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress - held him responsible for the inept handling of the bomb scare case.Vaze’s Saturday arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is said to be the reason behind his sudden transfer.Also Read: Vaze did it for lost glory, says NIAVaze, an "encounter specialist", has also been facing heat in the murder case of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of that SUV.

18-03-2021||Pune||Forum directs Pune-based developer to pay ₹3.56L with 10% interest for denying refund to consumer||PUNE The Pune district consumer redressal forum has directed FC road-based Xrbia developers to pay a compensation of ₹3.56 lakh with ten per cent interest to a consumer for denying a refund after she withdrew from a project. The forum has also asked the developer to pay an additional ₹28,000 towards compensation and expenses within forty-five days from the date of order.The forum comprising of members Anil Jawalekar, Shubhanghi Dunakhe and JV Deshmukh passed the order to the effect after a complaint was lodged by Shashikala Kamble, a resident of Sinhagad road.The complaint was filed on November 27, 2018, and the order was passed on March 16, 2021.Kamble in her complaint stated that she had booked a one BHK flat number 611 in the C3 building of the Eiffel towers residential project and also booked a 2 BHK flat number 602 in the A2 building of the said project. She paid ₹3.56 lakh through two cheques to the developer. After fourth months, Kamble got the quotation from the builder and found that she had been charged more for less area of the flat. She claimed that she was not informed about the reduction of the flat areas in square feet and took the decision to withdraw from the project and sought a refund. She requested for refund but her plea was denied. Accordingly, she filed a complaint with the consumer seeking compensation of ₹3.56 lakh with 24 per cent interest.Xrbia in its reply stated that the complaint was wrong and fabricated. “The complainant had booked flat 611 in C3 building and A2 in 602 building. The complainant had made a misrepresentation of size ( square feet ) in the complaint and after a complete inquiry had paid ₹3.56 lakh. The complainant cancelled the booking for personal reasons and never requested a refund.”“There is no reason behind the lodging of the said complaint by her. The complainant does not have any right to lodge a complaint and the said complaint must be dismissed thereof,” Xrbia stated in a written statement before the forum.The forum in its order stated “It can be concluded that Kamble had given ₹3.56 lakh to the developer. From the papers submitted on record, it is evident that the developer has not refunded the complainant post cancellation of the booking. In its written submission, the developers said that it was appropriate to return the amount after taking the booking cancellation charges. However, the developer has not submitted any proof related to how much was scheduled to be recovered as cancellation charges and how much amount was to be refunded.”“Despite repeated requests, the developer did not refund the booking amount exhibiting deficiency in service. The complainant is eligible to claim a refund along with interest from the developer,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/forum-directs-pune-based-developer-to-pay-rs-3-56l-with-10-interest-for-denying-refund-to-consumer-101616073255150.html

A day before the session began on March 5, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala said that he did not agree with the phrase love-jihad, a term coined by state home minister Anil Vij for the proposed Bill. Chautala said that his Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), an ally of the ruling BJP, will support the move to enact a law for stopping forced religious conversions. “But if someone is willing to convert on his own, there should not be a bar,” he said. Vij had said earlier that the state government planned to introduce the Bill to curb love-jihad in the assembly’s budget session. On November 6 last year, he told the assembly that the government was compiling information about instances where forced religious conversions took place to give effect to an inter-faith wedding. Chief minister ML Khattar had also said that the state government would introduce the Bill to stop forced conversions. “People are free to adopt any religion in an informed manner but using coercion, allurement to force religious conversions is a matter of concern. We are studying similar laws enacted by other states and will accordingly take a call,” Khattar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/freedom-to-religion-bill-doesn-t-make-it-to-haryana-budget-session-101616071695727.html

18-03-2021||Lucknow||Blessed by PM Modi, Varanasi’s wooden toys get makeover for new markets||The wooden toy engine displayed in a shop starts chugging and the wooden lantern begins to glow, while the chariot rolls forward with the press of a button. These are modern versions of the famous lacquered wooden toys of Varanasi, known for antiquity and beauty, as they come alive in a designer and electric ‘avatar’ to keep pace with the demands of the global market. These traditional wooden toys, including train engines, carts, chariots, and lanterns are now battery-operated, courtesy awarded designer craftsman Rajkumar Singh. Singh started working on electric wooden toys last November and succeeded in operating the wooden train engine with a battery. Later wooden chariots, wooden carts and wooden lanterns were also fitted with batteries. “The new concept of wooden toys has got a very good response from the buyers in the domestic market. People like them,” said Singh and added that many people bought them for decoration purposes, while children purchased them to play. “Battery operated wooden toys, including train engines, wooden carts, chariots and lanterns are all set to land in the international market. Initially, we are making 100 sets of each of these wooden toys for export,” Singh said. These toys will be exported to Russia, Germany, France, Australia, USA and also Sri Lanka, Japan and Thailand to gauge the response, added Singh. A post graduate in fine arts, Singh learnt the craft of shaping wood into toys from his father, national merit award winner craftsman Rameshwar Singh, who had been carving gods and goddesses for three decades. Singh said wooden parrots, myna, elephants, horses and chariots were much in demand in domestic markets, while Russian dolls, Indian dolls and traditional Indian couple were in demand abroad.His father and ace craftsman, Rameshwar Singh, is quite enthusiastic after getting an assurance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who spoke to him via video conferencing after inaugurating the toy fair.“I am thankful to PM Modi for assuring us all possible support for the promotion of wooden toys. His assurance has acted as a catalyst and encouraged all the artisans to innovate further in making wooden toys. We are working on new designs while maintaining antiquity and exclusiveness of the toys.” Singh is the son of late Ramkhilawan Singh, who was popularly known as the ‘Bhishma Pitamah’ of wood craft and toy making. He played a crucial role in reviving wooden toy making in Varanasi over three decades ago when this craft was dying, said Padma awardee Dr Rajnikant, who is credited with getting GI (geographical indication) tag to 13 handicraft items, including wooden toys in Kashi. The wooden toys made in Kashi are exclusive in design and diversity. Wooden toys on mythological characters are also made here. The artisans also make beautiful masks, which are used by the actors in Ramleela. In addition, toys like ghunghuna, jhunjhuna, different birds, horses, elephants, carts and many more are made of wood. Dr Rajnikant said idols of deities were very popular and high in demand in Mauritius and certain other countries. Omprakash Sharma, another awarded craftsman, is expert in making wooden idols of deities, he said. According to him, a common facility hub equipped with a training centre for diversification in designs of wooden toys, a raw material depot and proper packaging centre should be set up in Kashi to make artisans aware of the current international and national trends. The size of Varanasi wooden toys’ market is around ₹15 to 20 crore including annual exports worth ₹5 crore, said an official. Divisional commissioner, Varanasi, Deepak Agarwal said, “A concrete plan has been made for promoting export of the wooden toys and other handicraft items made in Kashi. As part of the plan, craftsmen and artisans are being imparted training in design diversification.” He said a group of artisans had already been imparted training, including soft skills. They are also being introduced to online platforms, where they may sell their products. Through this training, the artisans are also imparted knowledge of basic financial literacy, including handling foreign exchange and learning the process to register their products for export to reduce their dependency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/blessed-by-pm-modi-varanasi-s-wooden-toys-get-makeover-for-new-markets-101616069355661.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||More leaders likely to follow Baig into People’s Conference||The People’s Conference, which split from the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, is trying to expand his base across Jammu and Kashmir. After former deputy chief minister Muzaffar Baig, a former patron of the People’s Democratic Party, joined the People’s Conference, the party has received a major boost. Baig, a former MP from Baramulla had left the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) after his wife was denied a district development council (DDC) ticket.The People’s Conference (PC) had contested the DDC polls with the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of mainstream parties fighting for the restoration of Article 370, and had managed to win eight out of 12 seats in Kashmir where party candidates contested polls. After exiting the PAGD, the party managed to keep its hold on two important DDCs — Baramulla and Kupwara.PDP spokesperson Adnan Ashraf said many senior leaders will be joining the PC in coming days. “This is true but names cannot be revealed at the moment.”In a few days, Baig’s wife, Safeena Baig, who is DDC chairperson of Baramulla DDC, will also join the party. “Around half-a-dozen senior leaders are ready to join the PC, which will further strengthen the party across Kashmir and replace traditional parties. The PC is trying to attract more leaders to the party,” said a leader close to Sajjad Lone.The party’s general secretary and prominent Shia leader, Imraz Reza Ansari, had also dropped hints that many leaders will join the party and had even resigned from the post of general secretary to pave way for other senior leaders. However, Lone did not accept his resignation and praised him for his magnanimity.Sources within the PC said that half-a-dozen former ministers and legislators, including two former parliament members, could join Lone’s party. Most of leaders are from north and South Kashmir. Political analyst and editor of a local newspaper Asem Mohiudin says in the prevailing political situation changing political parties seems the only activity in Kashmir’s mainstream camp.“All local political leaders and parties find themselves on the defensive. Some emerging political parties are trying to grab the opportunity, especially the People’s Conference and Apni Party, to get some stalwarts into their fold to lend weight and legitimacy to their parties.” He said these parties have their eye on the next election in J&K. However, emergence of the People’s Confrence could dampen the Apni Party’s prospects. The Apni Party is trying lure former legislators and leaders towards the party after it was formed by Altaf Bukhari last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-leaders-likely-to-follow-baig-into-people-s-conference-101616068335957.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Open-ended NBW against Canada gangster behind YC leader killing||A Faridkot court has issued an open-ended non-bailable arrest warrant against the Canada-based main conspirator of the killing of the district Youth Congress president, Gurlal Singh Pehalwan. The district police had approached the court of chief judicial magistrate, Faridkot, Harvinder Singh Sindhia, seeking the open-ended non-bailable arrest warrant of Satinder Singh, alias Goldy Brar, who is living in Canada at present. This would help the police get a red corner notice issued against him. Unlike a non-bailable warrant, an open-ended non-bailable warrant does not carry a time limit for execution, while the red corner notices are issued by Interpol or international police on the request of a member country to prohibit the movement and subsequent handing over of an accused from across the globe. On February 18, two unidentified men shot dead 34-year-old Pehalwan near Jubilee Chowk in Faridkot. Pehalwan died on the spot after sustaining 12 bullet injuries. A few hours after the murder, a post on a purported Facebook page of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently in Rajasthan’s Ajmer jail, linked the crime with the death of Bishnoi’s aide Gurlal Brar, a former state president of the Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU). Brar was killed outside a mall in Industrial Area, Chandigarh, in October 2020. On February 21, Delhi Police arrested three men and claimed the murder was the fallout of a gang rivalry and it was orchestrated by Goldy Brar, with the help of Bishnoi, to avenge the murder of his cousin Gurlal Brar. After arresting other suspects in the murder case, the Faridkot police named Bishnoi and Goldy as conspirators in this crime. The Faridkot court has already issued production warrants against Bishnoi. He will be produced in the court here on March 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/openended-nbw-against-canada-gangster-behind-yc-leader-killing-101616067555273.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM not in favour of job quota for locals||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday opposed the policy of job reservation for locals being followed by some states, including neighbouring Haryana. The chief minister said he was not in favour of the policy of excessive regionalisation being followed by certain states, announcing that “Amarinder stands for India for Indians”. “I believe that India is one country and too much regionalisation is not a good thing,” he said in response to a question on the Congress’ promise on compulsory recruitment of locals by private industry. In its 2017 manifesto, the Congress had promised “compulsory recruitment of local youth by industrial investors in Punjab up to 50% of the total workforce”. Recently, Haryana reserved 75% of jobs for locals in the private sector. Pointing out that there was no state in India where Punjabis were not flourishing and doing well, the chief minister said: “Why can’t Punjabis buy land in Himachal Pradesh or why don’t they have certain rights in Kashmir and Rajasthan?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-not-in-favour-of-job-quota-for-locals-101616065935427.html

Singh added an inquiry has been initiated.The train with 60 people on board was on its way to Tanakpur from Delhi when it ran over a cow near Tanakpur railway station, officials aware of the matter said. The train was stopped before it started running in the reverse direction due to pressure pipe leakage that resulted in brake failure, they added. It moved at a speed of 40-50km per hour and sparked panic on board before it was stopped near Goshikuon by putting soil and aggregates on the railway track, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/railways-suspends-loco-pilot-for-running-train-in-reverse-direction-for-20-km-101616065575383.html

The online election easily went the Sena way after 27 BJP corporators defected, and went on to vote for Sena candidates from a Thane hotel where they were lodged. Jayshree Mahajan won the mayor’s seat while Kulbhushan Patil won the election for the deputy mayor’s post.In the 2018 civic election, the BJP had got a clear majority by winning 57 seats in the 75-member corporation while the Sena bagged 13 seats. With the entry of 27 corporators, the Sena’s strength has risen to 40. It also had the backing of Independent corporators in the mayor’s election.This is the second setback for the BJP after it lost control over the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad civic body to NCP-Congress around three weeks ago. Sena leaders claim that the municipal councillors rejected the BJP as it did not give them their due. Jalgaon guardian minister and Sena leader Gulabrao Patil said disgruntled corporators got in touch with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray and Eknath Shinde. “BJP did not fulfil promises made to these corporators. Senior leaders did not even know the names of their corporators...that’s why it is our [Sena] flag atop this corporation today,” said Patil, a minister in the MVA government in the state.Former BJP leader who quit the party to join the Nationalist Congress Party, Eknath Khadse, who hails from Jalgaon district, said, “BJP had singlehandedly held power in Jalgaon, but in the past 2-1/2 years, there have been several issues, including road works and water issues, which made corporators unhappy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-maharashtra-sena-wrests-jalgaon-civic-body-s-control-from-bjp-101616064555221.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Will move SC if President doesn’t give assent to Punjab amendments: CM||Reiterating that his government was opposed to the Centre’s farm laws, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Government of India to scrap the legislation and bring in new laws after fresh discussions on the issue with farmers. The chief minister declared that “we will go to the Supreme Court if the President does not given assent to the state amendment Bills”, which unfortunately the governor is still sitting on instead of forwarding them for presidential approval, even though the Vidhan Sabha had unanimously passed the Bills, with all parties voting for them. “It’s tragic, however, that the Akalis and the AAP later started playing political games on the issue,” he said. Addressing mediapersons on the completion of four years of his government, the chief minister declared that he could not see any middle path to break the stalemate between the farmers and the Centre. “What’s the use of making it a prestige issue? How many more farmers do you want to kill (with your adamant stand)? There are poor farmers sitting out there, with women and elderly,” he said, adding that Punjab alone has lost 112 farmers’ lives since the agitation began. “The Constitution has been amended more than 100 times in the past, so why can it not be done again to scrap these laws?” he asked. Delhi does not understand agriculture: CM The chief minister said he didn’t understand why the Centre was trying to break the age-old time-tested relationship between farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents). “The new laws are not an improvement on the existing system but will destroy the farming sector,” he said, asking where the poor farmers, comprising 75% of Punjab’s farmers, would go in case of need once the arhtiyas are replaced by big faceless corporates. “Delhi does not understand agriculture,” he said in response to a question on the new FCI policy of direct payment to farmers. In any case, said the chief minister, agriculture is a state subject, and the Centre has no right to legislate on the matter. Rebutting allegations of being party to the decision on the farm laws as a member of the Centre’s high-powered committee, he said that Punjab was not a member when the panel was initially announced and was included only later, by which time any policy decision had already been taken at the first meeting (in Punjab’s absence). The second meeting had financial agenda, and at the third, the agriculture secretary was present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-move-sc-if-president-doesn-t-give-assent-to-punjab-amendments-cm-101616063175466.html

Gupta, also a member of the Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment, was declared dead after the MIG-21 Bison aircraft crash."The mortal remains of Indian Air Force pilot Ashish Gupta rested at the crematorium for last rites in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. He died in the MiG-21 Bison crash yesterday,” ANI tweeted.Gupta, according to Bharat Rakshak, had been a part of the fighter squadron and also trained to become a squadron pilot. He had previously also been eligible to fly the T-75 and Jaguar aircraft and held the position of a 4 aircraft Leader as well as of a trainer captain.During 'Operation Vijay' Gupta, flew 16 photo-reconnaissance missions to the enemy-held areas in Kargil, Mushkoh and Batalik sectors at altitudes of 1500' to 10,000' AGL. The mission was successful since IAF managed to retrieve vital information about the enemy locations using Gupta's professional acumen, excellency in flying and filming enemy targets. These photographs enabled the Air Force to strategise fire attacks, and also reduce IAF casualties. For his exemplary work during Operation Vijay, he was honoured with the Vayu Sena medal of 1999."A MiG-21 Bison aircraft of IAF was involved in a fatal accident this morning, while taking off for a combat training mission at an airbase in central India," the IAF said in a tweet."The IAF lost Group Captain A Gupta in the tragic accident. IAF expresses deep condolences and stands firmly with the family members. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause of the accident," it added.Also read: IAF group captain killed in MiG-21 Bison crash in GwaliorThursday’s crash, in which Gupta was killed, is the second accident involving a MiG-21 Bison this year after an aircraft crashed near Rajasthan’s Suratgarh on January 5 but the pilot ejected safely.The Soviet-origin MiG-21 Bison is an upgraded version of the MiG-21 aircraft that IAF began inducting in the 1960s. IAF has around six squadrons of MiG-21 Bisons, which are capable of carrying beyond-visual-range missiles and other potent weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mig21-crash-mortal-remains-of-iaf-fighter-pilot-taken-for-last-rites-101616051205566.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sports university of Haryana Bill referred to select committee||The Haryana assembly on Thursday referred the Sports University of Haryana Bill, 2021, reintroduced in the House on Wednesday, to a select committee on Bills of the assembly. The Bill was withdrawn on March 8 following an objection by the central government. The reintroduced Bill carried a controversial provision (clause 6) which said that no special provision for employment or admission of women, persons with disabilities or of persons belonging to weaker sections of society, Scheduled Castes, and the other socially and educationally backward classes of citizens shall be made on the ground of domicile. This was first highlighted by Hindustan Times. Since the state government recently enacted a law providing 75% reservation in private sector jobs to Haryana domicile candidates, the provision in the sports university Bill runs contrary to it. Congress MLAs BB Batra, Kiran Choudhry, Raghuvir Singh Kadian, led by leader of the opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda, raised the issue of domicile when the Bill came up for discussion in the assembly on Thursday. “The state government has gone in for reservation for Haryana domicile candidates in private sector jobs. But the Sports University of Haryana Bill says that domicile will not be a ground for employment or admission of women, persons with disabilities, weaker sections, Scheduled Castes,” Choudhry said. Subsequently chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar referred the Bill to a select committee of the assembly. The Bill was initially passed by the state assembly in August 2019 and was reserved by the governor for consideration of the President. Subsequently, the Union home ministry, in December 2019, wrote to the state government citing a Union HRD ministry office memorandum stating that as per the University Grant Commission (UGC) regulation, the chairman of the UGC will nominate a member of the selection committee for selection of vice-chancellor of state, private and deemed universities. In over five decades, this is only the fifth occasion when a Bill has been referred by the state assembly to a select committee for examination. Former Haryana assembly secretary to Speaker Ram Narain Yadav told HT that only four Bills have been referred to the select committee since 1966 when the first sitting of the assembly took place. Yadav said the first was Haryana Cattle Fair Bills referred to the select committee on June 15, 1967 and again on February 11, 1969. “The next were - Haryana Canal and Drainage Bill, 1973 referred on November 16, 1973; Indian Electricity (Haryana amendment) Bill, 1986 referred on December 2, 1986; and Haryana Lokpal Bill, 1996 referred on November 22, 1996,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sports-university-of-haryana-bill-referred-to-select-committee-101616061615386.html

The organisation wants colleges to either refund fees, such as annual college fees, or adjust it in the 2021-22 academic year. MNVS cited examples of colleges reportedly flouting university norms to over-charge students, and also highlighted instances of fees charged for heads/services not used by students in the last one year. “The MU has clarified that colleges can only charge ₹500 as development fees, however, several affiliated colleges are charging anywhere between ₹3,000 to 5,000 and some also threaten students if the fees is unpaid,” said Santosh Gangurde, state vice president, MNVS. “The university requested colleges to not charge excess fees, but clearly colleges are playing by their own rules. We request the university to take action against such colleges that flout rules,” added Gangurde.In October last year, less than a month after colleges reopened with the help of virtual classes amidst Covid-19 pandemic, a varsity circular asked affiliated colleges to give students the option of paying fees in instalments due to the economic stress as a result of Covid-19 crisis. Colleges were also asked not to charge library or laboratory fees, or fees for other activities, since classes were being held online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-students-body-allege-overcharging-by-mumbai-university-colleges-101616052675389.html

The problem is people are going to hospitals too late, he said. He appealed to citizens to wear masks and maintain social distancing, warning that penalties may also be enhanced if required.The chief minister hoped the Centre would accept his suggestion at the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on opening up vaccination to younger people in the worst-hit areas and also to those in public dealing.Capt not for restricting religious movementTo a question on Himachal Pradesh CM’s statement seeking curbs on people coming in from Punjab for pilgrimage and religious purposes, Captain Amarinder said he was not in favour of restricting religious movement.

Last year some people erected a hut next to a small temple and even ploughed a small patch to grow vegetables. We reported this and a team demolished the tent. On March 16, a similar encroachment was reported on the hill and again, a rapid response team from the firest department ensured that it was taken down. Unless strict action is taken immediately, such structures tend to rapidly become permanent ones with concrete and bricks, which then becomes impossible to remove,” said Sushma Date, member of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti (DGPS). In another instance, an illegal encroachment was razed to the ground on Mahatma tekdi due to the intervention of Vandana Chavan, who highlighted the encroachment. According to tekdi lovers, though the administration has strict rules on paper as regards all areas marked under the biodiversity park reservation (BDP), the administration is not on the ball in terms of implementation. According to activists, encroachments on hills in Katraj, Kondhwa and Baner have doubled in the last five years. “Despite knowing that these hills belong to the BDP, they are being ignored by the municipal officials and complaints from locals are disregarded,” added Date. Similarly, the Baner tekdi is also under attack with encroachments in the form of a statue and gazebo on a hillock that is part of Sr.no. 49/1 of the Baner biodiversity park. Recently, a new encroachment, in the form of a “Buddha Vihar”, is visible since April 2020. This is atop a hill adjacent to the ongoing construction of the Sus-Pashan bridge. “Various politicians have come to check the Pashan-Sus bridge/flyover work, but no one utters a word against this structure. PMC officials have categorically ignored this encroachment,” said Pushkar Kulkarni, from Save Baner Hills. “We are urging PMC and local authorities to use technology and satellite imagery to scan and check for encroachments on the tekdis,” added Kulkarni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-hills-have-eyes-activists-residents-ensure-encroachments-on-city-s-tekdis-stay-on-pmc-radar-101616052253411.html

The year was 1943. She was about to get married in a couple of months and her colleagues demanded she treated them to a plate of fritters. So they went to “Balkrishna Upahargruha”, near the Central Building in Pune, one Saturday afternoon, and ordered three plates of fritters which were shared by the group of five women. They then returned to their work in the Rationing Office. The Second World War had entered India then. While India had been spared the material destruction that had befallen many other countries, she had suffered the devastating economic consequences of war. The British Government was forced to introduce the first structured public distribution of food-grains in India through the rationing system of a fixed quantity of ration (jowar, rice, sugar, kerosene) to ration card holders in several cities and towns. The system was started in September 1939 in Bombay and subsequently extended to other parts of India. By the end of 1943, 13 cities had been brought under the coverage of rationing (including Pune), and by 1946, as many as 771 cities/towns were covered. The system catered to some rural areas, suffering from chronic shortage, as well. The Department of Food under the Government of India was created in 1942, which helped in food matters getting the serious attention of the government. When the rationing office was set up in Pune in early 1940, the first batch of employees comprised 17 women. Annapurnabai Apte was one of them. She had just got out of school. When one of her classmates told her about the new office employing girls, she decided to grab the opportunity and showed up at the office, without informing her family. She was asked to start working immediately. There was no interview.The War forced women to step out of their houses to contribute to household expenses. Their responsibilities were often clerical and limited to non - combat positions away from the frontlines. In India, women were either enlisted as nurses, or they worked at the rationing offices. Great care was taken to not abandon the domestic ideals in India. Women were given the traditional responsibility of providing and distributing food. Men were employed at the armament depots and factories set up in Khadki, Dapodi and Aundh. The men earned ₹40 at the armament depots. The women earned ₹20 per month at the rationing offices. They were entrusted with making ration cards, keeping records, drafting letters, maintaining inventories and tracking orders. The women were young and timid. Many of them had never ever spoken with men outside their homes. They suddenly found themselves in an unfamiliar environment, entrusted with work for which they had no prior experience. They would often fumble, or could not speak at all. They would get the names on the cards wrong and would burst into tears when people complained and their bosses scolded them.Men found this funny. They would visit the rationing offices and enjoyed themselves when the women found it hard to answer pointless queries of visitors. One morning in 1941, an elderly gentleman visited the rationing office in the Central Building. The female staff were asked to assemble in a hall. The gentleman asked the women to be more confident and believe in their abilities and skills. “You have been given a great opportunity to work outside your homes, make the most of it. Always remember that if you fail, women would be condemned to household chores all their lives. You have to set a benchmark for them. People are hungry. They have little money. It is your responsibility to make sure they are fed properly. Do not let them down”, he told them. He was RP Paranjpye, the first Indian to achieve the coveted title of senior wrangler at the University of Cambridge.Annapurnabai narrated this incident to me one evening in August, 2012. I was roaming around Kasba peth looking for a hostel established in 1880s by the Satyashodhak Samaj, and someone directed me to her. She was 92 then. She knew nothing about the hostel, but I got to listen to the gutsy lady narrate her experiences working in the rationing office and later, at the District Collectorate. She and the 16 other women from the first batch worked till their retirement at the age of 55. They bought bicycles with their salaries, educated their younger siblings and later married them off. They started wearing sarees differently. They relished puri-bhaji and misal occasionally at Santosh Bhuvan and bought jalebis at Mathura Bhuvan. They built homes and their careers. Their courage resulted in more women working in offices and factories. Annapurnabai and the other women at the rationing offices made sure they did not let RP Paranjpye and Pune down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-war-rationing-office-conquers-new-dimension-for-women-s-lives-independence-101616050753350.html

Attempts are now being made to revive the virtually defunct department with appointments to vacant posts.Highly placed officials in the state home department said no vacancies have been advertised in Bihar since 2018. A senior home department officer said files were sent to the CM’s secretariat twice but nothing happened. “Now efforts are on to fill the vacant posts with the state police officers,” said the official.Set up in 2006, the SVU used to be a crack team of former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials and was assigned a separate headquarters on the Serpentine Road in the state capital. However, till date, the SVU has filed only 22 cases and most have not reached any logical conclusion since charge-sheet could only be filed in 12 cases, said officials in the department, on condition of anonymity.Almost 14 years since its formation, the SVU has become virtually defunct with only one out of the six posts of superintendents of police (SPs), meant for former CBI personnel, being occupied by a retired officer Arun Kumar Sharma, whose contract is likely to end in a couple of weeks. Only retired CBI officials are eligible for the posts of SPs in the SVU.The unit, now headed by a full-fledged additional director general (ADG) rank officer Sunil Kumar, once had seven IG rank officers, most of them holding additional charge of the unit. The post of the deputy inspector general (DIG) in the unit is still lying vacant.Former director general of police (DGP) Narayan Mishra was the first government official to come under the department’s scanner. Booked on February 6, 2007 in a disproportionate assets (DA) case, Mishra was charged for amassing wealth worth ₹1.35 crore, when posted as director general (DG), homeguards and fire services.Then secretary of minor irrigation department, S S Verma, was the second bureaucrat to be booked in a DA case on July 3, 2007 for allegedly amassing property worth ₹1.43 crore beyond his known sources of income. The unit lodged the last DA case on January 14, 2019 against the then joint director of Industry department Sanjay Kumar Singh.Development commissioner, Amir Subhani, who also holds the charge of vigilance commissioner remained unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nitish-kumar-s-apex-corruption-fighting-unit-hit-by-staff-crunch-101616050214107.html

Hiran’s diatom bone samples were now being sent to a forensic science laboratory in Haryana to get a clear opinion.The detection of diatoms known as the diatom test in the organs can contribute to a diagnosis of death underwater.Mumbai’s JJ Hospital submitted the report to ATS on Wednesday. “The government lab in Haryana has expertise in conducting such tests. The samples have been sent to get a confirmed report,” said the ATS official.Also Read | Ambani bomb scare: Maharashtra govt transfers Mumbai top cop Param Bir SinghThe official said it appears the murderer might have used chloroform to make Hiran unconscious or some other means because his face was covered by handkerchiefs and a mask. “Perhaps he was later [after becoming unconscious] thrown in the water.” Hiran’s viscera reports are still awaited.Hiran’s widow, Vimla, has alleged her husband was murdered and ATS has registered a murder case against unknown persons. In her statement, Vimla said her husband was a good swimmer and could not have drowned. She has accused suspended police officer Sachin Vaze, who has been arrested for alleged involvement in parking the explosive-laden car outside Ambani’s residence, of having a role in Hiran’s death.The car was in Hiran’s possession before it was found abandoned with 20 explosive gelatin sticks and a threatening letter on February 25.Hiran’s body was found in the creek a day after he went missing on the night of March 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/did-mansukh-hiran-drown-ats-to-send-samples-to-haryana-lab-101616047393934.html

18-03-2021||Delhi||Sharp rise in Delhi’s jobless during lockdown, women worst hit: Survey||The unemployment rate in Delhi rose by 17.4 percentage points during the Covid-19 pandemic-induced nationwide lockdown—from 11.1% recorded in January-February 2020 to 28.5% recorded in October-November 2020—according to a Delhi government survey, which HT has seen.And even for those employed, the report said, the average income dropped from ₹16,511 to ₹15,383 between the two periods.The survey showed that the increase in the unemployment rate was sharper among women than men. While the unemployment rate among men rose from 8.7% to 23.3% during the survey period, the rate among women rose from 25.6% to 54.7%, stated the report, which is yet to be shared in the public domain.Citing excerpts from this report, Delhi’s finance minister Manish Sisodia said in his budget speech, which HT reported, on February 9: “The Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent lockdown have had a disastrous impact on the livelihoods of people. People have lost their jobs, their businesses. In this time of crisis, our government understands it to be its duty to formulate schemes of social security and welfare of the people. For this, we had started a survey which showed that before the corona crisis, in February 2020, 26% of women were unemployed. In February 2021, this statistic was still 40%.”Also Read | Cycle tracks, eco-trails in revamp plan for 22km Yamuna riverfront“This reveals that among the women of Delhi, who are available for employment, 40% cannot find any work. 45% of these women have completed Class 12 and 60% of these women are less than 30 years of age. It is essential to economically empower these women and integrate them with the economy of the family and the state,” he said.The report also said that in the two given periods the unemployment rate rose from 9.2% to 29.7% among people who are illiterate, from 7.6% to 27.6% among those who graduated primary school, 9.2% to 25.8% among those who cleared Class 10 board exams, 23.1% to 36.1% among those who have a school senior secondary degree (Class 12), from 12.7% to 29.1% among college graduates, and from 11.5% to 24.4% among university post-graduates and above.The survey also noted that 89% of the unemployed respondents continued looking for work in October-November 2020. Of the 89%, around 56% had been unemployed for over six months, compelling the government to work on drafting a “job guarantee scheme” to revive the economy of Delhi, it said.The sample size of the survey was 44,226 individuals across all 11 revenue districts in Delhi.“The present employment survey in Delhi to understand the unemployment and under-employment scenario in Delhi is going to be a very important tool to assist policy-making that responds to the ground-level economic situation in Delhi. Through this survey, the government of NCT of Delhi intended to get the full picture of unemployment in various sectors/occupations which are the most prevalent in the economy, the extent of under-employment as well as citizen feedback on some potential policy responses that the government of NCT of Delhi may want to initiate. Special focus is given to the consequences of job loss in various economic activities/ industries after the outbreak of Covid-19 and consequent lockdown,” the report said.Debolina Kundu, professor at National Institute of Urban Affairs, said: “The findings of the Delhi Employment Survey 2020 can be an important tool for the government to deal with the current economic recession induced by the pandemic and associated lockdown. It brought into light the precarious condition of youth, especially women, even in pre-pandemic times. This section has also been very severely impacted by the recession resulting in increase of unemployment and underemployment. The government has to strengthen its job generation initiatives taking into account a wide range of stakeholders. The government has told the Delhi assembly that it is already working in this direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-unemployment-rate-rose-sharply-during-lockdown-women-worst-hit-survey-101616044753681.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||HP’s legacy resolution scheme helps recover ₹318-cr arrears||The Himachal Pradesh government’s legacy cases resolution scheme is helping the pandemic-hit economy of the hill state as the excise and taxation department has already recovered disputed arrears amounting to ₹318 crore under the scheme till March 16. This is up from ₹1 crore that was collected as arrears in July last year. The department now hopes to make a total recovery of ₹362 crore by March 21, 2021. The total expected recovery under the scheme is equal to the one-month GST (goods and services tax) collection of the state. The highest collection under the scheme is in March 2021. Last year, arrears worth ₹73 crore were recovered from July to December, while this year ₹289 crore has already been recovered. The maximum recovery of ₹102.99 crore was made in Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh (BBN) revenue district followed by ₹98.06 crore in Solan and ₹19.94 crore in Kinnaur districts. Scheme saved time, litigation cost Introduced last year, the scheme is aimed at settling the pending legacy cases of all subsumed laws and recovering the arrears. Many of the cases were under dispute for over a decade and involved huge litigation cost both for the state and taxpayers. Under the scheme, the settlement fee in lieu of interest and penalty is limited to 10% over and above the principal amount. In January 2021, the scheme was extended up to March 21, 2021. Settling of legacy issues under the scheme has saved the time and litigation cost of the department and tax officials can now focus on GST collections of the state. Generating awareness, coordination helped “The success of the scheme is due to strategising of focus arrears; awareness creation among taxpayers about the benefit under the scheme; and constant coordination between the headquarters and district authorities,” says excise and taxation commissioner Rohan Chand Thakur. Besides, interactions with taxpayers; publicising the smooth settlement process under the scheme; training of staff; and coordination with external agencies such as banks and courts have helped in the scheme’s success. “The department has worked hard effectively as a team to settle the cases and recover the arrears in a time-bound manner,” says Thakur. MONTH-WISE RECOVERY OF ARREARS July 2020: ₹1 crore August: ₹2 crore September: ₹5 crore October: ₹17 crore November: ₹3 crore December: ₹45 crore January 2021: ₹104 crore February: ₹4 crore March (till 16): ₹181 crore||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hps-legacy-resolution-scheme-helps-recover-318-cr-arrears-101616044393697.html

18-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Proustian of Sushant Lok||Many book-loving Delhi homes have Shakespeare, Tagore, Tolstoy and Ghalib. French author Marcel Proust is more difficult to spot, though his novel is counted among the greatest works in literature. There’s a reason to that rarity. À la recherche du temps perdu—In Search of Lost Time in the English translation—consists of seven fat volumes, full of twisty dense super-long sentences.In these times of mobile phone distraction, who can exercise sustained concentration over several months of such demanding work?Even so, there must be a few folks in the city who have read the entire Proust (not counting the current French ambassador, who indeed has—he has already been featured in these pages). Actually, reading the first volume alone is considered a feat, for it is like an overture whose themes resonate across volumes.Here’s a woman in the Delhi region, who grew up in Chandigarh, and has completed the first volume, in the original French—no less.“It took me three months to read Du côté de chez Swann,” says Gauri Mohan Gupta on a WhatsApp video chat, from her small first-floor studio apartment in Gurugram’s Sushant Lok where she lives alone. A data analytics professional in a multinational, Ms Gupta is referring to the first volume’s title. She finished it despite her “10 hours daily of work-from-home, plus I do all the cleaning and cooking in the house.” And then there was not only the novel’s universally acknowledged difficulties, but also the fact that she was reading it in a language she started learning only in her adulthood.Proust’s style can be difficult to understand, she admits, “so sometimes I would revisit paragraphs to make sense of them.”In her early 30s, Ms Gupta’s daily life is intimately involved with the French language. She started learning it in her hometown. Later, her jobs in the corporate corridors of Bengaluru and Gurugram obliged her to engage with French colleagues and clients. She also lived in France for two years as an “English Assistant” in a school in Nantes.Ms Gupta’s initiation to Proust took place late last year. A one-page extract of his novel was part of her academic project. “I’m doing an online C1 course (equivalent to Masters) in French from the Alliance Française in Chandigarh, and I ended up reading the whole volume out of interest.”Was Proust fun?“I enjoyed the love story of Swann and Odette, and also the parts on the society’s snobbery.”Ms Gupta personally knows of nobody who has read Proust. She sees it as a major accomplishment, especially as she read the formidable first volume in the language it was originally written in. “French has always been an escape from my mundane life. To immerse myself in it and the worlds it contains helped me come out of my shell, and taught me the importance of individualism, of taking a pause and reflecting and probing...”An ambitious woman, she plans to carry on to the other six volumes. “My former teacher, who is now back in France, has promised to send me all the Proust books.”Bonne chance, Madame !||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-proustian-of-sushant-lok-101616034095236.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||Cycle tracks, eco-trails in revamp plan for 22km Yamuna riverfront||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is working on rejuvenating and making the Yamuna riverfront accessible to the public by building cycling tracks, walkways, eco-trails to wetlands and a floodplain forest along the 22 km area between Wazirabad Barrage and Okhla Barrage, a senior DDA official said.Large parts of the 54km-long Yamuna riverfront have been rendered inaccessible for Delhiites for decades, while industrial waste and untreated sewage are dumped into the river.The officials said the project will not only help people connect with the river but also check the dying ecosystem of the Yamuna floodplains, both flora and fauna. Under the plan, the DDA will develop close to 1,400 hectares of land on the eastern and western banks of the river.DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, “The entire stretch has been divided into 10 projects, each spread over 90 hectares and above. The work is moving at a fast pace, and three projects will be completed in the next few months. We aim to complete large parts of projects by the end of this year.”The project to restore the riverfront was conceived following a National Green Tribunal order in 2015. The work on the riverfront, DDA officials said, started in 2017 and was monitored by the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee that was set up in 2018. The committee concluded its proceedings in January this year after it submitted its final report. DDA officials said that the restoration work on the 22km-stretch in Delhi has been planned as per the committee’s directions. The restoration work is being closely monitored by Delhi lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, who has been taking regular review meetings. DDA submitted a status report to the L-G in February.One of the biggest challenges in restoring the riverfront, Jain said, is removing encroachments and reclaiming the land. According to a senior DDA official, about 1,000 acres of land have been cleared of encroachment and are being developed, and work is going on in other parts.DDA officials said they have installed CCTV cameras and deployed staff to prevent dumping of debris on the floodplains.Of the total 10 projects, three —Kalindi Biodiversity, Park Asita East, Asita West—are in advanced stages of construction and will be completed in the next few months, officials in the know of the matter said.Spread over 200 hectares, Asita West, located between the Old Railway Bridge and the ITO barrage, is one of the first areas being revamped. DDA has developed 4.8km of walkways, 1.5km of cycleways, three new water bodies, 300m of green buffer along the river, greenways, etc. on 93 hectares of land. The project is likely to be completed by June this year.For residents of Walled City and nearby areas, this has become a popular spot. Kishore Kumar (35), who lives and works in Chandni Chowk, said that he often comes here with his children. “While there are parks in the area, there aren’t many such large open spaces. We usually come here on weekends. They have now expanded the park and constructed a water body here.”DDA also plans to develop the three ghats (Qudsia, Yamuna Bazaar and Sur ghats). While work on Sur Ghat is expected to be completed by September this year, plans for the other two are yet to be prepared.As part of the rejuvenation project, DDA is also developing a biodiversity park near Delhi Noida Direct (DND) Flyway. Spread over 116 hectares between DND Flyway and Okhla Barrage, the biodiversity park will have 11 constructed wetlands and will treat sewage from about 25 drains. It will also have 100m-wide greenways, about 6km-long walking trails and recreational parks.The Delhi government has set a target of three years to clean the river.CR Babu, who heads the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) at Delhi University, said, “Two of the 11 constructed wetlands are operational. We are treating drain water that has raw sewage from the Kilokri drain naturally via a constructed wetland system before the water is released into the river. A similar wetland system will be soon operational for the Maharani Bagh drain where 500MLD (millions of litres per day) of drain water will be treated. We are also constructing recreational spaces.”However, environment experts say that beautifying the floodplains will serve no purpose if the river continues to be dirty.Faiyaz A Khudsar, a scientist in charge of the Yamuna Biodiversity Park who is involved in the development of Kalindi Biodiversity park, said, “The river has to be clean before you take people close to it. How can people sit near the river if it stinks? Just beautifying the floodplains is not enough, we have to restore the ecology of the area which will help not only rejuvenate the river but become an attraction for the people.”He added, “We are working on ensuring that sewerage water is naturally treated through constructed wetland systems before it is discharged into the river.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cycle-tracks-eco-trails-in-revamp-plan-for-22km-yamuna-riverfront-101616033049295.html
18-03-2021||Jaipur||In state assembly, Rajasthan govt denies tapping phones of MLAs and MPs||The Rajasthan government informed the state assembly on Wednesday that it did not tap phones of any legislator during last year’s political crisis.Rejecting the Bharatiya Janata Party’s allegations on phone tapping, parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal said the opposition party was making an issue in order to protect Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.He said the chief minister would offer his resignation if these allegations were proved right. “Not only the chief minister, all of us will resign,” he said.The BJP, however, sought an inquiry led by the Central Bureau of Investigation and created a ruckus in the assembly which led to adjournment of the House twice.The controversy around phone tapping erupted in July last year when former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.At the time, three purported audio clips surfaced in which Shekhawat and some Congress leaders could be heard discussing a conspiracy to topple Gehlot’s government. Chief whip Mahesh Joshi then filed FIRs with the Special Operations Group (SPG) and the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).On the BJP’s allegations that the audio clips were prepared and circulated by Lokesh Sharma, the OSD to the chief minister, Dhariwal said the audio clips were received on WhatsApp. He stressed that forwarding an audio clip on WhatsApp was not a crime.Dhariwal apprised the House that the SOG last year intercepted phones of two persons — Ashok Singh and Bharat Malani — with permission from the Home Department, after receiving information about illegal arms smuggling and movement of explosives. He said none of them was a politician but during the interception, conspiracy to depose the Gehlot government was exposed and that the SOG inspector lodged an FIR in the matter.The minister reiterated that the government did not order any MLA’s, MP’s or an elected representative’s phone-tapping.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/in-state-assembly-rajasthan-govt-denies-tapping-phones-of-mlas-and-mps-101616031334760.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||Prosecutions for mask, distancing violations drop from Oct-Nov peak||Prosecutions by the police and district administrations for violations of Covid-19 norms have dropped in the Capital to a fraction of the fines issued during the peak of the infection’s third wave in October-November last year, according to police and government data, even as the city’s Covid-19 graph inches upwards.Experts have attributed to the steady spike in Delhi’s caseload to increased gatherings and poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour such as mask discipline and social distancing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBetween March 1 and 15, only 130-160 people in the city were fined a day for violating mask norms in public, a sharp fall from October and November last year, when the police fined nearly 2,300 people a day.During that period, Delhi was in the middle of the third wave of the Covid-19 outbreak, recording a daily average of 3,451 new cases in October and 6,122 infections in November.That surge coincided with Diwali, a period when crowds thronged markets in the city with little regard for Covid-19 safeguards, even as the police and administration ramped up prosecutions and fines.On November 11, for instance, when infections touched a single-day peak of 8,593, the Delhi Police fined 2,403 for not wearing masks or wearing them improperly.In November, on average, the police prosecuted nearly 2,000 persons for the offence every day.In the first 15 days of November last year, at least 40 people were fined a day for violating distancing norms. In the past week, however, only eight people were fined for this office.Delhi on Wednesday added 536 new cases of the infection, the highest single-day spike January 6.Fines issued by the state government, through district teams, have also reduced significantly. Between January 1 and 15, government teams caught 20,970 persons for not wearing masks, a number that fell to 18,728 in the next fortnight. Fewer people were caught in February. Between February 1 and 15, the Delhi government had fined 13,148 people for the offence, which dropped to 9,016 between February 16 and February 28.But while there are photographs of people roaming without masks or violating social distancing norms, showing lax enforcement, district administration and Delhi Police officials have said they have increased prosecution in the last 15 days. Spokespersons of the Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.Data shared by the government shows that there were 20,386 fines issued between March 1 and 15. During the same fortnight, police have fined 2,227 persons.Till date, the police have fined 520,650 people for not wearing masks while Delhi government teams fined 398,496 people.District administration officials admitted that people had let their guards down.At least five district magistrates said they have now stepped up measures to check for violations, in light of the rise of cases in the city.Isha Khosla, North Delhi district magistrate, said, “We have been issuing 200-300 fines a day. But with the rise in cases, we have stepped up measures to build awareness regarding precautionary measures. We have also increased the number of monitoring teams from 14 to 21.”Another district magistrate, who did not wish to be named, said, “On average, we are issuing nearly 150 fines every day. We are also focussing on educating people and telling them to follow all precautionary measures.”The Delhi Police also said they have increased prosecution on the ground.Deputy commissioner of police Chinmoy Biswal said,” Our squads are patrolling markets and crowded areas like railway stations and public parks to prosecute those who are not adhering to the rules. We ensure that if there is more than one person travelling in a car, they’re all wearing masks. All district DCPs have been directed to intensify the prosecutions in their respective areas and ensure no tolerance towards such violations,” Biswal said.Currently, the fine for not adhering to mask norms or violating social distancing measures is ₹2,000.Experts warned people against letting their guards down.Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of the PSRI institute of Pulmonary, Critical care and Sleep medicine, said, “There is a definite surge not just in several states across the country but Delhi too... There has been an uptick in cases in the last 15-20 days. At my hospital, one ward that had been declared Covid-19 free was again converted into a special Covid facility. People should not be complacent.”A senior Delhi Police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Since the pandemic, our personnel have been on the roads and enforced Covid-appropriate behaviour. If you compare our data with that of any agency, even those outside Delhi, we have taken more action that anyone. Now that Covid-19 cases are increasing, we will increase prosecution and ensure people follow the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/prosecutions-for-mask-distancing-violations-drop-from-oct-nov-peak-101616011451087.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu’s wife Navjot Kaur appointed All India Jat Mahasabha’s state women wing chief||The All India Jat Mahasabha (AIJM) on Wednesday appointed former MLA Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, wife of Congress leader and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, as president of its women wing in Punjab. Announcing her appointment at a press conference in Chandigarh, AIJM national vice-president and Punjab unit chief Harpal Singh Harpura said, “She will work to strengthen the organisation in the state. The decision to appoint her was taken by the national executive at a meeting in Delhi last week.” Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is the national president of AIJM. Whether her appointment had Amarinder’s approval, Harpura said the AIJM was a non-political organisation and its national executive was bigger than its president. “We were not very active in Punjab in the recent years. We have decided to rebuild the organisational set-up and made several appointments in several district in the recent weeks,” he said. Navjot Kaur said she would go all out to support the farmers protesting against the Centre’s three agriculture reform laws. “What was the urgency to bring these laws during the pandemic without any consultation with the stakeholders? We are with the farmers. We will not let them lose. These laws will have to be repealed,” she said, asking the central government to write off loans of farmers of the state. Navjot Kaur was a chief parliamentary secretary in the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government in the state before joining the Congress four years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhus-wife-navjot-kaur-appointed-all-india-jat-mahasabha-s-state-women-wing-chief-101616011692330.html

18-03-2021||Chandigarh||4 shooters arrested with arms, ammunition in SBS Nagar||Police have arrested four shooters who allegedly were planning the murder of three people at the behest of a UK-based NRI and seized three pistols, six magazines, 46 cartridges and a car bearing fake number plate. The arrested accused have been identified as Makhan Singh of Hoshiarpur district, Ranjit Singh of Rupnagar district, Gurjit Singh of SBS Nagar and Balbir Singh of Hoshiarpur. SBS Nagar police senior superintendent of police Alka Meena said they had information that Makhan Singh and Ranjit Singh were roaming with a plan to execute murder at the behest of one Harish Kumar lais Sabi, an NRI. “Police laid a trap and arrested Makhan and Ranjit from Balauni village and recovered the two weapons from their possession. During the interrogation, they confessed that they were to kill Ranjit Singh of Lasara village in Phillaur sub-division and two more people at the behest of Sabi, who lives in the UK,” Meena said. Meena said gangster Tejinder Singh Teja, who is currently in Bathinda jail arranged three weapons and cartridges to Ranjit and Makhan to execute the murders, while another gangster, Kuldeep Singh alias Keepa, arranged a car for them. “Makhan and Ranjit revealed that guns and ammunition was also provided to their aides Gurjit Singh and Balbir Singh. We arrested Gurjit and Balbir and recovered the weapon and ammunition,” she said. Police have also booked gangsters Tejinder Singh of SBS Nagar, Kuldeep Singh ‘Keepa of Moga district, and NRI Harish Kumar ‘Sabi’. Six of the seven accused are facing many criminal cases including those of murder and attempt to murder. Police said Harish was facing five criminal cases, Ranjit two, Makhan eight, Tejinder 21, Balbir one and Kuldeep Singh ‘Keepa’ four cases. A senior official privy to the development said Harish had an old rivalry with Ranjit Singh of Lasara and wanted to kill him and his two aides. “We will bring the gangsters lodged in Bathinda and Faridkot jails on production warrants for further investigations. A case has been registered against the accused under the relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and Arms Act at Aur police station in the district,” the SSP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-shooters-arrested-with-arms-ammunition-in-sbs-nagar-101616011271093.html

Gupta was posted at the IAF’s elite Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment (TACDE).“A MiG-21 Bison aircraft of IAF was involved in a fatal accident this morning, while taking off for a combat training mission at an airbase in central India,” IAF announced on Twitter.“The IAF lost Group Captain A Gupta in the tragic accident. IAF expresses deep condolences and stands firmly with the family members. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause of the accident,” it said in another tweet.The MiG-21 was upgraded to MiG-21 Bison in 2000. Experts said it is a reliable aircraft but nearing the end of its service life.“The upgrade in 2000 was significant and essentially on avionics, radar, electronic warfare suite and weapons. The aircraft is very safe to fly, has had a good safety record and will see IAF through till 2023-24,” said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), who was the team leader of the MiG-21 upgrade programme.IAF operates four squadrons of MiG-21 Bison aircraft. The last of these upgraded fighter jets are set to be phased out in the next four to five years. IAF will induct different variants of Tejas light combat aircraft in the coming years to bolster its combat potential.The defence ministry last month awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for IAF. The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force in three years, with the rest being supplied by 2030. The deal involves the supply of 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia paid homage to departed pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/iaf-group-captain-killed-in-mig-21-bison-crash-in-gwalior-101616010478158.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Focus back on Punjab’s high death rate, worries mount||Blurb: Chandigarh With over 200 deaths in last one week, the focus is back on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) or death rate of Punjab, which is highest in the country, as 20-25% of country’s total virus-related deaths are coming from the state. The situation is getting critical day-by-day with the state contributing 100 deaths in the last three days, 35 on Wednesday, 38 on Tuesday, and 27 on Monday. As per the state health authorities, Punjab has contributed maximum deaths in the country after Maharashtra in recent days. The state’s Case Fatality Rate of 3.1% is more than double the national figure of 1.4%. As per information procured from state authorities, Maharashtra and Sikkim stand below Punjab when it comes to CFR at 2.2%. Punjab’s high CFR, as per information, also cropped up during chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. ‘Late medical help main reason’ As per the analysis carried out by the Covid management group of the Punjab government for the last 10 days, 77% of those died of the virus reported for the first time at the nearest health centre when their symptoms had reached the severe stage. Only 14% of those who lost their lives reported when their symptoms had reached the moderate stage and 8% reported at the health facilities when their symptoms were still mild. “Most virus-hit patients report at the health centres when the symptoms are serious and this is the biggest reason behind high number of deaths in Punjab. Majority of those who died reported for the first time when their symptoms had reached the severe stage. Early reporting is the only way to save lives,” said a senior official, who was present during the presentation given during the meeting of the Covid management group. As per an analysis of the figures available in the daily media bulletin of Punjab, Faridkot is the only district whose CFR is lowest at 1.9% and that too is more than the national figure. Three districts of Punjab, Sangrur, Ropar and Tarn Taran have CFR above 4%. Co-morbidity is the biggest reason behind deaths and figures suggest co-morbid condition was common in almost 95% of fatalities in the recent days. The low turnout in the vaccination drive has also added worries of the health department. “Even people with co-morbidities are shying away from getting the jab. We must keep in mind that even after getting first dose, the risk of reaching the severe stage reduces to a large extent,” said Punjab’s nodal office for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/focus-back-on-punjab-s-high-death-rate-worries-mount-101616010856301.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||National Green Tribunal disbands its committee monitoring pollution in Ghaggar river||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has disbanded its committee headed by retired high court judge Pritam Pal for monitoring pollution in the Ghaggar river and directed the administrative heads of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh to take over the task. Monitoring by the tribunal or its committee “cannot be a permanent feature”, said a bench on Tuesday while disposing the main petition on pollution in the river that originates in HP and then passes through Haryana and Punjab. “It is finally for the states to take ownership of the problem at hand and take strict measures to provide a clean environment to their citizens and protect natural resources like water, air and soil for the current and future generations,” the order said. In January, the tribunal had also disbanded its committee for monitoring pollution in the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab. The panel had slapped a fine of ₹4.15 crore on 15 industrial units in the three states and the union territory last year. In November 2020, the tribunal had expressed its displeasure with the three states and the UT for their failure to implement the recommendations of committee to control water pollution in the river. The bench in its latest order said the respective chief secretaries or other administrative heads should personally monitor the progress of compliance at least once in a month.“The chief secretaries while reviewing the status of various issues may focus on timely completion of the ongoing works and send quarterly reports to the central monitoring committee of Union jal shakti ministry which deals with the issue of restoration of 351 polluted river stretches, including the rivers in question,” added the tribunal.It appreciated the panel for its “significant contribution to controlling pollution” in the Ghaggar through recommendations. There still are huge gaps in capacity and functioning of the sewage treatment plants, common effluent treatment plants, reuse of treated water for irrigation, preventing dumping of solid waste, industrial pollution, preventing direct discharge of pollution in the drains and rivers, it observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/national-green-tribunal-disbands-its-committee-monitoring-pollution-in-ghaggar-river-101616010852072.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||9kg heroin recovered in Amritsar, cross-border smuggler arrested||At least 9kg heroin was recovered on Wednesday in two cases in the Amritsar district. In the first case, the anti-drug special task force (STF) recovered 7kg heroin concealed in a tractor’s empty battery from across the barbed wire fence near the zero line on the India-Pakistan border in Ajnala. The recovery was made during the STF’s joint search operation with Border Security Force (BSF) near the DS border outpost (BoP). The STF officials said they had a tip-off that a consignment of the contraband smuggled from Pakistan was concealed underground across the fence. The STF coordinated with the BSF and recovered the drugs from a field. The STF officials have handed over the case’s further investigation to Ajnala police. A case under the various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered at the Ajnala police station, said a senior STF official. In another case, a man allegedly involved in cross-border smuggling of drugs was arrested with 2kg heroin at Cheecha village in the district on Wednesday.  ₹35,000 in drug money was also seized from the accused, identified as Resham Singh, alias Gori, a Cheecha resident. A case was also registered against his accomplice Sandeep Kaur, the police said.“Resham was in contact with some Pakistan-based smugglers. We have also confiscated his two mobile phones and a motorcycle. Sandeep Kaur is absconding, but we have recovered 10gm heroin, two mobile phones and some intoxicating tablets from her hideout at Ladhowal village,” a police official said. Senior superintendent of police (rural) Dhruv Dahiya said they had a tip-off that Resham along with one Sukhwinder Singh, alias Sukha, who died recently, was involved in cross-border drug trade. “A special police team was formed to conduct a raid, during which Resham was nabbed. Our teams are working to ascertain the identity of those who he was supplying heroin to,” he said. A case under various sections of the NDPS Act was registered at the Gharinda police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/9kg-heroin-recovered-in-amritsar-cross-border-smuggler-arrested-101616010850900.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Capt, Sidhu bond over tea, discuss latter’s return to Punjab cabinet||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu met over tea on Wednesday and talked about the latter’s re-induction into the state cabinet. The 40-minute meeting between the chief minister and Sidhu was held at the former’s farmhouse in Siswan village near here. The two leaders discussed the contours of the cricketer-turned-politician’s return to the state cabinet, and the likely portfolio, but no time-frame was finalised, according to sources in the know of the discussion at the meeting. Their meeting was a result of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat’s unrelenting efforts for rapprochement between the two to pave the way for an important role for the Amritsar East MLA ahead of the state assembly polls due early next year. Rawat had met Amarinder and Sidhu separately in Chandigarh last week and sounded hopeful of “positive developments soon” amid talk of behind-the-scene efforts by the central leadership to reinduct the former minister’s into the state cabinet as the deputy chief minister or as the state unit president. While neither leader spoke to journalists after the meeting, the chief minister’s media adviser Raveen Thukral posted a photograph of the two on Twitter with a cryptic caption – “A picture is worth a thousand words…” Sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, who travelled with Sidhu to the chief minister’s farmhouse and was present during their discussion, said the meeting was warm and cordial. “Both Patialvis hugged each other and talked frankly. The impression I got from their discussion is that there is no difference in their thought process and they are united,” he said, adding, “they talked about several things but not on cabinet or portfolios”. Wednesday’s meeting between the chief minister and his former cabinet colleague, who were not on the best of terms for a long time, was second in four months. Amarinder had invited Sidhu for lunch but the programme was changed due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with all the chief ministers on Covid-19. Their luncheon meeting on November 25 last year had set off talk of his cabinet return and likely portfolios but Amarinder later brushed it aside by accusing people of “making a mountain out of a molehill”. Rawat, who is pushing for Sidhu’s return at the earliest, did not respond to calls. Earlier in the day, the former minister’s wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhu, was not very hopeful about the outcome of his meeting with the chief minister. “All this talk of giving him (Sidhu) an important responsibility has been going on for almost two years. We will talk about this when it is done,” she told reporters after being appointed the All India Jat Mahasabha’s state women wing president. She said that Sidhu was not hankering after any position but only wanted to serve the people of Punjab. “If he was after position, he would have contested form Kurukshetra (Lok Sabha seat) as the BJP candidate and become a Union minister. But he did not want to leave Punjab. If he gets something where he can work for the state, he will take it, otherwise we are fine this way,” the ex-MLA said. Sidhu had quit the state cabinet in July 2019 after the CM divested him of the local government portfolio, blaming his “inept handling” of the department and for the poor performance of the party in urban pockets during the Lok Sabha polls. He maintained a profile for more than a year until Rawat cajoled him and ensured his presence at former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally against the farm laws five months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sidhu-bond-over-tea-discuss-latter-s-return-to-punjab-cabinet-101616010731510.html

Kumar is convicted to life imprisonment for the brutal killing of five members of a family in Raj Nagar in Delhi, during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. A three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde and also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian will hear Kumar’s bail application. Kumar in his bail application had contended before the apex court that he has been in jail since December 2018 and had lost almost around 8-10 kilograms since then.

The local bodies department is expected to receive the gazette notification of results from state election department soon, after which it will give a 14-day notice to elect office-bearers and for civic bodies to make arrangements. The office-bearers are mayors, senior deputy mayors and deputy mayors in municipal corporations and president, senior vice-president and vice-president in councils and notified area committees. A sub-committee that state congress chief Sunil Jakhar leads pondered on issues such as caste and community combination in electing the office-bearers on Wednesday. “We have received representations from MLAs and other party leaders. A decision will follow soon,” said Jakhar. No public function will be held to administer the oath and the chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will do this in a virtual event. This has been decided due to increase in coronavirus cases. “We may decide to gather members at different locations and organise the event virtually,” said Jakhar. Other members in the committee who were in today’s meeting include cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Aruna Chaudhary, political secretary to CM Capt Sandeep Sandhu and Youth Congress Leader Barinder Dhillon. There are 2,302 wards that went for polls and 1,151 wards went to the women candidates. 50% RESERVATION TO WOMEN IN OFFICE-BEARERS NOT POSSIBLE The state government may have given 50% reservation to women candidates, as per its promise ahead of the 2017 state polls. The reservation, however, is not applicable in the election of office-bearers. “For electing office-bearers, there is a reservation of 5% for the women candidates and this would be brought into the practise. The Municipal Act, 1911, mentions a total of 12% reservation, 5% each for women and scheduled caste candidates and 2% for those belonging to backward classes,” said a member of the subcommittee constituted by the state government to take decisions related to civic body polls. “In case, the government wants to increase the role of women the Municipal Act, 1911, needs to be amended,” added the member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/officebearers-for-117-urban-local-bodies-in-punjab-to-be-elected-in-april-first-week-101616009711256.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||‘If govt means L-G, why hold elections?’: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday urged the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government to withdraw a bill that redefines the power of Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G), contending that the legislation would undermine the rights of the people of the Capital and their elected government.Kejriwal said the Union government, by moving this bill, was not just bypassing a Supreme Court verdict of July 2018, but also negating the Constitution and democracy.“The bill says the government means the L-G. If that is the case, where will the chief minister go? Where will the people of Delhi go? Why were elections conducted? The people of Delhi are being cheated by the central government. This is wrong,” he said during a protest rally of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers and supporters at Jantar Mantar.Kejriwal added that he was ready to do anything to safeguard the rights of the people.“Be it folding our hands before them [the Centre] or touching their feet, we are ready to do anything for the people of Delhi. We will not allow any work to stop in the city. We will ensure that the powers of the people of Delhi are given back to them. The country is celebrating its 75th year of independence fromBritish rule and here BJP led Centre government is snatching the rights of the citizens of Delhi,” he said.The Union government introduced the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha on Monday to amend the 1991 GNCT Act. The Bill says that “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation, and seeks to make it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the prior opinion of the L-G before any executive action. It also says that the Delhi assembly cannot constitute any committees to look into the day-to-day and administrative issues.Since Delhi is a Union territory, its elected government does not have full control over the city-state. The Centre, through the L-G, controls subjects such as public order, land and police, and the L-G can also refer matters to the President in case of difference of opinion between him and the council of ministers. This unique duality of power has resulted in frequent tussles between the Delhi government and the Centre.Kejriwal hit out at the BJP, saying the party should engage in “healthy competition” instead of trying to take over Delhi by “mischief”, and referred to the AAP’s success in the recent elections. “We won 67 of the 70 assembly seats in 2015, 62 seats in 2020 and in the recent MCD bypolls, the BJP got zero seats. People are clearly saying they do not want the BJP, they want the AAP. But the BJP is behaving like an angry child who runs away with the bat and the ball on losing a cricket match. The BJP is losing one election after the other, but they want to rule over Delhi by doing such mischief,” he said. “In other states, they buy MLAs from other parties, topple the incumbent government, and form a new one after losing elections. But in Delhi they are not able to buy our MLAs, so now they are bringing this bill to end the rule of the people of Delhi,” Kejriwal added.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said it is the AAP which was disturbing the balance of power in Delhi by not giving the constitutional funds to the three municipal corporations since 2015. “The chief minister should tell why he even refused to talk to the three mayors who sat on dharna outside his house demanding municipal funds,” he said.The CM, who is also the AAP’s national convener, contended that the proposed law would snatch the powers of the elected government and stall all the subsidies that are provided on power, water, and other amenities, along with development work in the city.Hinting at intensifying the protest, Kejriwal reminded the people of the dharna which he had led at the L-G’s office in 2018, when he was seeking the clearance for the Delhi government’s CCTV project. On that occasion,the CM and his council of ministers did not leave the L-G’s house for nine days, until he gave his nod to the plan.Kejriwal said that all files prior to the 2018 Supreme Court judgment were sent to the L-G, resulting in delays in the implementation of projects. “The SC verdict stated the elected government does not need to send all files to the L-G. But this proposed law will overturn all of that. The central government is bypassing the SC, the elected government and will of the people of Delhi,” he said. The SC in its July 2018 verdict made it clear that the L-G is “bound to act on aid and advice of the council of ministers” in all matters, except those relating to police, land, and law and order. It also stated that while it is necessary to apprise the L-G of all the decisions, it does not mean that his concurrence is required. Kejriwal contended that the bill was a way to stall a surging AAP.“The entire country is talking about the good works being done but the Delhi government. The AAP is slowly winning seats in panchayat and municipal corporation elections in other states because of our Delhi model. Now people in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana are also saying they want free electricity. I want to tell them [the BJP-ruled central government] that they should not stall the good works happening in Delhi. You show people your good work,” he said.“Let there be a competition of good work. You won’t do any work but will only stop all the good things happening in Delhi. This is wrong. If you want votes, you should also work well. Now, if you make electricity free in Gujarat, AAP will not get a single seat,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi BJP said that in all Union territories, including Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry, the L-G has some extra constitutional rights despite each having their own assemblies. “The bill does not end the concept of legislative assembly. So, to say that the Delhi Government’s rights are being curtailed is wholly unjustified. Kejriwal needs to understand that democracy doesn’t just mean that you get your own demands fulfilled, it means working in coordination to ensure good governance. If Kejriwal tries to work like his predecessors from the BJP and the Congress who were CMs of Delhi and worked in constitutional coordination with the L-G, there is no reason why his decisions will be stalled,” Gupta said.The Delhi Congress led by unit president Anil Kumar also staged a sit-in at Jantar Mantar against the bill. “We are protesting against the autocracy of the Centre and the murder of democracy in Delhi through this bill. Though the Congress does not have an MP or an MLA from Delhi, the party was the first to speak against the bill... (It) will make a mockery of the people’s power to elect a government and representatives of their choice.”Former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash Kashyap said the frequent friction between the Central and state government is not only disruptive, but also slows down the development story of Delhi. “Delhi has limited powers because of its nature as a UT. It was not necessary for the Centre to initiate such an amendment at such a junction when the Supreme Court has given a subject wise clarity on several issues. Maybe the central government is attempting to clarify the division of power further,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/if-govt-means-l-g-why-hold-elections-101616008781639.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze row: BJP, Sena war of words continues||Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday demanded a probe to find the “political bosses” who were behind the police officer Sachin Vaze, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the security threat at industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, Antilia.Pointing out the links between Vaze and Shiv Sena leaders, he said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had called him in 2018, when he was the chief minister, to reinstate Vaze in the police force. Vaze was under suspension then. “Thackeray had called me and his senior ministers had met me in 2018. As the high court had ordered the Vaze’s suspension, I refused to accede to their demand,” said Fadnavis.Addressing the media in Delhi, Fadnavis said the focus should be on people who operated behind the scenes. “Param Bir Singh (former Mumbai police commissioner) and Sachin Vaze were small players. We want to know their political masters in the government,” said Fadnavis. “The way the chief minister was defending Vaze, the manner in which he is defended by the government, we want to know, whose interests are being protected,” said Fadnavis.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena stepped up its offensive, saying the Vaze incident will not result in the collapse of the Maharashtra government. “Everybody should snap out of the illusion that like the Chandra Shekhar government collapsed due to two constables, the Maharashtra government too will fall due to an assistant police inspector [Sachin Vaze]. The National Investigation Agency and the Anti-Terrorism Squad are investigating and it should be left to them. But we are keeping an eye on it. It is a small matter now,” said Sena leader Sanjay Raut.Raut dared Fadnavis to name leaders who he thought were “Vaze’s handlers”. “Take names or don’t shoot in the dark,” Raut said, adding a former chief minister should not work to demoralise the Mumbai Police.Responding indirectly to Fadnavis’s claims of Thackeray’s request for Vaze’s reinstatement, Raut said, “Vaze was a police officer then. He was suspended following the death of an accused terrorist during investigation. The court ordered his suspension, there was no other case. So is our leader of Opposition speaking in favour of a terrorist?”The Sena parliamentarian said that Fadnavis should not think that he holds the reins of the investigation. “The probe is being done by NIA and ATS. Let’s see what comes out. Terrible incidents have happened in the BJP-ruled states, but we have never interfered in it,” he said.Speaking on the transfer of police commissioner Param Bir Singh, Raut said, “Whatever has happened in the past 15 days, has not and will not be supported by anybody. The transfers that happened today are important. It is not done under pressure from the opposition. It is our moral responsibility,” he said.Raut further said, “This is not sudden or a routine transfer. Given the type of atmosphere in the state or in the media , the chief minister thought that the head of the police force, on whom doubts were raised, should be transferred till the inquiry is complete…No police officer takes the government into confidence before committing any crime. But when such incidents come forward, it is our duty to take appropriate action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-row-bjp-sena-war-of-words-continues-101616008930953.html

Sources privy to the development said that Choudhary, a former MLC and only prominent Hindu face of the PDP in entire Jammu region, resigned from the post of state general secretary and political affairs committee because he was neither taken into confidence nor given a suitable place in state body and parliamentary affairs committee constituted by Mehbooba Mufti. “Despite being a popular Hindu leader from Rajouri district and having mass base in Jammu, he was not taken into confidence. He was handed a raw deal in the state body and parliamentary affairs committee. Hence, he resigned from the post of state general secretary and political affairs committee. He is going to resign from the party itself in a day or two after talking to his workers and supporters,” said people close to Choudhary. They also produced a letter written by Choudhary to Mehbooba Mufti, part of which read, “First of all I thank you for appointing me as State General Secretary and member of the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP)-the highest decision making panel of the party. Being a simple and grass-root level worker of the PDP, I will not be able to shoulder such important responsibilities of the party, so I am resigning from both the posts. I will serve the party as a simple worker, which I have already been doing for years together”. “My best wishes are always there for your future journey as president of the PDP and newly appointed office-bearers,” it read further. However, people close to him said that Choudhary has decided to quit the party. The development comes on a day when PDP’s founding member and former J&K deputy chief minister Muzaffar Baig joined Sajad Lone’s Peoples’ Conference in Srinagar. It may be recalled here that the PDP had suffered a major jolt last year after six of its senior leaders had quit the party. Barely two days ahead of DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, the PDP had suffered another jolt as three senior leaders — Dhaman Bhasin, Fallail Singh and Pritam Kotwal — resigned. On October 26, former PDP MP TS Bajwa along with former MLC Ved Mahajan and former state secretary Choudhary Hussain Ali Wafa had quit the party over Mehbooba Mufti’s highly provocative remarks against the Tricolour. During DDC elections, the PDP had won only one seat from Nowshera in Rajouri district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jolt-to-pdp-as-jammu-leader-choudhary-quits-party-posts-101616008870898.html

Baig, one of the senior-most leaders in Kashmir, had resigned from the PDP last year after his wife Safeena Baig was denied party ticket by the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration to contest district development council (DDC) polls from Sangrama. Later, Safeena, who was also the president of PDP’s women wing, contested DDC elections as an independent candidate from Sangrama and won. She then became Baramulla DDC chairperson with the support of the Peoples’ Conference and the Apni Party.The Peoples’ Conference spokesperson, Adnan Ashraf, said party chairperson Sajad Lone accompanied by senior leaders visited the residence of Baig and confabulated with him on a range of issues afflicting the people of J&K in these “difficult times”. “Lone also invited Baig to be a part of the party. He (Baig) keenly participated in the discussion and expressed his pleasure in joining the party from where he started his political career,” he added. Baig had started his political career in mid 80s and contested elections on a Peoples’ Conference ticket. He was considered close to the party founder, Abdul Gani Lone. However, in 1999, he along with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed laid the foundation of Peoples Democratic Party and became minister in the PDP-Congress coalition government. He also served as the deputy chief minister of J&K. He fought on a PDP ticket and won the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat. However, the PDP later sidelined him.

I will talk to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to keep tabs on the influx,” Jai Ram said after attending a videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.The Hiamchal chief minister said that PM Modi has asked all states to not only increase testing capacity, but also ensure strict implementation of various SOPs issued from time to time by the government. He said over 1.78 lakh people had been administered vaccine in the state that was about 2.6 percent of the total population. He said that the HP government was also keeping an eye on the situation and appropriate steps were being taken accordingly. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while virtually reviewing the situation of Covid-19 and progress in vaccination campaign in the country with the chief ministers, lieutenant governors and administrators of union territories, expressed concern over the sudden spike in the number of cases in a few states of the country. In Himachal, a spurt that began in February last week which is still continuing with a 10% rise in the first fortnight of March. Since the beginning of this month till March 16, Himachal has recorded 1,224 new infections compared to a total of 1,109 recorded in February. Opening of educational institutes and relaxation are said to be responsible for the rise while authorities claim that people also have become carefree and are not following the Covid-19 guidelines.

18-03-2021||Mumbai||PM2.5 pollution in Mumbai dipped 9% between 2019 and 2020: Report||The average daily concentration of PM2.5 in the city at stood 41.3ug/m3 for 2020, according to a report released on Tuesday by Swedish technology company IQ AirVisual. This is lower than the daily average of 45.3ug/m3 recorded in 2019. However, it is slightly higher than the safe annual threshold of 40ug/m3 as per India’s national ambient air quality standards.According to the latest World Air Quality Report, Mumbai noted an “observed” reduction of 9% in concentration of PM2.5 pollutants between 2019 and 2020. However, when accounting for “weather correction” — a mathematical factor which aims to eliminate the influence of weather on observed air pollution data — the reduction worked out to be about 13%, as per the report.Experts said this can be attributed largely due to the Covid-19-induced lockdown which brought a wide range of emissions to a halt. Similar reductions were noted in several Indian cities “with 63% reporting direct improvements over 2019 averages” with regard to PM2.5 levels.February remained the most polluted month in Mumbai with respect to PM2.5 pollution, clocking an average daily concentration of 73.3ug/m3, above the daily safe threshold of 60ug/m3 as per India’s NAAQS. June was the cleanest month, recording an average daily PM2.5 concentration of 15.9ug/m3. However, during the last quarter of 2020, PM2.5 levels returned to the same levels as the previous year, the data shows.Requesting anonymity, a spokesperson for System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) — which maintains an observational network of 10 air quality monitoring stations across Mumbai and Navi Mumbai — said, “The results are not surprising given that most of Mumbai’s prominent emissions sources, such as vehicles and construction activity, were essentially absent during the lockdown months. But I would not celebrate the findings. If you see the monthly data, the level of PM2.5 again rises sharply in October, November and December as lockdown restrictions were lifted. This report has given us some idea of how we can reduce particulate matter pollution, but finding city-specific solutions is now up to us.”Mumbai remained the third most polluted among major Indian cities featured in the World Air Quality Report (behind Delhi and Kolkata). Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai, meanwhile, all recorded cleaner air than Mumbai in 2020, with average daily PM2.5 levels ranging from 26ug/m3 to 35ug/m3.Overall, Mumbai saw average daily concentrations of PM.25 above or equal to 25ug/m3 on 64% of days during 2020. A similar metric for comparison with the previous year’s World Air Quality Report was not provided.The report also shows that, over the past six years, there has been a steady decline in the city’s annual average concentration of PM2.5 — from just under 50ug/m3 in 2015 to 41.3ug/m3 in 2020. The report does not, however, offer possible explanations for this trend.The report states that this progress is “only marginally attributable” to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) introduced in January 2019, which targets PM2.5 reductions between 20-30% in 122 selected cities by 2024, with reference to a 2017 baseline. “Officials cite the pandemic as part of the reason for the programme’s slow implementation,” the report goes on to state.Hindustan Times reached out to Sudhir Shrivastava, chairman of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), and VM Motghare, joint director of MPCB, for a comment but did not receive response till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pm25-pollution-in-mumbai-dipped-9-between-2019-and-2020-report-101616008092290.html

It was the first and last meeting of the committee constituted in November 2016.“I had attended the 2017 meeting. It was very constructive and some of the suggestions were implemented. We were also assured that such meetings would be held every three months. But since then, the government has not cared to call a single meeting, showing their non-seriousness about the important issues concerning the city,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in Chandigarh municipal corporation.However, former members have highlighted the committee’s effectiveness and importance for the city. “It is the only formal platform where Chandigarh’s residents can sit face to face with the officials of home ministry and air their grievances. They can bring important issues to the direct notice of the home minister. The discussions in the past meetings have borne positive results for the city,” said Surinder Bahga, member of the committee constituted in 2016.But this is not the first time that the committee’s meetings have been put on the back burner. As per senior UT officials, the last meeting in 2017 was held after a gap of nearly 12 years. The meeting in 2005 was held after 20 years.The tenure of the advisory committee members is three years, and they can get extension. Chandigarh is represented by the UT administrator, and in his absence, UT adviser. The member of Parliament, mayor, leader of opposition are the ex-officio members.

After the budget is approved by the BoF, it is placed before the syndicate and the senate for final approval before implementation.The term of the senate had ended on October 31 last year without fresh polls. The elections were postponed by vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar twice due to the pandemic, and PU is now functioning without a governing body.Issues on spending may ariseWith the final approval pending by the senate, the local audit department of PU may raise objections on spending from the next financial year.The regulations of the PU calendar lay down that “the budget estimates recommended by the BoF shall, after consideration by the syndicate, be submitted to the senate for sanction not later than March 31 of each year; in such form and in accordance with such directions as may be given by the syndicate.”Former senator professor Navdeep Goyal said, “If some problem arises, it is the V-C who will be responsible as he has not conducted the senate polls.”Budget approved by V-C: PUPU in its official version said, “The budget of 2021-22 has been approved by the BoF, consisting of nominees from the ministry of education, government of Punjab and the UT administration. After the approval from BoF, the same has been approved by the V-C in anticipation of approval of syndicate/senate, in exercise of powers vested in him under the PU regulations.”However, the regulation 14 of PU calendar volume 1, chapter II (A) (ii), states that whenever there is an urgency, the V-C may take such action as he deems necessary, and report the matter at the next meeting of the syndicate for approval.Former senator Ashok Goyal said, “To my knowledge there is no such provision in the PU calendar which grants power to the V-C to take any action in anticipation of both syndicate and senate. With neither syndicate nor senate in place, it seems that the V-C and other authorities have no respect for the law of the land.”“Merely the presence of government nominees in BoF does not mean that the syndicate and the senate are under obligation to approve what they say,” he added.PUTA secretary Amarjit Naura said, “We wish that no such financial crisis arises in the university, but if any issue arises in absence of the governing body then the V-C will be responsible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-s-2021-22-budget-remains-unapproved-101616008031018.html

Vipul Prakash, chief operating officer of MakeMyTrip, said, “While travel to drivable destinations will continue to be preferred by leisure travellers, we are noticing an increase in searches and bookings to some of the lesser-known hot spots in Assam, Daman and Diu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, among others. In comparison to advance bookings for summer travel in 2019, we are seeing traction build gradually for the upcoming season. However, as summer sets in and vaccination roll-out picks up pace, we are hopeful we will see it reflect in travel bookings.” As per the portal, compared to bookings made for the winter season in 2020, they are already noticing a 70% increase in daily holiday bookings for the upcoming summer season. “Within India, apart from unexplored destinations, people will be seen traveling to Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, North-east and to hills located down south. International leisure destinations such as Maldives, Seychelles and Russia are seeing a sudden rise in demand for the summer travel season,” Prakash added. International destinations that have opened their borders for India are seeing Indians travelling to those places. One such place is Seychelles which is a short-haul, visa-free destination for Indians, and therefore, does not entail planning much in advance.Lubaina Sheerazi, chief executive officer, BRANDit, the marketing and PR office for Seychelles Tourism Board in India, said, “With Seychelles opening up for tourism, and Indians having access to a new international travel destination, the response has been overwhelming among both consumers and the travel trade fraternity.

18-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra education department invites suggestions on fee act||Flooded with complaints on fee hike at private schools, the Maharashtra education department has invited suggestions from parents and other stakeholders for amendments to be made to the fee act.In a government resolution (Gr) issued on Tuesday, the department stated that parents, activists and other stakeholders can send their suggestions and objections for proposed changes in the act on- https://www.research.net/r/feeregulation. The state government recently formed an expert committee to suggest changes and revisions in the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. As per the government resolution (GR) issued on Tuesday, the committee will look into the suggestions that are sent by various stakeholders before giving its report.“There are several operational issues in the current fee act. Over the past few months, there have been a large number of complaints from parents regarding issues of fee hikes and fee-related disputes with private schools. While a committee has been formed to study the act and suggest changes if any, stakeholders can send their suggestions to the committee within a month’s time,” states the GR.Parents said they are hoping the government takes note of the suggestions made in the past. “Parents had sent a detailed list of recommendations before the amendment to the fee act was made in 2018. However, the then BJP government ignored them and went ahead with the anti-parent provisions in the act,” said a parent. The amendment allowed schools to hike fees by up to 15% once every two years. It also allowed schools to declare fees for the next five-10 years when a child gets admission in Class 1, thus undermining the role of parents and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) in fee related decisions. The act was called out for its pro-privatisation and pro-management stance, and its passage was followed by protests from parents across the state. While the resistance slowly faded away as the government turned a blind eye, the concerns raised then are now becoming major hurdles in addressing fee related disputes in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-invites-suggestions-on-fee-act-101616007671193.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s fight against pandemic fraught with lapses||Over the course of fighting one of the worst health crises to ever befall the City Beautiful, its people and the administration have grown a thick skin against the coronavirus. As Chandigarh marks a year since its first Covid-19 case, here’s a look at the administration’s dealing of the outbreak from March last year till now.The UT administration may boast high of “less” number of infections, low fatality rate and imposing timely restrictions at the onset of the pandemic in the city, but its counter measures have lacked in terms of department coordination and expected robust response.The first case confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported on 18 March 2020, when a 23-year-old student, who had returned from the UK was tested positive and was isolated at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32. The chain of infection was spread to her family, friends in Chandigarh and Panchkula.A total of 23,592 persons have been tested positive in the UT so far, which is almost 2 percent of the total population.Bapu Dham horror The ebb and flow of the virus spread in the city was fraught with lapses which were initially exposed with the community outbreak in Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, last year. Despite a strict approach towards testing, the UT administration had failed to cope up with the rising cases during the peak in September 2020.“The system is failing to respond effectively even to this day. Patients are being left in the lurch with no one to seek suggestions from in case of home isolation. There are no calls from the health officials and the patient has no idea how to go about it,” said Taruni Gandhi, a city resident who recently contracted the infection.Delayed detection “The testing was done so selectively that the asymptomatic persons were not detected in time which led to the massive outbreak in the city and high increase in infection load even in complete lockdown,” a senior health official, who was part of the core team handling the operations in the area, said.The administration later changed the policy by bringing in on-site sampling centres which brought the increased number of infections to the fore. At one point, a total of 75% infections in the city came from Bapu Dham Colony alone.A study by Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research had also revealed that a significantly high number of cases in Bapu Dham Colony were due to its dense population coupled with a huge number of asymptomatic infections that was responsible for the late detection and delayed isolation of cases leading to a widespread outbreak.September surge As the Covid-19 pandemic surged in Chandigarh in September last year, the UT administration was not able to get in touch with those testing positive within 24 hours of reporting, which further delayed contact tracing. A team of experts was also deputed by the central government in early September to find gaps and assist the local administration in dealing with the pandemic.The month saw a major surge in infections, with the record being set on September 13 (449 cases), while the highest number of active cases (3,171) was reported on September 16.The central team observed that initially in the zones where there were a smaller number of cases or were in the nascent phase of the epidemic, the authorities were not able to contact all positive cases in 24 hours, which resulted in delayed testing of their household contacts. Some positive patients even complained that the health department did not contact them, and they didn’t even know who to reach out to in case of any problem.Vaccine hesitancyEven though the vaccination drive prioritising health care and frontline workers commenced in mid-January, only 50% have been inoculated so far, hesitancy being a key reason behind their low turnout. The response to vaccination among senior citizens, however, has been promising.“We need to acknowledge that our infection number has been so low that people may not find it necessary to get vaccinated. But people should come forward for it if they are among the priority groups,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-fight-against-pandemic-fraught-with-lapses-101616007552545.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA brings Sachin Vaze to his Thane home||A day after establishing controversial former Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze’s role in parking an explosive-laden SUV near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s home Antilia on February 24, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) brought Vaze to his residence in Thane at 8pm on Wednesday. The NIA team had already initiated search and interrogation at his house since 2pm along with local police. The team was also set to visit Mumbra Creek where the body of Mansukh Hiran, who owned the SUV, was found on March 5. However, the team returned to Mumbai without going to Mumbra Creek, said sources. A local police officer said, “The NIA team, along with officers from Rabodi police, reached his residence at 2pm and started interrogating his family members. The team continued the interrogation till late at night.” Meanwhile, Shivdeep Lande, additional commissioner of police, Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), on Wednesday visited ATS office in Wagle Estate, Thane. Mumba police personnel and staff, who carried out Hiran’s post-mortem at Kalwa hospital, were called for questioning and their statements were recorded. Hiran’s diatom test report out, claims kinHiran’s family members said that they came to know that reports of the diatom tests are out. A family member requesting anonymity said, “We came to know that the diatom test report is with the police. But we haven’t received anything or being informed by the officers. We only want justice; whether NIA investigates the case or ATS is none of our concern.” The family had requested the diatom test to ascertain if Hiran’s death was caused by drowning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-nia-brings-sachin-vaze-to-his-thane-home-101616007550877.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Missing Panchkula hospital staffer found dead in Ambala||The body of a 23-year-old man reported missing for the past two days was recovered from the woods in Shahzadpur area in the district, police said on Wednesday.The victim, identified as Anil Kumar, worked at a private hospital in Panchkula.The police have registered a murder case against six persons on the complaint of the victim’s father.The deceased youth’s family also staged a protest demanding the arrest of the accused. The complainant, Ashok, alleged that his son was jointly murdered by the relatives of a local girl, with whom he (Anil) was having an affair, and another group of old rivals.He stated that on Sunday, Anil went out in the evening. But when he didn’t return, they lodged a missing persons complaint with the police on Tuesday. Later that day, they learnt that a body was found in a forest area. “We went there and identified him through his clothes, bike and mobile phone. He had several wounds on his neck and chest,” said the father, a resident of Dhanana village in Bhiwani district.He said that in 2018, some men on behalf of one Sajjan had beaten up Anil over enmity, but the dispute was resolved in a panchayat. “However, Sajjan’s men and the girl’s family have killed my son due to old enmity and the affair,” Ashok told the police.Shahzadpur police station in-charge Dhoom Singh said a murder case has been lodged against six persons. “The autopsy is pending, and the accused will be nabbed soon,” he said.This is the second murder case reported in the last 48 hours from the same area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/missing-panchkula-hospital-staffer-found-dead-in-ambala-101616007310726.html
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s daily Covid tally goes past 200 after six months||For the first time since September 24 last year, the daily tally of Covid-19 cases crossed the 200 mark on Wednesday, which also pushed the number of active cases to 1,330, highest in the past six months.As many as 201 people tested positive in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 23,592. While 21,903 patients have recovered, 359 have succumbed to the virus to date.In fact, the Prime Minister on Wednesday identified Chandigarh as one of the 12 states and UTs with “districts of concern” because of the steady rate of increase in cases between March 1 and 15.However, amid the spike, the Chandigarh administration has ruled out night curfew.“The infection spread is increasing, but fatalities have not shown any spike. We are monitoring the situation closely, and if things go beyond a certain point, the option of more restrictions is always open. However, there will be no knee-jerk reaction, such as night curfew,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. Parida said testing is being ramped up and more micro-containment zones are being demarcated, including six on Wednesday, to deal with the present surge.The health department has already warned of a second wave, like the one witnessed in September, mostly due to people ignoring the Covid appropriate behaviour.10 areas reporting maximum cases, though scatteredThe new cases being reported in the city this month are concentrated in a few pockets out of 71 localities in the city, official data suggests. As many as 35% of the cases reported between March 4 to 15 surfaced in Manimajra and nine sectors, mostly in southern parts (see map).“The clusters that may have developed are dependent on various factors, such as the population density. Also, infection spread in previous waves determines how much population is still vulnerable,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the school of public health and department of community medicine at PGIMER.Health department officials said that within the sectors that are reporting high numbers, the cases are scattered, making it difficult to demarcate micro-containment zones.“At least two houses vertically or horizontally should have been affected due to the virus to demarcate a micro-containment zone. However, presently the cases are scattered within sectors,” said a senior UT health official, not wishing to be named. Ramp up testing, ensure strict enforcement: Badnore Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore on Wednesday directed the health department to ramp up testing and told the police to ensure strict implementation of Covid norms, after attending a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding steps to be taken to control the resurgence of the pandemic.In his address during the virtual meet that was also attended by chief ministers of various states, Badnore said that though there has been a substantial rise in cases this month due to various relaxations and removal of restrictions on gatherings. After the meeting, Badnore directed senior UT officials to follow the principle of 3-Ts (Testing, Tracking and Treating) to combat the virus. The health department was told to enhance the number of tests, particularly RT-PCR, and to send genome samples to Pune to determine the strain of the virus.Badnore said that school teachers, students and people coming from outside at the railway station and bus stands should be regularly tested, and shopkeepers should get themselves tested as they come in contact with many customers.The administrator directed the director general of police to intensify challaning in public places, eateries and markets to ensure that people wear masks and follow social distancing. According to data shared by Badnore with the PM, the UT administration has already conducted 2.8 lakh tests against a population of around 12 lakh. He also mentioned that 57,000 people have been vaccinated, and the dose wastage is as low as 2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-daily-covid-tally-goes-past-200-after-six-months-101616006893416.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||2,377 new cases in Mumbai, highest in five months||The city on Wednesday reported 2,377 fresh covid-19 cases, crossing the 2,000-cases mark for the first time since October 15, when the city reported 2,119 cases in a single day. Mumbai also reported eight deaths on Wednesday. The total number of cases in the city has now shot up to 349,974, and the toll has reached 11,551. There are 15,410 active cases in the city at present.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, incharge of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) public health department, said, “Lockdown is not on the agenda for Mumbai right now. But restrictions related to following rules are being implemented very strictly. Maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks at public places are mandatory. The BMC is showing zero tolerance toward anyone breaking these rules or even home quarantine. A lockdown is mainly imposed to get health infrastructure ready, educate people and standardise treatment protocol.”Despite the recent spurt, Mumbai currently has 55% of its hospital beds available for Covid-19 as per data available as of March 16. Of the 13,062 hospital beds, 5,767 beds are occupied and 7,295 beds are vacant. In addition, Mumbai has 1,537 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, of which 42% or 652 are unoccupied, according to data from BMC as of March 16. Of the 942 ventilator beds, 40% or 377 beds are unoccupied and the rest are occupied. The BMC also plans to activate 200 more ICU beds in tertiary hospitals across the city in the coming days. As per data available for March 16, of the 15,263 active covid-19 cases, 62% or 9,489 patients are asymptomatic, 35% or 5,384 are symptomatic but in stable condition, and 3% or 426 patients are in a critical condition.Kakani said, “We plan to activate some of the ICU beds in tertiary hospitals so that critical patients would be treated properly. We have the ecosystem in such hospitals to take care of critical patients.”The present vacancy in Covid-19 beds has mainly been attributed to a larger percentage of active cases being asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and almost 90% of the case load coming from residential buildings. Asymptomatic patients living in residential buildings have the option of home quarantining themselves, as long as they have a separate room and toilet in their house for personal use. Else they are moved to Covid Care Centres (CCC2) or quarantine facilities. Mildly symptomatic patients are moved to hospitals or CCC2 facilities on the basis of severity of their symptoms.Currently, the city has eight active CCC2 facilities, with a bed capacity of 587, of which 285 are occupied. The BMC also has 29 buffer CCC2 facilities with a bed capacity of 4,875.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2377-new-cases-in-mumbai-highest-in-five-months-101616006891680.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees highest single-day Covid spike since September 17||A day after the Maharashtra government admitted that it was witnessing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, the state saw its highest single-day spike since September 17, 2020. The state on Wednesday clocked 23,179 new cases— the highest in 181 days. The state had reached its peak on September 11 last year, with 24,886 cases. Maharashtra has breached the 20,000-mark 16 times since the pandemic broke out in March 2020, of which, it surpassed the 23,000-mark six times, data showed. The state’s total tally rose to 2,370,507, while its active caseload climbed to 152,760. Mumbai recorded a 159-day high with 2,377 new cases, taking its tally to 349,974. The active case count in the city was 15,410. The state reported 84 fatalities on Wednesday, pushing the toll to 53,080. Of the 84 deaths reported on Wednesday, 42 occurred in the past 48 hours and 28 in the past week. The remaining 14 deaths are from the period before last week. Mumbai reported eight fatalities, taking its death toll 11,551. Nagpur city reported 2,698 fresh cases—topping the chart on Wednesday among the cities—followed by Pune city, which clocked 2,612 fresh cases. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (excluding Mumbai) reported 2,434 fresh cases, including Kalyan-Dombivli with 637 fresh cases and Thane city with 516 new cases. Districts, including Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Aurangabad, Buldhana, Yavatamal, Nanded, Beed, and Nandurbar, reported the chunk of the fresh cases on Wednesday. In the first three months of the year, Covid cases have seen a steady rise in the state. In January, the state reported 104,287 cases and 1,561 deaths. This rose to 128,671 fresh cases in February—a jump of 23.38%. Conversely, the deaths reduced by 31.32% in February to 1,072 fatalities. In March so far, Maharashtra’s cases have risen by 67.43% in comparison to February’s cases. So far, in March, the state has reported 215,437 new cases and 926 deaths. State health minister Rajesh Tope said though the cases are increasing, there is no need for “panic” as the state has adequate number of hospital beds and other life-saving equipment. He said that the bright side in the second surge is the death count and rate are under control. “I appeal to people of Maharashtra that there is no need to panic. There are enough beds in hospital, ICUs and oxygenated beds. In the second surge that we are witnessing today, the speed of infection is faster. If one person is infected, everybody in the house may get infected. Therefore, we need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Tope told reporters. He said that a chunk of the fresh cases are asymptomatic and are in home quarantine. “The ones who are admitted to the hospital, of them, only 5% of them are on oxygen, 3.8% are in the ICU,” he said. He added the government has directed district and municipal authorities to increase its contact tracing and ramp up testing. Tope said the state’s average testing per million population stood at 138,000. “We have been testing over 100,000 [samples] for the past few days. Since the cases are going up, the Centre expects to further increase it and we will do so. We have nearly 500 RT-PCR laboratories in the state and we will ensure that all these laboratories carry out tests to its full capacity,” Tope said. The minister said there is a challenge to trace contacts after the activities in the state have been fully unlocked. However, he said that the state is strictly following the three-T principle—trace, test, treat. “Today in the video conference with the prime minister the stress was on going back to tracing. We need to trace 20 to 30 contacts behind a positive patient. Definitely, there is a challenge in tracing today as we have opened up all activities, unlike earlier. The high-risk contacts who are family members mostly can be traced. But low-risk contacts difficult. However, we are going to follow it rigorously,” he assured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-highest-single-day-covid-spike-since-september-17-101616006770797.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No change in local train timings for now||Even as the number of passengers on local trains has been on the rise, the railways are unlikely to extend the timings for general public, amid the surge in Covid cases. While the curbs won’t be lifted, the services won’t be stopped too, for now.Local train services resumed for the general public on February 1. The general public are allowed to commute between noon and 4pm, post 7pm and from the start of the local train services till 7am. Nearly 3.7 million passengers travel by local trains – 2.1 million passengers on the Central Railway and 1.7 million on the Western Railway – daily. Railway authorities said that they have not received any requests from the state government on restricting time or suspending local train services for the general public. The CR operates 1,685 local train services, while the WR operates 1,300. Before lockdown, 8 million passengers travelled by local trains on the CR and WR.“We have not received any communication from the state or the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) regarding reducing local train timings or suspending train services. Reducing train timings will lead to overcrowding inside train compartments and on platforms. We will continue to operate the present number of local trains for essential workers, even if trains are later suspended for the general public,” said a senior railway official, who did not want to be named.Further, state officials have stated that commuting restrictions for local trains are likely to continue. “The restricted timings for passengers travelling by local trains are likely to continue.” said a senior state official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-no-change-in-local-train-timings-for-now-101616006711005.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||VBA to contest 90 seats in BMC polls||The Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) plans to contest 80-90 seats in the forthcoming 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls. The VBA plans to contest seats which have a substantial number of Dalit and Muslim population. The BMC elections are one of the prestigious, with a budget of approximately ₹39,000 crore, and give a lot of clout to the political parties. “We have built a formidable combination of Dalit, OBCs (Other backward Classes) and Muslim votebank,” said VBA chief Prakash Ambedkar. “Currently the Muslims have no alternative as the Congress is highly weakened and they are looking at VBA as their best choice,” said Ambedkar. The VBA plans to contest in areas like Chembur, Govandi, Kurla, Bhandup, Vile Parle, Borivali, Dadar, Kandivali and Jogeshwari. “Our workers have done excellent work at the grassroot level and we plan to contest at least 80-90 seats in the BMC polls. We are confident of winning a minimum of 40 seats,” he added. Ambedkar ruled out any truck with the BJP, but said he was ready for an alliance with the Congress, but on respectable terms. Political experts said though Ambedkar commands respect among the Dalit masses, it is unlikely to translate into votes. “The BMC elections are fought on strong ground level network and not on caste combinations,” said political commentator Surendra Jondhale. “VBA does not have a strong organisational network and there is no consistent mobilisation from their end. In the past one year, they have hardly raised issues concerning Dalits, OBCs and Muslims who were affected due to the Covid-19 lockdown,” he added. Ambedkar, who was marginalised for years, shot into limelight due to the January 1, 2018 incident, when Dalits were attacked at Bhima-Koregaon. Ambedkar took the lead and announced a state-wide bandh, which proved to be a success. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, the VBA, in alliance with the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), polled 41.08 lakh (7.63%) votes in the state. While the AIMIM won the Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat, the votes bagged by VBA candidates led to the defeat of two former chief ministers, Ashok Chavan and Sushilkumar Shinde, in Nanded and Solapur, respectively. However, in the Assembly polls held just months later, Ambedkar broke the alliance with AIMIM. The VBA also failed to strike an alliance with the Congress as it said it will give 144 seats of the total 288 to the latter. It said of the 144 seats, the Congress needs to accommodate even the NCP. In the final tally, the VBA was wiped out, as it failed to bag a single seat. The Congress said it was unfortunate that Ambedkar has still not learnt his lesson. “Ambedkar’s aim is just to help the BJP indirectly and this is evident as he plans to contest in such seats where we are strong. However, the voters have seen through his gameplan and will not vote for the VBA. Even last time, Ambedkar put impossible conditions before the polls for an alliance as he was not interested in any alliance. It is unfortunate that despite failing last time in the Assembly polls, the VBA has still not learnt its lessons,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vbato-contest-90-seats-in-bmcpolls-101616006651311.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Congress claims BJP link to car found from Sachin Vaze’s possession; party hits back||Maharashtra Congress has raised questions over the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) links with the Mercedes found in possession of arrested former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, as the vehicle was allegedly owned by a friend of the party’s Thane office-bearer. The Congress has also questioned leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on why he has not submitted the call detail records (CDR) of the conversation between Vaze and deceased businessman Mansukh Hiran to the investigating agencies.The BJP, meanwhile, has alleged that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was hushing up prime evidence in Hiran’s death case. BJP leader Ashish Shelar said forensic documents have not been submitted to the forensic science laboratory (FSL). “The selective documents and tapes related to the laboratory, autopsy report of Hiran have not been submitted in their original form. CM Thackeray should bring the whole truth to the fore,” Shelar said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Wednesday tweeted, “Now BJP connection emerges- the Mercedes car allegedly used by Mansukh Hiren on 17th February is seen in a photograph of BJP office-bearer of Thane. Would @BJP4Maharashtra leaders give an explanation? (sic)” He also tweeted photographs of a secretary of BJP’s Yuva Morcha, Thane with the owner of the SUV.Sawant also questioned why Fadnavis has not submitted the CDR to investigating agencies. “He had produced a CDR of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran. He should know that possessing CDR is an offence. By not submitting the document to the investigating agency, he has created doubts if he wants to shield the accused,” he said.Reacting to the allegations, Fadnavis said, “These are foolish allegations made by Sawant, who is known for such statements… I don’t even want to take cognisance of such claims. The BJP office-bearer has clarified that he is just a friend of the person who sold his Mercedes to Vaze.” Shelar said, “Congress’s state unit chief Nana Patole and Sachin Sawant have been levelling baseless allegations in connection with Antilia bomb scare and Vaze’s involvement in it. I think Congress leaders have been doing this deliberately as they do not want the truth to come to the light.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-claims-bjp-link-to-car-found-from-sachin-vaze-s-possession-party-hits-back-101616006590682.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM to Centre: Give Covid vaccine everyone over 45||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday requested the Centre to start Covid-19 vaccination for all citizens above 45 years of age to check the spread of the pandemic. He also wanted the state’s supply of vaccines be increased to 2 million doses a week, among other demands made during a meeting of chief ministers of all states and Union territories with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.The state also recorded 23,179 fresh Covid-19 cases, first in excess of 20,000 since September 26 (20,419 cases) and highest one-day spike since September 17 (24,619 cases), taking the tally to 2,370,507. September 17’s daily caseload was the peak of the first wave of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. On Wednesday, Thackeray said that looking at the large number of young people getting infected, people above 45 years must be allowed to get vaccinated, even if they do not have comorbidities. “Keeping in mind that there is a young population among those getting infected, people above the age of 45, irrespective of comorbidities, should get vaccinated,” Thackeray said in the meeting with Modi.The state government has now targeted to ramp up its vaccination drive to 300,000 beneficiaries daily—more than double its current average of 138,957 per day. “Several private hospitals have come forward and registered themselves, but they will be allowed to operate, looking at their overall preparedness, Efforts will be made to take the daily vaccination to 300,000,” Thackeray said, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO).Responding to Union minister Prakash Javadekar’s charge that the Maharashtra government was mismanaging the vaccination drive, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the state has vaccine stock that would last 10 days. Tope said that he had apprised union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday of its stock availability based on its current trend of daily vaccination. The vaccination issue could become the latest friction point between the Centre and the state.Javadekar claimed that the Shiv Sena MPs were asking the Centre for more vaccines, while the state has only utilised 44% of what has already been delivered. In a tweet on Thursday the Union minister said, “The Maharashtra government had only used 23 lakh vaccines out of the total 54 lakh vaccines sent to the state, till 12th March. 56% vaccines remained unused. Now, Shiv Sena MP asks for more vaccines for the state. First, mismanagement of pandemic, now poor administration of vaccines.”Responding to the claim, Tope said, “One union minister tweeted that we still have 31 lakh vaccines available. As per our target of 300,000 vaccinations a day, we only have vaccine stock that will last 10 days. I have told this to Rajesh Bhushan. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, too, has told this to the prime minister in today’s video conference meeting.”According to the CMO, the state has 3,138,643 doses available with itself. Till March 16, Maharashtra has inoculated 3,365,952 beneficiaries, including healthcare workers, frontline workers, senior citizens and people between age groups 45 and 59 with comorbidities.The state sought inclusion of 50-bedded private hospitals as vaccine centres to speed up its vaccination drive. Tope said they have requested the Centre to relax the conditions laid down for a hospital to be eligible to become a vaccination centre. Tope said that they have asked the Centre to revise its policy and reduce the criteria from 100-bed hospitals to 50-bed ones, which could be allowed to give vaccines.“We have sought relaxation in the condition that only 100-bed private hospitals can be allowed to give vaccines. They should, at least, reduce 50-bed hospitals. Ultimately, adequate space is required for vaccination, proper cold storage facility and means to tackle cases if there are any adverse effects following immunisation. If these parameters are fulfilled by either 50-bed or 20-bed hospital, then it should be allowed to give vaccines. We hope this is accepted,” Tope told reporters in Mumbai. The minister added that the health department will give “zero wastage” target to all vaccination centres in the state to achieve least amount of vaccine wastage. Besides that, Thackeray also requested the Centre to allow its Mumbai-based Haffkine Bio Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited to manufacture Covaxin in association with Bharat Biotech. The chief minister said that the state-owned research institute in Mumbai should be allowed to attain vaccine technology from Bharat Biotech or it can be allowed to work on a “fill-and-finish’ basis. Thackeray, according to a statement from the CMO, said that the state can produce 126 million vaccines though Haffkine. Haffkine is a public-sector undertaking owned by the state government and has developed a number of vaccines that include anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc.Tope, while speaking to reporters said, “We have demanded that the technology transfer from Bharat Biotech [which manufactured Covaxin] can be done to Haffkine Institute. We have two options; firstly, either we can manufacture it on our own or they provide technology and we use our space and equipment and we do it on a fill-and-finish basis. The prime minister is positive about it. If this is accepted, then we are definitely going to put a condition that Maharashtra should get 25% of the product in lieu of its capital input of land and equipment.”In the meeting, the chief minister said that contact tracing has become a challenge as all activities are open and the movement of people has increased. Then, too, the contact-tracing will be done on “war-footing”. Thackeray added that the Centre has expressed satisfaction in the number of vaccination and RT-PCT tests the state carries out in a day. He said Maharashtra is well above other state in terms of RT-PCT tests, which should be 70% of the total tests carried out to detect coronavirus cases. The statement from the CMO said, “The health secretary during a presentation said that Maharashtra’s performance with regards to vaccination is satisfactory. The daily average inoculation carried out 138,957, which is better than some leading states.”The vaccination drive in the state has picked up after the senior citizens and people between 45-59 age bracket were eligible to get a jab. The state government, according to a health department official, said that they will be able to touch higher daily targets on a daily basis. “On March 16, we achieved target of 232,340 vaccination which is much higher than our average. The average seems low because we had a slow start to our drive. It is picking up. Soon, we will hit the desired target of 300,000,” he said requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-to-centre-give-covid-vaccine-everyone-over-45-101616006532205.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Home vaccination likely in the fourth phase: Mumbai civic body||To deal with overcrowding at vaccination centres, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is likely to allow inoculation at homes during the fourth phase of the nationwide mass immunisation programme. The contemplation is following a suggestion put forth by the state’s Covid-19 task force last week to the civic body to allow vaccinations at home for senior citizens with severe comorbidities to prevent them from probable infections at centres. BMC officials, however, turned it down citing a lack of feasibility.“At this moment, we can’t implement the plan. Every beneficiary is kept under observation for 30 minutes in a room after vaccination. By the time the fourth phase starts, we will have a better understanding of both vaccines. Then, we can think of starting home vaccination,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.As HT has reported earlier, most vaccination centres are facing overcrowding. This increases the risk of contracting Covid-19 infection especially among the elderly with underlying health issues who are most vulnerable to the virus.“We are seeing individuals with partial paralysis being taken to vaccination centres for inoculation in ambulances. It would have been better if BMC under their supervision could start inoculating them at home at their own cost. This would have helped to control the crowd at vaccination centres,” said a member of the task force.The civic body is gradually trying to extend the number of vaccination centres and plan to inoculate 1lakh probable beneficiaries daily.“Daily, we are holding inspections of private hospitals who are willing to take part in the mass immunisation process. We have also shortlisted another 49 private hospitals with over 50 beds and sent their names to the central government for approval,” said Kakani. “We will keep adding more hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/home-vaccination-likely-in-the-fourth-phase-mumbai-civic-body-101616006530956.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||Mercedes owner says he had sold the car online, has nothing to do with Vaze||Saransh Bhavsar, 27, the registered owner of the Mercedes Benz that was being used by suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his role in parking an explosives-laden SUV near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, on Wednesday said he had sold the vehicle in February to a car-trading site and that he has nothing to do with the officer. The tours and travels operator from Dhule in northern Maharashtra said, “I don’t know who Sachin Vaze is. I heard his name for the first time on Tuesday evening when the media started showing the Mercedes, mentioning his name,” said Bhavsar. “I do not have any connection to Vaze,” he said. On Tuesday, multiple NIA officials told HT that 49-year-old Vaze, who was arrested on Saturday, was behind the bomb scare, which he orchestrated as part of a conspiracy to restore his reputation as a successful officer, contending that the mystery around the explosives-laden vehicle has been solved. A senior Mumbai Police officer said the NIA has found an invoice of the car’s purchase, which was for ₹28 lakh in the name of a company, in February 2021, while conducting a search of Vaze’s erstwhile office at the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU). “We also found a car key,” the officer said. “The car was purchased in a company’s name,” he added. Bhavsar, owner of Ansh Roadways, said he had purchased the Mercedes from a showroom in Pune in November 2019 and sold it to an online car-trading site, CARS24, last month. “CARS24 complies with stringent legal practises for the buying and selling of automobiles through its website. All documentation and processes undertaken are aimed at ensuring transparency and utmost customer satisfaction. As a responsible brand, we would like to reiterate that we neither influence nor participate in any illegal activities undertaken with the automobile, before or after the sale. In light of the recent investigation, we have already submitted the information requested by the relevant authorities and will continue to cooperate with them to clarify any queries pertaining to the sale,” said the CARS24 spokesperson.A Mumbai Police officer said the luxury car was seen being used intermittently by Vaze. The suspended police officer used to come to the office in the vehicle twice or thrice a week. Other police officers said Vaze had been seen using several other private vehicles and that he was also in the habit of using fake number plates on the vehicles in his possession or use. The Mercedes Vaze was driving was a GLC 220D 4Matic with registration number MH 18 BR 9095.A team of NIA officers on Tuesday seized the Mercedes and also inspected the car. On Tuesday evening, NIA inspector-general Anil Shukla said their preliminary probe has confirmed that Vaze used the car, but the agency was yet to verify its ownership. NIA had not commented on the ownership until Wednesday evening. Shukla also confirmed that their search of the Mercedes revealed more than Rs5 lakh in cash, a currency note counter, some clothes and a set of vehicle number plates matching that of the Mahindra Scorpio found abandoned near the Ambani residence, Antilia, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threat note, on February 25. Though several vehicles are parked on Carmichael Road, where the SUV was abandoned, a security officer found the SUV suspicious because it was carrying a number plate identical to that of the lead vehicle in the security convoy of Reliance Foundation chairperson and Ambani’s wife, Nita. Gamdevi police then reached the spot and called in the bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS), which inspected the vehicle and found the gelatin sticks and letter. The sticks carried the words “Superpower 90 Danger Explosive” and the name of its manufacturer, Solar Industries India Limited, Chadoh, in Nagpur. However, it not yet clear as to how the gelatin, mostly used for mining purposes, landed in the vicinity of the Ambani residence. On February 27, Gamdevi police registered an offence in connection with the SUV. The NIA had taken over the case for investigation on March 8, following orders issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Vaze’s role first came under the spotlight after the death of Mansukh Hiran, who came forward as the person who possessed the Scorpio after it was found from outside Antilla. Hiran told police it was stolen from his residence before he was interrogated multiple times, including by Vaze’s unit. Hiran was found dead on March 5, and the police said it was a suicide. His wife, however, said she suspected the police officer’s role in the death, kicking off a chain of events that eventually led to Vaze being questioned and arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mercedes-owner-says-he-had-sold-the-car-online-has-nothing-to-do-with-vaze-101616006410802.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||No physical meeting of civic bodies amidst second Covid wave: Bombay HC||In the light of experts predicting the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and the state government hinting at revisiting lockdown norms, the Bombay high court (HC) has refused to interfere in a petition filed by municipal councillors from Thane seeking directions to the urban development department and municipal authorities to conduct council meetings physically. The court has expressed hope and trust that as and when the situation improves, the municipal authorities will resume physical meetings. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by Vikrant Chavan and Ashraf Pathan, councillors of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), were, informed that as the Parliament and Assembly sessions were being conducted in physical mode, the municipal authorities should be directed to discontinue virtual meetings of the general body. On March 16, when the petitions came up for hearing, government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade placed a letter addressed by the undersecretary, urban development department, before the court. The letter stated that the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was predicted by the experts and, therefore, the situation called for strict adherence to Covid-19 related health protocol and norms. The court observed that through the communication the government also proposed to revisit such a decision after a month based on the ground realities of Covid-19 cases in the state. The court noted that it was not inclined to grant the prayers of the petitioners and said, “In matters of protocol relating to health and medical care, the court ought to be slow to interfere with the executive policy decision.” The court, while disposing of the petitions said, “In such view of the matter, we dispose of the writ petitions expressing hope and trust that as and when the situation improves and holding of general meetings of the municipal corporations and the councils with the physical presence of the corporators/councillors is possible, the relevant department shall not waste any further time to revisit its decision and take an appropriate decision as the facts and circumstances would warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-physical-meeting-of-civic-bodies-amidst-second-covid-wave-bombay-hc-101616006292357.html

18-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Haffkine institute seeks nod to make Covaxin||The state-owned Haffkine Institute has sought permission from the Centre for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech, an Indian biotechnology firm that has developed Covid-19 vaccine — ‘Covaxin’. Alternatively, it has also sought permission for ‘fill and finish’ operations of the Covid vaccine, in which, it will only fill vaccines in bottles and make them ready as a product.In a video conference meeting with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi held on Wednesday, the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also requested permission for the same, to which, the PM said they will encourage the industries and institutions interested in manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine.In January, Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Company sought permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech that has developed the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in the country. It means, the institute will be able to manufacture the vaccine, if provided the technology.In the first week of March, the institute again sought permission for starting fill and finish operations for the Covid vaccine from the ICMR. In this process, Haffkine will get the vaccine in bulk and it will use its resources for fill and finish operations, said Sandip Rathod, managing director, Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Company.Haffkine is a public sector undertaking owned by the state government and has developed several vaccines that include anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, oral polio vaccine etc.ICMR is an apex body in the country for the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical research.“Under ‘Mission Covid Suraksha’ the Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Limited (a subsidiary of Haffkine Institute) should get permission for the transfer of technology by ICMR so that vaccines can be produced. The firm can also start with fill and finish operations in which the firm aims to manufacture 126 million vaccines,” the chief minister said in the video conference meeting.In response, the PM said they will encourage all the industries and institutions for developing the Covid-19 vaccine. The Centre will also be looking to promote utilizing such facilities in all the states 24x7 a day, said a statement issued by the chief minister office.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “PM Modi was positive over the request made by the chief minister for permitting technology transfer for manufacturing Covid vaccine. If permitted, we will demand the use of 25% of the total production in Maharashtra.”“The operations for fill and finish production can be started in more than a month if permitted. The manufacturing of vaccines on its own will take more than a year. As for that, we have to develop BSL-3 laboratory and other resources,” Rathod said.State medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said the Haffkine will set up a new plant for manufacturing the Covid vaccine in collaboration with Bharat Biotech. The project will cost ₹154 crore. “It is going to be done in two phases, in the first phase, fill and finish operations will be started by taking vaccines in bulk from Bharat Biotech. In the second phase, Haffkine will start manufacturing on its own by taking technology from the firm, which will take one and a half years. Till then, fill and finish operations will be continued,” Deshmukh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-haffkine-institute-seeks-nod-to-make-covaxin-101616006171489.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP case: How much more time to complete probe: HC asks Mumbai Police||While noting that even after three months, investigations had not yielded anything concrete in the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case, the Bombay high court (HC) asked Mumbai Police to inform it as to how long it wants to continue investigations. The court also sought a timeline of the same and as to whether it would proceed against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, who are not named as accused in either of the two charge sheets filed by the police so far.On Wednesday, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale were hearing the petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which runs Republic TV, and Goswami, seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) and charge sheet filed by Mumbai Police in TRP case. Senior counsel Ashok Mundargi continued from where he left, on Tuesday.Mundargi submitted that while other channels had also been named in the case, the police were only interrogating Republic TV employees and the channel’s role in the case. Mundargi submitted that though the police had been investigating for four months, they had been unable to get any evidence to nail the channel and it was like a sword hanging on the heads of the channel and its employees.Special counsel for the state Shishir Hiray submitted that the reports of BARC and statements by some witnesses showed that some channels were involved in manipulating TRPs. He submitted that the information with the Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in October was about money being paid to households where barometers were installed to watch certain channels, however, in December the BARC report showed that there had been discrepancies in viewership ratings.After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from the police as to how much more time it needed to investigate the case as it could not go on forever. The court also sought a timeline of the investigation and directed the police to submit the same in the hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-case-how-much-more-time-to-complete-probe-hc-asks-mumbai-police-101616006050735.html
18-03-2021||Mumbai||HC hints at CAG probe on Mumbai-Pune expressway toll collection||The Bombay high court is likely to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to conduct a thorough investigation into the toll collection done by the contractor on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, after hearing objections in public interest litigation (PIL) for the extension of the contract till 2030. The court expressed astonishment that the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) could not recover the total capital outlay of the project of ₹3,632 crore since the expressway was thrown open for public use in 2004, and as a result of which, the recovery now stands at ₹22,000 crore. The court has asked the advocate general and the additional solicitor general to appear before the court on Thursday. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by activist and advocate, Pravin Wategaonkar was informed that he was challenging the toll collection on Mumbai-Pune Expressway and seeking a declaration that levying toll on the e-way from August 2019 was illegal as per the Motor Vehicle Tax Act, 1958. Pointing to the submissions in the MSRDC affidavit filed in response to the PIL, Wategaonkar drew the attention of the bench to the fact that there was no mention of the total capital outlay for the project and the period over which it was to be recovered in the Build-Operate-Transfer agreement between the corporation and the contractor. The affidavit merely spoke about the amount recovered so far and how much was pending as of date. On perusing the affidavit the court sought to know from MSRDC what the total cost of the construction was, however, the counsel for the corporation only submitted that while ₹3632 crore was recoverable in 2004, the recoverable now stood at ₹22,370 crores. Astonished at the reply the court observed that it was difficult to believe that project cost recoverable in 2004 was yet to be recovered. Expressing its displeasure that the MSRDC affidavit was filed without any supporting documents the court said that the same deserved to be rejected. The court then sought to know from MSRDC how much of the toll collected was benefitting the general public and how much of it was going to the private contractor. The court then sought the presence of additional solicitor general Anil Singh for CAG and advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the state before it on Thursday and said that after hearing them it was likely to ask the CAG to conduct a thorough investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-hints-at-cag-probe-on-mumbai-pune-expressway-toll-collection-101616005930752.html

HT had, on Wednesday, reported that Meshram was struggling for days to get an appointment for the United States of America (USA) emergency visa for his son’s life-saving surgery. The Meshrams have been called to the consulate on Thursday for a visa interview. “The consulate officers assisted us in getting the slots and approved our appointment requests immediately. Now, I am hopeful that I would be able to save my son. I am so thankful to people who came forward to help us,” said Meshram, who works as a wall painter. Priyanshu is suffering from a rare congenital heart defect where the impure blood gets mixed with pure blood, damaging the lungs of the child. Due to the severity of his illness, he was referred to Boston Children’s Hospital for his surgery. In 2018, the hospital gave them an estimation of ₹2crore for the procedure. It took Meshram more than two years to raise the money through crowdfunding. The hospital scheduled his surgery on April 5 and instructed him to reach Boston by March 22 for a pre-surgery diagnosis. But due to the on-going pandemic, severe restrictions have been imposed on issuing visa. After HT published a report on Wednesday detailing the plight of the family awaiting visa, the US consulate contacted the family. As per the family, they facilitated the appointment online and have also called for their visa interview on Thursday morning. The state minister Aaditya Thackeray on social media asked the US consulate to look into the matter. “While we cannot comment on individual visa cases for privacy reasons, we place a high priority on any cases involving medical care and attempt to expedite such cases to the maximum extent possible under U.S. immigration law,” said Nick Novak, spokesperson, US Consulate General, Mumbai. The family is now hopeful that they will be able to make it in time to reach Boston by March 22 for the surgery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-after-ht-report-man-gets-emergency-visa-for-6-year-old-son-s-surgery-in-us-101616005751301.html

They are not fit for offices,” Puri said in the Rajya Sabha while responding to a question by Congress MP Amee Yajnik over the number of buildings that will be demolished for the redevelopment of the Centra Vista.“We are now going to relocate you. Madam, we will relocate you to a new parliament building where you will have enough space,” he added.The Congress has been arguing against the Central Vista redevelopment project during a pandemic and economic recession.On December 10, Congress’ parliamentary leaders had boycotted the ‘Bhoomi poojan’ ceremony for the new Parliament building by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Puri also said the Centre has not taken any decision on how the old Parliament building will be used.“At this point of time, no comprehensive thought has been given to what precise use the old parliament building will be put to. Several suggestions keep coming, including that there should be an institute for democratic and parliament studies. These are merely suggestions. No decisions have been taken,” he said.The Central Vista plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves building a new Parliament by India’s 75th year of Independence in 2022. It also includes constructing 11 administrative buildings to house all the government ministries and is scheduled to be finished by 2024. Tata Projects Limited was tasked with the construction of the new Parliament complex on September 29, 2020.Broadly, the plan also includes razing buildings such as Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan that house important government ministries to build a common secretariat for nearly 70,000 central government employees who are currently located across 30 buildings. “We hope that the next winter session of Parliament will be held in the new building in 2022, which also happens to be the 75th year of Independence,” Puri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-built-substandard-buildings-like-krishi-bhawan-shastri-bhawan-puri-101616004010999.html

In its affidavit on Wednesday, the civic body said it considers the absence of a member from monthly meetings over a period of “consecutive three calendar months” and not “three consecutive monthly meetings”.The corporation said it had held its meetings in January and February 2020, but, due to the Covid-19 lockdown, it could not hold a meeting in March 2020 or the months that followed.The next meeting was held in June 2020 and then in July 2020. The EDMC said Hussain was absent from all meetings since January 2020.Hussain in his plea challenging his disqualification contended that he had not absented himself from meetings “for three successive months” as the meetings were never held successively for three months till August 2020 when the decision to disqualify him was taken. He said as he was being held in judicial custody since March 5, he could not be faulted for the unavoidable circumstances.On November 4, the high court had stayed the decision of the EDMC to disqualify Hussain.The civic body said Hussain did not seek approval for his absence from meetings for being lodged in judicial custody. It also said Hussain had changed his address after the north-east Delhi riots but he did not intimate the corporation about it.The matter would be now heard on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tahir-hussain-suspended-because-he-skipped-meetings-edmc-tells-hc-101616003951164.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||First road built of legacy waste to come up in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri area||The East Delhi civic body will construct its first road using legacy municipal waste on an 800-metre stretch in Kalyanpuri, officials said on Wednesday, a project that will reportedly be the first of its kind in the city. A tender for the project will be floated after a detailed project reported is finalised in a civic body meeting.East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) officials said the pilot project will be overseen by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI).Vijay Prakash, the East civic body’s chief engineer, said CRRI will check if the road, to be made with legacy waste inert materials generated after processing by trommel machines at Ghazipur landfill, is fit to bear the expected load and examine it for cracks.“We will use nearly 25,000 metric tonnes of legacy waste from Ghazipur landfill in the process,” said Prakash.Labelling it a “first-of-its kind experiment”, Prakash said if the project is a success, then waste inert materials could potentially be used in the construction of other road projects as well, including expressways.The EDMC generates nearly 3,900 metric tonnes of inert materials a day by processing legacy waste at Ghazipur landfill using 20 trommel machines. East Delhi generates nearly 2,700 metric tonnes of garbage every day, of which 1,100 metric tonnes are dumped at Ghazipur landfill.Municipal officials said that the project will be implemented and funded under the “Waste to Wealth Mission” of the central government.Earlier, the civic agency had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to supply processed legacy waste to fill the embankment of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, an agreement that did not materialise due to apprehensions about the strength of the inert material.“The entire project will be conducted under the supervision of CRRI. They will study the strength of inert materials being used in the road and also check if there are any chances of cave-ins. The EDMC will only provide the land and inert materials for the construction,” a senior EDMC official said.Vasant G Havangi, chief scientist CRRI, said that lab testing of the waste inert materials was conducted by the CRRI and that yielded good results. In the lab tests it was found that these inert materials can be used for the road construction and retaining walls of flyovers, expressways.He said the road, which will be constructed through inert materials, is a service road of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway where load carrying capacity of inert materials will be tested on site. “We plan to finish the work by June 2021 and leave it for traffic and monsoon to pass. During this period we will check characteristics of the road. In July 2022 we will submit a report to the Centre,” Havangi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-road-built-of-legacy-waste-to-come-up-in-east-delhi-s-kalyanpuri-area-101616003950608.html
18-03-2021||Delhi||Transit-oriented hub coming up fast in East Delhi||Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday reviewed Karkardooma’s Integrated Development of East Delhi Hub, which is Delhi’s first Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) project with officials saying that the work on the project has picked up pace as the Centre is soon going to notify the TOD policy.The policy, which was put in the public domain for comments, will be tabled in a Delhi Development Authority (DDA) meeting on Thursday and then sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry for approval.Spread over 37.42 hectares, the ₹1168-crore project will have residential, commercial green spaces.“Advised VC, DDA to firm up an activity-wise timeline for each phase of implementation to facilitate close monitoring and time-bound completion of the project. Also advised the team to prepare a blueprint for the implementation of the PPP component of the project on priority,” Baijal tweeted.The TOD policy, which is aimed at sustainable development around rapid transit facilities such as Metro, was notified in July 2015. It couldn’t be implemented due to objections from the public against DDA regulations issued in 2016. In March 2017, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry directed DDA to review the policy.DDA officials said that the mixed-use development will have office complexes at walking distance and will be connected to Karkardooma metro stations, which is an interchange between Blueline (Vaishali to Dwarka) and Pink line (Shiv Vihar to Majlis park). It will also house one of the biggest residential complexes in the densely populated east Delhi with 6,518 flats, including 1,992 for the economically weaker section.“It will have various amenities like schools, dispensaries, library, cultural centre, community halls, convenient shopping, community spaces, creche etc. Environmentally friendly/ green building features, skywalk connectivity and cultural centre are other notable features of the project,” the L-G tweeted.In 2019, DDA prepared a plan to develop areas around five Metro stations — Dwarka Sector 18, Dwarka Sector 21, Mayur Vihar Extension, Mukundpur, Sarojini Nagar and INA (combined). A DDA official says that these stations were selected based on high footfall and the scope for real estate development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/work-on-east-delhi-integrated-hub-to-pick-up-pace-101616003950029.html

Police said the woman, who runs a tea shop in the area, had come to open her shop in the morning when the men, who were on a motorcycle, shot her.Police said the woman has been identified as Meena Tamang, who ran the tea and snack shop along with her husband Jeet Maan. Both of them lived nearby, in a one-room set with their 12-year-old daughter. The couple was of Nepali origin and had been living there for the past few years, police said.The matter was reported to the police around 7am -- a call was received at the Timarpur police station about a woman being shot. A police team reached the spot and rushed the woman to Sushrut Trauma Centre, but she could not be saved, a senior police officer said.“During the initial probe, it was found that the attackers did not flee with the woman’s money or phone or any other valuables. Prima facie, it doesn’t look like a robbery attempt. It seems that she was attacked over some enmity. It also looks like the assailants knew what time she would open her shop. She was attacked when she was alone. Her family members and husband are being questioned to know if the woman had a dispute with anyone,” said a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity.Police have not ruled out the involvement of someone known to the woman behind the murder. Police are also checking CCTV footage to establish the sequence of events and track the vehicle used by the assailants.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said the woman sustained a single gunshot injury. “A crime and forensics team were called at the spot to collect evidence. The autopsy report is awaited,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nepalese-woman-shot-dead-by-two-men-on-a-motorcycle-in-north-delhi-101616003711075.html

The proposal will now be sent to the state and centre for approval. The proposal was pending before the general body for the past one year, after receiving the approval of the standing committee in March 2020. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “There has been a delay in approving the Swargate-Katraj route which will be one of the most crucial stretches, given the high footfall expectancy. It happened due to the Covid-19 pandemic as general body meetings are not being held.

Pakistan has blocked the drain from entering its territory and this has led to large-scale accumulation of untreated water. The Sutlej flows down from the Himalayas through Punjab and into neighbouring Pakistan, before turning back into India again. Under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, Pakistan is supposed to desilt and maintain drains such as the one at Fazilka.Fazilka drain is one of 22 drains and water bodies, where untreated water of Malwa district is discharged. The monitoring committee has said that the drain is closed at the borderline of countries, leading to stagnation in the shape of ponds and deterioration of quality of groundwater in the border area. The contamination of groundwater has been detected at more than 100ft in the border area.The direction is based on a review of remedial measures in Moga, Fazilka, Ferozepur, Faridkot and Muktsar districts. Justice Jasbir Singh (retd), chairman of committee, had chaired the review meeting on March 4. “Punjab chief secretary shall again take up matter with the ministry of water resources, to further take up the matter with the ministry concerned of government of Pakistan through the ministry of external affairs to open the Fazilka drain,” the committee recommended. On November 11, 2020, the chief secretary had written to the department of water resources, ministry of jal shakti, to look into the matter. There was, however, no positive result. Justice Jasbir added, “The halt in the flow of Fazilka drain at the borderline has created around a 2.5-km pound, where water is being stagnated. The stagnated water is seeping into the lands and contaminating groundwater. We have closed several hand pumps in the area, after harmful bacteria were found up to 150 feet deep in ground water.”“The removal of the blockade of the Fazilka drain will avoid stagnation of water and seepage. However, the solution is that the untreated sewage water which falls in the drain should be cured. Number of efforts have been made in this direction and improvement has resulted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/talk-to-pak-on-opening-blockade-on-fazilka-drain-ngt-panel-to-punjab-101616002330867.html

The police said they have apprehended the juvenile and also registered a case against the toddler’s parents for employing a minor as a domestic help.An official with the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) said that as per the juvenile’s version of events, she dropped the girl when she was picking her up to console her, as she kept crying due to the absence of her parents. “Despite her repeated attempts, she (the infant) did not stop (crying). She lost her temper, kicked her and punched her as she got irritated,” the official said. The police said that according to the medical loss ratio (MLR) report from the doctors on Wednesday, four of the toddler’s rib bones were fractured while her pancreas, kidney and spleen were severely injured, and her condition remained critical on Wednesday evening.Also Read | Three booked for assaulting acquaintance, sharing video on social mediaA case under sections 323 (assault), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the juvenile on Wednesday after an investigation took place and statements of parents and doctors were recorded. According to the police, the parents of the toddler had hired a 15-year-old girl as domestic help three months ago to take care of their daughter. The help used to visit their apartment for a few hours every day and was paid ₹9,000 per month. Police commissioner KK Rao said there were CCTV cameras in the house but since the incident took place inside a bedroom, it was not captured. “The help has confessed to the crime but as the family had hired a minor, we have registered a case against them under Juvenile Justice Act at Sector 56 police station on Wednesday,” Rao said. Sonia Yadav, a member of Child Welfare Committee (CWC), said that the families risk the lives of their children by hiring juveniles as nannies. “This incident has raised questions on the child labour issues of whether minors are mature enough to be nannies. The juvenile in conflict with law has been sent to Nari Niketan in Karnal,” she said, adding that a team will visit the hospital to meet the parents on Thursday.Pawan Kumar, the station house officer of Sector 56 police station, said that they received a complaint on Tuesday night following which a case was registered against the minor. “The parents in their statement told us that they had hired a girl through their cook from Sector 53. She used to live there with her father and stepmother. On Monday, the toddler’s parents went to buy groceries and asked the help to take care of the toddler as she was sleeping,” he said. As per the statement, the parents returned home around 9.30pm and found the toddler shrieking in pain and bleeding. They rushed her to a hospital in Sector 56, from where she was referred to a speciality hospital in Sector 51 due to her critical condition. The doctors conducted several tests and informed parents that the toddler had received severe injuries all over her body. The parents informed the police on Tuesday, following which the minor girl was questioned by a police team and apprehended on Wednesday.According to the police, the couple had installed CCTV cameras in the drawing room, dining area, kitchen and outside the house but the incident took place inside a bedroom. “The father told us that they used to treat the juvenile like their own child and they never faced any issues with her. She was warm and loving towards their daughter. He also said they used to take their daughter along wherever they went but as she was sleeping they preferred to leave her at home with the help,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/toddler-in-critical-condition-after-being-assaulted-by-juvenile-caretaker-101616001670525.html

His wife also tested positive. However, she has not been inoculated yet. an official said on Wednesday evening. District nodal officer (IDSP) and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Sahir Pal said the doctor couple have been put under home isolation as both were asymptomatic and kept under round the clock observation.25 contacts tested, beauty salon sealed“A Beauty Salon and Spa under Sakchi police here has been sealed this afternoon where doctor’s wife had availed the services. RT-PCR tests have been done on seven salon staff while 18 close contacts of the doctor couple have also been tested for Covid-19 on Wednesday. All of them have been asked to quarantine themselves till test reports come. We will conduct RT-PCR tests on the couple again after seven days and decide if their samples should be sent to Pune for advanced test for new Covid-19 strain,” said Dr Pal.Preliminary examination has found some patches in the chest of the doctor’s wife while the doctor is comparatively in good health despite being a cancer patient himself.No need to panicJamshedpur district deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar said there’s no need to panic as there would be some exceptions as the efficacy of the Covishield vaccine is above 60% while the same for Covaxin is about 80%. “No vaccine is 100% effective as of now. The target and effort is to achieve 50-60% immunity through vaccination while 30-35% through natural immunity via development of antibodies, eventually leading to herd immunity. It takes 45 to 60 days for antibodies to develop after both the doses of vaccine and once this is achieved, people will be immune for next 2-3 years and thus breaking the infection chain,” said Kumar.Expert opinionState IDSP nodal officer and eminent epidemiologist Dr Praveen Kumar Karn said there would be cases of coincidence as Covishield is 66.6% effective and efficacy of Covaxin is 81% as per trial run on 25, 000 volunteers. “Herd immunity is, however, a far away situation because that happens only after over 70-80% population is infected and has naturally developed antibodies. Covid-19 had reached peak in India in September 2020 bringing herd immunity. But cases dropped and so did the herd immunity phenomenon,” said Dr Karn.He said the findings of sero survey by ICMR last year in three districts of the state were not adequate to reach a conclusion. “We are still awaiting the report of sero survey in 10 districts by the state government with the help of ICMR. On the other hand, only 6.50 lakh or about 20% people in the state have been vaccinated so far. We may reach a conclusive result only after more intensive vaccination and sero survey covering all age groups, comorbid, general and migrating population across cities and villages across the state,” said Dr Karn. Vaccination figuresOn Tuesday, a total of 2,108 people took first dose of the Covid vaccine and 1,144 took second dose in Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum) district. Altogether 18, 726 persons have taken first dose while 9756 persons have taken second dose of the vaccine in the district till Tuesday night.Jamshedpur district has registered 375 Covid-19 deaths so far, highest in Jharkhand.The district has reported a total of 18, 379 Covid-19 positive cases, of which 17, 925 have been cured.
