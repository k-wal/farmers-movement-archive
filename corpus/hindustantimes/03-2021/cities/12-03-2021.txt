RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said the two killers were operating on the orders of two (alleged) gangsters, Amit Gulia and Ankush alias Bhalu, who are currently in jail. Both work for (alleged) gangster, Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, who is currently on the run. “During the murder, one of the two killers was on a video call with Ankush, who is lodged in Tihar Jail,” said Meena. Ankush allegedly made the WhatsApp call to Rana to gave him the go-ahead for the murder. “Ankush also used WhatsApp to send photos and vehicle details of the victim,” an officer associated with the investigation said, on condition of anonymity.The Dwarka-based property dealer, Sushil Singh, was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne men outside the Najafgarh police station on Sunday. Police had initially struggled to make headway in the case as the registration number plate of the motorcycle the assailants used had been removed. But as the police probed deeper, what emerged was the story of an extortion racket run by notorious gangsters in the western periphery of the city. On Thursday, a tip-off led to the arrest of one of the two suspected killers, 28-year-olf Manoj Rathi. The DCP said Rathi was caught with a pistol and three bullets. Rathi’s accomplice, Dharmender Rana, remains on the run, the police said. “Rathi, a resident of Bahadurgarh, revealed that he is friends with Sangwan, Gulia and Ankush, three (alleged) gangsters involved in a host of crimes ranging from extortion to murder,” said the DCP. About two months ago, Gulia and Ankush allegedly asked Rathi to extort money from shopkeepers at the weekly market (Shani Bazar) in Dwarka, the DCP said. “But Sushil Singh opposed that and the jailed gangsters decided to eliminate him,” said the DCP, adding that there would be more clarity on the circumstances of the murder once the police probe further and arrest the other suspect. The investigators have also learnt that Singh was killed for informing the police about the extortion racket, but the police are yet to confirm that independently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dwarka-property-dealer-shot-dead-for-trying-to-stop-extortion-of-shopkeepers-say-police-one-shooter-arrested-101615573720405.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Conclude investigations in Pansare, Dabholkar murders: Bombay HC asks CBI, cops||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday rapped the state government and the investigation agencies Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and crime investigation department (CID) for dragging their feet in the investigation of the murder of activists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare in 2013 and 2015 respectively. In light of the fact that the investigators in Karnataka had managed to complete the investigations in the murder of rationalist MM Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh and trial had even started in one of them, the court sought to know how much time the agencies needed to conclude investigations. The court has asked the agencies to file an investigation progress report in two weeks and posted the hearing on March 30. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petitions filed by Smita Pansare and Mukta Dabholkar, the kin of the slain activists on Friday was informed by advocate Abhay Nevagi that it had been eight and five years since the two activists had been murdered but the investigating agencies had not been able to catch the culprits nor conclude investigations. The two women had sought a court-monitored probe after the investigation agencies had been unsuccessful in nabbing the assailants. The bench was further informed that the investigators in Karnataka had not only managed to nab the culprits in the assassination of rationalist M M Kalburgi and journalist and activist Gauri Lankesh who were killed in 2015 and 2017 respectively but had also been able to file charge sheets and commence trial in the Kalburgi case, however, the investigations in Pansare and Dabholkar murders remained pending. The court was informed that while CBI had filed three charge sheets in the Dabholkar case the CID had made no progress in the Pansare case. On its part, additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the CBI submitted that the agency had done everything possible but was unable to retrieve the weapon used in the Dabholkar case which the accused allegedly had dumped in the Thane creek after committing the murder. He further submitted that of the five arrested accused in the Dabholkar case, one was out on bail and others including the two alleged shooters were in custody. Singh assured the court that the agency would file a fresh investigation progress report before the next hearing. Advocate Mankunwar Deshmukh also said that a progress report would be filed. After hearing the submissions, the bench said that it did not doubt the intentions of the investigating agencies, but the cases had to be taken to their logical conclusion. “The incidents happened in 2013 and 2015. We are now in 2021. How long will it go on like this? You take clear, concrete instructions and make a positive statement on the next date on how much time you will take,” observed the bench while adjourning the hearing to March 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conclude-investigations-in-pansare-dabholkar-murders-bombay-hc-asks-cbi-cops-101615573719999.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Medical admissions: Bombay HC upholds requirement of domicile||Bombay high court (HC) has upheld requirements for Maharashtra domicile and passing of Class 10 and Class 12 examinations from the state for admission to medical and dental courses from 85℅ state quota seats in private unaided medical and dental colleges.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni on March 9 dismissed a bunch of petitions, including one filed by the Association of Managements of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges.The petitioners had challenged the validity of two clauses of the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (regulation of admissions to the full-time professional undergraduate medical and dental courses) Rules, 2016, one of which mandated requirement of Maharashtra domicile and the other passing of Class 10 and Class 12 examinations from an institute in the state.The petitioners mainly contended that the two rules violated fundamental rights guaranteed to the private unaided institutes under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. Their counsel, advocate VM Thorat had submitted that the object of the state to provide appropriate and necessary medical and healthcare facilities should not be confined to narrow considerations of giving eminence to domicile.Private medical colleges which run without receiving a single penny from the State should not be made to suffer the rigours of State control. Requiring private medical colleges to adhere to domicile was per se bad in law.The state control should be limited to maintain educational standards by introducing qualification for teachers, curriculum and syllabi for the courses, etc. and to hold common entrance test for ensuring merit-based selection followed by a centralised admission process.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had responded to the petitions, on behalf of the state, that the statutory rules under challenge were neither manifestly arbitrary nor did they offend the parent law. He pointed out that the law on the topic was very well-settled that the reasonableness of a restriction on a fundamental right must be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint of the interests of the general public and not from the point of view of the persons upon whom the restrictions are imposed. Therefore, the private interests of the medical colleges have to yield to the larger public interest, which is the soul of Article 19(6).HC accepted Kumbhakoni’s submissions. The bench noted that Article 19(6) authorises restriction to be imposed on the right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g), inter alia, in the interests of the general public. The bench said the restriction - eligibility requirements for 85℅ state quota seats - imposed on such a right was in the interest of the general public and in tune with clause (6) of Article 19.“Such restriction was imposed keeping in mind the local and regional needs,” said the bench, adding that several states like Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have reserved 85% seats for being filled up by students having state domicile or permanent residence in the respective states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/medical-admissions-bombay-hc-upholds-requirement-of-domicile-101615573660058.html

The prosecution was scheduled to examine a punch witness, a witness to the seizure of Mukerjea’s mobile phone and other articles at the time of her arrest in August 2015.The defence lawyer for Mukerjea, Gunjan Mangla submitted before the court that it’s been years since the investigation is over and the trial has begun. The prosecution ought to have assured that evidence is brought before the court much before they were scheduled to examine the witness.The prosecution has assured the court that they would check as to where the articles were and produce the same, before the next date.Besides, Mangla also insisted the prosecution should examine a star witness of the case by the next hearing. “The prosecution had assured that they would soon examine the star witness because of which the bail plea of Mukerjea was rejected. However, it’s been nearly two months since the witness has expressed his inability to travel. In absence of this, the defence agreed for other witnesses only to make sure that the trial is not affected. However, the prosecution must now make efforts to examine the star witness next,” Mangla told the court.The court has asked the prosecution to the state before the court about when can they examine the star witness next in line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-indrani-s-mobile-other-articles-still-not-produced-before-court-101615573540989.html
12-03-2021||Lucknow||Chhatar Manzil gondola may be 200 years old: BSIP carbon dating test||: The mysterious gondola that was found buried on the premises of nawabi-era Chhatar Manzil here is approximately 200 years old. The fact came to light in a radiocarbon dating test that was carried out by Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) of Lucknow to assess the age of the 42 feet-long and 11 feet-wide gondola, which some historians say could also be a ‘royal gondola’. Dr Rajesh Agnihotri, senior scientists and in-charge of radiocarbon dating and isotope characterisation laboratory, BSIP who spearheaded the Carbon Dating or C-14 test said, “We tested two samples—both were of the wood from the boat. As per the findings, one sample was found to be 200-year-old whereas the date of another sample was not found desirable.” BSIP scientists, however, have also expressed their willingness to collect a few more samples from the site in order to make an accurate assessment. “Of the two samples which we initially collected, one failed to fetch desirable result. Hence, we want to collect more samples in order to make 100 percent accurate assessment,” Dr Agnihotri added. Besides, the institute had also approached Uttar Pradesh State Archaeological Department (UPSAD), the custodian of Chhatar Manzil, seeking permission to carry out sampling for the second time. The sampling was initially done in July 2019 after UPSAD had approached BSIP for the sampling of the gondola, which is also being said to be a ‘royal gondola’. AK Singh, director of state museum who has additional charge of director UPSAD, said as of now the project work was stalled for want of funds and the site was lying covered. “The fund is expected to be released this month. Once the project work resumes, we may further grant permission for the sampling as the findings would throw light on many hidden facts and mysteries. Besides, it will further throw light on the lavish lifestyle of the nawabs and also on the water transport system that was said to be a common feature during the era,” said Singh. The discovery of the gondola was made on May 8 when excavators and experts stumbled upon a wooden structure that was partially visible. It was later confirmed that the wooden structure was nothing but a huge gondola. In the ongoing Chhatar Manzil restoration and conservation project, Faculty of Architecture, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), is the consultancy. HISTORIAN’S TAKE: PC Sarkar, a historian, said the present finding indicated that the excavated gondola could be from the early 1800s, roughly corresponding to the rule of Sa’adat Ali Khan (1798-1814). Generally speaking, carbon dating a 200-year-old sample of wood can have an error of around 3 to 10 years. So it could be from the reign of Ghazi-ud-Din Haider also (1814 - 1827), who is credited for building Bada Chattar Manzil. However, travelling by gondolas was not confined to the nawabi rulers of Lucknow. There are several paintings which show gondolas with decorative mast heads of horses, peacocks etc. even in the times of Shuja-ud-Daula at Faizabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/chhatar-manzil-gondola-may-be-200-years-old-bsip-carbon-dating-test-101615573539379.html

12-03-2021||Mumbai||Activist moves HC supporting Mumbai Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg||Activist Zoru Bathena has filed an intervention application in the cases being heard by the Bombay high court (HC) in the Kanjurmarg Metro car shed matter.The activist, through title documents of the land at Kanjurmarg has claimed, that the plot of land earmarked for the depot, which both the Union of India through the salt commissioner and an independent person claim to have ownership, is not valid. The application states that the said land is apart from the land the title of which is with the Union of India and the individual, hence the state has a right to develop the said land as a depot. In light of these submissions, the activist who has been advocating the construction of the depot at the spot since the first proposal was mooted for Aarey, has prayed that the stay by the HC in December 2020 on the Metro car shed construction activity be vacated so that Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) may go ahead with the construction activity. According to the application, the information is based on a study of land records from 1906 onwards when the Union of India acquired over 1,400 acres of land for salt pan activity. In 1922, four plots had been made out of the said land out of which three plots were surveyed and numbered while the fourth plot remained unsurveyed. This unsurveyed plot later came in the possession of Arthur Salt Works and thereafter Garodia possessed it. The application states that the depot is proposed to come up on the three numbered plots and hence Garodia’s claim is unsubstantiated. The application further states that even though the UoI had acquired the land in 1906 the plot where the depot is proposed was never utilised for salt pan activity as it was away from the creek, hence the UoI could not claim it to be part of the land under the Salt Commissioner. The application also states that the proposed plot for the depot is not within CRZ limits. In light of these submissions, the application states that even if the claims of both the UoI and Garodia was assumed to be correct they would be compensated for parting with the land in the interest of Mumbai’s public transport system and Mumbai’s fragile ecology. The application thus seeks a vacation of the December 16, 2020 stay on construction activity at Kanjur. The court while stating that it would not be hearing any applications individually, said it would take up the application during the final hearing to be held on March 19. While speaking to HT, Bathena said that the plot in question where the government proposes to build the integrated Metro car shed was already earmarked for the Metro-6 line depot in 2016 and the UoI had agreed to transfer the land to MMRDA hence its objection to transferring the land now that the Aarey car shed is also going to be shifted to Kanjurmarg is surprising. Meanwhile, public interest litigation (PIL) has been moved in the HC seeking continuation of the previously planned car shed at Aarey. The PIL filed by three city residents has pointed to the fact that the decision to construct the Metro car shed was taken after due deliberations by all authorities and only after it was concluded that the Aarey Milk colony land was the most suitable for the depot had work commenced on it. The PIL states that the decision of the current government to shift the same to Kanjurmarg by modifying the reservation of the land from public purposes to car metro depot is illegal and undoubtedly a ploy to subserve the political ego, hence the decision should be set aside and the car shed be ordered to be constructed at Aarey itself. The court said it would hear the PIL after the issues arising out of the other petitions were resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/activist-moves-hc-supporting-mumbai-metro-car-shed-at-kanjurmarg-101615573420671.html
12-03-2021||Lucknow||Follow strategy for India to be superpower by 2047: CM Yogi||: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said there was a need to follow a strategy for India to establish itself as a superpower by the time the country celebrates 100 years of independence in 2047.“2022 will be the year of Amrit Mahotsav (75 years) of India’s independence. We will have to move ahead with a work plan for the next 25 years when India completes 100 years of its independence in 2047,” he said. The chief minister was speaking at the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programme organised at Kakori Shaheed Smarak in Kakori, about 26 kilometres north-west of here. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav programmes in Gujarat on Friday, chief minister, along with some of his cabinet colleagues and others, watched the event live at the Kakori Shaheed Smarak here to mark the beginning of the celebrations. He said the state government had organised Amrit Mahotsav programmes at four places in different parts of the state on the occasion.“We have organised programmes at four places. I have got the opportunity to be present at this programme in Kakori where the Kakori incident took place in 1925,” he said.Programmes were also organised at the martyrs’ memorial and freedom struggle museum in Meerut, martyrs’ memorial in Ballia, the Jhansi fort and the Pt Deen Dayal auditorium in Jhansi.“When India celebrates 100 years of its independence, we will have to evaluate what we have found and what we lost in 100 years. We will have to remember this, cherish our freedom and realise the dream of Ek Bharat, Sheshtha Bharat and make the world realise about India becoming a superpower in accordance with the wishes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/follow-strategy-for-india-to-be-superpower-by-2047-cm-yogi-101615573419421.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: No ST candidate hired as asst professor since 2009 at IIT-B, states RTI||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has not recruited a single associate professor from the scheduled tribe (ST) and other backward castes (OBC) categories since 2006, according to responses received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Several RTI applications were filed by Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC), an informal student organisation at IIT-B, about the institute’s recruitment process. The responses included counts of recruited candidates for each category, but did not reveal the number of shortlisted candidates. The data supplied is in line with figures shared by minister of education Ramesh Pokhriyal in Lok Sabha in July 2019, when he said of the 6,043 faculty in 23 IITs, 2.5% were from scheduled castes (SC) and 0.34% were ST. In the last 14 years, IIT-B has hired only one SC candidate as associate professor. Between 2009 and 2020, no ST candidate was hired as assistant professor, which is the entry-level position for faculty. Three SC and six OBC candidates were hired as assistant professors in this period. Data for recruitment of assistant professor positions between 2006 and 2008 was unavailable. Of 317 candidates hired as assistant professors at IIT-B in the 12 years, 97% were from the general category; 1.9% were OBC; 0.9% were SC and 0% were ST. Between 2006 and 2020, 42 general category candidates were hired as associate professors and 97.7% of all associate professors were from the general category, while 2% were SC, ST and OBC were 0%. According to government of India (GoI) norms, 10% of all faculty positions in IITs are reserved for candidates belonging to economically weaker sections; 27% for the OBC category; 15% for SC; 7.5% for ST; and 5% for candidates with physical disabilities. Until 2019, these reservations were applicable only for the recruitment of assistant professors. The meagre representation of reserved category faculty members in IIT-B bears significance since last July, an expert committee submitted a proposal to the ministry of education, recommending IITs be included among Institutes of Excellence. Institutes of Excellence are exempted from caste-based reservations according to the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act of 2019. IITB has maintained that it follows the reservations policy in letter and spirit. “Earlier, prior to the reservations, departments had the liberty to forward shortlisted candidates to the selection committee. However, a few years ago, after the reservation policy came in, the policy was changed. Now, departments have to forward all applications from SC and ST categories to the selection committee as long as they meet the basic eligibility criteria,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, academic and infrastructure affairs. Data shows that in 2020, 26 SC candidates two ST candidates and 20 OBC candidates applied for assistant professorships. Only one SC candidate was hired. All ST and OBC candidates were rejected. Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson, Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies at Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Social Sciences, who has served on various selection committees at universities across the country, said the discrimination was systemic. “If a reserved category candidate has applied, the law mandates that the selection committee should have a member from the category. Most times, it is this member that bats on behalf of the reserved category candidate alone. There is resistance from all quarters because the department members have a set idea of who they want,” said Ramaiah. However, Sudarshan said, “Candidates who have achieved professional success despite socio-economic and gender barriers deserve a preference. They are also likely to continue to do better. While we don’t want to compromise on the quality of research, we also believe that there are brilliant people in every category.” Faculty recruitment process IIT-B posts a rolling advertisement on its website and accepts applications from interested candidates throughout the year. Each department forms a Faculty Search Committee with one faculty member as the convenor. The committee processes the applications received, and also scouts out for potential faculty from other universities and through the alumni network. Candidates are shortlisted based on their contributions to research, teaching and professional services. Shortlisted candidates have to deliver a seminar and interact with other faculty members in addition to providing references. Based on the candidates’ performance in the seminar, interactions and references, the department submits its recommendation to the dean of faculty affairs. The dean of faculty affairs facilitates the formation of a selection committee, which interview the candidates and evaluates their performances. The selection committee’s recommendations are placed before the chairperson and board of governors, who take the final decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-no-st-candidate-hired-as-asst-professor-since-2009-at-iit-b-states-rti-101615573300158.html
12-03-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh kicks of 2022 election campaign with cycle rally from Azam’s bastion||: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav kicked off his party’s campaign for 2022 assembly elections with a cycle rally from Rampur on Friday.Rampur was chosen to show party’s solidarity with local MP Azam Khan, who is currently in jail in different cases.“The days of our struggle are over and from today onwards only good things will happen as we work towards winning the election in the state,” Akhilesh said addressing his supporters at the inaugural event of the cycle rally in Rampur.The event was attended by senior party leaders, including Naresh Uttam, Ram Govind Chaudhary, Tazeen Fatima and close to 5,000 supporters from Rampur and nearby districts.“Today is a very historic day. I am saying this because people know that whenever cycle has moved, it has brought change in the state. I remember in 2012 when we rode the cycle it led to the defeat of then government. I am confident that the cycle will bring about a change,” he said. Akhilesh took out several cycle rallies in the run up to elections in 2012 in which his party emerged with single largest majority and won 224 seats defeating Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP).The tables turned in 2017 when SP was defeated by the BJP which won 312 seats. The change in government brought troubles for Azam who was slapped with over 70 cases raging from extortion, encroachment to theft and was sent to jail along with his wife Tazeen Fatima and son Abdullah Azam. While Fatima was released on bail a few months back, Azam and his son continue to remain in Sitapur jail.Akhilesh lashed out on the state government for cases against Azam in his address. “I would not have talked about the cases against Azam had they been a few. Never in the history of this country, a leader like Azam, has been named by the administration in so many cases. Azam had to suffer all this because he wanted to change the future of the coming generations. He opened a state-of-the-art university for youngsters so that they get a better education and make a future for themselves. But people who only know the language of ‘Thok do’ and ‘Patak ke marenge’ will never understand this,” Akhilesh said.The inaugural event was held at a short distance from Mohammed Ali Jauhar University, a brainchild of Azam which has become a hotspot of controversies. The local administration has accused the trust that runs the university and in which Azam is a member, of encroaching over the land of people and government for the construction of the university. The district administration has also made proposal to take the university under the control of the state government.Akhilesh, in his seven-minute-long address, express confidence in the judiciary and said, “We have full faith in the judiciary. I am confident that judiciary will do justice to the people of Rampur who have been wrongly accused in so many false cases.”He went on to caution that the BJP will target other leaders for its political gains. “Please remember that no one will be spared. Bharatiya Janata Party will attack everyone,” he said. Without taking name of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who injured her left leg in an alleged attack, Akhilesh said, “Everyone knows that if a person injures his legs that person will not be able to campaign in the election. We have also suffered all this, but it is time we begin preparations for upcoming election.”Akhilesh also took a jibe on the government for hike in prices of petrol and diesel. “Even the government wants people to use cycle that is why they have hiked the prices of petrol and diesel,” he said.Before attending the rally, Akhilesh met the family members of Azam and assured them of the party’s support.The event concluded with a cycle rally from the spot to Ambedkar sthal, some 10 kilometres away. According to Samajawadi Party officials, the cycle rally will continue from the same spot on Saturday and reach Lucknow via Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Lakhimpur, Sitapur and Hardoi. Over 2,000 workers are expected to join the rally according to party officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-kicks-of-2022-election-campaign-with-cycle-rally-from-azam-s-bastion-101615573239404.html
12-03-2021||Lucknow||PANCHAYAT POLLS HC stays release of final list of reserved seats till March 15||: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Friday stayed the publication of the final list of seats reserved for the panchayat polls till March 15. The stay comes even as the district magistrates were scheduled to release the final list of reserved seats in their respective districts on Saturday and Sunday. A division bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Manish Mathur passed the order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Ajay Kumar, challenging the state government’s decision to take 1995 as the base year, instead of 2015, for reserving the seats. “Considering the aforesaid submission, it is provided that till the next date of listing, the opposite parties (state government) shall not finalise the reservations to be provided in terms on Rule 4 of Rules of 1994 (for panchayat polls),” the court said. The petitioner pointed out that ignoring the government order (GO) dated September 16, 2015, the opposite parties (state government through additional chief secretary panchayat raj) were proceeding to reserve the seats in terms of Rule 4 of the Rules of 1994 by taking 1995 as the base year, instead of 2015. It was further submitted that GO dated September 16, 2015 is still in existence and the previous elections held in the year 2015 were also in accordance with the aforesaid government order, the petitioner’s counsel said. They further stated that even otherwise, in view of the changed demographic situation as noticed by the state government itself in the GO issued on September 16, 2015, it did not stand to reason that the base year for the purposes of reserving seats in terms of Rule 4 of Rules of 1994 should be taken as 1995. The court listed the case for the next hearing on March 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/panchayat-polls-hc-stays-release-of-final-list-of-reserved-seats-till-march-15-101615573119381.html

12-03-2021||Mumbai||Streamline online working system, members tell Mumbai university on Day 1 of senate||The annual senate meet of the University of Mumbai was conducted online on Friday and most members had grievances to share as well as demanded answers for all the irregularities that had taken place in the last year. For starters, most members demanded that the university streamline the online system, especially since the last one year all major activities have been conducted virtually.“Something as simple as the pre-admissions registration process was stuck because the university website was facing technical glitches. For a year when colleges and universities around the world are making students’ lives easier, MU students are struggling,” said a senate member. The members have also sought a separate question hour with the varsity officials on Saturday to discuss Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL).Last year, days after the Reserve Bank of India kept YES Bank under a moratorium, it was revealed that the University of Mumbai had fixed deposits (FDs) worth ₹142 crore stuck in the same bank. While the amount has now been recovered by the varsity, members questioned why the officials have not yet revealed the official report by the MU set up an inquiry committee.“We are not even aware of the members part of the inquiry committee, neither has the final report been shared,” said a senate member. The University pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni and board of examination director Vinod Patil assured members that the final report will be shared soon.Once again, questions were also raised on the status of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grade that the university is yet to get. “It is unfathomable that in the last four years, one of the oldest universities in the state has not managed to secure NAAC grading. Several students have faced trouble due to lack of funds or affiliation concern in the last four years and to date, we run the University with a NAAC grade,” said another senate member.The annual budget of the university will now be tabled on Saturday, said MU officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/streamline-online-working-system-members-tell-mumbai-university-on-day-1-of-senate-101615572942361.html
12-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad factory fire: Deceased owner booked, unit had no fire NOC||Ghaziabad: The 40-year-old owner of the factory, gutted in Ghaziabad’s Sahibabad area late Thursday, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Delhi on Friday. The Ghaziabad police, meanwhile, said they have booked the owner based on a complaint by the family members of two of the 14 injured in the fire. The 14 injured persons, which included a 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, had sustained severe burn injuries and were rushed to private hospitals in Ghaziabad, from where they were referred to hospitals in Delhi, the police said.“The owner was identified as Kunal Behl, a resident of Indirapuram. He had sustained severe burn injuries. He succumbed at a hospital in Delhi Friday morning. Family members of two injured persons have submitted a police complaint, on the basis of which we registered an FIR naming Behl. It is alleged that Behl deliberately added extra chemicals in the machine which led to an explosion and caused a blaze,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), Ghaziabad.The incident took place in the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area. “Of the remaining 13, 11 are under observation and the condition of four of them is critical. We will investigate the reasons behind the incident and statements of workers will be recorded. The two minors probably came along with their parents to the factory. We will also inquire if they too were engaged in any labour process or not,” the SP added. The factory allegedly did not have any no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department, fire officials said Friday. “No fire NOC had been taken for the factory and only primary fire-fighting equipment, such as fire extinguishers, were available at the site. The cause of the fire was some explosion in the chemical storage at the ground floor,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer.The FIR, filed at Link Road police station, was lodged under IPC section 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide). A copy of the FIR was made available to the media by the Ghaziabad police. The complainant in the case is Rohit Kumar, 20, who is from Sitapur and works at another factory in the industrial area. As per the copy of the FIR, the complaint was drafted by one Mohammad Saleem.When contacted, Rohit said that two of his brothers, Mohit Kumar, 18, and Vishwa Nath, 22, suffered severe burn injuries during the incident.“They both worked at the factory. I had come to my rented accommodation at Maharajpur when I got a call on my mobile. My brother Mohit was on the phone and he asked me to come fast for help and also told me about the fire. I rushed to the spot with two of my neighbours. There, without waiting for ambulances, I sat both of my brothers in the police van and rushed them to hospital,” Rohit said. He added that his brothers had been working with the factory for the past two-three years and received a monthly salary of about ₹10,000 each. “Since I was not at the factory, I cannot say what actually caused the fire. It is likely that it resulted due to some chemical used in the factory. I am yet to get a copy of the FIR,” he said Friday evening, when asked about the allegations levelled in the FIR.When asked about the allegations in the FIR, the SP said: “All allegations levelled in the FIR will be inquired during the course of investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-factory-fire-deceased-owner-booked-unit-had-no-fire-noc-101615572939342.html
12-03-2021||Other||Kanpur gang rape: Police orders probe into allegation against its officials||: The police on Friday ordered an inquiry into allegations that the father of a 13-year-old gang-rape victim committed suicide after he felt humiliated by the policemen associated with investigation and other police processes.The 40-year-old man was knocked down by a truck outside the community health centre (CHC), Ghatampur in Kanpur rural, where his daughter was admitted for medical examination, hours after he lodged the case of gang-rape.The family members leveled serious allegations against the police officers, including the circle officer Girish Chandra.His family further alleged the humiliation handed out to him in those 19 hours drove him to commit suicide.DIG/SSP Kanpur Dr Preetinder Singh said the SP Kanpur Rural Brijesh Srivastava had been asked to thoroughly probe the charges of humiliation.The SP had also been instructed to probe the allegations that the girl was repeatedly asked objectionable questions at the health centre where she was taken for medical examination and that questions were raised about her character, the officer said.The SP had been asked to probe all charges and submit the fact-finding report within the stipulated time, he added.SP Kanpur rural Brijesh Srivastava said he would submit his report in one week.Singh, however, also stood in defence of his men and said women police personnel spoke to the girl. He said every victim has to be asked certain questions to know what exactly happened with them and ascertain charges against the accused.“No evidence has so far been found which indicates that the rape survivor’s father was so frustrated with the police that he might have committed suicide,” he said. He added that any police personnel found guilty of insensitivity or negligence during the probe would not be spared.According to the police, the 13-year-old girl was allegedly abducted and raped by three men, identified as Deepak Yadav, Saurabh Yadav and Golu Yadav late Monday evening in a village of Sajeti police area.All the three accused have been arrested.In addition, two sub inspectors and constables were also suspended on the charges of negligence.But the action is under question as the three were not involved with the investigation or the processes of the case.Devendra Yadav, father of accused Deepak and Saurabh, and a sub inspector with UP police was not arrested yet. Yadav is accused of orchestrating the death of girl’s father according to an FIR lodged by his brother.SP Kannauj Prashant Varma on Thursday had suspended Yadav after he did not report back on duty. Yadav was sent to Jalaun on VIP duty as chief minister Yogi Adityanath was scheduled to visit the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-gang-rape-police-orders-probe-into-allegation-against-its-officials-101615572879352.html
12-03-2021||Noida||Saplings planted during green drive dry up due to negligence: Residents||Noida: The residents of Noida have claimed that hundreds of trees planted in the city in February have already started to dry up.Residents claim that freshly planted patches were neglected and not adequately watered even as the temperature was higher during the days this month.The roadside plantation drive of around 500 saplings of amaltash and neem was held by the Noida authority in sector 77, while the authority planted about 100 plants in November 2020 with the collaboration of the residents.“The contractor often waters the central patch of the road, but not the fresh saplings. We had asked the contractor to water the fresh saplings as a lot of them started to dry up due to negligence. Some have dried completely,” said city-based social activist and resident of sector 77, Amit Gupta.“We held the plantation drive last year on the road adjacent to Prateek Wisteria and a few other high-rises, which are being taken care of. But the maximum saplings planted recently on the main road are in bad shape,” said Deepak Mittal, a resident sector 77.According to the officials, however, the saplings are shedding leaves and dried up due to the warm weather.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has recorded the maximum temperature ranging between 28.8 degree Celsius and 34.2 degree Celsius at Safdarjung observatory — which is considered an average for the region — for March 2021 so far. Only two days witnessed a maximum temperature below 30 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, the average maximum temperature for March 2020 (first two weeks) ranged between 21.3 degree Celsius and 29 degree Celsius. Officials of the Noida authority’s horticulture department said the private contractor, responsible for the plantation and its maintenance, will ensure that the saplings are taken care of for two years. “The plantation will be maintained and even if any dries the contractors will ensure that they are replaced for the next two years. Apart from that, most of the saplings are fine, and it’s just the weather due to which they are shedding. We will ensure that the saplings survive,” said Anand Mohan, deputy director (Horticulture).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/saplings-planted-during-green-drive-dry-up-due-to-negligenceresidents-101615572820356.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cuffe Parade fishermen protest over 300-acre reclamation park||Revisiting their four-year-old tussle with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the fishermen of Cuffe Parade in south Mumbai staged a protest at the fishermen colony over the construction of the 300-acre Backbay Reclamation park, planned by the civic body, off the coast in the Arabian Sea.Revisiting the project, that has been stalled for the past two years after the fisherman did not allow the civic body-appointed third-party consultants to conduct surveys for feasibility report and oceanographic survey, to understand the impact of the park on marine life, BMC will present the development plan of the 300-acre ‘Green Park’ as it is being termed by BMC, on Saturday morning at Radio Club in Mumbai. BMC on March 8 sent a letter to the Machhimar Sarvoday Sahkari Samiti inviting them to the presentation.Local leaders, member of Parliament Arvind Sawant, Mumbai Congress president Ashok Jagtap, member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Rahul Narwekar and local corporator Harshita Narwekar, leader of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in BMC Rakhi Jadhav have been invited for the presentation.Following this, fishermen from the area on Thursday evening staged a protest. Bhuvaneshwar Dhanu, member of Macchimar Sarvoday Co-operative Society, Cuffe Parade, said, “We had earlier decided to boycott the presentation. But now we have decided to attend it, and then express our opposition to the project at the meeting.”In 2018, BMC had appointed Tata Consulting Engineers as a consultant to prepare a feasibility report of the project, and the Goa-based National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) to conduct an oceanographic survey to understand the impact of the park on the marine ecosystem, and climate along city’s coastline. After a few sessions, the fishermen did not allow the consultants to collect samples for the survey.According to Dhanu, presently BMC has accommodated parking of 200 boats for fishermen in the harbour. He said, “We saw the plans, and realised there is inadequate parking space. We should be allowed to park 350 boats. There is also construction planned in the pathway we use to access the sea during low tide. This will make it impossible for us to access the sea unless there is high tide.” The community also wants to be declared as project affected persons.They believe the project will affect their livelihood and kill the catch. Parshuram Meher, Mumbai president of the Maharashtra Machhimar Kruti Samiti said, “In 2017 we learned of the project and have opposed it since the beginning. This will destroy our business. Apart from this park, the Shiv Smarak is also being constructed on this site in the sea. The fishermen of Cuffe Parade will have no income left.”Two years ago, the community submitted 16-point demands to then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis of which eight were accepted by the government at the time. They included more space to park boats, jobs for the local fishermen of Cuff Parade in any leisure and entertainment developments that would be operated at the park, among others.A senior civic official said, “BMC is reopening dialogue with the community, and addressing their concerns. We had appointed consultants to study how their livelihood will be affected. The fishermen community did not allow that studies to happen. Then in 2020 coronavirus lockdown happened. On Saturday, we are only making a presentation. Dialogue with the fishermen will continue, so we can find a middle ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaicuffe-parade-fishermen-protest-over-300-acre-reclamation-park-101615572819969.html

12-03-2021||Lucknow||LU alumna wins Sahitya Akademi Award||Noted poet, social worker and novelist Anamilka (she goes by one name) on Friday won the Sahitya Akademi Award 2020 for her collection of poems ‘Tokri Mein Digant--Theri Gatha: 2014’.It was just a coincidence that she visited University of Lucknow (LU), her alma mater, on Friday and the award was announced within a few hours. An autonomous body under the union ministry of culture announced the Sahitya Akademi Award 2020 in New Delhi. After attending an event at LU, the poet was having lunch somewhere when she got a call from an unknown number. “It was from an unknown number so I did not feel like taking the call. I was in right kind of company at that time. Then I picked up the phone and the caller from other side broke the news that my name had figured in the Sahitya Akademi Award 2020 list,” said Anamika who did her PG in English Literature from LU in 1985.“I couldn’t believe it. Then I wondered for which book this award was being given as I had never applied for the award. It did not take much time to figure it out that the award was for my book ‘Tokri Meim Digant--Theri Gatha: 2014’. It was a pleasant surprise that I was on a visit to my alma mater and the award came my way the same day,” she added.Talking about the award-winning book, Anamika said, “I wrote the book good five years ago. The book is an imaginary conversion between Gautam Buddha with women on streets. It is like a time travel. As I had never applied for the Sahitya Akademi Award, I was not expecting anything like this to come my way.”“I was later told by a few people that the jury got feedback from university professors and experts. Self-recommendation doesn’t carry much weight,” she said.Her father’s Shyam Nandan Kishore, a prominent Hindi poet, was her first teacher. Talking about Lucknow, she said the state capital had people of all cultures and its inclusiveness made the city more liveable place.Her husband Dr Bindu Amitabh is a nephrologist. She has two sons Utkarsh and Unnayan. Ranu Uniyal, professor and head of department of English and Modern European Languages at LU, said it was a proud moment for the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lu-alumna-wins-sahitya-akademi-award-101615572399354.html
12-03-2021||City||Stalin’s son makes electoral debut, DMK to face AIADMK in 122 seats||DMK president MK Stalin will seek a third term from his Kolathur constituency for the April 6 Assembly elections while son Udhayanidhi will make his electoral debut from Chepauk-Tiruvallikeni. The opposition party is pitted in a direct fight with its arch-rival and ruling AIADMK in 122 seats.On Friday, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) announced candidates for 173 seats, three days after the party in power for a decade, the AIADMK, announced a list of 177 candidates. Both major Dravidian parties have avoided any surprises in their candidate lists and have opted for tested and senior party leaders.Since many of the parties, including Vaiko-led MDMK, will be contesting on DMK's 'Rising Sun' symbol, the lead partner will be in the fray in 187 seats, Stalin said while releasing the candidate list. DMK has allotted 61 seats to its allies, with the Congress taking the lion's share of 25.Nearly half of the 173 nominees were sitting MLAs including seniors Durai Murugan, KN Nehru, K Ponmudi, MRK Panneerselvam, P Geetha Jeevan and Poongothai Aladi Aruna - all former ministers, besides legislators such as TRB Raja, Anitha Radhakrishnan, SR Raja, M Subramanian and R Sakkarapani.Also read: Tamil Nadu assembly elections - AMMK releases third list of candidates for pollsUdhayanidhi will fight from the Chepauk-Triplicane constituency, represented by the late J Anbazhagan who succumbed to Covid-19 last year. Udhayanidhi, an actor-producer, is a third-generation politician from the DMK's first family, following in the footsteps of his late grandfather and former DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi and father Stalin.The big fights will be between DMK’s Senthil Balaji and transport minister MR Vijayabaskar in Karur. Former AIADMK strongman, Thanga Tamilselvan, who quit and joined TTV Dhinakaran's Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) and later the DMK, has been given the ticket from Bodinayakanur to face-off with deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam.Paneerselveam, who has won this seat from 2011, filed his nominations which opened for Tamil Nadu on Friday and will go on till March 19. Relatively lesser known T Sampathkumar will take on chief minister Edapaddi K Palanaswami on his home turf, Edappadi. “He may be an ordinary man but he has the potential to win,” Stalin said.Former mayors of Chennai, AIADMK’s Saidai Duraisamy and DMK’s Ma Subramanian will clash in Saidapet - the latter is the incumbent. Environment activist and pro-Jallikattu crusader Karthikeya Senapathy, who joined the DMK in 2020, will go head-on with AIADMK heavyweight and minister for municipal administration SP Velumani in his stronghold of Thondamuthur constituency in Coimbatore.The DMK has retained its party veterans, sitting MLAs and prominent faces across the assembly seats such as party general secretary S Durai Murugan, Thangam Thennarsu, Palanivel Thiagaran, PK Sekhar Babu, former state IT minister Poongothai Aladi Aruna.In Trichy, from where Stalin launched his ten-year vision for Tamil Nadu last week, party principal secretary and Trichy West MLA KN Nehru is fielded from the same seat while another third-generation party leader and Udhaynidhi’s close aide Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi will seek re-election from Thiruverumbur constituency.The party has fielded only 13 women. Stalin will file his nomination on March 15 and continue his campaign, he said.The DMK-led coalition will seek to oust the BJP-AIADMK alliance and return to power after a gap of a decade. BJP state vice-president and former minister in the AIADMK government Nainar Nagendran filed his nomination in the Tirunelveli assembly segment even before the BJP announced its candidates. Nagendran told reporters that he did so because it was an auspicious day. The BJP has so far identified only 20 assembly constituencies and is likely to announce candidates on Saturday.This is the first assembly election after the demise of towering leaders J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stalins-son-makes-electoral-debut-dmk-to-face-aiadmk-in-122-seats-101615570201517.html
12-03-2021||Pune||Milind Ekbote granted bail||A city court on Friday granted interim anticipatory bail to president of the Samsta Hindu Aghadi, Milind Ekbote, who was booked by the Kondhwa Police for his alleged objectionable comments, while opposing the construction of “Haj House” in Kondhwa, by the Pune Municipal Corporation. Ekbote, who is accused in a case registered by Pune rural police during the Bhima Koregaon violence in 2018, also claimed in the video that Kondhwa area is home to “sleeper cells” and is a “mini Pakistan”.’ “The high court has said that no religious place can be built without prior permission from the government, but the PMC has found a way out of this by terming the “Haj House” as a cultural centre. The Samsta Hindu Aghadi will not let it happen,” Ekbote said in a video shot in front of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). A complaint in the matter was lodged by Satish Bhaskar Kale (47), a resident of the NIBM road, who is a member of the Sambhaji Brigade and part of the Maratha Seva Sangh. “The aim of that video was to destroy peace in the Kondhwa area and cause communal violence; if anything of that sort happens, Milind Ekbote will be solely responsible for it,” read a part of the complaint lodged by Kale. A case under Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot); 153(a) (hurting religious sentiments); 153(b), 295(a), 298 (uttering words etc., with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person); 500 (defamation); 501, 502, 505(1)(c), 505(2), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy); and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(a) and 66(b) of Information Technology Act was registered at Kondhwa police station against Ekbote Additional sessions judge GP Agarwal granted bail on a personal bond of ₹15,000 and surety of like amount on the condition that Ekbote will not tamper with evidence and cooperate with the investigating agency as and when required. Ekbote had filed the anticipatory bail application through advocate SK Jain and Amol Dange.While granting the bail, the judge stated, “Upon perusal of the FIR, it transpires that, there is delay in lodging the FIR. The applicant has only brought to the notice of the fact about the construction of Haj House under the name of Civil and Cultural Centre upon the land which is in the possession of Pune Municipal Corporation and which cannot be carried out as per the verdict of Hon’ble High Court, Bombay and the Hon’ble Apex Court as per GR dated 5th November, 2016. All the alleged offences are triable by court of magistrate. The applicant is ready to co-operate the investigation machinery. In the alleged set of facts narrated in the complaint, the custodial interrogation of the applicant is not necessary at this stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/milind-ekbote-granted-bail-101615569459278.html

12-03-2021||City||After 25 years, Muslim League fields woman candidate in Kerala||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), an ally of the Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala, has fielded a woman candidate after 25 years. The party on Friday named Noorbina Rasheed, a lawyer, from Kozhikode South constituency.The last time the party fielded a woman candidate was in 1996. Kamarunias Anwar lost to the CPIM’s Elamaram Kareem. Though the IUML is a 72-year-old party with a strong presence in north Kerala’s Malabar and other areas, women always took a backseat in the party.There were some shrill voices against the woman candidate this time also but the party ignored the elements. At least three women leaders have approached the party for tickets but luck fell on Rasheed who is also the national general secretary of the Women League. The party is contesting 27 seats this time, a hike of three seats from the last elections.Also read: Former Kerala Congress leader Vijayan Thomas joins BJPThough all parties talk big about women and youth representation, when candidates list finally surface they are overlooked citing “winnability criteria”. Women leaders, however, swear that they are better placed in poll battles than their male counterparts.In a state where woman outnumber men (1,091 female for 1,000 men), electoral history shows women representation never crossed 10 per cent in the House. In the 14th assembly (2016-2021), there were nine female legislators in the 140-member House. This time, of the 85 seats the CPI(M) is contesting, 12 are women while junior partner CPI has four women among 25 of its candidates. The lists of Congress and BJP are yet to be announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-25-years-muslim-league-fields-woman-candidate-in-kerala-101615565987866.html

Since it was a long weekend, the Khed Shivapur toll plaza saw a heavy rush on Thursday as it was a holiday due to Mahashivratri. Most of the people have made a four-day holiday plan and even on Friday, there were long queues of vehicles seen at the toll plaza. Unfortunately, the public had to suffer frustration on Thursday morning, as only half of the counters were open at the Toll Naka as there were no operators at half of the counters. Vivek Velankar, president of Sajag Nagarik Manch said, “As there was a heavy rush of vehicles to go towards Satara from Pune, there should have been better management at the toll plaza. However, the opposite was seen, and complete mismanagement of the toll booth administration. There were operators at only half of the counters and the remaining counter lanes were closed on Thursday morning, due to which long queues of vehicles were there. The Central government has made the Fastag system for speedy movement at toll nakas but due to this mismanagement public had to suffer,” On Friday, there were operators at all counters, but compared to Thursday there was a lesser rush. However, the rush and long queues return on weekends. Commuters have demanded better efficiency in service. Tushar Jawalkar a traveller said, “I have Fastag installed in my vehicle but if the toll booth management is not proper and we have to wait for 10 to 15 minutes in the queue then it needs to be changed. Today it took us 10 minutes to pass through the toll naka.” Suhas Chitnis, Pune project director of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) said, “We have received the complaint of having fewer operators on Thursday morning. Accordingly, a notice has been given to the toll administration and a clarification has been sought.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fastag-effectiveness-in-question-as-long-delays-reported-at-toll-plaza-101615566459088.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Man held for making another person take exam on his behalf||A 35-year-old man who obtained his MBBS degree from Tajikistan was arrested here for allegedly making another person sit for an examination that would have made him eligible to practise in India, police said on Monday.The accused has been identified as Manohar Singh, a resident of Rajasthan's Pali district, they said.Singh had registered himself for a Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE) conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE), an autonomous body under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the police said.This is a licentiate examination for Indians or overseas citizens of India who have completed primary medical qualification from other countries, they said.The last FMGE screening test was conducted on December 4, 2020 and Singh was allotted a test centre at Mathura Road, the police said.The result of the accused was frozen due to a mismatch between the photo on the application form and the one taken on the exam day. He was called for the verification of the face ID on February 3 but he did not turn up, they said."On Wednesday, Singh visited the NBE for the face ID verification. When the team verified the face ID with the photo taken on the exam day, it did not match," Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) R P Meena said.Later, he answered a question incorrectly, which aroused suspicion and he was taken to the police station, the officer said.Singh was arrested and his admit card, MBBS degree and application form were seized, Meena said.During interrogation, the accused told the police that he obtained his MBBS degree from Tajikistan and was trying to clear the FMGE for the last six years, the police said.He met a doctor who offered to take the exam in his place for ₹4 lakh and assured him that he would clear it. The doctor appeared for the exam in Singh's place on December 4, 2020, they said.Efforts are being made to trace the co-accused, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-man-held-for-making-another-person-take-exam-on-his-behalf-101615561292180.html
12-03-2021||Pune||AICTE’s PCM optional for tech education gets mixed reactions||In an important development made in the admission process of undergraduate engineering courses, the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the technical education regulator has made physics, chemistry, and mathematics, optional for Class 12 students to be eligible for the programme. Kuldeep Ambekar, president of Students Helping Hand organisation said, “The decision taken by AICTE seems right initially, but in order to move forward in the career, these subjects are very important for engineering students to sustain in the open race. Also, the new education policy talks about various new initiatives and comparisons with world-class education. Students need to get such education which can boost their future growth and job opportunities. From the last few years, engineering admissions and seat vacancy has been high, some of the colleges have even shut down. So, this decision might be taken due to it, but most students will now get a chance to go for engineering courses.” This new update was announced in the AICTE handbook 2021-22 released yesterday whereas now students willing to take admission for Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) or Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech) courses need to pass 10+2 with any of the three following subjects — physics /mathematics / chemistry / computer science / electronics / information technology / biology / informatics practices / biotechnology / technical vocational subject / agriculture / engineering graphics / business studies / entrepreneurship. In the handbook released by the AICTE, it is stated that, “The universities will offer suitable bridge courses such as mathematics, physics, engineering drawing for students coming from diverse backgrounds to achieve learning outcomes of the programme.” Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of AICTE said, “We have expanded the number of subjects and given choice to students who are willing to take admission for engineering courses. So, from the next academic year, students can choose three subjects from different disciplines. Though we have made changes in the criteria, an aspirant student of engineering will require maths and physics knowledge while pursuing the course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/aictes-pcm-optional-for-tech-education-gets-mixed-reactions-101615565739039.html
12-03-2021||Pune||26 illegal mobile network boosters seized||The Faraskhana police seized a total of 26 mobile network boosters and deactivated 27 by cutting feeder joints during a raid. A total of nine notices were served in the Faraskhana police jurisdiction recently. The action was taken following complaints by Wireless Monitoring Organization (WMO), Department of Telecom (DoT) along with a joint team from the local administration and mobile operators, which raided the peth areas of the city where the raiding team took down illegal mobile signal repeaters installed in homes, shops, and other commercial establishments. The Wireless Monitoring Organization (WMO), Department of Telecom (DoT) along with a joint team from the district administration and mobile operators raided the peth areas of Pune under the direction of IES (Indian Engineering Service) officer Amit Gautam, of DoT along with Gajendra Mewara, Rishabh Acharya, and RN Lahadke attached to WMO, DoT. According to the police, action was also taken against individuals who installed them. Amit Gautam, said, “We have maintained a sustained drive against illegal boosters and in 2020 removed approximately 500 of them. We have also conducted awareness campaigns against illegal boosters which lead to call drops and lowering of mobile network connectivity. We started 2021 on a strong note and have already acted against 580 such devices in the first quarter of the current year. We advise people not to use any illegal repeaters as they are not only legally correct, but morally I believe the prolonged influence of such radiation beyond permissible level might cause health issues, research is still going on regarding the effect of radiation on health and installing a mobile signal booster is like installing a mobile tower on the head that radiates multiple times higher than what BTS tower radiates. Further, these devices are disrupting mobile networks to a greater extent.” Illegal mobile signal repeaters have become a major nuisance and are one of the biggest reasons for customers facing network issues like call drops and low data speeds. These illegal repeaters are installed by individuals, establishments at homes, offices, PG guest houses to boost mobile signals. This illegal equipment interferes with all mobile networks, impact signal quality and degrades network experience in the entire area. Mobile operators invest heavily in the acquisition of spectrum and network rollout to enhance the customer experience; however, illegal boosters cause interference with the mobile network. Authorities were called to crack down on these installations and take strict action. Box According to the Wireless Monitoring Organisation (WMO) of DoT, installation, possession, or selling of illegal repeater is a punishable offence as per the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933 and Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. Heavy fines may be imposed on owners of several premises who have installed these illegal repeaters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/26-illegal-mobile-network-boosters-seized-101615565619057.html

In Bengali, slippers are called ‘choti.’“Although an ardent walker, Banerjee never wore any other footwear, even during her trips abroad. I wonder how long she will listen to the advice of the doctors. The blue and white rubber chappals are part of her identity,” the TMC leader said on condition of anonymity.Also read: BJP leaders meet EC, demand probe over 'attack on Mamata BanerjeePolitical songs and slogans have been written on her chappals. The most interesting line in these slogans and songs was “Delhi jabe Hawaii choti,” (the Hawaiian chappals will go to Delhi). It became extremely popular on the eve of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the Trinamool Congress (TMC) was hoping to emerge on the top of all national parties.TMC leaders used to say that Banerjee might become the prime minister. The polls results however upset their plans. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ended second in the race, winning 18 of the state 42 seats. The TMC’s tally came down from 34 to 22.Walking became Banerjee’s passion ever since her blood sugar level shot up a few years ago. She not only uses a treadmill at home every day but walks briskly during her visits to the districts. Since blue and white are her favourite colours, the chief minister does not wear slippers of any other shade. All government buildings in Bengal are painted blue and white. Common people are also offered a rebate on the tax on their properties if these are painted in these two shades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-s-iconic-blue-white-hawaiian-slippers-need-some-rest-too-101615561452957.html
12-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand cabinet expansion seeks regional balance between Kumaon and Garhwal||The cabinet expansion by the newly-appointed Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat is seen as an act of balancing the regional equation in state politics by inducting two legislators each from Garhwal and Kumaon regions and increasing the representations of the districts from five to eight.The new cabinet inductees include Swami Yateeswaranand from Haridwar and Ganesh Joshi from Mussoorie in Dehradun in Garhwal region.From Kumaon region, the new cabinet inductees include Vishan Singh Chuphal from Didihat in Pithoragarh and Bansidhar Bhagat from Kaladungi in Nainital.In the earlier eight-member cabinet, five MLAs were from Garhwal, while three hailed from Kumaon.There were eight ministers in the previous cabinet, of which one, Madan Kaushik, was appointed state BJP president on Friday. The other seven ministers of the previous government, who have been retained, include three from Pauri Garhwal, and two from US Nagar districts.Also read: Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat gets new cabinet with 4 new facesIn the new eleven-member cabinet, there is a difference of just one minister between Kumaon and Garhwal, while in the previous council there was a difference of two ministers between the two regions.In the previous cabinet, five ministers were from Garhwal and three from Kumaon. This time, six ministers are from Garhwal and five from Kumaon. When it comes to hilly and plain areas, six are from hill districts and five from plain districts.There were also expectations that the cabinet would have one more woman minister besides Rekha Arya. Sources said Ritu Khanduri from Yamkeshwar in Pauri Garhwal, whose name was making rounds for inclusion in the cabinet, could not find a place for herself as there were already three ministers from Pauri Garhwal and her inclusion would have offset the regional dynamics.The cabinet expansion has given more representation to districts this time. Trivendra Singh Rawat's government had only five districts that were represented in the cabinet including three from Pauri district. This time around, eight of the thirteen districts have found representation in the cabinet.Anoop Nautiyal, who analysed the two cabinets, said that he was hoping that women representation in the cabinet would increase to at least two. “But that has not happened. But I am happy that representations of the districts have increased from five to eight in the new cabinet,” he said.Historian and political analyst Shekhar Pathak said Uttarakhand politics is dominated by regional dynamics and whichever party comes to power, they have to strike a balance between the two regions. “As the state has thirteen districts, the balance can never be 100 per cent. But despite all challenges, whether it is rebellion or under-representation of one or more districts, at the regional level it is their political compulsion to strike a balance. Otherwise, it can have repercussions in the election results,” he said.The ministers who hail from Kumaon in the new cabinet include Bansidhar Bhagat from Kaladhungi in Nanital, Vishan Singh Chuphal from Didihat in Pithoragarh district,Rekha Arya from Someshwar in Almora, Yashpal Arya from Bajpur in US Nagar and Arvind Pandey from Gadarpur in US Nagar.Ministers who hail from Garhwal in the new cabinet include Satpal Maharaj from Chaubattakhal in Pauri Garhwal, Subodh Uniyal from Narendranagar in Tehri Garhwal district, Dhan Singh Rawat from Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal, Harak Singh Rawat from Kotdwar in Pauri Garhwal and Satpal Maharaj from Chaubattakhal in Pauri Garhwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cabinet-expansion-seeks-regional-balance-between-kumaon-and-garhwal-101615559130297.html

The count on Thursday was 409.Interacting with reporters outside the House of the Delhi Assembly, Jain said the figures of over 400 per day suddenly were "not alarming"."The positivity rate in Delhi in November was about 15 per cent. It came down to less than five per cent first and then to less that one per cent, and for the last two months, it is still below 1 per cent, which is much lower than what is being recorded in cities in Maharashtra and Kerala," he said.He said there is a "stark difference" in the number of cases reported in Delhi and states like Maharashtra and Kerala, adding that the positivity rate recorded in Maharashtra is "about 10 per cent", while in the national capital it is hovering around 0.5 per cent.Maharashtra has been recording a substantial rise in coronavirus cases of late, with authorities attributing it to crowding witnessed during the gram panchayat elections held in mid-January this year and a widespread disregard for the norms by common people as well as politicians.The state on Thursday recorded 14,317 fresh Covid-19 cases, which is not only the highest so far in 2021, but also since October 7 last year. The overall case count till Thursday night was 22,66,374.Jain said, "We are fully prepared and on full vigil", adding that over 70,000-80,000 tests are being conducted a day.With 431 new coronavirus cases, the infection tally in Delhi has risen to 6,42,870, according to the latest health bulletin.The number of active cases of the disease in Delhi increased to 2,093 on Friday from 2,020 on Thursday, while the positivity rate rose to 0.60 from 0.59 per cent the previous day.Health experts and doctors have attributed this "sudden rise" to people turning complacent, not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and "assuming all is well now".The total number of tests conducted on Thursday stood at 72,031, including 46,135 RT-PCR tests and 25,896 rapid antigen tests, the bulletin said."We are quite alert, tests are being being conducted on a large scale. We are well within the cut-off mark, and are on the safer side, concerning the positivity rate. Delhi alone is conducting Covid tests, five times that of what is being conducted in all of India," Jain was quoted as saying in a statement issued later by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-positivity-rate-far-lower-than-in-maharashtra-kerala-satyendar-jain-101615559108193.html

He also said that there should be no more politics on this issue and students should focus on the study as the new exam date has been declared. “In my opinion, the MPSC handled this issue poorly. The commission should have handled this situation more appropriately, however, the CM has clarified, and a new date of the prelim exam has been declared. Whatever happened was unfortunate, students should not have felt a need to come out on the roads. Yesterday’s decision caused students to suffer. As the deputy chief minister of the state, I regret the inconvenience caused to the students,” Ajit Pawar said while talking to the reporters at Council hall in Pune. Pawar also insisted on not fuelling this issue anymore as appropriate clarification has been given by the chief minister. “The chief minister took cognisance of this matter immediately and reassured the aspirants. This issue should not be politicised further,” Pawar said. The state civil service preliminary exam was scheduled for March 14th but on Thursday, the MPSC announced the postponement of the examination due to the spread of Covid infection throughout the state. This was the fifth time the examination was postponed. The announcement caused widespread outrage among state civil service aspirants throughout the state, and they staged protests in major cities such as Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Amravati.

12-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat gets new cabinet with 4 new faces||The suspense on the new cabinet of chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat ended on Friday after eleven of his party MLAs took oath as ministers in his government at Governor House on Friday evening.Among the ministers, four are new faces including Vishen Singh Chuphal, Bansidhar Bhagat, Ganesh Joshi and Swami Yatishwaranand. The remaining are from the previous cabinet including Subodh Uniyal, Satpal Maharaj, Arvind Pandey, Dhan Singh Rawat, Rekha Arya, Harak Singh Rawat and Yashpal Arya. Only Madan Kaushik has not been repeated as he was appointed the new state president on Friday.Among the new faces, Bansidhar Bhagat, who is party MLA from Kaladhungi, had served as BJP state president before Kaushik. He is likely to be the deputy chief minister, a position that has been created for the first time in the history of Uttarakhand.Also read: Uttarakhand Congress - BJP changed CM’s face, no change in graft, unemploymentAccording to party insiders, he had been given a prominent position in the government as a "compensation for the state president post."Among other prominent new faces in the cabinet, Chuphal's inclusion had been an attempt by the party to pacify him as he had expressed his resentment against the working of previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat before the Central leadership. An MLA from Didihat constituency, Chuphal had also reportedly written a letter to the party Central leadership during the recently concluded budget session in the state assembly in Gairsain along with thirteen other party MLAs. He, along with other ministers, had threatened to tender their resignation if Trivendra Singh Rawat is not replaced. It was this incident that reportedly triggered the politician crisis in the BJP.Another new face, MLA from Haridwar rural, Yatishwaranand, is believed to have been rewarded for his feat of defeating former CM Harish Rawat of Congress in the 2017 assembly elections. His inclusion is also important as the party had to have a representation from Haridwar after Kaushik, who also hails from the region, was appointed the new party chief in the state.The fourth MLA in the cabinet is three-time BJP MLA from Mussoorie, Ganesh Joshi. Considered a "public leader" in his area, Joshi is believed to have been rewarded for his loyalty to the party.Political experts, however, have described the new cabinet as an act of balance by the newly-appointed CM on caste and region equations along with pacifying the "rebel MLAs."Political expert, MM Semwal, said, "the new cabinet has six ministers from the Garhwal region while five are from Kumaon. Those from Garhwal include MLAs like Satpal Maharaj, Subodh Uniyal, Harak Singh Rawat, Dhan Singh Rawat, Ganesh Joshi and Swami Yatishwaranand while Yashpal Arya, Rekha Arya, Arvind Pandey, Vishan Singh Chuphal and Bansidhar Bhagat come from Kumaon."Semwal added, "by including Chuphal, the party leadership seems to have finally doused the fire of rebellion."Meanwhile, the Congress has termed the new cabinet a mere "eyewash" to cover up the government's "failures."Party state president Pritam Singh said, "The new cabinet will make no difference for the BJP with a year left for the next state assembly elections in 2022.""If they are thinking that changing the CM and having a new cabinet will help them in the elections then they are wrong because the public has already made up their mind to show them the door in 2022," said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-cm-tirath-singh-rawat-gets-new-cabinet-with-4-new-faces-101615556123875.html

12-03-2021||Delhi||'We dream of hosting 2048 Olympics': Delhi CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said it is his government's dream to host the 2048 Olympics, adding that he would approach the Central government and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) for it."It is our dream to host the 2048 Olympics. We will go to all sports bodies, the Indian Olympic Association and the Centre for it. The Delhi government will take initiative but all have to come together for it. I am sure our dream will come true," Kejriwal said in the Delhi assembly.Earlier this week, Kejriwal said that the national capital will bid to be the host of the Olympics in 2048, adding that a vision has been provided for the same in the Delhi budget."A vision has been provided in the Budget that 2048 Olympic games should be held in Delhi. Delhi will bid for the 2048 Olympics. We will take up whatever infrastructure and other necessities that are needed to be created for it," he said.On Tuesday, Sisodia had said that with the aim of 2048 Olympics, the Delhi government will build adequate infrastructure and create an atmosphere where sports flourishes. While presenting the 2021-22 budget for the state, Sisodia said, “There is another big dream related to sports which I am placing before this house… It is a dream to organise the Olympic Games in Delhi.”Sisodia said that the Olympic torch has never come to Delhi since the Games began in Athens, Greece, in 1896. “The 32nd Olympic Games are to be held in Tokyo. The next three host cities have also been decided. Our government aims to bring the sports facilities and the atmosphere towards sports competitions to such a level through the new Sports University that we can apply to host the 39th Olympic sports competitions for 2048,” he added.“This may seem far away, but we have to bid for it 10 years before 2048. And before that, it will take 15 years to build adequate infrastructure, create an atmosphere where sports flourishes and bring our players to a level where they bring medals in sports competitions leading to Olympics 2048,” Sisodia said.Sisodia further said that the sports university will also initiate its activities this year. Delhi hosted the first Asian Games in 1951, and later the 1982 edition. In 2010, the national capital had hosted the Commonwealth Games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/we-dream-of-hosting-2048-olympics-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101615552859439.html

12-03-2021||City||Kamal Haasan to go head on with BJP, Congress in Coimbatore South||Actor-turned politician and chief ministerial candidate for Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), Kamal Haasan will contest from Coimbatore South constituency in Tamil Nadu. He will face lock horns with the BJP and Congress as the Dravidian majors AIADMK and DMK have allotted the Coimbatore South constituency to their respective allies but their candidates are yet to be released.“Coimbatore is a place close to my heart,” Haasan said at a press conference Friday in the city while releasing the party’s second list of candidates. Coimbatore, which falls in the western region of Tamil Nadu popularly known as the ‘Kongu belt’, is an AIADMK’s citadel. The BJP also enjoys considerable support from the business communities in this region. Quoting a proverb in Tamil that if Kongu region flourishes, everything else would flourish, Haasan said that “It is sad that it has become a corrupt place now. I plan on changing that.”The MNM was floated in 2018 as an alternative to the Dravidian majors of DMK and AIADMK and built its party with former bureaucrats and activists on an anti-corruption poll plank. The party debuted in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but didn’t win any seat and managed to register a 3.7 per cent vote share. The MNM received much of their support from the urban pockets of Chennai and Coimbatore. R Mahendran contested the Coimbatore Lok Sabha seat in 2019 and came in third after the winning CPI (M) candidate and runner-up BJP in the constituency. He will contest from Singanallur constituency in Coimbatore district this time. In the 2016 assembly elections Coimbatore South was won by AIADMK’s Amman K Arjunan, Congress’ Mayura Jayakumar was the runner-up and BJP’s national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan came in third. Arjunan's supporters protested against the AIADMK handing over the seat to the BJP.Also read: I have worked, says deputy CM Panneerselvan as he files nominationFormer IAS officer Santhosh Babu, who had earlier been named as the Vilivakkam candidate, has now been fielded from Velachery.

Social worker Sneha Mohandoss from Saidapet will have to take on veteran former mayors AIADMK’s Saidai Duraisamy and DMK’s M Subramanian.The MNM will contest 154 seats, the party announced late Monday night and allotted 40 seats each to its alliance partners, All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi (AISMK), led by actor R Sarathkumar, and Indhiya Jananayaga (IJK).

12-03-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress: BJP changed CM’s face, no change in graft, unemployment||The Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh accused the BJP led state government of doing “nothing” on issues like corruption and unemployment and just changing the chief minister's face at party’s state headquarters in Dehradun on Friday.The Congress attack comes two days after Tirath Singh Rawat was sworn-in as the new CM of the state replacing Trivendra Singh Rawat and on the day when the new cabinet was formed."When the BJP came to power in 2017, it had made many tall claims including zero tolerance to corruption, job creation, curbing price rise and others. But in four years of its rule so far, it did nothing," Singh alleged."Instead, the corruption is rampant to such an extent that the high court had to order an FIR and CBI probe against previous CM Trivendra Singh Rawat. Also, the unemployment rate in the state has touched all time high with skyrocketing fuel prices making the life of common man extremely difficult," said Singh.The Congress state president also alleged that the BJP government did nothing for the welfare of farmers in the state."The government had promised loan waiver for all farmers of the state before coming to power in 2017, but till date, not a single farm loan has been waived off. Instead, it has pushed the farmers to protest on roads against the three black farm laws introduced by the Centre. But Congress will always stand behind the farmers," said Singh.Singh also took a jibe at the BJP for changing the CM with one year left for assembly elections, saying, "The BJP was habitual of taking down elected governments of other parties in states. In Uttarakhand, it was their own government, but despite that they took it down to maintain their habit of taking down elected governments"He also claimed that the new CM’s appointment will, however, have “no effect” on the 2022 election results, which he said will be the end of BJP’s “misrule".Also Read: Akhilesh Yadav predicts a repeat of Uttarakhand in Uttar Pradesh ahead of pollsThe BJP shot back saying the Congress was frustrated because it had long been rejected by the public."The CM has been changed because the previous CM, Trivendra Singh Rawat, would be given a more important role in the organisation.

It also asked the couple to pay ₹50,000 compensation to the girl.Special judge Rekha N Pandhare said the couple of the child’s grandparents’ age, who lived in the same building, was supposed to take care of her but instead abused her. In her police statement in 2013, the girl said the couple, now aged 87, and 81, whom she addressed as dada and dadi, stopped her while she was returning home and made her sit on a swing. She said the dada slapped her while the dadi held her tight. She said the dada then disrobed her and inserted his fingers into her private parts. The girl said when she tried to run away, the dada spat on her and left her before letting her go home.Seven witnesses were examined during the trial that began in 2017 when the accused were out on bail. The court relied on the girl’s testimony recorded almost after four years after the complaint was filed.Also Read | Try 16+ as adults in POCSO cases: PanelDinesh Tiwari, the couple’s lawyer, said they have moved the Bombay high court against the conviction, saying personal enmity prompted the girl’s family to file the case against them.

12-03-2021||City||Goa opposition rejoices as govt asked to redo municipal reservations||Opposition parties in Goa have welcomed the Supreme Court verdict which dismissed the Goa government's appeal on the municipal poll process, claiming a moral victory against the ruling BJP government ahead of the municipal polls.The apex court, in a judgement delivered on Friday, dismissed the Goa government’s petitions challenging the orders of the Bombay High Court at Goa which had quashed and set aside the reservations for municipal polls as notified by the state government.The top court also ordered the Goa State Election Commissioner to step down from his post ruling that the posts of the State Election Commissioner should be ‘independent’. In Goa’s case, law secretary Choka Ram Garg was given an additional charge as the State Election Commissioner.The opposition has claimed a moral victory calling the Supreme Court judgement “a complete slap and indictment of the government led by Pramod Sawant in Goa.”Also read: Goa beach’s Blue Flag certification in limbo as court stays Central notificationSpeaking to media persons, Advocate Carlos Alvares Ferreira, who represents some of the original petitioners before the High Court, said, “the SC has straightforwardly dismissed the appeals filed by the state government. The SC has found that there was clear machination done by the SC in trying to manipulate the entire constitutional machinery and override constitutional provisions,” Ferreira, who is also a Congress leader, said.The case originated when the Director of Municipal Administration (DMA), who is in charge of notifying which seats in Municipal Councils are to be reserved for candidates from vulnerable categories like women, STs, SCs and OBCs, issued a notification.In the notification, the DMA ‘rounded off' the number of seats to be reserved for women to the lower integer that emerged when the total number of seats was sought to be divided into three. For example, in the Mapusa Municipal Council, of the 20 seats only six were reserved for women (30 per cent) when the constitution mandated that “no less than” 33 per cent be reserved for women which meant that at least seven seats should have been reserved. A similar case was witnessed in several other of the 11 municipal councils going to the polls.The matter was promptly challenged before the Bombay High Court at Goa and even while the hearings were underway, the State Election Commission notified the poll process and proceeded to take a stance before the High Court that now that the poll process was underway, the Courts should follow precedent laid down and not interfere in the ongoing process since legal remedies can always be sought after the polls were concluded.The unimpressed High Court, however, quashed the notification concerning five municipal councils and asked the Goa government to issue fresh notifications this time ensuring that the seats were adequately reserved for various categories asking that the poll process be pushed forward by ten days.The Goa government promptly approached the Supreme Court appealing against the HC orders and secured an interim stay, which prompted the Goa CM to prematurely declare victory claiming ‘democracy has been restored.’“Hon. Supreme Court has stayed the High Court’s order cancelling elections to five municipalities and consequent order of the State Election Commission keeping the election process in abeyance. Matter to come up for final hearing on Tuesday. Now, the democratic process has been restored!” Sawant had tweeted.With the Supreme Court now dismissing the government’s petitions, it’s not the opposition turn to rejoice.“The Highest Court of the land has crushed @DrPramodPSawant’s blatant attempt to violate our constitution and derail democracy; He’s brought disgrace not only to Goa but also to his own leader @narendramodi who had bowed before the Constitution before taking office in 2019,” leader of Goa Forward Party, Vijai Sardesai, said in a tweet.“The pat on the back @DrPramodPSawant expected has come as a slap on the face. @goacm is now a certified cheat. He defied [the] Indian Constitution and strangled democracy; and got caught. It’s no more about resigning as @goacm, he has no moral right to remain in public life,” Sardesai said in another tweet.“The CM is illegal, he is not worthy of the chair. Uttarakhand has changed a CM, maybe they will change him too. After the SC order, the CM should not be sitting in the chair for a single minute. Strictures have been passed against the Goa government. The minister (for urban development) should also be sacked. The officer who supported this harakiri should be acted against,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.The judgement leaves the State Election Commission to now re-do the election process, barring those who were elected ‘unopposed’ in several wards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/goa-opposition-rejoices-as-govt-asked-to-redo-municipal-reservations-101615548789860.html
12-03-2021||Bangalore||Arjuna awardee Aditi Ashok: Growing up in Bengaluru, you can play golf all year!||Think of golf and one is usually reminded of ace players such as Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa. But when it comes to the young guns taking up this game of patience, there’s one name that has been shining bright in the last few years, and that is Bengaluru-based 22-year-old Aditi Ashok! Carrying the baton of women golfers in the country, Ashok started learning golf when she was five, and is today the only Indian golfer to have played in the Asian Youth Games, Youth Olympic Games and Asian Games. Presently in the USA, competing at the coveted LPGA tournament, after the pandemic hit last year, she says, “The pandemic was hard for me because golf is an outdoor sport and there is only so much you can do indoors. It took some time to get back into the groove but I’m happy with where my game is trending right now.” Ask her how it feels to get back on the turf amid safety concerns and the golfer replies, “I’m excited to get back into the competition! I guess this is the new normal so we have to get used to all the restrictions and protocols but I’m glad that we have tournaments to play.” The year 2020 was a tough one for most sportspersons, and sporting events including the Olympics got pushed to 2021. But, what made things brighter for Ashok was being conferred with the Arjuna Award. “It was a great honour and achievement for me. The recognition for golf and women’s golf in particular was also great to see,” she says, opining how her achievement at the national level will inspire more women to take up the sport: “I think it can definitely help young girls in India believe that they can also make it (golf) a career and compete on the world stage.” Ashok, who has been in the spotlight since she won a professional event as a 13-year-old amateur, credits her parents for letting her foray into golf and develop interest in the sport. “My parents and I started learning golf at the same time, when I was five and a half years old. It was just a weekend activity that we could do as a family, but I really liked it and wanted to learn and play more,” she recalls, adding, “While growing up, I was definitely one of the handful of girls playing in most tournaments, but never thought of it as a sport for men. I enjoyed it so much that it never bothered me most of the time,” she says. Though she doesn’t get to be in her hometown most of the year, due to tournaments across the globe, yet Ashok thanks Bengaluru for contributing to her successful career in the sport. “Growing up in Bengaluru was great for me because here you can play golf all round the year, and the weather is perfect,” she exclaims. Ask if she could choose to spend time at a particular place in the city, and Ashok says her choice is predictable but honest: “It would definitely be the Bangalore Golf Club because I’ve grown up practising and playing there, and it’s the oldest golf course outside the British Isles so it’s got some history too!”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/arjuna-awardee-aditi-ashok-growing-up-in-bengaluru-you-can-play-golf-all-year-101615548399626.html
12-03-2021||Chandigarh||Year after escape, Amritsar jailbreak main accused is back behind bars||More than a year after he escaped from the Amritsar Central Prison, police have arrested Vishal Kumar, the main accused. Vishal had escaped from the high-security jail along with two undertrials on February 1 last year. While two escapees, Jarnail Singh of Hansanwala village in Tarn Taran and his brother Gurpreet Singh, were arrested a week after the jailbreak, Vishal, who belongs to Majitha road in Amritsar, had been absconding. He is accused of raping a minor. Addressing a press conference on Friday, deputy commissioner of police (DCP-detective) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar, who supervised the operation of arresting the accused, said, “A team of inspector Sukhwinder Singh, in-charge excise staff, acted on a tip-off about the presence of Vishal at new grain market in Ambala city. Without delay, the team reached there and arrested him on Thursday.” “Vishal is being questioned in detail. We want to know who helped him escape, who funded him and gave him shelter,” he said. Vishal was an undertrial in the case registered at Chheharta police station in 2019. The other two escapees are notorious criminals who are booked in five cases each of robbery and snatching. Those who sheltered them were also arrested. The three had escaped by removing bricks of their barrack and then scaling the inner and outer walls of the jail. Both the brothers had planned to escape earlier too and made four other inmates part of the plan. However, they did not implement it as one of the inmates was shifted to Faridkot jail. The new plan was made in September 2019, in which Vishal was also involved. On February 3, the police arrested two wardens and a home guard jawan deployed at the prison in connection with the February 1 jailbreak. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/year-after-escape-amritsar-jailbreak-main-accused-is-back-behind-bars-101615548038937.html

The BJP had earlier alleged former minister Sanjay Rathod's role in the death, following which he resigned.Speaking to reporters here, the BJP leader said Rathod's resignation was never the target."We have filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court in the case. We have demanded that an offence be registered and a special investigation team (SIT) be formed or the probe be handed over to the CBI," Wagh said.When asked about the police summoning a local BJP corporator in connection with the case, the party leader said, "The party does not have anything to do with the incident. Corporator Dhanraj Ghogare helped the woman. If the government is investigating him, should we stop helping people?"Wagh further spoke about an incident in Latur, where a woman, who was seeking her deceased father's government job on compassionate grounds, was harassed by an official from the social welfare department.The official had allegedly demanded sexual favours in exchange, the BJP leader said, adding that the government should take action against such officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-bats-for-sit-or-cbi-probe-in-pune-woman-s-death-101615543631860.html
12-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana CM presents ₹1.55 lakh crore budget with focus on health, agriculture||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday presented a ₹1.55-lakh crore budget for the 2021-22 fiscal, with health, agriculture and infrastructure identified as priority areas. Presenting the budget estimates, which have no fresh tax proposals, Khattar, who also holds the finance portfolio, proposed a budget of ₹1,55,645 crore for FY 2021-22, an increase of 13% over FY 2020-21 of ₹1,37,738 crore. The budget outlay comprises 25% as capital expenditure of ₹38,718 crore and 75% as revenue expenditure of ₹1,16,927 crore. As compared to the revised estimates of 2020-21, the budget estimates for 2021-22 indicates an increase of ₹10,084 crore in revenue expenditure. As per 2021-22 budget estimates, the revenue deficit is estimated to be at ₹29,193 crore (3.29% of the GSDP) as compared to ₹20,856 crore revenue deficit in the current fiscal. The debt liability is likely to go up to ₹2,29,976 crore as on March 2022 from ₹1,99,823 crore as on March 2021, constituting 25.92% of the GSDP. Khattar said that the Covid-19 pandemic posed unprecedented challenges and “taught us several lessons”. “It is important for the budget to prioritise specific sectors that are key to leverage a rebound in the economy, particularly in times of crisis. We have identified health, agriculture and infrastructure as key priority areas that we need to focus recovery and resurgence,” he said. Announces Antyodaya scheme for state Khattar said the Parivar Pehchan Patra initiative will go a long way in improving the ease of living of citizens by targeting paperless, faceless service delivery to citizens. It will help in achieving citizen convenience and good governance. “Our strategy for the implementation is guided by principles of Antyodaya – of serving and uplifting the last person first,” he told the House and announced the launch of a new scheme – the Mukhyamantri Antyodya Parivar Utthan Abhiyan. The scheme will draw verified data from the Parivar Pehchan Patra and identify the poorest 1 lakh families in Haryana. The package of measures from education, skill development, wage employment, self-employmentand job creation will be adopted and tailored to each family to ensure their economic uplift so as to reach a minimum economic threshold of ₹1.8 lakh per annum. Once the one lakh families are successfully uplifted, the government will identify the next lot of poorest 1 lakh families and work for their economic uplift, he said. The drive will be an umbrella mission encompassing all government schemes to identify the scheme or set of schemes to supplement the uplift of each identified family. Each department will prioritise schemes implemented by them for the uplift of the identified poorest families. “By 2025 if we are together in implementing the Abhiyan, I hope to see no family in the state living below the poverty,” he said. Reiterates commitment to doubling farmers’ income Khattar said that his government needs to continue assistance to farmers for paving the way for Haryana’s economic growth. An outlay of ₹6,110 crore has been proposed for 2021-22, of which ₹2,998 crore is earmarked for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, ₹489 crore for horticulture, ₹1,225 crore for animal husbandry & dairying, ₹125 crore for fisheries and ₹1,274 crore for cooperation. The outlay of ₹6,110 crore for 2021-22 indicates an increase of 20.9 per cent against the 2020-21 fiscal’s ₹5,052 crore. He said the government is committed to doubling farmers’ income. “We are indebted to our farmers, whose toil and hard work has made Haryana the food bowl of the country. Agriculture is the mainstay of our economy. We are committed to doubling farmer’s income and ensuring his/her wellbeing,” he said.  ₹700 crore for tech-based learning Khattar allocated ₹700 crore for promoting technology-based learning in all government schools, including provision of digital tablets and digital classrooms. The chief minister said the government is considering bringing a policy for performance-indexing of the municipal bodies to create a positive atmosphere of healthy competition among these bodies. The state government will award the incentive to such municipalities that achieve the performance level fixed in the Municipal Performance Index. Panchkula, Hisar to be smart, inclusive cities Khattar said the government is developing a global city near Manesar that will be the central business district of the National Capital Region. “Panchkula and Hisar will be developed as smart and inclusive cities,” said the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-cm-presents-rs-1-55-lakh-crore-budget-with-focus-on-health-agriculture-101615541138712.html

12-03-2021||Other||#slamdunk Can pressure-cooker environment contribute positively to basketball development? – Part 1||The competitive world of professional sports requires all players to possess cut-throat instincts, elite mental focus and the ability to make decisions in split seconds with vast amounts of information. In the NBA, players who carry franchises, such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo possess a huge degree of responsibility, both on and off the basketball court, as ambassadors of their franchises and the entire league. The history of players in the NBA is littered with prodigious talents like Kobe Bryant playing basketball since the age of three, or challenging grown men playing professionally at age 10. On the other hand, it is well chronicled that Basketball Hall of Famers like Hakeem Olajuwon did not start playing the sport until well into their teenage years, at age 15 or 16. This begs the question: how and why does elite talent develop in different environments? What are the key ingredients necessary for success at the highest competitive levels of the sport?In our societies, with increased notoriety, resources and financial gain available in a sport like basketball, it leads to a greater level of competitive basketball at earlier ages. It is not uncommon in a highly competitive environment to therefore, take a short-term approach to talent development for immediate success. At younger levels of basketball in America, coaches design and implement game strategies to control games in the interest of winning at all costs; rather than the focus being on an individual player’s long-term development, they focus is on winning the game by any means necessary. Psychologically, this could benefit a young player’s mental focus, competitive desire and tenacity with which they approach every game. The other side of this approach is that the creativity and development opportunities for all the players who aren’t as talented or physically gifted at a young age is curbed and drastically limited. For example, if the goal of a team is to have the best team of 11-year-old youth basketball players, the players who are more physically developed and have hit an early growth spurt will likely get the most playing time and developmental opportunities. Other players might get minimal time, or get told to focus on simply one task in a game, such as rebounding, which limits their ability to develop skills like shooting. While there are benefits to the “survival of the fittest” approach of developing talent, it always begs the question, are younger athletes mentally developed enough to handle the rigors of such a competitive cauldron at early ages? Or will it result in mental burnout and unrealised potential? We can find examples throughout basketball history of highly touted young prospects such as Lenny Cooke. Cooke touched extreme heights as teenage high school basketball player, once being rated a better basketball prospect than LeBron James. However, these early successes were a mirage as he was unable to sustain his success, with external pressures and factors preventing him from ever being drafted in the NBA. More recently, NBA players such as LaMelo Ball are proving that prodigious talent does have a chance to succeed under this microscope, particularly when creativity is not stifled and is allowed to express itself. It is obvious that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to talent development.In the second part of this series we will focus on how the long-term approach to youth talent development has manifested itself in producing great NBA basketball players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slamdunk-can-pressure-cooker-environment-contribute-positively-to-basketball-development-part-1-101615535197919.html

12-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze transferred out of Crime Branch to Mumbai Police CFC||Assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze has been transferred from crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch to Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) of Mumbai police.Vaze is facing allegations in connection with the suspicious death of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran after a Mahindra Scorpio in Hiran’s possession was found parked near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25 with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening letter.A senior IPS officer confirmed the development and said, “The CFC is located within the Mumbai Police headquarters, on the ground floor of the new building, and the unit handles grievances of citizens and various licenses issued by Mumbai Police and other public-related services.”Also Read | Vaze row: Shiv Sena slams Opposition ruckus in legislatureThe process of the transfer started after leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue of Hiran’s suspicious death in the state assembly. He alleged that Vaze had used the same Scorpio found near Ambani’s house months before the incident, and sought Vaze’s arrest. Home minister Anil Deshmukh then announced the officer’s transfer in the legislative council on Wednesday. A day after the Scorpio was found parked on Carmichael Road, Deshmukh released a video statement stating that the Mumbai crime branch would investigate the case. Vaze, who was heading the crime intelligence unit, took the lead in the investigation. The Scorpio was traced to 48-year-old Hiran, a Thane resident, who had reported the car stolen on February 18. Hiran was called in for questioning by several agencies and he said that he had registered a complaint that the SUV was stolen under the jurisdiction of Vikhroli police station between the night of February 17 and February 18. On March 4, Hiran died in mysterious circumstances: his body washed up on a creek in Thane district, his mouth stuffed with handkerchiefs and covered with a scarf, and all his personal belongings, including his ring, chain and wrist watch, missing from the body. Three days later, Hiran’s wife, Vimla (43), gave a statement to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad investigating team that she was certain Hiran had been murdered, and she suspected Vaze had a hand in it. Her statement revealed that Hiran knew Vaze well, and that he had lent him the Scorpio in question in November. Vaze returned the car on February 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-transferred-out-of-crime-branch-to-mumbai-police-cfc-101615530158483.html
12-03-2021||Bangalore||City matters: Need significant change in way we plan Bengaluru||Recently, Bengaluru jumped over fifty places to be ranked the best Indian city on the Ease of Living index in its population category. This ranking by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs was accompanied by its sibling, the Municipal Performance (MP) Index in which the city did not make it to any of the top spots. While the latter was both understandable and explainable, the most liveable city tag, while a welcome surprise, was a tad difficult to reason away akin to the umpire’s call. Bengalureans were understandably skeptical and the chief minister (B S Yediyurappa) chose to skip its mention while presenting the budget. Self-proclaimed urban experts like this writer were scrambling around to make sense of the ranking.While there are many parameters underlying the index, the primary reasons for the high ranking possibly stems from the Citizen Perception Survey (30%) and Economic Ability (15%). While the latter has always been a city’s strength, it is clear that the one silver lining from the pandemic year was citizens feeling better about a city that they experienced less! Given the technological nature of the city’s workforce, it was a natural fit for the shift to the Work from Home (WFH) paradigm. Many companies had progressive schemes to facilitate WFH – employees had laptops sent to their homes and broadband connection enabled. This coupled with less need for travel saw reduced traffic, Bengaluru’s notorious bugbear, and less visible garbage too, another regular dampener. The multiple excavation sites too were mainly out of sight. All in all, less distress led to relative happiness. Bengaluru saw a steady middle order performance in the other two parameters of Quality of Life (35%) and Sustainability (20%).Also Read | HT Editorial: Shaping India’s urban futureThe problem with being ranked the best is that the only way is down since there are no underlying structural measures that can ensure repeat winning performances. The Municipal Performance index says it all. Bengaluru has chosen to disregard the multiple committee (disclosure – this writer was a member of one of them) recommendations to reform its city governance and administration. There is a need to do a mix of deep decentralization at the ward level and centralization to coordinate across multiple agencies at the city level. It has not happened and neither does there seem to be political will nor administrative appetite to do what is required.More important than the structural reforms, we need a transformative vision for the city. If there is one takeaway from the 2020 pandemic, it is the idea of a ‘bubble’ and the need for compact cities. We need to think in terms of a 5 km city radius where the bulk of ‘live and work’ happens for most Bengalureans. We had the code, but we chose to junk it. The public sector townships like ITI, BEL, HAL, HMT were planned in this manner where the workplace, educational, social infrastructure were all provided for in the neighbourhood. Somewhere in the growth process, we chose to crisscross the city and lost the plot. It is possible to reimagine the city drawing from this relatively ‘ancient’ way of life!Also Read | ‘Choice between smart city and decay’: Minister on Ease of Living Index reportBengaluru no longer has one city centre. Just going overground on the Metro on MG Road sort of killed it. There are multiple city centres around Whitefield, Jayanagar, Malleswaram, etc. The 5 km city has to work for strata of citizens. Our house helps, business workers, street side vendors need to be able to live with dignity within these ‘enclaves’. For that to happen, it is imperative we think in terms of social rental housing, a much-neglected area. We need plan permission policies that enable rental housing for the underprivileged on scale – instruments like Transit Oriented Development, Transferable Development Rights and local retrofit initiatives need to be reoriented to address this need.We need a significant change in the way we plan our city if we need it to be a truly liveable one for decades to come. The current Comprehensive Master Plan route has failed us comprehensively. We ought not to be in denial and be ready to embark on new imaginations of what is desirable and possible. This will require enlightened political leadership and Bengaluru has the civil society eco-system that is happy to partner. Together we can make the change happen.(V.

They have also accused Girish Chandra, the officer, of allegedly harassing and humiliating the girl and getting her locked up in a maternity room of the centre. The son of another police officer and his friends are accused of raping her.The family on Wednesday blamed the accused for the accident and said the police were initially reluctant to file a gang-rape complaint and that they made the survivor undergo medical examination five times.Also Read | Mumbai: Boxing coach arrested for rape of minor studentChandra did not respond to calls and messages for comments.A family member said the man responsible for the father’s death was asked to probe when he needed to be punished. “An uncle of the girl said the circle officer behaved as if he was above the law,” he said. “He abused my brother and niece several times in presence of others,” he said. The family member added Chandra kept sending the girl from one hospital to another for medical examination.“How many times a victim is examined medically? He abused them several times, even at the hospital. He brazenly questioned her character in presence of other policemen who laughed. I was there.”The family member said Chandra took her to a second medical centre and did not allegedly allow the girl and her parents to leave for their village. “He spoke to the medical superintendent and asked for a ward. He was told there is none except for a maternity ward. The mother and the victim were sent inside, and he got the door locked from outside.”He added the father was allegedly taken to a police station. “I do not know what he went through there,” he said.Deputy inspector general Preetinder Singh was unavailable for comments.Police superintendent (Kanpur rural) Brijesh Srivastava did not call back after promising to do so when asked about the allegations against Chandra.Singh earlier suspended three policemen on Thursday citing “gross negligence” in the case after Chandra indicted them even as their role is believed to have been limited to sending the father to hospital after the truck hit him, said people aware of the matter.Dhanesh Prasad, the local station house officer, said: “Why do not you ask the CO [circle officer Chandra]...he was involved in the case at every step. I cannot comment more than this.”The family said after the gang-rape complaint was filed on Tuesday, the accused assaulted the father and were pressuring him to withdraw the case filed under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. One of the accused also threatened the minor with dire consequences if she reported the sexual assault.“When my brother was coming to the police station, the accused Deepak Yadav and others accosted and assaulted him,” the girl’s uncle said on Wednesday. “They threatened him with dire consequences for pursuing the case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cop-humiliated-rape-survivor-s-father-before-a-truck-hit-killed-him-family-101615529018187.html
12-03-2021||Patna||Bihar granting taxation powers to gram panchayats from next fiscal||The gram panchayats in the three-tier rural local bodies system will soon have the power to impose tax for collection of own revenue in Bihar, a move aimed to achieve financial independence for local self government institutions. The state government is giving the final shape to rules for taxation powers to panchayats under the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act, 2006.The gram panchayat, which forms the bottom level of the three-tier rural local bodies, will have the powers to collect taxes from markets, haats (small temporary markets at the village level), commercial use of vehicles in respective gram panchayats such as tractors and trucks and also commercial use of water for any purpose. Besides, tax could be collected by the gram panchayats from transmission towers set up by private and public sector operators, officials said on condition of anonymity.In Bihar, there are a total of 8,386 gram panchayats, which are headed by Mukhiyas. “We are going to give the powers of imposing tax to all gram panchayats for generating their own resources. The rules are being framed and sent to the cabinet for approval. The panchayats would implement the new tax rules from next year after the constitution of new panchayat bodies following elections to the local rural bodies,” said additional chief secretary, panchayati raj department Amrit Lal Meena.The panchayati raj department minister Samrat Choudhary too, informed the state assembly on Wednesday that the rules for giving taxation powers to gram panchayats were under process and will be implemented from the next fiscal year. The government may take a call on giving taxation powers to panchayats samitis and district boards later on, officials said.The issue of taxation powers to the gram panchayats and other rural local bodies has long been pending with successive state finance commissions recommending the same to reduce the rural local bodies’ dependency on grants from the state and Central governments.The fifth state finance commission, for the period 2015-20, in its report, had recommended that state government should put in place rules and procedure in place for collection of property tax by the gram panchayats and also encourage panchayats to develop infrastructure like bus stands, community centres and markets to increase their own revenue. The 14th finance commission also recommended taxation powers to panchayats.Under the Bihar panchayati raj law, gram panchayats have the powers to realize tax and non-tax revenue from holdings, trade, professions, employment as well registration of vehicles not registered under any other law, sanitary arrangements at haats, pilgrimage spots, fairs and public use, water rate, lighting fee etc.Officials said the tax rate for each category, where panchayats can collect tax was being finalised. “The tax rate for different categories would be in various slabs and there would be an upper limit fixed for each slab. The rates are being finalised,” said Meena.Also Read: 960 cartons of liquor seized in UP's Ballia ahead of panchayat pollsRight now, the gram panchayats are dependent on grants and devolutions from the central and state government. Each gram panchayat gets around ₹2 crore as grant and other allocations for implementation of various development works and schemes from the Centre and the state government.Meanwhile, officials said the state government’s implementation of the public financial management system (PFMS) has fixed more accountability on the PRIs-related financial accounting and expenditure as all tied and untied funds allocated to the panchayats have to reflect in the software. Some panchayat representatives have recently expressed annoyance over procedural delay in using development funds. “The use of PFMS has brought in more financial accountability and transparency.

That’s their purpose. In the main Delhi riots cases, they say soft copy is equal to hard copy and we would not give hard copy of charge sheet. Here they don’t want a soft copy,” Pracha said.Opposing his plea, the city police said that seizing the original hard disk was essential as it ought to be sent to a forensic science laboratory for examination and that a mirror hard disk can be put into Pracha’s computer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mehmood-pracha-s-plea-on-search-at-his-premises-delhi-court-order-today-101615526078448.html

About 9.5 lakh health workers were listed for vaccination and officials said the target was almost achieved. In some cases, certain health workers did not fall in the category of those to be vaccinated due to health conditions.“In certain health conditions, vaccination is not recommended. But not many health workers will be left out from vaccination in the state. We have almost achieved our target,” said a senior health official.Efforts are also going on to increase the vaccination percentage among the elderly. In a recent order, the National Health mission has asked all the chief medical officers in the state to engage accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in the districts to motivate the elderly and those between 45 and 60 years of age with co-morbidity to get vaccinated.Experts said the elderly were showing enthusiasm in getting the vaccine jab and they just needed a smooth process and easy access.Also Read: BJP launches rural-connect drive ahead of UP panchayat polls“The elderly started making queries via phone call even before the vaccination for their category began.

He also accused UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath of claiming credit for the work done by the SP government in the past."The image of the chief minister taking a selfie on Wednesday has been splashed in newspapers and social media. The project seen in the background is the SP government's project," claimed Akhilesh. Yogi Adityanath took a selfie at a dam project that he inaugurated in Chitrakoot on Wednesday.Akhilesh Yadav’s pot shots at CM Yogi Adityanath came during a press conference in Moradabad, ahead of the bicycle rally he is scheduled to flag off on Friday in the neighbouring Rampur. The SP is taking out the bicycle rally from Rampur to Lucknow in support of party's Rampur MP, Azam Khan, who is currently in jail in connection with the cases filed against him over alleged anomalies in institution and operation of Maulana Jauhar University, Rampur."Even the jobs that the BJP government claimed to have provided were the ones created in the previous government's tenure," Akhilesh said while building on this theme.Taking about the three new Central farm laws, Akhilesh said, “The laws will ruin small, medium farmers and agricultural labourers."Yadav indicated that his party would not ally with his uncle Shivpal Yadav's Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L) for UP Assembly polls 2022.Also Read: BJP launches rural-connect drive ahead of UP panchayat polls"Samajwadi Party's experience with big political parties has not been good.

12-03-2021||Lucknow||BJP launches rural-connect drive ahead of UP panchayat polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched the 'gram chaupal' or rural meet programme in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday, ahead of the panchayat polls with the focus on listing government’s work including the ongoing crackdown against mafias as proof of the party’s commitment to ensuring rule of law in the state.The week-long initiative will see Central and UP ministers along with party functionaries visit villages to market the ‘achievements’ of the BJP government in the last four years of its rule. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev flagged the issue of action against mafias by the Yogi government prominently during the launch of the programme.“Now bulldozers are demolishing ill-gotten property of mafia elements. The criminals are running scared or are behind bars,” he said, during the launch of the ‘gram chaupal’ campaign at Salempur, Gangaganj.Swatantra Dev, who will be in a village in Lakhimpur Kheri on Friday, also mentioned the ongoing construction work for the Ram temple in Ayodhya, which he said, only became possible due to PM Modi’s stewardship. He also mentioned abrogation of Article 370 among the key achievements of the Centre.Also Read: In run-up to UP polls, several leaders switch loyalties to Samajwadi PartyThe idea for ‘gram chaupal’ was mooted by national BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, during his recent visit to Lucknow.

12-03-2021||Lucknow||In run-up to UP polls, several leaders switch loyalties to Samajwadi Party||The Samajwadi Party (SP) claims it has the momentum ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh as leaders from all other parties are making a beeline to join it. It cites new-inductees from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Trinamool Congress, to buttress it's claim.SP organised March’s first induction ceremony welcoming leaders from other parties at the SP headquarters in Lucknow. Before that, the previous month saw six such occasions, three of them on successive days — February 19, 20, and 21.It started with some BSP veterans joining SP in August 2019, a few months after the collapse of the SP-BSP alliance, following the Lok Sabha poll debacle for the two partners. Former BSP minister Ghura Ram, who had been with the party since its inception in 1984, was the first major leader to switch loyalties to the SP in August 2019. Within a fortnight, 17 BSP leaders from Pratapgarh joined the Akhilesh Yadav-led party. Then, former BSP state president Dayaram Pal and ex-Ballia district chief Mithailal Bharati followed suit. In October 2019, former Mau BSP district president Ashok Gautam crossed over to the SP. Former minister Kamlakant Gautam, who quit the BSP after its poor show in the 2017 assembly polls, merged his Rashtriya Bahujan Utthan Party with the SP this month. Ghura Ram died of Covid-19 in July 2020, but the trend continues.The day after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati’s 65th birthday, BSP's Meerut mayor Sunita Verma, her husband Yogesh Verma (former BSP MLA from Hastinapur and ex-minister) joined the SP on January 16, along with former BSP MLA from Bareilly Vijay Pal Singh. The other entrants included former BSP MLA from Thakurdwara (Moradabad) Vijay Yadav, former UP minister Awadhesh Verma and former BSP MP from Lakhimpur Dawood Ahmed.Before the Covid induced lockdown, it was only BSP veterans who were joining SP. Post lockdown, other party leaders have also moved to the party."It's quite understandable why the trend emerged and became so prominent. The state is getting into the poll mode. Such times are the best for party-hoppers to switch loyalties, find suitable placements. The trend is in favour of the Samajwadi Party because it is the only party that is looking like a challenger to the ruling BJP. The Congress is not visible beyond one or two of their Delhi leaders. The BSP has been in a steady decline and smaller parties are looking for an ally in the SP," said Professor SK Dwivedi, an expert on political affairs.In October, five-time MP and former Union minister Saleem Sherwani switched over to the SP from the Congress. This happened soon after former Congress MP Anu Tandon and former MP RK Chaudhary joined the SP. Chaudhary, a BSP founder member, had earlier changed sides to the Congress ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The BJP camp, too, is not untouched by the trend. In January, former BJP MLA from Mirzapur, Ram Bharti and Gorakhpur's RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) pracharak Vineet Shukla, joined the SP. At their induction ceremony, Akhilesh Yadav said: "The trend shows who is going to form the government in 2022. We will continue to embrace people from other parties without discrimination. They are coming to strengthen the party and make SP win the polls."Also Read: UP cop shunted for trampling on rosary, hitting woman vendor’s hand with bootIn the last 12 months, SP has held over two dozen joining ceremonies. Party chief Akhilesh Yadav anchors all such events that are held with much fanfare, accompanied by bands playing outside the Lucknow party headquarters gate.The entire Vikramaditya Marg, where the party office is located, is replete with hoardings of the new entrants. They give mementos such as crowns, photo frames, idols and replicas of the SP symbol bicycle to Yadav who, in turn, hands the SP's red caps to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/in-run-up-to-up-polls-several-leaders-switch-loyalties-to-samajwadi-party-101615519197576.html

12-03-2021||Chandigarh||HC issues notice to Punjab, Haryana in case of Hoshiarpur man’s death in police firing||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a notice of motion to the governments of Punjab and Haryana as well as the Punjab Police in the case of death of a 40-year-old Hoshiarpur man in police firing in Amritsar district on December 8 last year. The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) probing the case was also served the notice and the next date of hearing has been fixed on July 12. Inderjit Singh, who was accused of snatching an SUV from a man in Haryana’s Ambala district, was killed in firing by a team of the crime investigation agency (CIA) unit of the Amritsar commissionerate police. The cops had claimed that they opened firing at the tyres of the vehicle after the accused tried to run over them. The victim’s family has filed a petition in the high court seeking a CBI probe into the case, expressing their dissatisfaction over the ongoing inquiry by SDM (Amritsar 1) Vikas Hira, saying it was deliberately being delayed under pressure of senior police officials. The commissionerate team allegedly started the operation without taking the district rural police into the loop as the area falls in the latter’s jurisdiction. “The police team smashed the windshield on the driver’s side and opened direct fire at my brother. They also deleted the CCTV footage of the Manawala toll plaza. Some farmers’ mobile phones wherein they shot videos of the incident were also confiscated by the police,” said victim’s brother Maninder Pal in the petition.  ₹15 lakh cash was given to the wife and two children of his brother as “compensation” by the accused policemen, he claimed. “During the magisterial inquiry, no concrete steps were taken to collect necessary material, information or evidence,” the petition reads. Advocate Sarabjit Singh Verka said, “ ₹15 lakh cash was deposited in the bank accounts of the victim’s family. This is bribe in clear violation of the rules. It’s a very serious issue and should be probed thoroughly.” Also, the SDM enquiring into the death has missed the three-month deadline for probe completion. SDM Vikas Hira had started the probe two days after the death. “The probe could not be completed as we are waiting for some scientific reports related to the case. Also, I got no information from the family about the transaction of ₹15 lakh by the accused,” Hira said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-issues-notice-to-punjab-haryana-in-case-of-hoshiarpur-man-s-death-in-police-firing-101615493855474.html

It had given relaxation to the goods train in November but continued the blockade for passenger trains unlike the other farm organisations which had announced to lift the blockade completely. Committee leader Sawinder Singh Chutala said, “We think the protest at the Delhi borders is gaining momentum by the day. We want to strengthen it. Secondly, the government is not running goods trains on the direct route citing our blockade. This is causing losses to the local traders. Also, the season of wheat harvesting is nearing and the crop needs to be transported.” Despite relaxation for goods trains, the railways did not resume operations of any of the trains through this station and was diverting the route from Beas and the trains reach Amritsar city via Tarn Taran.The sit-in was shifted from the platform to a nearby open ground in November after the agitators allowed the goods train to pass through the track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kmsc-lifts-rail-blockade-on-amritsar-delhi-route-after-169-days-101615493315863.html

12-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh bumps up daily vaccination capacity to 5,000||Ramping up the city’s vaccination campaign, the UT administration has raised the daily inoculation capacity for senior citizens and the comorbid group to 5,000, against 3,200 since March 1.For this, the health department has started vaccination centres at dispensaries in peripheral areas of the city. With this, as many as 19 government centres, with a minimum capacity of 200 each, and 14 private facilities, having a capacity of 1,400 people, will now offer vaccination services.“We are trying to decentralise the system, which is concentrated at main hospitals of the city. We have made arrangements in several dispensaries, which cater to specific areas, so that people don’t have to visit hospitals,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health, Chandigarh.However, utilising the whole capacity remains a challenge for the authorities.“When the daily dose capacity was around 3,000, only half of it was utilised in the first week of the drive. Even now after glitches have been taken care of and process is moving faster, not many people are coming forward,” a senior official of the health department said.Health officials said the response was largely lower from the low-income neighbourhoods of the city and there was a need to spread awareness to encourage residents to get the vaccine.“We have made announcements in areas like Bapu Dham Colony and are pushing for more educational activities in similar areas. We plan to set up more centres near such areas to encourage more people to get the jab. The expansion in network is being done to inoculate as many people as possible,” said Dr Kang said.Chandigarh has inoculated as many as 45,495 people since January 16 when the vaccination drive first started. These include senior citizens, people aged between 45 and 59 and having comorbidities, healthcare workers and frontline workers.In Panchkula, 24,579 people from these target groups have received the vaccine, while the number is 24,568 in Mohali.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur appealed to the senior citizens in the district to come forward for vaccination without any fear. “On-the-spot registration facility is available at seven government health institutes and 27 private centres in the district. Those intending to get the vaccine just need to carry their Aadhaar card,” she said.(With inputs from Mohali and Panchkula)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-bumps-up-daily-vaccination-capacity-to-5000-101615492959029.html

12-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze row, Delkar case, Speaker polls: Congress unhappy with Shiv Sena, NCP||Feeling left out of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, the Congress is now unhappy with its two alliance partners – Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – over the delay in holding election for new Speaker of the Assembly and the way the Vaze episode was handled by the state government. The Congress was insisting on holding the election for the Assembly speaker’s post (the seat is with the Congress) in the budget session, but two other partners did not want it, as some of the MVA legislators were absent. The party is also irked over the handling of the case of an abandoned SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence and the alleged controversy surrounding cop Sachin Vaze over the death of the car owner. After Nana Patole resigned as speaker of the Assembly, as he was appointed state Congress chief, the Congress insisted on the election for the new speaker in the budget session. The party leaders held meetings and pushed for it during the session, but NCP and Shiv Sena did not respond to the demand, stating several MVA legislators were absent due to Covid-19 infection and as such the parties did not want to take the risk of an election on the floor of the assembly. “Of the 25 legislators and ministers who were Covid-positive during the session, 15 were from the ruling parties. It could have reduced the number of votes during the election, but it can’t be the reason for not holding the election. Even Opposition votes were reduced. There was no question of embarrassment for the government, as the reason was genuine. In fact, the NCP wants the house to be run by deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal, who is from their party,” said a Congress leader requesting anonymity. The leader said Congress leaders did not attend the press conference after state budget and conclusion of the budget session to express their displeasure. The leader said the party had also demanded a waiver in electricity bills for smaller consumers who use upto 100 units a month and incentive of ₹50,000 to farmers who have been repaying their loans regularly. “We expected the decision to be taken in the budget, but they were not included in the state budget. As the electricity waiver was announced by our minister Nitin Raut, we are firm on the demand and will keep pushing for it,” the leader said. The Congress leadership is not happy over the handling of Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar’s death by suicide case too. “The special investigation team announced to probe Delkar’s death and the case against Dadra and Nagar Haveli’s administrator Praful Patel should have been done well in time. Also, had assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze been transferred immediately after the issue was raised in the Assembly on Tuesday, it could not have flared up for two days. This has damaged the image of the government,” he said. The minister added that it has been clearly conveyed to the leaders from other two parties. When asked about it, energy minister and senior Congress leader Nitin Raut said, “I would not be able to comment on this. Our state unit chief Patole or our legislative party leader Balasaheb Thorat will speak on it. ” Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the lack of coordination between three ruling parties has come to the fore time and again. “Be it floor management on contentious issues that were raised in the house or the MPSC exam goof-up, the dismay and absence of teamwork was visible. Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat openly said the decision related to MPSC exams has damaged the image of the MVA. The Congress did not even whole heartedly come forward to defend the government when opposition corned the ruling parties over the Sachin Vaze episode.” Shiv Sena chief whip in Assembly Sunil Prabhu said, “We have perfect coordination between three parties and all decisions have been taken collectively. The Congress leaders did not attend the press conference as many of the ministers and leaders had to rush back to their constituencies. There is nothing to be read into it.” When asked during the press conference about the conspicuous absence of Congress leaders, deputy cheif minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar on Wednesday avoided speaking about it. “The decision about the election of the speaker will be taken by three parties together,” he said. NIA team quizzes Hiran’s kinA team of five officials from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) questioned the family of Mansukh Hiran, the owner of the car containing explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia, who was found dead in Thane creek on March 4, in their Thane home for two-and-a-half hours.The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) on Wednesday grilled the family for more than five hours. NIA officials did not divulge the details. They later headed to the creek where the body was found. “The team reached Hiran’s house around 2.30pm and was there till 5pm,” said an officer from the local police station. A relative said, “We are awaiting the forensic analysis report to get some insight on what happened.” Meanwhile, the Sena asked if the Opposition was targeting Sachin Vaze, police officer linked to Hiran’s death, because he reopened the file against Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case and fake TRP scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-row-delkar-case-speaker-polls-congress-unhappy-with-shiv-sena-ncp-101615492175816.html

As per the police, they are in the process of adding more sections to the FIR. Joint commissioner of police (city and traffic) Deepak Pareek said police could take action against the parents of the teenager under Sections 180 (allowing unauthorised persons to drive vehicles), 181 (driving vehicles in contravention of section 3 or section 4) and Section 4 (age limit in connection with driving of motor vehicles) of the Motor Vehicle Act.He added that the traffic police had recently initiated a drive against underage driving and issued 150 challans and impounded more than 100 vehicles, including two-wheelers and cars. Police will take action against the parents of repeat offenders, the joint commissioner of police added.The teen accused in Wednesday’s incident is a resident of Geetanjali Apartments, Rishi Nagar, and his father is a trader. Police have come to know that the teen used to frequently take his parents’ car for a spin and record videos to flaunt to his friends. He was trying to record a video while driving on Wednesday evening when the mishap took place. The teen had allegedly tried to flee after the incident but was nabbed by onlookers and handed over to the police. He has been booked under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. Meanwhile, the parents of the 10-year-old victim, Tanish alias Tarun, carried out his last rites on Thursday. Another mishap had taken place on stretch hours before The road stretch near the income tax office is notorious for attracting youths trying to pull off stunts with their vehicles, say locals. As the stretch witnesses comparatively lower traffic in the evening hours, youths and teenagers can often be seen racing and recording videos here, they said. Just hours before the mishap that killed the 10-year-old, a youth on a bike had reportedly hit a scooterist, leaving him injured. The scooterist had to be hospitalised, shopkeepers in the area said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-teen-indulging-in-underage-driving-runs-over-boy-parents-to-face-action-too-101615491995659.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze row: Shiv Sena slams opposition ruckus in legislature||The Shiv Sena on Thursday slammed the Opposition over the ruckus created in the state legislature over the death of Mansukh Hiran and Mumbai police inspector Sachin Vaze’s alleged involvement in the case. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana questioned if the Opposition is targeting Vaze because he reopened the suppressed file against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case and the fake TRP scam. “There are several issues related to people that are currently at hand. It would have been good had the Opposition taken up such issues in the Assembly to corner the government,” the editorial said.“Instead, they created a ruckus over a suspicious death without allowing proper investigation to be carried out. This is a perverse version of democracy,” the editorial said. “Goswami duped everybody in the TRP scam, which was being investigated by Vaze. Did the Opposition create a hue and cry because Goswami will have to answer questions related to the suicide and TRP scam,” it asked. It further said the government has transferred Vaze, but the decision should not be viewed as the victory of the Opposition party. Responding to the editorial in Saamana, Opposition leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “We have taken up issues related to inflated electricity bills, on farmers and on Covid [response], but they did not see these issues. They only saw the issues that hurt them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-row-shiv-sena-slams-opposition-ruckus-in-legislature-101615491814693.html

We have been urging the residents to follow the norms and awareness posters have been put up on the premises. Masks are being distributed at the entrance.”A resident of Kundan Nagar in Model Town Extension, Daljit Singh, said, “Wearing masks in public places is important, but sometimes it becomes difficult to breath and manage the irritation/itching, especially in the scorching heat. With virus cases on the rise, people should stay safe and avoid moving out whenever possible.”Despite the Covid scare, reckless behaviour by citizens has become a concern, especially in public places and markets, including Chaura Bazaar, Jawahar Nagar camp, Sarabha Nagar, Model Town, Dugri, Shivpuri, Janakpuri, Field Ganj among others. Shopkeepers and eatery owners have also become complacent and are generally seen without face masks.Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “Challans were issued to the violators at public places on Thursday. We had also conducted a meeting with heads of religious organisations asking them to follow all the safety norms. People should also understand their duty and follow all the guidelines while moving out.”Infection surge quadruplesThe number of coronavirus cases in the district has increased by nearly four times from last month.

GMADA had already released funds ₹25 crore as maintenance charges for parks.At present, the MC is taking care of around 565 parks from Sectors 48C to 71. Since Sectors 71 to 75 in the Industrial Area have no parks, MC will now be taking over 105 parks in Sectors 76-80.‘Almost all our parks are ready’On the other hand, a senior official of GMADA said, “All our parks are ready and in some parks in Sectors 79 and 80, civil work is pending, which is going on now.”The announcement about the parks was made last year in December by cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. He had also said that the MC would take over the maintenance of city roads, too. GMADA has already taken over the maintenance of the water supply and sewerage system in the new sectors of GMADA from January 1 onwards.MC councillor and president of Plot Allotment and Development Welfare Committee, Sector 76-80, Sucha Singh Kalaur, said, “It was a long pending demand of the residents. Now, the maintenance would be easier, quicker and to the satisfaction of the people. Local councillors would be able to identify and follow up on requisite repairs and maintenance of local roads and the big and small parks of the city.”GMADA-MC tussle over paymentsIn the past, many a tussle has erupted between GMADA and the MC over the payment of ₹50 crore for 540 parks, which were handed over to the civic body in 2017. The MC, however, has not paid the amount to resident welfare associations for the past three months.As per the agreement in 2016, GMADA was to pay ₹5 crore every year to MC for the maintenance of parks and the total amount fixed was ₹50 crore, but in the last four years, GMADA has paid only ₹34 crore.The civic body pays the RWAs ₹2.45 per square metre per month for maintenance of around 56 acres (2.2 lakh square metre) of park land, which comes out to be around ₹6 lakh a month. The MC makes the payment to the RWAs by the seventh of each month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-mc-to-take-over-105-parks-from-gmada-on-april-1-101615491335328.html

However, as a physician I will not approve of consuming liquor, but any alcoholic drink can be had 72 hours after the vaccination.”At vaccination sites, some senior citizens are also seen showing social media videos to the medical staff which suggest avoiding alcohol for over a month.Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, who is looking after the vaccination drive at Arora Neuro Centre, said some of the senior citizens or immune-compromised residents are avoiding vaccination due to the myth that they have to avoid consuming alcohol for over a month.“It is completely safe to consume moderate amounts of alcohol 72 hours after vaccination,” said Dr Sachdeva and added that vaccination is like wearing a seatbelt or putting on a helmet.“The two doses of the vaccine build 72% immunity against the virus. Though the persons could suffer from Covid-19, the possibility of adverse events could be avoided,” said Dr Sachdeva.On the other hand, Dr Kiran Ahluwalia, civil surgeon and nodal officer for the vaccination dive in the district, said that in case of any inconvenience or complaint, people are advised to visit a nearby health facility or call a health worker. The helpline numbers for the said services are being made available through SMS after getting vaccinated.“Another common rumour is that of fever. As per the data of vaccination available, only 5% of the people have suffered from fever or any other complication post vaccination,” said Dr Ahluwalia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaxtakers-in-ludhiana-shower-health-staff-with-queries-on-alcohol-intake-101615491275442.html

A simple lamp-lighting ceremony was held to mark the reopening on Thursday. “We turn 10 today and will have a celebration to mark the occasion, but all in good time,” co-owner Amrita Somaiya said. It will be a while before the store can resume its popular events calendar, which pre-pandemic ranged from book readings to discussions and sessions for children. But already on day one, the small ceremony at the rebuilt store was followed by warm conversations as frequent visitors arrived, masked and distanced, to reconnect with the books and each other. “This is not just a place of transactional interests. It guards a common point where people crisscross and where social, cultural and intellectual interactions happen, both by chance and design,” said architect, author and city researcher Kaiwan Mehta, who visited on Thursday. “Now that it is up and about, a vacuum has been filled.” A void has been filled for Somaiya too. “We had a series of setbacks in the last year,” Somaiya said at the reopening. “My father, who had supervised the interior design of the bookshop, was suffering. And a week before his death, I received a letter of hope from a 12-year-old girl named Dania Khan. She described how her love for books had blossomed in the corners of Kitab Khana and shared her wish to help us through crowdfunding. I was too full for words. I am so glad she lit the lamp for us this morning. And I thank everyone else who has been a pillar of support.” Virtual book discussions and events are planned, with details set to be shared via social media. “This is not only a place where we come to read, browse or buy books, it is also a centre for a community of readers and writers,” said poet Ranjit Hoskote, who also visited the bookstore on its reopening day. “The revival is a miraculous measure of continuity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-kitab-khana-opens-its-doors-to-booklovers-again-101615490615256.html
12-03-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: At 75, a renewed resolve to build New India together||An individual or a nation turning 75 often invites anxiety. What next? But, for us, India turning 75 is a moment for joy and celebration and indicates a fresh resolve towards nation building. A New India, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for in his address to the nation from the ramparts of Red Fort on August 15, 2017, should emerge on the 75th anniversary of Independence in 2022 from the joint strength of all. The next 75 weeks will lay a spread to celebrate Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav to mark 75 years of independence. The impressions of resistance against the British are still young and have failed to age in our nation’s memory. March 12 is a major milestone in India’s freedom struggle against British imperialism. The day captures Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent feat to achieve freedom through the Dandi March from Sabarmati Ashram in 1930. Nation’s destiny on the cusp of change The country’s destiny is on the cusp of a change. The emerging New India is eager to come out of the shackles of impediments that have held the nation hostage from realising human potential and development that leaders such as Gandhi had dreamt of. The celebrations should hold the spirit of the freedom movement, express gratitude to martyrs, and reflect the glory of Sanatan Bharat and Modern India, which glows under the twin lights of the spirituality of mystics and the contribution of our scientists. Now is the time for each one of us to take a pledge again on our duties towards the nation – that’s what Gandhi and Constitution-maker BR Ambedkar told men and women to vow for post-Independence. But ponder over what Gandhi told us that is relevant even now. “The true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, right will not be far to seek. If leaving duties unperformed we run after rights, they will escape us like a will-o’-the-wisp. The more we pursue them, the farther they fly.” Of valour, sacrifice and compassion History testifies that India has stood for Vasudev Kutumbhakam every time a crisis has stared at humanity. The latest insight into the country’s potential and determination was writ large in the compassionate way we distributed vaccines to other countries in our fight against Covid-19. Free India also managed a spirited economic recovery off-setting financial costs the British had imposed. Over less than seven decades since 1947, India’s per capita income has grown six times. Similarly, other economic parameters too jumped significantly. The culture of our country teaches us that one must visit a pilgrimage site before starting festivities. Today, my desire is fulfilled. I’ll be visiting the holy birthplace of Brigadier Rajendra Singh, an epitome of valour and sacrifice. If we’ve been able to save the soul of Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistani invaders, it’s due to the gallantry of Brigadier Singh and his soldiers at Uri in October 1947. The Women Self Defence Corps also protected the composite culture of J&K by putting their lives at stake. To commemorate 75 years of Independence, the tales of saviours such as Brigadier Rajendra Singh, Maqbool Sherwani, Subedar Major Swaran Singh and Ram Saran must reach the entire population of J&K. Sowing seeds of a new awakening In Mandukya Upanishad, a word, jagrit, is used to demonstrate awakening. The celebration will be a glory of our cultural heritage with the fragrance of talent pool, strength of our youth power and vision of scientists and technology experts. This occasion too will sow seeds of a new awakening for the people of J&K. One of the stalwarts of the freedom movement, Lokmanya Tilak, was way ahead of his times. Another visionary but less told facet to his personality was the support he lent to small entrepreneurs and industrialists to have businesses of their own, a great proponent of what we now call startups and atmanirbhar (self-reliant) India. Tilak took to crowd funding to establish paisa fund, a corpus for financing village enterprises and local factories. Borrowing from Tilak’s vision, J&K has created an ecosystem for startups. Within months, the administration has registered 69 startups to allow entrepreneurs to explore and realise business opportunities in different sectors. One of the fundamental laws of life is dignity to every human being. It’s the master key to bring peace and development. I seek the support of every citizen of J&K with the spirit of “jan bhageedari (people’s participation)” to usher in a new era of growth. Our seers, freedom fighters had taken similar steps to build the idea of New India. With this spirit, we need to work towards inclusive socio-economic development so that prosperity reaches all. That’s the J&K administration’s priority. We need to provide youngsters prospects for the future, invest more in education and skills and strengthen the position of women in society. During the next 75 weeks of celebration, we will demonstrate our shared commitment to the fundamental values of harmony, Sarv Dharm Sambhav, freedom, democracy and duties. J&K must strive to reach milestones set out by our founding fathers.

It also reiterated that safe houses should be constructed at district level.The high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan while dealing with a plea from Jalandhar couple observed that the non-acceptability of inter-caste marriage was a social problem which needs to be dealt at multifarious levels.“Inter-caste is not the only reason for non-acceptability of marriage, there are numerous other socio-economic reasons acting as hurdles for young couples in selecting life partner of their choice,” the bench said, adding that a large number of such petitions are being filed by the couples who performed marriage against the wishes of their parents and relatives. It was in 2014 that the high court had directed both the states and the Chandigarh administration to establish a ‘safe house’ in each district to help runaway couples.One of the ways to tackle the problem is that safe houses should be made available in each district and a website or an on-line module should be provided for such couples to raise their grievances without being physically present, it said. Arranging a 24x7 help desk at the tehsil level for filing of such representations by aggrieved persons or through someone can be of great help, the bench added, further stating that Legal Services Authorities have a strong network at the grassroots level and can help by setting up these help desk for such couples with telephone service and internet connectivity at the local level.The court, while fixing the next date of hearing for February 22, has asked both governments and the Chandigarh administration to come up with suggestions to devise a mechanism to help runaway couples.It added that a large number of pleas are being filed in high court due to which petitions involving really serious and imminent threats get mixed up with petitions filed in routine. Couples who apprehend threat have to travel all the way to this court for completing formalities for filing the plea, exposing them to threat, the bench said. It added that despite directions from the high court that the sessions courts would take up such pleas, cases continued coming directly to the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-for-help-desks-safe-houses-for-runaway-couples-101615490435216.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Surge in Covid-19 cases leaves more with anxiety, depression||With the recent spike in the number of Covid-19 cases reported in Mumbai, city psychiatrists and psychologists have noted a rise in the number of patients struggling with anxiety and depression. Since February 17, when the city’s daily Covid tally crossed the 700 cases mark, the number of reported cases has seen a sharp increase. The number of active Covid-19 cases at present has increased by almost 89% compared to the first week of February. Consequently, there have been rumours of another lockdown in the city, which is impacting the mental health of many with a history of ailments such as depression and anxiety. A 34-year-old Borivli resident, who runs a business and requested anonymity, said he has been getting anxiety attacks at the thought of another lockdown. Last year in March, his business came to a grinding halt when the lockdown was declared and only after relaxations were introduced in September 2020 did his work revive. “Every month, I have to pay ₹36,000 [as an equated monthly instalment] for a flat I bought for ₹56 lakh in 2018 since my business was flourishing then. Due to the lockdown, however, I sustained a loss of ₹15 lakh. Now, finally when my business was beginning to catch up again, the fear of another lockdown keeps me awake at night. I can’t sleep and due to the anxiety, I feel nauseous and dizzy,” he said, adding that he will be seeking professional help from a psychotherapist for his anxiety. City psychiatrists say many patients are expressing fear of contracting Covid-19. “When the pandemic curve flattened, there was a belief that it was over. But as cases are increasing again, the anxiety level is increasing. Many fear losing their jobs or getting isolated again. In fact, recovered patients are getting scared of reinfection,” said psychiatrist Dr Sagar Mundada. With some relaxation in lockdown rules and the resumption of local train services, many offices and businesses have opened up in Mumbai. “Many may be facing ‘travel anxiety’ triggered by transit during this pandemic. This happens when people overestimate the worst-case scenarios, anticipating the worst incident may happen with them or their family. The only way to look over anxiety is to distinguish between real risk and over-estimated catastrophising,” said Dr Sahir Jamati, consultant psychologist and psychotherapist, Masina Hospital. Doctors recommend figuring out coping strategies and being careful. “I suggest my patients to follow the TOWN policy — travel only when needed. They should also listen to music or read funny and humorous books during their commute. They need to accept the current situation because it won’t go away so fast. There is nothing they can do other than taking precautionary measures,” said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-surge-in-covid-19-cases-leaves-more-with-anxiety-depression-101615490255241.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||₹22K-crore yet to be recovered from toll on Mumbai-Pune Eway: MSRDC to Bombay HC||In response to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging extension of toll collection on Mumbai-Pune Expressway till April 2030, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has disputed calculations by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that the entire capital outlay of the expressway was recovered by 2019.MSRDC has, in its affidavit, stated that the CAG audit was faulty as it did not consider various aspects such as traffic flow in initial years, fluctuation in interest and value of money at the time when the first contract was awarded in 2004, and hence the cash flow and revenue collection figures in the CAG audit report till 2019 are not accurate and cannot be relied upon. It further said that while the cost of the project was in excess of ₹4,000 crore in 2004, the corporation had received an upfront amount of ₹918 crore only. After taking into consideration the internal rate of return at 16%, the total amount recoverable in 2021 was ₹22,370 crore and hence the extension of contract was justified and the PIL should be dismissed. The PIL has alleged that as the entire capital outlay of the project has been recovered as per the CAG, further extension granted to the contractor to collect toll will not only result in a burden on commuters but also rob the state exchequer of revenue as the contractor will make illegal gains. The affidavit filed by Kamlakar Phand, chief general manager, MSRDC, stated that the PIL is not bona fide and is motivated and a publicity-seeking proceeding. Phand said as the PIL raises technical and scientific issues which involve experts, the court should not involve itself in it unless there is an allegation of mala fide, which is absent in the case. Refuting the claims of the petitioner Pravin Wategaonkar, MSRDC said the allegations are based on the CAG report which is erroneous. The affidavit states that the allegation in the PIL that the contract was granted for a mere ₹918 crore while the CAG report held that the cash flow could be up to ₹3,946 crore, thus recovering the entire capital outlay of the project, were misconceived. It further states that the CAG report estimations were based on revenues apart from toll collection in the form of income from real estate, land leased, etc. However, as the latter did not materialise, the revenue collected by the contractor in the form of toll over a 15-year period sufficed to fulfil his contract agreement only and there was no recovery of capital outlay. In light of these submissions, the affidavit states that taking into consideration the net present value and cash flow, an amount of ₹22,370 crore was yet to be recovered. In view of this, MSRDC was justified in extending the contract in 2020 for a period of 10.2 years, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/22kcrore-yet-to-be-recovered-from-toll-on-mumbai-pune-eway-msrdc-to-bombay-hc-101615490015198.html
12-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab sees 20% dip in child sex abuse cases in three yrs||Punjab has seen a drop of 20% in cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, in three years. The number of cases has decreased to 389 in 2019 from 489 in 2017, according to data shared by the Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation (KSCF) in its report titled ‘Status of Pocso Cases in India’ on Thursday. There were 392 victims in the cases registered under the Act in 2019 as against 493 in 2017. The state witnessed the decrease during the period in which the total number of Pocso cases in the country increased from 32,608 cases in 2017 to 39,827(up 22%) in 2018 and further to 47,335 in 2019 (up 19%).Cases registered under Pocso Act constituted 32% of the total crimes committed against children in 2019 and Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra registered the highest number of cases under the law. However, the state’s conviction rate in such cases of 36% was only slightly better than the national figure of 34% in 2019. The non-governmental organisation’s report said that as per the Act, trials in such cases should be completed within a year but over 1.6 lakh cases of sexual abuse of children were pending trial in the courts across the country. “Data presented by the NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) in its ‘Crime in India’ report 2017-2019 shows that even though in terms of absolute numbers, the cases in which has been completed is increasing, yet the percentage of trials completed to the total cases for trials remains constant at 10%. By the end of 2019, the cases pending trial stood at 89% of the total cases for trial,” it said, stressing the need for more fast-track courts. Last month, the Punjab government decided to set up nine more fast-track courts under the Pocso Act and constitute sexual assault response teams in all 27 police districts of the state to deal with such cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sees-20-dip-in-child-sex-abuse-cases-in-three-yrs-101615489777029.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 case positivity rate on rise in Mumbai; daily rate stands at 7.39%||With the city reporting more than 1,000 new cases of Covid-19 daily of late, the single-day positivity rate has increased from 3-4% in February to 5-7% in the last 10 days. The daily positivity rate on Thursday was 7.39%. Overall, 3.5 million tests have been conducted in Mumbai and the positivity rate is 9.64%. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said the spike in cases is due mostly to increased testing and citizens not following Covid protocol. On Thursday, the city reported 1,509 new cases of Covid-19, taking the tally to 338,643, and four deaths. The death toll stands at 11,519, with fatality rate of 3.40%. There are 10,563 active cases and the city’s recovery rate is 93.21%. The highest growth rates in the city are in Mulund, Andheri (West), Vile Parle, Bandra, Khar, Dadar and Wadala. While Mumbai’s average growth rate is 0.34%, these neighbourhoods have growth rates between 0.51% and 0.40%. According to BMC, on March 9, Mumbai’s daily positivity rate was 7.12%, which is significantly higher than the February rates. On February 28, the positivity rate was 5.19%. It was 4.87% on February 19 and 3.33% on February 10. The number of tests conducted daily in Mumbai now ranges between 18,000 and 23,000. In January and February, the range was between 12,000 and 17,000 tests. BMC said 90% of the detected cases are from high-rise buildings. On March 10, there were 228 sealed buildings and 2,815 sealed floors in the city followed by 27 containment zones. On February 26, there were 127 sealed buildings, 1,849 sealed floors and 12 containment zones. Assistant municipal commissioner of Mulund, Kishore Gandhi said, “Currently, there is no plan to have any mini lockdown or night curfew, but we are implementing the existing restrictions strictly.” Mulund’s growth rate is the highest in Mumbai. BMC officials said that rather than the resumption of local trains, the spike in cases is due to people attending large gatherings and not following Covid-19 norms. “Though Nagpur — which will go under one week of lockdown from Monday — is reporting cases equal to that of Mumbai, there is an assumption that Mumbai’s situation might not be like the September peak. The sero prevalence level of those residing in Mumbai is higher compared to those in Nagpur or other rural belts of the city where cases are increasing,” said a BMC official. On Tuesday, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told HT that no lockdown or micro-containment zones were expected in the city. However, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray hinted at a lockdown on Thursday when he said, “In a few days, we may have to lockdown some places. We may have to start from scratch, but still the situation has not gone out of control.” Experts say lockdown might not be the solution since economic activities need to resume. “We might announce a lockdown,” said city physician Dr Siddarth Paliwal, “but this will come with a cost if we do not speed up the process of vaccination.” On Monday, the state Covid-19 task force had suggested allowing door-to-door vaccination for the elderly to increase the number of people vaccinated daily. BMC has authorised private vaccination centres to operate round the clock. On Thursday, 29,264 people were vaccinated at 72 centres, of which 29,262 were senior citizens and 4,004 were above the age of 45 years with comorbidities. Overall, 190,294 senior citizens and 23,044 people above 45 years with comorbidities have been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-case-positivity-rate-on-rise-in-mumbai-daily-rate-stands-at-739-101615489775427.html

12-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt faces flak over delay in MPSC exams||The Maharashtra government on Thursday received flak from aspirants over Maharashtra Public Service Commission’s (MPSC) decision to postpone preliminary examinations for recruitment, which was scheduled on March 14. Aspirants staged demonstrations at several places in the state including Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Sangli, and Amravati among others. They have demanded that the exams be held on the same day.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of senior officials and directed them to declare the fresh dates on Friday. He assured aspirants that the exams will be conducted within a week and expressed regret over the inconvenience. He also requested people not to get provoked, without naming any political party. Thackeray also assured that the no aspirant would be affected due to age bar norms owing to the delay in holding the examinations.In Pune, the agitation by the aspirants was led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Gopichand Padalkar, who was later detained by the police for refusing to leave the venue. Initially, the exams were scheduled in April 2020 but have been delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak and were postponed four times since then, aspirants said. Recruitment for various posts in the state government is held through MPSC, and youths from all over the state participate in thousands every year.The commission took the decision to postpone the exams further considering the recent spike in Covid-19 cases. It has also received a communication from the state relief and rehabilitation department suggesting postponement of exams.On Wednesday, state relief and rehabilitation department issued a letter stating, “It would be inappropriate to hold MPSC exams in the backdrop of restrictions imposed as precautionary measures to arrest the spread of coronavirus by local administrations in different districts and cities, hence exams should be deferred.”MPSC in its order dated Thursday cited instructions from the relief and rehabilitation department and stated, “In the view of the decision taken by the state government, the exams have been postponed. The revised schedule for the examinations will be released later.” “I have directed the chief secretary (Sitaram Kunte) and concerned MPSC officials to declare a date by tomorrow and hold exams within a week. Continue your studies and I promise that the exams will be held in a week. It is being postponed only because of the rise in Covid-19 cases,” Thackeray said in his address to the state through Facebook live on Thursday evening.He added, “I have directed to assign officials and employees, who have either tested negative for Covid-19 or been vaccinated, to conduct exams. I will not allow anyone to play with the sentiments and health of the students. I can also assure that no student is going to be affected by the age bar norm in case of delay in holding the exams.” He said that the authorities are imposing certain restrictions in containment zones where cases are coming in big numbers, and they may have to prepare for alternatives in case an examination centre is located in a containment zone.Taking a veiled dig at the opposition, the CM said, “Do not get provoked. Do not allow them to use your shoulder for targeting the government.”Leaders from across political parties have opposed the move. State Congress chief Nana Patole said the state should reconsider its decision. “Since the past one year, MPSC exams could not be held. There is strong discontent among students over the sudden move, and thus the state government should reconsider its decision,” he said. Patole also called the CM and requested him for reconsideration.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator Rohit Pawar said the exams should be held by following Covid-appropriate norms. “Nothing should be stopped due to Covid-19 and we have to keep moving by adopting precautionary measures. I am sure people will also cooperate in this. Accordingly, MPSC exams must be held. I request CM Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar to look into it,” Pawar tweeted.“Postponing the exams all of a sudden is wrong. If everything is allowed by following Covid-appropriate behaviour, then why not hold exams? The postponement of exams will affect many students. I express my displeasure towards the decision,” tweeted Pankaja Munde, national secretary of BJP and former women and child development minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-faces-flak-over-delay-in-mpsc-exams-101615489475243.html
12-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid death rate high in those with kidney ailments, shows study||A study conducted by SevenHills Hospital found that between April and July 2020, the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) was significantly higher than that of the other Covid-positive patients. Patients above 60 years of age who were on regular dialysis were the most vulnerable to the infection due to their low immunity. When the pandemic started in March 2020, most dialysis centres shut down due to the possible risk of spreading the infection. As HT has reported earlier, this led to chaos among CKD patients, particularly those who were Covid-positive and needed regular dialysis. Soon after, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started dialysis facilities for Covid patients at the civic-run SevenHills Hospital. Between April and July 2020, the hospital saw around 70 Covid-positive patients receive dialysis treatment daily. During this period, the hospital conducted a study on 310 co-infected patients, which revealed the recovery rate was 76.1% among patients with CKD and the mortality rate was 23.87%. Titled “A cross-sectional study to assess impact of Covid-19 infections amongst patients with chronic kidney diseases”, the study was published in the International Journal of Community Medicines and Public Health in February. In April, the mortality rate was 6.5% and in July it was 5.5%The mortality rate of the surveyed patients depended on three basic factors: the age of the patient; the stage of infection spread; and frequency of dialysis. “In comparison to the general public, the mortality rate was higher among CKD patients. We have noticed that the death rate was the highest among patients above 60 years, due to their underlying health issues. Many elderly patients had comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension which further compromised their immunity,” said Dr Harshalkumar Mahajan, assistant professor, community medicines, at Seven Hills Hospital. Dr Mahajan was part of the study. The study found that more patients who were diagnosed late succumbed to the infection than those who received treatment early. “In our study, we found that the mortality rate among severely infected patients was 22.3%, which was the highest. We haven’t recorded death among mildly symptomatic patients during the study. This reflects on the importance of early diagnosis of patients with kidney ailments whose immunity is already compromised,” said Dr Smitha S Chavhan, principal researcher and additional dean of the hospital. Also, the study revealed that the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, remains longer in the bodies of those aged above 60 years. According to BMC’s data, more than 2,300 patients with CKD have contracted Covid-19 in the city since March 2020. Doctors said the mortality rate among such patients has improved since the onset of the pandemic. “When the pandemic started, the availability of dialysis centres for such patients were limited. Many faced problems commuting in the lockdown. But now, the situation has improved which has also helped to improve the mortality rate,” said Dr Chavhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-death-rate-high-in-those-with-kidney-ailments-shows-study-101615489295503.html

12-03-2021||Kolkata||Doctors unsure on Mamata Banerjee's release from hospital||The six-member medical board treating West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is yet to decide as to when the TMC supremo would be released from the SSKM hospital where she is admitted with an ankle injury following an alleged attack on her during the election campaign in Nandigram on Wednesday.“Banerjee was stable. She has a bony injury in her left ankle and has been plastered. She has a frontal headache. Further investigation has been prescribed. Her sodium level is low,” hospital authorities said in a medical bulletin.Doctors said during the day that her condition would be examined again on Friday before taking the treatment forward."We are going for further radiological investigations such as X-Ray and CT Scan. The same treatment, which was started yesterday, is going on. In addition, she would be given medicines for low sodium level," said hospital authorities.Meanwhile, a senior TMC leader said that Banerjee’s campaign schedule over the weekend, wherein she was supposed to campaign in Purulia and Bankura, has been postponed.On March 15, 16 and 17 she is likely to camp in the districts of Jhargram, West Midnapore and East Midnapore. There could be some changes to the plan, a leader said.“I hope to return to the field in the next two to three days. But the injury may be there. I will manage. I won’t drop a single meeting. Maybe I would have to take the help of a wheelchair for a few days. I want your support," Banerjee said earlier in the day.“We want her to return to the field at the earliest. Else against whom we would score the goal? All her party leaders have shifted to the BJP. Only she and her nephew are left,” said Dilip Ghosh, state BJP president."The CM is responding to treatment and her general condition has improved. She still has pain and is facing some problems in her left ankle for which she is being treated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, X-Ray of the forearm and shoulder and CT Scan of the thorax are within acceptable limits. There were some degenerative changes spotted in the left knee," the medical board said late on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/doctors-unsure-on-mamata-banerjee-s-release-from-hospital-101615488196739.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||‘Warning signs for another spike’: Caution, vaccines key, say experts||The Covid-19 outbreak in Delhi may now be at a crucial stage when urgent steps could help fend off a full-fledged new wave of infections, experts have said, underscoring the need for people to stay cautious and for the vaccination drive to be accelerated.The city added 409 new cases, according to the state health bulletin on Thursday, the highest since January 9. The current seven day average positivity rate of 0.50% is an increase over the 0.37% recorded the week before and 0.28% recorded the week before thatClick here for full Covid-19 coverage“These are the warning signs for another surge in the number of infections in Delhi; there is no doubt about that. This is the natural cycle of any virus, add to that the complacency on part of the people in following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour since the decline in the number of cases over the last three months,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Delhi has experienced three distinct wave of infections, with the last peaking around Diwali in the first half of November last year. “The situation is exactly like it was during Diwali when people were out and about, leading to a lot of asymptomatic spread of the infection. Delhi is currently a ticking time bomb,” Khilnani added.The pulmonologist added that there are also concerns that people who were infected previously may now be at risk since immunity is believed to wane after several months. “One, there are still questions about the life span of the immunity against the infection – is it three months? Five? Seven? Nobody can say for sure. Second, the latest seroprevalence in Delhi was found to be 56%, which means true herd immunity – of at least 70% population being protected against the infection – hasn’t happened yet,” he said.Additionally, the city could face a threat from mutated variants that could be more infective or cheat previous immunity.The Union government on Thursday said Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) was emerging as an area of concern, in addition to Maharashtra. “We are very worried about Maharashtra. We are reaching a stage where all those measures (lockdown) are being brought back; it is a matter of serious concern. A word of caution for Delhi and neighbourhood as well. There is a rise in positivity rate in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, and Ghaziabad. Be careful and be watchful. We still have a huge proportion of vulnerable population,” said VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog.Officials said they are working on aggressive contact tracing and testing. “Strong surveillance, testing of suspects, identifying cases, educating people for covid appropriate behaviour, vaccination of identified and vulnerable group as per guidelines is being done with greater intensity. District health teams are working hard to trace the contacts,” a Delhi government spokesperson said.Revenue officials said all district magistrates have directed their health teams to continue with aggressive testing. A second revenue official, who asked not to be named, said focus is also being directed on improving turnout at vaccination centres.Although number of tests conducted in Delhi has increased over the last one week, it is still not near capacity. On average, nearly 65,600 tests were done each day during the last seven days in comparison to 61,377 the week before. In mid-December – just after the November surge – there were over 82,000 tests being done a day.“The government should ramp up testing to capacity now as that will help us in quickly identifying more people with the infection. If they are isolated and all their contacts are traced and tested, then we can contain the spread of the infection. I believe that there is a need to trace as many as 15 to 20 contacts for each positive case, who have to be tested. The government also has to ensure that the quarantine and isolation are actually followed,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Experts also called for faster pace of vaccination as well as vaccinating everyone over the age of 18 in regions witnessing a surge in infections.“When there is a fire somewhere, should we throw all the water we have at it or distribute it equally. What are the vaccines for? The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait for it,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Dr Khilnani said, “The solution to Covid-19 remains vaccination along with masking social distancing and other Covid-19 norms. There is no dearth of vaccine and although the vaccination drive is picking up it is not commensurate with the Indian population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/warning-signs-for-another-spike-caution-vaccines-key-say-experts-101615487866009.html

Thackeray’s address was chiefly regarding the Maharashtra State Public Commission examination and to announce why it has been postponed by a few days.Thackeray said that Maharashtra where the daily numbers had come down to around 2,000 have again increased to 12,000-13,000. The transmission in increasing in cities and in the rural areas, he said. “Currently, Covid cases are increasing at several places. Looking at this increase, we will have to announce some containment zones. We are at the threshold of a lockdown. We can still avoid a lockdown. The authorities have been instructed to coordinate with the state government before announcing a lockdown in a city, taluka or a district,” the CM said in his address.Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, Thackeray said that a decision on lockdown or strict restrictions will be announced in a couple of days. “In a few days, lockdown will have to be imposed at some places. I again appeal to people to avoid stepping out of home without need, wear masks in public places, keep sanitising hands, keep physical distance. We might have to start from scratch again [in combating Covid] but so far, the situation has not gone out of control… Looking at the situation, a strict lockdown will need to be imposed in some places. We will take a decision in the next two days and the lockdown will be imposed wherever required,” Thackeray told reporters after he took his first vaccine shot.Thackeray, along with his wife Rashmi and her mother Meenatai Patankar got their first dose of Covaxin at city’s JJ Hospital.

These vendors or milkmen are landless or own up to two acre of cultivable land, with supplying milk as their main income source. Their land was acquired in the early 1980s for building the largest cantonment in the country. Most of them took to milk vending since 1985. These vendors collected milk from dozens of small dairy farmers and supplied nearly 10,000 litres per day to the households and other establishments in the local army area. This is now not happening. Narpat Singh of Bhucho Khurd was supplying nearly 200 litres every day, but had been out of business for the past year. His monthly earning was close to ₹50,000 but now he is unable to pay his equal monthly instalments for a car, house and contribution to the informal recurring investment sector.“Milk vendors were barred from entering the cantonment in the last week of March last year after the lockdown was imposed. Now, all other professions and sectors have resumed work, we are still not allowed to restart work with cantonment. This has been our only source of income for over three decades,” he said.Cantonment Branch Milk Vendors’ Union president Buta Singh said milk vending was the main occupation of members and the authorities should revoke the ban on their entry. Singh added, “The ban has affected nearly 1,500 families from whom we buy, having one or two cattle, who are struggling even to give feed to animals due to the disrupted chain of supply.” “Cantonment staff says milk vendors cannot enter inside, but other civilians are allowed to enter to supply packaged milk. We are dependent upon the army area and our members are ready to strictly follow all medical protocols while resuming work,” said Singh, of Bibiwala village.For Sandeep Singh, 31, of Bhagu village, the ongoing restrictions have made him sell six cattle over the past few months. Singh said he was now worried about paying school fee to his two children.“Besides maintaining 16 cattle with my elder brother, I was collecting more than 125 litre milk daily from other farmers. Like others, I have to sell the cattle as the profit margin by working with organised dairy sector is uneconomical. Small dairies in Bathinda face irregular demand,” he added.Army officials say vendors may have to wait until the pandemic eases. “Army authorities have a compassionate view of milk vendors’ difficulties, but the defence forces have strict instructions of following covid-19 guidelines,” said a functionary at the cantonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bathinda-cantt-s-covid-19-vigil-has-milk-vendors-cry-for-relief-to-ply-trade-101615487795501.html
12-03-2021||Kolkata||Three ‘assaults’ that marked Mamata Banerjee’s rise through street politics||Whether it was the street fight against the ruling Marxists as a youth Congress leader in the 1980s and 1990s or the tirade against former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s industrial policies in her avatar as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, allegations of physical assault against her adversaries have marked West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s career.On August 16, 1990, when Banerjee was about to lead a youth Congress agitation at Hazra in south Kolkata, Bengal was rocked by the news of an assault on her by Lalu Alam, a CPI(M) youth wing worker. Images of Banerjee, with her head wrapped in bandage, and reports suggesting how the injuries might have crippled or killed her, shot the sale of newspapers.Banerjee, who had made news in 1984 by defeating CPI(M) veteran Somnath Chatterjee in the Jadavpur Lok Sabha election, shot in national politics as a member of Rajiv Gandhi’s team of young leaders.Nineteen years after that incident, Alam was acquitted by the court in 2019.Also read: Mamata Banerjee still has symptoms related to bony injuries, says doctorBanerjee recounts the alleged assault at political rallies even today. “They (BJP) keep parroting the words didi and bhatija (nephew). I feel bad when I see Abhishek facing this because of me. He was a child when he saw me getting injured in that attack. After growing up he wanted to join politics,” Banerjee said at a rally on February 18, countering Union home minister Amit Shah, who targeted her and Abhishek Banerjee at a BJP rally in South 24 Parganas district the same day.In October 1998, news of another alleged assault spread faster than wildfire.A decree from a Kolkata court had empowered the police to evict around 70 families of declared squatters from Bedi Bhawan, an expensive piece of land covered by a dilapidated property at Golpark in south Kolkata. When a huge police contingent reached the spot, they found Banerjee and her supporters. When her demand, that the court order be discussed with the residents, was not met, she entered into an altercation with the officers. As mercury rose, Banerjee alleged that the police assaulted her. She also alleged that someone had bitten her and torn her saree.Within an hour, people even in remote parts of Bengal heard rumours that she had been killed in a skirmish with the police. Railway tracks and national highways were blocked for hours. In the ransacking that took place, workers of the BJP, which was then an ally of the TMC, were also arrested.The third incident, which left a scar on the Bengal assembly, took place on November 30, 2006.Banerjee, then an MP, was on her way from Kolkata to Singur in Hooghly district to protest the Left Front government’s decision to hand over 990 acres of farmland to Tata Motors when she was allegedly stopped by the police on the highway. She returned to Kolkata and headed straight for the assembly house.Banerjee alleged before TMC lawmakers that she had been assaulted by some policemen. The MLAs vandalized furniture at random places. TMC workers tried to block traffic and shut down shops. The party called a 12-hour bandh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/three-assaults-that-marked-mamata-banerjee-s-rise-through-street-politics-101615486797210.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||Covid spike raises fears of fresh wave in Delhi||The Capital on Thursday reported 409 new infections of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the highest single-day increase in cases in over two months, or since January 9, prompting experts to warn that yet another wave of the viral disease appears to be on the horizon in the city.Health experts expressed alarm over the resurgence of infections at a time when most curbs on social movement in the city have been lifted, and when people have let their guards down and stopped adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour (including attending weddings and gatherings), despite a vast majority remaining vulnerable to the disease. They also warned about the drop in the testing rate and said the current situation in the Capital appeared akin to what happened in Mumbai and Maharashtra not too long ago – about two weeks ago, the western state saw a rise in cases, and is now in the midst of a full-blown Covid-19 wave.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe seven-day average of daily cases, also known as the case trajectory, in the Capital touched 322 on Thursday — it had dropped to 125 for the week ending February 12, which was the lowest in eight months. This number has now been rising for 17 days in a row, something that last happened in mid-November last year, before the city brought its third wave of infections under control.With Thursday’s addition, the total number infections in Delhi stands at 642,439, while three new deaths pushed the death toll to 10,934, according to the Delhi’s government’s Covid-19 bulletin.At the Union health ministry’s Covid-19 briefing on Thursday, NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul singled out Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) and cautioned authorities about letting down their guard. He said that Delhi, along with Gurugram, Faridabad and to an extent Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad, is seeing a rise in positivity rate.“We still have a huge population at risk of this virus. This pandemic is not yet over. Be vigilant… Today, using the force of vaccination, we are in a position to give a stronger fight (to the pandemic). We plead again, do not lower your guard and please embrace the vaccines that are available,” Paul said.On average, 0.51% of all samples tested in Delhi in the past week have come back positive for Covid-19 (Thursday’s positivity rate was 0.59%). While this number is low in absolute terms (the World Health Organization recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5%), the worrying trend is that is it again rising. The average positivity rate in the city had touched the lowest ever (0.21%) for the week ending February 10.Testing, meanwhile, has dropped more than 20% from peak levels, data shows. In the past week, 65,599 samples have been tested every day in the city on average. This is despite Delhi government exhibiting that its testing capacity is much higher – at its peak, the city tested 83,151 a day for the week ending December 23, 2020.Experts warned that warning signs like the rising positivity rate, drop in testing, and the complacency among people regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour indicates that a surge of infections may be on the horizon. They said the government needs to quickly expand the qualifying range for vaccinations before it is too late.Also Read | Delhi: More than 29,000 people received Covid-19 vaccine doses on Thursday“When there is a fire somewhere, should we throw all the water we have at it or distribute it equally. What are the vaccines for? The government should vaccinate everyone over the age of 18 in the six states that have started seeing an increase in the number of cases. All the vaccines from other states should be diverted; the others can wait,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.“These are the warning signs for another surge in the number of infections in Delhi; there is no doubt about that... The euphoria of having low number of cases in Delhi was short-lived because people have stopped following Covid-19 norms such as social distancing and masking. The antibody levels against Covid-19 wane off after about three months; but we still do not know how long does the protection against the disease last. And, a seroprevalence of 56% also means that there is still a large susceptible population... The situation is exactly like it was during Diwali when people were out and about attending weddings and gatherings, leading to a lot of asymptomatic spread of the virus,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“There is always a risk of surge in cases in Delhi, we can clearly see this in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as closer home like Maharashtra — all these regions have had to go back into lockdowns again,” Khilnani added.Others added that increasing testing remains one of the only sure-shot ways to quickly isolate cases and stop transmission of the virus. “The government should ramp up testing to capacity now as that will help us in quickly identifying more people with the infection. If they are isolated and all their contacts are traced and tested, only then can we contain the spread of the infection. I believe that there is a need to trace and test as many as 15 to 20 contacts for each positive case,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-spike-raises-fears-of-fresh-wave-in-delhi-101615484764468.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||202 prisoners out on emergency parole fail to surrender, declared fugitives||Of the 1,184 prisoners who were released last year on “emergency parole” to contain the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi jails, at least 202 prisoners have not surrendered even after the parole period has ended, said prison officers aware of the development. The absconding prisoners have now been declared “fugitives” and Delhi Police teams across the city are looking for them.In the past two weeks, police have arrested five such persons for street crimes such as robbery, attempted murder, snatching and carrying illegal arms. A senior Delhi Police officer, who did not wish to be named, said several prisoners who were out on parole had returned to crime.As one of the first measures to decongest jails and ensure social distancing at the start of the pandemic, these 1,000-odd prisoners were released on “emergency parole” in April last year. The three jails of Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini collectively hold over 18,000 prisoners, well above their sanctioned strength and a high-powered committee had stressed upon the need to decongest prison complexes.With Covid cases abating in Delhi, the out-on-parole prisoners were told to start surrendering from February 6, in small batches of 10 or 20. The surrender process ended on March 6 and the prison department checked the records to find at least 202 prisoners missing.On March 3, absconding prisoner Vinod Yadav --- he has more than 31 cases of theft, robbery, and snatching against him -- who was out on parole since October 14, was arrested in a robbery case. Police said while on parole, Yadav had committed at least nine instances of snatching. The same afternoon, another prisoner, Kanwaljeet Singh, was arrested with illegal weapons. Three days before that, fugitive Javed (identified by a single name in police records) was arrested for snatching.Javed, who has 10 cases against him, was released on parole in April 2020 but had failed to surrender last month.A mid-level prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “In most cases, we found that their cellphones were switched off or the number they gave for the records is no longer active. In other cases, someone would answer the phone and quickly tell us that we dialled the wrong number. We have sent a message to the local police stations about such persons.”Prison officers said they have informed police stations from where the prisoners, now fugitives, were first arrested and brought to prison. Director-general, prisons, Sandeep Goel said, “There are around 200 such prisoners who did not surrender. As of now, we have informed police stations, but we will also send a consolidated list to the Delhi Police headquarters. Some prisoners may have genuine reasons for not surrendering. We will look at each case on its merits.”The punishment for not surrendering after parole includes cancellation of furlough or parole for the next one to three years, depending on the gravity of their offence.Among those who had failed to surrender and was arrested later was Shamshad, sentenced to life imprisonment in the infamous 2010 Dhaula Kuan gang rape case of a woman. Shamshad was released on parole on April 20, 2020. He had to surrender on February 20, 2021. On February 23, when he was arrested, he had been a fugitive for three days, like the 202 others who are now on the run. Delhi Police has said Shamshad, while on parole, had committed at least 12 break-ins at ATM kiosks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/202-prisoners-out-on-emergency-parole-fail-to-surrender-declared-fugitives-101615484796231.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||Doorstep delivery of ration in Delhi likely from March 25||Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme is likely to be launched on March 25 by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, senior officials said on Thursday. The scheme, named Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana, will be first rolled out in the Seemapuri area of north-east Delhi’s Shahdara district.Delhi food and supplies minister Imran Hussain said the service will first be rolled out in 100 households in Seemapuri and then extended to other areas across the city from April 1.On January 25, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the scheme will be operational by March. The project was cleared by the Delhi Cabinet in March 2018 but could not be rolled out because of several administrative issues, some of which even led to stand-offs between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and officials in charge of the department.The scheme, which will be an optional service, can potentially make monthly ration more accessible to 1.75 million households in the capital, exempting families from long queues at fair price shops.“The food and supplies department is currently identifying the first 100 households in Seemapuri zone where ration will be home delivered. These 100 households will be covered in a week’s time after which, from April 1 the scheme will be expanded to cover more areas such as New Delhi and Ballimaran (old Delhi) to name a few. Additional zones will be included on a weekly basis,” a senior official from the department said.On February 20, the Delhi government notified a policy document prescribing the modalities of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme.“The beneficiaries of the existing TPDS [targeted public distribution system] in Delhi will be asked whether they want to enrol under the scheme or continue getting their ration from the Fair Price shops. Those who will not opt for the scheme shall continue to get their ration as per the existing mechanism and price. Beneficiaries will be able allowed to change their mode of getting ration in the beginning of every financial year,” read the notified document, which HT has seen.It further said foodgrains will be collected from food corporation godowns by agencies empanelled by the government and sent to mills where grains such as wheat will be processed into flour and packed. Similarly, there will be units for the cleaning and packing of rice too. The packets will be delivered to fair price shops and from thereon to residences of beneficiaries who opt for the scheme.The beneficiaries will have to register the receipt of the ration with their fingerprints on the biometric-based electronic point-of-sales (e-POS) machines, which representatives of the agencies entrusted with doorstep delivery will carry. The entire operation will be monitored from the godown stage to the doorstep through CCTV cameras, GPS-fitted vehicles, e-POS logs, etc, said the document.Delhi has 1.75 million ration cardholders, which translates to 7.16 million beneficiaries, according to authorities. Of the total ration card holders, 1.51 million are covered under the priority household category of the National Food Security Act, 2013, while 0.17 million are covered under the priority state household category, and the remaining 0.07 million come under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, show government records.While those under the first two categories are entitled to 5kg of foodgrains a month, those under the third category are entitled to 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar every month. These items are distributed to them from 2,010 fair price shops that are currently functional across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doorstep-delivery-of-ration-in-delhi-likely-from-march-25-101615484794343.html
12-03-2021||Delhi||Teachers of 12 DU colleges start indefinite university shutdown in DU||Teachers of Delhi University on Thursday started an indefinite “university shutdown”, suspending classes in some colleges and refraining from taking up administrative work in some others, to protest against the delayed salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff at 12 government-funded colleges.Though several principals said that the impact of the strike was minimal due to Thursday being a restricted holiday (due to Mahashivratri), members of the staff association of various colleges deemed it a success.The 12 fully state-funded colleges in DU have been at loggerheads with the Delhi government since 2019 over the formation of governing bodies and the delay in release of grants. The Delhi government had last year alleged that a special audit sanctioned by them had revealed financial irregularities in these colleges, indicating a “big fraud” and “ghost appointments”.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “Many teachers took online classes today. Since today was a restricted holiday (under which teachers have the choice to take the leave or not), it will be tough to gauge the impact of the shutdown. We will only know in the coming days. However, teaching and non-teaching staff go on a strike , academic activities will be hampered.”Referring to the final exams slated to begin next week for first-year undergraduate students, Khanna said, “Since the exams will be held online, the strike is likely to have a minimal impact on them. We will be providing options for offline exams and only a handful of students are expected to appear in person for them. The principal and a few staff members can conduct those exams if needed.”Kumar Rahul, president of the staff association at Ramjas College, however, said that the strike had been successful. “The strike was largely successful. Since classes are still taking place in online mode, it is difficult to ascertain if people actually refrain or take online classes. When we had given the call for a strike, we received positive responses from our group. Teachers also called us and asked if they could take classes after 5pm, after their official working hours so that students do not suffer.”Sujit Kumar, executive member of staff association of the state government-funded Bhim Rao Ambedkar College and Commerce teacher said that their college had observed the strike. “We have to submit marks of practicals or internal assessments by March 13. We did not do so today because of the strike. How long can we work without a salary?” he said.A Delhi government spokesperson said the situation implies “bad financial management” by college authorities who had not paid salaries despite release of grants.“The non-submission of utilisation certificates of previous instalments by the colleges has delayed the release of final instalment by the Delhi government..It seems as if there is an attempt to hide financial irregularities by not submitting utilisation certificates,” the official said, adding that they would launch a probe into the ‘financial mismanagement’.Governing body members of Deen Dayal Upadhyay College cry scamA government-appointed governing body (GB) member of Deen Dayal Upadhyay College on Thursday alleged financial mismanagement of funds by college officials, which has led to pending wages for the staff. The 10-member governing body of the college comprises people nominated both by the university and the Delhi government and take important decisions, like appointment of staff members.GB member Anil Chaudhury on Thursday said that the Delhi government has cleared the third instalment dues for the college in December 2020 but the college has not paid the salaries of teachers and others for the last several months. He said that the college has funds to the tune of ₹6.48 crore with it“As per our knowledge, the government of Delhi has sanctioned the third instalment of grant-in-aid to the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, which amounts to Rs.1.95 crore, under the salary head and ₹0.45 crore under the other salary head. However, the college has failed to submit any utilisation certificate for the same. This non-submission of the utilisation certificate has caused a delay in the Delhi government releasing the fourth installment for the college,” said Chaudhary.Reacting to the allegations, college principal Hem Chand Jain said, “The government released ₹1.9 crore as against salary requirement of ₹10 crore. The allegations levied by them are baseless. ₹6 crore that they are talking about is the student security fund which is refundable. The other funds stated by them are hostel fund and college development fund which cannot be used for other purposes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-of-12-du-colleges-start-indefinite-university-shutdown-in-du-101615484734097.html

The IMD has predicted spells of light rain on Friday across parts of Delhi and NCR.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “We are expecting light rain in the morning on account of a western disturbance. The wind speed is also likely to pick up.”The city’s air quality entered the poor zone on Thursday, recording an air quality index (AQI) reading of 268 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, a rise from Wednesday’s AQI reading of 122 (moderate).Experts attributed the deterioration to calm surface wind conditions on Thursday.The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 156.52 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Thursday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. At the official monitor in Sector 51, the PM 2.5 concentration stood at 182.62 µg/m3 on Thursday.

This will be part of the exercise for Chhatar Manzil’s restoration, which is expected to take off this month.The project will also include the excavation of the gondola that is still lying buried on Chhatar Manzil’s premises, said officials with the UP State Archaeology Department (UPSAD). “The stalled Chhatar Manzil beautification work is set to start again. Funds for the project are likely to be released by March, after which the excavation and relocation exercise of gondola would start,” said AK Singh, director, state museum who holds additional charge of UPSAD director. Singh said as per the proposed plan, the gondola would be housed in Darbar Hall of the Chhatar Manzil, which itself would be transformed into a museum. “No place would be better than the Darbar Hall to house the gondola. I think it would be a major tourist attraction,” said Singh. The UPSAD had also written a letter to UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam (UPRNN) —the construction agency engaged in the ongoing work – to suggest an agency to ensure the safe excavation of the gondola, which could also be a royal boat. UPSAD officials said the excavation agency for the gondola was yet to be finalised. Some officials said the UPRNN or the UPSAD could rope in the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) or the National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property (NRLC) or UPSAD’s excavation wing to take out the gondola safely. The gondola was unearthed on May 8, 2019, during excavation work at Chhatar Manzil when excavators and experts from UPRNN stumbled upon a wooden structure that was partially visible. It was later confirmed that the wooden structure was nothing else but a colossal gondola. The faculty of architecture, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), is the consultant in the Chhatar Manzil restoration and conservation project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhatar-manzil-restoration-project-to-resume-gondola-will-be-housed-in-darbar-hall-101615462533205.html
