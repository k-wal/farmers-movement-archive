The university’s budget of ₹724 crore was tabled and approved by the varsity for its senate late on Saturday. This is the first time that the annual senate meeting was conducted virtually. The senate, comprising elected and nominated members including principals, teachers and management members, works as a watchdog for the university. The body has the power to approve the varsity’s annual budget. The deficit for the 2021-22 academic year stands at ₹78.53 crore, compared to ₹66.8 crore from the previous academic year. For 2020-21, the MU senate had approved a budget of ₹809.24 crore whereas for the 2021-22 academic year, the tabled budget was of ₹724 crore. “The Covid-19 pandemic and eventual lockdown have severely affected the income and expenditure of the university. Our predictions for the 2021-22 budget as well as the deficit did not match the final outcome, so there has been a reduction in the annual budget in comparison to our original prediction,” said an MU official as he read highlight of the budget at the annual senate meeting late on Saturday night. Highlights of the budget include the allocation of ₹1 crore for the Digital University project. MU also plans to spend ₹22.5 crore towards making its campus disabled-friendly. This is in line with the state government’s disability policy for higher education, which requires universities to reserve 3% of their budget towards making campuses disabled-friendly. This includes easy accessibility to infrastructure, peer support systems, disabled-friendly furniture and teaching aids. The budget has further allocated ₹2 crore for the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Research Centre and ₹9 crore to set up the Balasaheb Thackeray Arts and Cultural Centre. Another ₹2 crore has been allocated to the digital library.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-approves-724-crore-budget-for-202122-101615659944681.html

The woman accused Lodha of defrauding her and not handing her possession of her flat, despite payment. The Congress alleged Lodha also demanded money from the woman beyond the due payment and threatened to not hand over the flat if the said amount was not paid. In a statement, Mumbai Congress chief Ashok Jagtap also taunted Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis to use his investigative skills in the matter. Jagtap alleged that for Lodha’s Palava project in Kalyan and Dombivli, the builder seized hundreds of acres of land from farmers.In a Twitter clarification issued by Lodha on Saturday said the complainant was a persistent defaulter “who has not made payment of her dues (Worli flat) for many years, and is therefore liable to pay applicable penalty as per RERA”. Lodha’s Twitter statement said that on the basis of the woman’s complaint, NM Joshi Marg police station, which has jurisdiction in the area where her flat is located, investigated the matter in December 2019. The company filed a case against her for default and cancellation more than 12 months ago. Mangal Prabhat Lodha on Saturday told Hindustan Times, “I do not have anything to do with the matter. I have clarified everything on my Twitter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-congress-demands-resignation-of-bjp-mumbai-chief-over-fir-in-flat-case-101615659884531.html

13-03-2021||Mumbai||Malwani ISIS module: Rizwan Ahmed seeks bail, cites order in Areeb Majeed’s case||Rizwan Ahmed, who has been accused of radicalising local youth from Malwani to join militant group Islamic State (ISIS), has applied for bail in the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court citing the Bombay high court’s order granting bail to Areeb Majeed, a purported ISIS recruit from Kalyan. Ahmed and another accused, Mohsin Ibrahim Sayyed, are facing trial for instigating youths — Ayaz Sultan, Mohsin, Abdul Bashir, Noor Mohammad — from Malwani to join ISIS in 2015. The probing agencies claimed Ahmed was allegedly the second-in-command of the ISIS wing in India.Ahmed has, in his bail plea, relied on the recent HC judgment wherein alleged ISIS recruit Areeb Majeed was granted bail on the grounds of delay in trial.He also pleaded, “The applicant is a 23-year-old boy. The accusation that he is the head of an international terrorist organisation sounds unbelievable. It is not the story of the prosecution that the act of the applicant has caused any death. Unlike Areeb, it is not even the case of the prosecution that the applicant had left India or intended to leave India to join a proscribed terrorist organisation. The case of the prosecution is that the applicant along with co-accused and wanted accused was instigating youths to join ISIS. The prosecution until now has been unable to bring anything material on record to suggest such allegation.”Further he has claimed that he was arrested on January 21, 2016. The first witness was examined on October 04, 2018. After more than two-and-a-half years, only 23 witnesses have been examined.According to the prosecution, there are 228 witnesses, and more than 200 witnesses are yet to be examined. Refuting prosecution’s allegations, Ahmed claimed that he was a child in 2013, when the purported radicalisation of the accused Ayaz Mohamed began. He claimed that it was Ayaz who had great influence on the youth in Malwani area and was responsible for radicalising to youths there. He has also claimed that he is suffering from acute case of tuberculosis and has developed a tumour/lump in his throat.As per the prosecution case, Ahmed and Mohsin instigated and radicalised youth from Malwani area of Malad to join the ISIS with the help of two wanted accused — Yusuf Al Hindi alias Shafi Armar and Ayaz Sultan, both residents of Malwani who escaped to Syria to join ISIS.It is alleged that Sayyed, along with Noor Mohammad, a carpenter, and Wajid Shaikh, son of a vegetable shop owner, had gone missing on December 15, 2015. The agency claimed the three had decided to join ISIS after 23-year-old Sultan went missing on October 30, 2015. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had claimed that Sultan had escaped to Afghanistan, and then to Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malwani-isis-module-rizwan-ahmed-seeks-bail-cites-order-in-areeb-majeed-s-case-101615659764468.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||Reflection of rival’s info in search results not grounds for trademark infringement: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused to accept the reflection of rival’s details in online search results of a wellness spa as a ground for its trademark infringement.A single judge bench of justice Prithviraj Chavan dismissed an appeal filed by Sharmilee Kapur who challenged refusal of temporary injunction in a trademark infringement suit filed by her against Kiran Bharekar.Kapur, owner of a trademark “atmantan-be transformed”, has given exclusive right to use the trademark to Sparsh Infratech, which runs a luxury wellness centre at Mulshi near Pune. In 2019, Kapur and Sparsh Infratech filed the trademark infringement suit against Bharekar, who owns a registered trademark “TanMan” and runs an Ayurvedic treatment and research centre in that name and style, about 30 kms from Sparsh Infra Tech’s wellness spa.They had moved HC after ad-hoc district judge-6, Pune on July 19, 2019 refused to issue interim injunction restraining Bharekar from using the purported “deceptively similar” trademark.Before HC, Kapur and Sparsh Infotech alleged that the mark adopted by Bharekar was nothing but rearrangement of the first word of their trademark and was deceptively similar to that of their trademark. They contended that the nature of the trade or business was similar and was being carried out barely at a location which is 30 kms away.“That would definitely mislead the public,” their counsel submitted and also drew the court’s attention to the fact that on searching Sparsh’s wellness spa on Google, Bharekar’s trade name is also reflected in the search results. “This would definitely affect not only the reputation and business of the appellants but also the goodwill earned by the appellants by passage of time,” the lawyer had added.Justice Chavan was unimpressed by the argument and held that there was no similarity in the two marks, and therefore, there can be no confusion in the mind of any person about the two rival brands.The judge said even their respective websites were quite different and therefore, there was no substance in the contention that if one scrolls down the Google search results for Sparsh’s wellness spa, Bharekar’s mark also appeared in the search results and thus, an impression was created that Bharekar’s trademark was that of Sparsh’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reflection-of-rival-s-info-in-search-results-not-grounds-for-trademark-infringement-bombay-hc-101615659704482.html

The case was filed based on a complaint by Maharashtra tax department. The catering company is known for providing services to overseas clients, and also provide catering and housekeeping services on vessels travelling to high seas. Presently, it’s not functional, said tax department officials. The police booked the directors of the company — Alfred Michael Arambhan, Aarti Alfred Arambhan, Puja Alfred Arambhan and Nalini Maria Arambhan — on the complaint of Sambhaji Yadav, deputy commissioner, state tax.Yadav, in his statement to police, stated the firm has an outstanding payment of taxes to the tune of ₹18.13 crore, including interest and penalty. The department has calculated the tax for non-payment of VAT tax by the company between 2012-13 and 2015-16.“As per due procedure, the accused company directors were given opportunity to clear the tax dues. The department also followed up matter with them. But on not getting satisfactory response, tax officials decided to initiate prosecution motion against them and issued show-cause notices to the company for the same. Notices were pasted on the company’s Fort office and (the Arambhan) family’s Bandra residence. But the department didn’t receive any response to the notices,” said Yadav.He added, “After all possible ways of recovering dues were exhausted, we finally lodged a police complaint recently.”Arambhan Group in an email reply stated that the matter is sub judice. “I am unaware of any FIR that has been registered, thus cannot comment on the same at this stage,” stated Puja Arambhan in the email.Police registered a case under sections 420 (cheating) 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and section 74 (2) of Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002 against the four directors.“The tax department has already produced documents pertaining to the alleged fraud. Soon we would start recording statement of the witnesses and take further lawful action on the accused,” said an officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-catering-company-4-directors-booked-for-18-crore-vat-default-101615659584467.html

13-03-2021||Delhi||Week 5 of Switch Delhi campaign to raise awareness on charging infra in city||The fifth week of the Delhi government’s Switch Delhi campaign will be aimed at raising awareness about the city’s existing and upcoming EV charging infrastructure, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Saturday. “The Delhi government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure a smooth transition to EVs for the people of Delhi. With a three-pronged strategy, the Kejriwal government has taken lead across India in installing sound charging infrastructure in Delhi for a smooth transition to EVs. The vision of the Kejriwal government to establish a charging point at a distance of every 3kms will increase confidence in people to make the switch to EV and pave the way for making Delhi the EV capital of India,” said Gahlot.The Delhi government has floated the largest tender in India, so far, to build 100 public charging stations with 500 charging points at prominent locations. These will be operational by December 2021 and will add to the existing 72 stations already operational in Delhi. “Details of these can be seen on the website ev.delhi.gov.in. Delhi government is also building a mobile app to ensure that the geo-locations of all charging stations and the status of chargers, whether they are occupied or available for use, can be seen real time,” he said. Secondly, in a historic step taken this week, Delhi will soon have more than 10,000 chargers by December as all commercial and institutional buildings such as malls, shopping complexes, cinema halls/multiplexes, office spaces, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, etc that have a parking capacity of more than 100 vehicles will soon have to set aside at least 5% of their total parking capacity for EVs along with suitable slow EV chargers, Gahlot said. A suitable amendment in Delhi’s building by-laws has already been initiated to enable this. The Kejriwal government is the first and only government in India to take such a progressive step. At present, 20% area in parking facilities already have to be kept aside for EV parking in all new constructions under unified building bylaws for Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/week-5-of-switch-delhi-campaign-to-raise-awareness-on-charging-infra-in-city-101615659463891.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Two govt-funded DU colleges pass resolution to use surplus funds to pay staff||Two Delhi government-funded Delhi University (DU) colleges on Saturday passed a resolution directing its administrations to use surplus funds to pay salaries and meet other expenses. The Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) saw the move as the Delhi government forcing colleges it funded to change the pattern of financial assistance. The governing bodies (GBs) of Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and the Sports Sciences and Maharishi Valmiki College of Education on Saturday passed the resolution that read,” Special audits show that all 12 colleges have surplus grant aid excess is drawn and available with them. Consequently, the colleges are directed to use the same minus student society fund for the purpose of the salary, allowance and other approved and admissible recurring expenses.”It further said that the colleges cannot undertake any activity that entails financial liability for the government, like creation of posts and infrastructure projects over ₹2 crore, without taking prior approval from the government. The other 10 colleges were yet to pass the resolution.DUTA said in a statement, “It’s shocking that these twelve colleges are being forced to adopt in their GBs a document called ‘Pattern of Assistance’ issued by the Directorate of Higher Education, Government of Delhi. The provisions of this Pattern of Assistance are designed to ... divest Delhi Government of its funding responsibility by coercing them to gradually become self-sufficient and self-sustaining.”GBs have 10 members, both from the college as well as government-nominated and their numbers differ from college to college. It is the apex decision making body in the colleges.Deepanshu Srivastav, the government-appointed chairperson of Maharishi Valmiki College, said, “The resolution was passed after proper discussion. None was forced to sign the document. We know that the 12 Delhi government colleges have enough funds in their account to pay salaries to their employees, and that’s why we passed the resolution.”Prabhanjan Jha, a government-appointed GB member at Aditi Mahavidyalaya College, said, “The Delhi government is liable to the deficit only after the utilization of reserves as per the pattern of assistance.”Principal of one of the other 10 colleges, who wished not to be named, said, “Only those colleges having government-appointed GB chairpersons are in favour of the resolution. We are totally against it. How can we pay salaries from the money released under different heads for different purposes? This is totally against the norms.”A senior Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The pattern of assistance is already applied to all Delhi government fully-funded colleges in DU… Besides, the government has already released the pending grants to these colleges.”These 12 state government-funded colleges have been at loggerheads with the Delhi government over funds for a long time. Earlier, the colleges had alleged that the government either delayed release of funds or gave “insufficient” funds, and the government alleged financial irregularities in these colleges claiming they had surplus reserves. Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia had on Friday ordered a probe into the alleged irregularities in these 12 DU colleges. This was a day after teachers launched an indefinite strike demanding their salaries pending since November. DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “The Delhi Government released ₹82.79 crores under salary head and an amount of ₹9.50 crores under other than salaries’ head on Friday. However, the grants released are insufficient, and, in most colleges, will meet fund requirements for payment of salaries only up to January… The government can’t ask these colleges to use their savings for the payment of salaries.”The resolution related to changing pattern of assistance could further escalate the existing tussle between these colleges and the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-govt-funded-du-colleges-pass-resolution-to-use-surplus-funds-to-pay-staff-101615659405758.html

13-03-2021||Delhi||Neeraj Bawana gang member held in encounter: Police||A 21-year-old wanted man was arrested after an alleged encounter with the Delhi Police’s Special Cell near Mundka Industrial Area in outer Delhi On Saturday.The suspect, Kamal Gehlot, is allegedly a member of a criminal gang led by jailed gangsters Neeaj Bawana and Naveen Bali. Gehlot was wanted in connection with the murder of his rival. He allegedly killed him firing three bullets into his head and face in a residential neighbourhood near Nawada Housing Complex in October last year, the police said.In Saturday’s encounter, at least four bullets were fired in which Gehlot was hit in his leg.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that the team received information that Gehlot would travel to Mohan Garden in a white car via Mundka Industrial Area Metro station after midnight. Accordingly, a trap was laid.Around 2 am, the DCP said, the team spotted the car and ordered its driver to stop. But instead, the driver fired two bullets at the police personnel in a bid to escape. “One bullet hit head constable Lokendra Singh’s bulletproof vest. Our team members fired two bullets in self defence, one of which hit the suspect, Kamal Gehlot’s left leg,” said Yadav, adding that a pistol and a revolver were seized from Gehlot along with six cartridges.The injured suspect, previously involved in three cases of robbery and murder, was taken to a nearby hospital for medical attention. His condition was stable, the police said.A resident of Delhi’s Nawada, Gehlot’s father Pawan Gehlot is a property dealer with an office in Uttam Nagar. Pawan’s brother Praveen Gehlot was an active member of a gang led by jailed gangsters Manjeet Mahal and Pradeep Solanki and also allegedly involved in property grabbing, said DCP Yadav.“After the arrests of Mahal and Solanki, some dispute arose between Praveen and Solanki over a property. Solanki used his hitman, Vikas Dalal, to kill Praveen in May 2019. Since Kamal Gehlot was close to his uncle, he decided to take revenge,” said the DCP.While lodged in Tihar jail in two robbery cases, Gehlot joined Bawana and Bali who were in the same jail. After coming out of the jail, Gehlot and his father killed a person named Vikas Mehta in October, as they suspected he was involved in Praveen’s murder. Mehta’s murder was captured in a CCTV camera and its footage had gone viral on social media.In the 18-second video clip, the alleged killer in yellow t-shirt and a white towel around his mouth is seen chasing a man with a gun in his hand. The two come in a lane where the CCTV is installed. The suspect fires a bullet at the man who is looking towards him and walking backward with a red helmet in his left forearm.The bullets pierce the man’s left eye and he falls on the ground. The suspect first walks back but returns and pumps at least two more bullets in his right eye and forehead. He then takes out a cellphone from his pants pocket and takes the bleeding man’s photograph before leaving the crime scene, the footage shows.Pawan was arrested five days after Mehta’s murder while his son was absconding, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/neeraj-bawana-gang-member-held-in-encounter-police-101615659404009.html

Soon after her fall, a 35-year-old man came out from the same building, lifted the injured woman on his shoulder and ran away — the entire incident being caught on a CCTV camera in the area as well as being noticed by some neighbours, one of whom alerted the police. The woman was later found dead near a garbage dumping yard, some metres away from the place where she had fallen off the building, the police said.In the evening, the suspect, identified as Mukesh Kumar, was caught from near Lucknow along with his family members and a pet dog while they were en-route to their hometown in Bihar’s Darbhanga, deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said.“We are bringing Kumar to Delhi and will interrogate him to ascertain the exact sequence of events leading to the woman’s death, his relation with her, and why was he trying to flee,” said DCP Rangnani.The police said that they have registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence, since Kumar had allegedly lifted the injured woman, threw her on the roadside and left her to die.The police also said that after leaving the injured woman near the roadside, Mukesh Kumar spread sand over the blood on the spot where she had fallen down from the building. The woman’s identity has not been revealed by the police, as they were awaiting an autopsy report, which will ascertain if she was sexually assaulted.According to the DCP, at 1.16am on Saturday, the Subhash Place police station received a call that a woman had fallen from the fourth floor of a house in Shakurpur and that someone had lifted her on his shoulder and dumped her at a nearby chowk.“Our team reached the incident spot, shifted the woman to a nearby hospital, where she was declared brought dead. A case was registered and investigations launched,” she said, adding that the suspect was identified through CCTV footage and neighbours’ accounts and teams started looking for him.The investigating team collected his cellphone’s details and found its location on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway. The police then contacted the Kakori police station in Uttar Pradesh and they intercepted and nabbed the suspect along with his car and family members and the dog, near a toll booth on the expressway, said a police officer, associated with the case.Apart from Kumar, the police have also arrested his associate Jiten alias Kana, who was with him in the car. “As soon as the Delhi Police team approached us and shared details about their suspect’s car, we deployed many teams on the exit points on the expressway between Lucknow and Agra. We caught the suspect and handed him over to a Delhi Police team,” said Kuldeep Singh, station house officer of Kakori police station.During preliminary investigations, the DCP said, it was revealed that Kumar works as a placement agent and supplied domestic helps and servants to various households. The woman, whom the police has identified as Rehsmi, 22, was from Jharkhand and had come to Kumar’s house for placement purpose. “Apparently, some argument had taken place between Kumar and the woman over payment. Further probe is on in the case,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-falls-from-4th-floor-man-dumps-her-near-garbage-dump-to-die-101615659345708.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||CM offers ₹1 crore to family of Covid warrior who died on duty||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday met the family of a Hindu Rao Hospital staff member who had died of Covid-19, and offered a compensation of ₹1 crore.Rakesh Jain, 58, worked as lab technician and died in June last year.“Rakesh contracted the infection when he was on Covid duty. He was shifted to Metro Hospital, but we could not save his life... till his last breath, he served the citizens of Delhi. The Delhi government salutes such front line workers who have relentlessly served the citizens of Delhi,” read a statement issued by Kejriwal’s office. The CM met Rakesh Jain’s wife and children. “His (Rakesh’s) elder son is looking for a job. The Delhi government will also provide a job to his son. I want to ensure the family of Rakesh Jain that the Delhi government will stand beside them in the future also, whenever they need any help.” The same day, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain chaired a ceremony organised to felicitate 80 Covid Warriors from Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital at the Delhi Vidhan Assembly. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel was also in attendance. Speaking at the event, Jain said the Delhi Government’s Lok Nayak Hospital, India’s largest Covid-19 treatment facility, had treated more than 10,000 patients. He also said that the ambulance response time was reduced and it was ensured that it reached the patients’ home within 15 minutes of the call. “We have now declared Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital as a non-covid hospital because even in our dedicated Covid hospitals the number of Covid-19 patients is very less and the beds are ample. The hospital at Burari has 300 beds for Covid-19 patients that have only 10-12 patients, LNJP has 300 dedicated beds for covid-19 patients, whereas the number of patients is only 20. Similarly, at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, 500 beds have been dedicated to covid positive patients, however, the number of admissions is only 10-11,” he said.

On Saturday, the governing bodies of two out of the 12 collegespassed the resolution directing the college administrations to use “surplus funds” to pay salaries and other expenses. The 10-member governing body of the college comprises people nominated both by the university and the Delhi government and take important decisions, like the appointment of staff members.The government-appointed members of the GBs in these 12 colleges, however, claimed that the panels were in favour of the resolution. There are 12 Delhi government fully funded colleges in DU. While other colleges receive grants from the Centre, these 12 colleges are fully dependent on the Delhi government.These 12 state government fully-funded colleges have been at the loggerheads with the Delhi government over funds. While the colleges alleged that the state government either delays release of funds or gives “insufficient” funds, the government alleged financial irregularities in these colleges claiming that they have surplus amounts in their reserves. Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Friday ordered a probe into the alleged irregularities in these 12 DU colleges. The probe was ordered a day after teachers launched an indefinite university shut down demanding their pending salaries. Officials at these colleges alleged that they were struggling to pay salaries to their staff since December due to the lack of funds. Even as the Delhi government had on Friday released pending funds, DUTA said that it was not sufficient to clear the salaries pending since November.This resolution related to changing pattern of assistance could further escalate the existing tussle between these colleges and the Delhi government.The resolutions passed by the GBs of at least two colleges ---Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and Sports Sciences and Maharishi Valmiki College of Education---on Saturday, stated, “special audits show that all 12 colleges have surplus grant aid available with them. Consequently, the colleges are directed to use the same, minus student society fund, for the purpose of the salary, allowance and other approved and admissible recurring expenses.”It further said that the colleges cannot undertake any activity that entails financial liability for the government without taking prior approval. “Like the creation of posts, the grant of pay scales higher than those of corresponding posts in the government of NCT of Delhi, the undertaking of infrastructure projects, estimated cost of which is above ₹2 crore, provision/extension of the pension to employees, etc.” it stated.The other ten colleges are yet to pass the resolution.Objecting to the resolution, DUTA said in a statement, “It’s shocking that these twelve colleges are being forced to adopt in their GBs a document called ‘Pattern of Assistance’ issued by the directorate of higher education, government of Delhi. The provisions of this pattern of assistance is designed to redefine association of these 12 colleges with Delhi University and divest Delhi government of its funding responsibility by coercing them to gradually become self-sufficient and self-sustaining.”A senior Delhi government official, who wished not to be named, said, “The pattern of assistance is already applied to all Delhi government fully-funded colleges in DU… Besides, the government has already released the pending grants to these colleges.”The government-appointed members in the governing bodies of these colleges dismissed DUTA’s claims. Deepanshu Srivastav, chairperson Maharishi Valmiki College, said, “The resolution was passed after proper discussion. None was forced to sign the document. We know that the 12 Delhi government colleges have enough funds in their account to pay salaries to their employees, and that’s why we passed the resolution.”Prabhanjan Jha, a governing body member at Aditi Mahavidyalaya College, said, “The Delhi government is liable to the deficit only after the utilization of reserves as per the pattern of assistance. Eight out of 12 colleges, having government-appointed GB chairpersons, are in favour of the resolution.”DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “The Delhi Government released ₹82.79 crores under salary head and an amount of ₹9.50 crores under other than salaries’ head on Friday. However, the grants released are insufficient, and, in most colleges, will meet fund requirements for payment of salaries only up to January… The government can’t ask these colleges to use their savings for the payment of salaries.”Principal of one of the other 10 colleges, who wished not to be named, said, “Only those colleges having government appointed governing body chairpersons are in favour of the resolution. We are totally against it. How can we pay salaries from the money released under different heads for different purposes? This is totally against the norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/use-surplus-funds-to-pay-pending-wages-says-governing-bodies-of-2-delhi-govt-funded-colleges-101615659345178.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||Delkar wrote to PM Modi, Amit Shah and LS speaker, says Maharashtra Congress||Maharashtra Congress has alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government did not pay heed to the alarm by deceased Dadra and Nagara Haveli MP Mohan Delkar, and it resulted in his suicide. Raising question on if his complaints were deliberately left unnoticed, the Congress has also demanded that the breach of privilege committee of Lok Sabha should make it public if Delkar had warned the committee with suicide during his hearing 10 days ahead of his suicide.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant, on Saturday, said Delkar, who committed suicide in a south Mumbai hotel on February 22, had written letters to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, weeks before his suicide. Sawant said the MP had apprised the top leadership of the country of the harassment he was going through and had sought an appointment to seek their intervention.“Delkar had written two letters to the PM on December 18 and January 31; two letters to Amit Shah on December 18 and January 12, and three letters to Lok Sabha speaker in December and January. He had said he was being harassed by the administration of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and 20-year-old cases were being raked up to frame him. He had also said that his family members were threatened to be jailed. Despite this, the deceased MP did not get any help. Had the Central government acted in time, Delkar’s life could have been saved,” Sawant said.The Congress spokesperson also said that Delkar had appeared before the breach of privilege committee of Lok Sabha and narrated the harassment he faced. “Committee chief Sunil Kumar Singh should make it public if Delkar in his statement had said that he has no option but either to commit suicide amid the harassment or resign as an MP. The MP committed suicide in just 10 days after his appearance before the committee,” he said.Maharashtra BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “The Congress has been blaming us for Delkar’s death. But why did their top leaders who sit in Parliament kept quiet if the deceased MP was raising this issue in the houses? Why did Rahul Gandhi and party’s group leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury not raise this issue in Parliament? The Congress wants to capitalise Delkar’s death for the political gains. But the Maharashtra government took more than two weeks to register a case after Delkar’s death. It was only after the BJP raised the Sachin Vaze issue in legislature, a special investigating team was announced to probe the suicide. Congress does not have any sympathy for Delkar; it wants to play politics out of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delkar-wrote-to-pm-modi-amit-shah-and-ls-speaker-says-maharashtra-congress-101615659106128.html

Now, Guramrit is trending on social media following his announcement to appear for the JEE Main again in the next sessions of JEE with people joking and asking him to give others a chance, while he says he wants to prepare better for the JEE Advanced to be held later. Here’s wishing the lad from Sector 74, Mohali, the very best as he plans to pursue computer science engineering from IIT Bombay. Congress councillors leave House high and dry over water tariff The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (MC) general House meet on March 9 was a noisy affair with the water tariff hike issue dominating proceedings. While the city Congress chief was staging a protest outside the House, party councillors were at their combative best inside, trooping into the well repeatedly. Congress member Satish Kainth even sat in the well of the House, prompting BJP councillors to place a water bottle in front of him. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma lost his cool when the Congress members kept interrupting their BJP counterparts. “We didn’t interrupt you. Why are you not allowing anybody to speak?” Sharma said, letting off some steam. MC commissioner KK Yadav too had a tough time putting his word across. “I didn’t interrupt you. Let me give the official take on the issue,” he was heard telling Congress members. Year on, Mohali MC website displays old mayor’s message The Mohali Municipal Corporation has some catching up to do on the virtual front. Even though it’s nearly a year since former mayor Kulwant Singh’s term ended on April 26, 2020, the civic body’s website, www.mcmohali.punjab.gov.in, still displays the message he posted six years ago. Mohali awaits a new mayor next week after the February elections but Kulwant is certainly out of the race, having lost the poll. Coping with exams, keeping stress at bay To help examinees cope with stress, a student of Gian Jyoti Institute of Management and Technology, Mohali, has made a short film that he has uploaded on YouTube.

While the government insists on e-governance, it takes days for its officials to make their website functional. Mohali elections to blame for Chandigarh’s Covid spike Officials from the UT health department and Chandigarh administration are of the view that the epicentre of the recent spurt of infection is neighbouring Mohali. During review meetings on reasons for the surge, officials, including UT adviser Manoj Parida, said that the gatherings in Punjab due to the municipal corporation elections have led to the spike in infections there and it has impacted Chandigarh, too.

13-03-2021||Delhi||UN expert panel asks Govt to compensate Safoora Zargar for ‘arbitrary detention’||A United Nations (UN) expert panel has asked the Indian government to compensate student activist Safoora Zargar, arrested last year in connection with the violence in northeast Delhi, for being detained arbitrarily in violation of international conventions. Zaragar, an MPhil student at the Jamia Millia Islamia, was arrested in April last year in connection with the northeast Delhi riots in February last year and granted bail two months later. She was pregnant at the time of her arrest.The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), in its report that was released in Geneva, said Zargar’s detention went against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. WGAD operates under the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights.“The Working Group considers that, taking into account all the circumstances of the case, the appropriate remedy would be to accord Ms Zargar an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law,” WGAD said in its report.The group asked the Indian government to take steps to “remedy the situation of Ms Zargar without delay”.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the report.Zargar was accused of conspiring with others to instigate and start the violence in which 53 people died and 400 people were injured. She had said she was only part of protests and had denied the allegations.In its report, WGAD concluded that Zargar “was deprived of her liberty on discriminatory grounds, owing to her status as a human rights defender, and on the basis of her political or other opinion regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act”. It urged the government to “ensure a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty” of Zargar and to take “appropriate measures against those responsible for the violation of her rights”.The WGAD considered that Zargar was “targeted for discrimination on the basis of her status as a human rights defender” and that her “political views and beliefs regarding the Government’s policies and actions are at the heart of the present case”.The group also referred Zargar’s case to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, for appropriate action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/un-expert-panel-asks-govt-to-compensate-safoora-zargar-for-arbitrary-detention-101615659103897.html

Besides, to check the activities of bootleggers, the police, along with the district administration, have issued a WhatsApp number where any information can be shared. The GB Nagar commissioner of police, Alok Singh, said that special monitoring by senior officials is being arranged in the sensitive villages. “On the basis of their reports, booths will be classified as sensitive and supersensitive. Adequate police forces and provincial armed constabulary (PAC) jawans will be deployed for the security measures in these villages,” he said. Singh further said that the police have already started taking tight security measures in the villages believed to be the stronghold of gangsters and notorious criminals. “We’ve already started keeping surveillance on physical movement of such elements and locations of their mobile phones,” he said. Police are also checking the criminal past of expected candidates and the process of cancelling their arms’ licences has already been initiated. “We will take stern action against criminals, land mafias and liquor smugglers as they may influence and pressurise the mandate during the election. All the police stations have been asked to prepare the criminal dossiers of poll aspirants, and that of land and liquor mafias in their respective areas. All the weapons of those involved in any illegal or violent activities will be seized,” Singh said. The district police chief said that police will also keep a strict vigil on illegal transportation and distribution of liquor and cash, which the poll aspirants generally use to woo the gullible voters in rural areas. “All the station house officers have been asked to ensure timely closure of liquor shops in their areas concerned and take tough action against the bootleggers,” he said. Elamaran G, additional DCP of Noida Central (crime), said that at times candidates distribute liquor to woo voters during local elections. “Locals know that use of liquor during elections is illegal, but they do not know whom to complain. At times, they do not inform the local police because they don’t trust them. We have issued helpline number 8851065641 to tackle illegal distribution, sale and purchase of liquor during the elections. The informers’ details will be kept a secret, and they will also be rewarded for helping the police,” he said.Elamaran G said he himself will receive the calls, and talk to DCPs of areas concerned in the same. “We will send a special team to conduct a search operation. The local police will not be engaged in this exercise,” he added.Police will also check vehicles at the borders, to stop liquor smuggling.

Police said that his 75-year-old wife was rushed to a hospital where she is under treatment. According to police and fire department officials, Raghunath Shah and his wife Sapna were sleeping when a fire initiated at their flat in D-block of the area and the neighbours alerted the fire department and police around 1:15am on Saturday. “We received a call at 1:18am and rushed a fire tender from nearby Vaishali fire station. The couple was taken out from the flat and rushed to the hospital. The fire, which probably started due to some short circuit in the house, was doused soon after our personnel reached there,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. The neighbours living at the second floor of the building raised an alarm after they spotted thick fumes emanating from the couple’s flat. “The couple did not sustain any burn injury. The elderly man died soon after the incident probably due to inhaling fumes. They lived alone in the flat and were not keeping well. In the morning, their relatives also arrived from Delhi,” said Ajay Tyagi, one of the neighbours. The police said that the man probably died of suffocation after inhaling toxic fumes. “His wife is still at the hospital in Vaishali. The 80-year-old man died in the flat.

13-03-2021||Gurugram||GMDA plans to install smart traffic signals across city||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is planning to set up smart traffic signals at new traffic locations across the city and convert the existing signals into smart ones wherever necessary, said officials on Saturday. The move is likely to ease traffic movement and keep constant vigil over the functioning of traffic signals, added the officials.A smart traffic signal is an automated one and unlike manual or conventional ones takes into account the volume of traffic on a real-time basis. As per GMDA officials, from now on only smart signals will be set up at every new traffic location. Seven such signals have already been placed at important junctions and stretches, such as Bakhtawar Chowk, Huda City Centre, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road and Pataudi Road.Further, GMDA is also compiling a detailed project report (DPR) to identify the spots where existing traffic signals have been installed, check their working condition, and assess if the signals are providing comprehensive coverage.“Smart traffic signals are ideal for mobility as they turn red or green depending on the volume of traffic at each end. This way, commuters have to wait at a signal for the shortest duration possible. Conventional traffic signals, where the changing of signs is already pre-decided, do not conform take into account real-time traffic volume,” said JS Sindhu, engineer, traffic, mobility wing, GMDA.The GMDA’s long-term aim is to also link all of the city’s traffic signals to their Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC), from where they can also monitor their functioning.“Wherever new traffic signals are being installed, the GMDA is only setting up smart ones. So far, seven major points in the city have already been covered and work on adding the same at a dozen more points is in process,” said Sindhu.Last week, GMDA floated tenders for installing traffic signals on Krishna Chowk — a key intersection on Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road.“We are also planning on phasing out conventional traffic signals from the city and replacing them with smart traffic signals. A DPR on this is being prepared but the matter is still at a nascent stage. Our long-term vision is to connect all traffic signals in the city with our ICCC so that we can monitor them on a real-time basis and quickly spot any errors in case the signals malfunction,” said Sindhu.As per GMDA officials, the city has around 130 traffic signals.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi, said that the objective of smart traffic signals is to reduce delay and optimise movement as per the traffic conditions.“A smart signal allows more time for traffic to continue moving in the direction with the highest volume of traffic, which both manual and conventional traffic signals are unable to do. The GMDA should also look at the option of synchronising smart signals in such a manner that they can be altered in cases of emergencies to ensure services such as ambulances and fire tenders take the least amount of travelling time,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-plans-to-install-smart-traffic-signals-across-city-101615658687443.html

This comes in the view of Holi.According to the Ghaziabad health department officials, of the daily testing target, they will devote 50% of the 3,500 rapid antigen tests and 40% of the 1,700 RT-PCR tests to “focused testing”.“We have a daily target of conducting around 3,500 antigen tests and another 1,700 RT-PCR tests. The current daily achievement is lower than the daily target as many do not come for testing nowadays. However, we have been directed that 50% rapid antigen tests and 40% RT-PCR tests, of our daily testing target, will now be devoted to focused testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad.The drive will be carried out every day till March 27, and will cover labourers at construction sites, street vendors, school and college students, domestic travellers, workers at pan and cigarette shops, bus stands, sweets shops, liquor shops, malls, markets and shops selling items for Holi celebrations, among others.According to the district health department data, Ghaziabad conducted a daily average of 2,437 tests in January, an average of 1,971 tests per day in February, and an average of 2,174 tests per day till March 9.“We have been asked to conduct tests on travellers at railway stations and bus stands in case our daily focused testing target is not achieved. We already have 22 teams conducting the tests, and many of these teams will be devoted to focused testing,” Dr Gupta added.The district also saw focused testing before and after Diwali last year.According to the official data, the district has a total of 26,863 Covid cases till March 12, and the figure includes 26,661 discharged, 102 deaths and 100 active cases. Recently, 21 Covid-19 positive cases were reported at the central public works department’s (CPWD’s) national academy at Kamala Nehru Nagar in Ghaziabad.Meanwhile, considering the large number of assistant executive engineers getting infected, the health officials have now decided to go for genome sequencing to find the Covid variant.“Since a large number of cases was reported at the academy, we will take up genome testing of 10% of the samples and these will be sent to the Delhi laboratory. It will help us find out whether the patients are infected with the Sars-Cov-2 or the latest variant, VUI-202012/01. We are yet to get the test reports of two staffers and as many departmental stores, and one fruit shop where the patients went for shopping,” Dr Gupta added.In December 2020, genome sequencing was done on 231 travellers from the UK, but none tested positive for the new variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/focused-testing-starts-in-ghaziabad-ahead-of-holi-101615658685831.html

13-03-2021||Gurugram||Mixed response to budget from city-based industrialists||Factory owners and city-based industrial associations gave a mixed response to the budget presented by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday that primarily focussed on agriculture and health.Businessmen running small and medium enterprises, in particular, said that they expected more relief measures from the government to meet the challenges posed by Covid-19 and the pandemic-induced slowdown. However, those running larger and organised industries, viewed the budget proposals with a focus on infrastructure as positive.JN Mangla, president, Gurgaon Industrial Association, said that although the budget addressed macro issues, city-based entrepreneurs wanted measures for small and medium units, which was missing. “We had expected measures to augment infrastructure for the industry in non-conforming areas — budgetary support to fight pollution, subsidy for machinery upgradation, ease of finance and few tax sops. The focus on infrastructure is positive but more needs to be done for the entrepreneurs,” he said.Industry leaders also said that they were expecting special provisions for small scale industry, budget for Gurugram Metro extension and improvement in public transport in the city, but there was not much in the budget on these aspects.“We have been demanding that backward industrial areas should be declared tax-free zones like Himachal and Uttarakhand. If it is implemented, then there will be better avenues of employment in these areas and Investors will be motivated to come to our state. There is also a strong need for an industrial peacekeeping force to maintain better labour relations,” said HP Yadav, president, NCR Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Manesar-based industrialists said that the government should implement the promises made in the budget. “The promises made in the budget are good but these should be implemented so that benefits reach both employees and employers,” said Pawan Yadav, the president of the IMT Industrial Association.Rajiv Gandhi, chairman, CII Haryana State Council, said the government’s decision to introduce a scheme to settling longstanding disputes, related to taxation, transport taxes, mining dues, dues payable to HSIIDC, HSVP, HSAMB and stamp duty payable, was a positive initiative and will provide a big relief to the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mixed-response-to-budget-from-city-based-industrialists-101615658684402.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||Pedestrian trial at Sadar Bazar to commence on March 20||A week-long pedestrian trial at Sadar Bazar will be conducted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) between March 20 and March 27 — a release issued by the civic body stated on Saturday.The trial was scheduled to be held last month, from February 26 onwards. However, MCG deferred it a day before its commencement, citing technical reasons. A meeting for discussing the details of the pedestrian trial was held at the Public Works Department (PWD) Rest House in Civil Lines on Saturday. It was attended by Mayor Madhu Azad; Sudhir Singla, Gurugram MLA; Vinay Pratap Singh, MCG commissioner, along with various senior MCG officials, and representatives of World Resources Institute (WRI) India — a non-profit organisation assisting MCG in the trial. The representatives of WRI India informed the attendees regarding the current situation of Sadar Bazar via video conference.As per the MCG release, WRI officials said that due to encroachments, haphazard parking of vehicles, lack of seating arrangements, visitors to the area often face problems. They also said that while 90 percent of movement in the area is pedestrian in nature, roughly nine percent are of two-wheelers.The attendees were also informed that there was also no place for the movement of emergency vehicles due to encroachments and haphazard parking of vehicles. Almost 80 percent of people in the area agree that the market should be made pedestrian-friendly.As per the plan, the pedestrian trial will be conducted on a 650-metre stretch between Jama Masjid and Head Post Office in Sadar Bazar that happens to be the main thoroughfare of the market.The 650-metre stretch has a width of 9 to 13 metres. However, due to encroachments and haphazard parking, the width is significantly reduced. Despite its narrow lanes, Sadar Bazar has a footfall of around 20,000 people visiting the market during a weekend. It has more than 1,200 shops and 400 street vendors.“During the week-long trial, the entire market will be made vehicle-free. Barricades will be set up at all entry and exit points. All parking spots in the area will be marked and proper signage will be installed,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.A dedicated street vending zone will also be set up during the trial. Further, 70 benches will be erected and LED streetlights and green belts will also be developed.As per MCG officials who attended the meeting, vehicles will not be allowed in the market between 10am and 8pm, during the week-long trial.They added the civic body had to defer the trial last month after shop owners in the area complained against the lack of adequate parking facility provided by the civic body. “The shopkeepers complained that MCG had provided parking spaces at a distance. This time, the parking is less than 200-300 metres from their shops, with proper signage and lighting,” said an MCG official who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pedestrian-trial-at-sadar-bazar-to-commence-on-march-20-101615658683883.html

The Santacruz weather station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, up from 37.3 degrees Celsius earlier this week.Previously, the Santacruz weather station had recorded 38.1 degree Celsius on March 4. Officials attributed the spike in Mercury levels to northeasterly winds, delaying the setting of sea breeze and causing a temperature rise. Colaba, on the other hand, the maximum temperature was recorded at 34.8 degrees Celsius.Officials also cautioned that the temperature would remain on the higher side over the next couple of days as well.“While no official heatwave is likely across the country over the next few days, Mercury levels will be on the higher side,” said Dr Shubhangi Bhute, a scientist at IMD. The minimum temperature at Santacruz and Colaba was recorded at 22 degrees Celsius on Saturday, which was at normal, and only slightly higher than the previous day’s reading.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Santacruz, there may be no relief from the heat over the next few days. The maximum temperature is expected to remain at 38 degrees Celsius for the next couple of days, while the minimum reading is also predicted to remain at 22 degrees Celsius. Mainly clear skies will prevail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mercury-crosses-38-c-in-mumbai-temperature-likely-to-remain-same-imd-101615658624698.html

Police said the incident came to light via a video of the alleged act, after which an FIR was registered at the Bhojpur police station.The suspect was identified as Mohammad Mohsin, who is from Muradnagar, who has been hired as a cook by the caterer at an engagement ceremony held at the premises of a college in Dausa Banjarpur in Bhojpur on Thursday afternoon.The complainant in the matter is Shiv Kumar Sharma.His nephew, Tarun Bhardwaj, said: “My uncle was hosting a function and had roped in a caterer who had hired the suspect to cook naan. During the function, while the food was served, one of our guests spotted the act in which the suspect was seen spitting on every naan before putting it into the tandoor (oven). The guest shot a video and informed us,” alleged Tarun Bhardwaj. He said that about 200 guests had been invited for the event.“After the incident came to light, we questioned the suspect but he ran away. We then gave the police the video along with a complaint and an FIR was lodged. However, none of our guests ate lunch after the issue came to light. It was really depressing to see someone doing such an act and serving such food to people,” he added. The police said the suspect was arrested late at night from Muradnagar.“We verified the video and traced the suspect before he was arrested. Based on the complaint given to us, we registered an FIR under several Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections. It was alleged that the suspect was spitting on the naans before cooking them,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).The FIR was lodged against the suspect under IPC sections of 295a (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 269 (unlawfully or negligently act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cook-at-pvt-event-in-gzb-held-for-spitting-on-bread-101615658323884.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Active Covid cases in Chandigarh again go past 1,000||The number of active Covid-19 cases crossed the 1,000 mark after a span of four months in Chandigarh on Saturday.The UT recorded 144 new cases — the highest since the surge post festive season last November — which took the total and number of active cases to 22,976 and 1,032, respectively. Meanwhile, the death of a 51-year-old woman from Dhanas took the number of fatalities to 358. The recovery rate stands at 94%, with 21,586 patients being cured so far.The grim milestone of 1,000 active cases, up from 430 at the beginning of the month, is coupled with a substantial increase in positivity rate, which is more than double the national average and second highest in the country despite increase in testing.Even as Chandigarh is conducting around 1,400 tests per million population in a day, against the national average of around 600, the weekly positivity rate in the city has bumped up to 6.3%, against 2.8% in India.The neighbouring state of Punjab, which is also witnessing a surge in infections, is conducting 657 tests per million population and has a weekly positivity rate of 5%, which is the third highest in the country after Maharashtra and Chandigarh.‘Take precautions to beat surge’“This shows that the infection is widespread in the community, and if people do not adhere to the safety protocol, the situation can turn more serious. A similar trend was witnessed in November, but as people started taking precautions, the number of cases went down,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director of health services.In November, the number of active cases had started to fall after reaching the peak of 1,190. “We strongly suggest that residents should venture outside only for essential work and for their jobs. Dine-in at restaurants should be avoided, and masks should be used at social gatherings. Adhering to the protocol for at least 10 days can reverse the upward trend,” said Dr Kang, while adding that it has been observed that social gatherings, and not the workplace, are the main source of infection.“In March last year, we had the target of eliminating this disease in six months. Now, we have completed one year of the pandemic, and the situation is the same,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. “We are seeing surges at constant intervals, as we don’t follow the Covid appropriate behaviour. It needs at least one year of strict adherence; otherwise we will see these waves coming regularly.” However, in the recent surge, no case of reinfection or different variant of virus has surfaced in the city, said officials. Meanwhile, the number of vaccine doses administered in Chandigarh has reached 50,670 after 2,558 people were jabbed on Saturday. The coverage among both healthcare and frontline workers is around 50%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/active-covid-cases-in-chandigarh-again-go-past-1000-101615658265741.html

Initially, hotels, restaurants were adhering strictly to COVID-19 norms, but now everyone has become lackadaisical," he said.He said his government was not in favour of a lockdown to tackle the latest surge and asked people to cooperate to avoid having to take such a drastic decision.Mumbai municipal commissioner IS Chahal suggested that the hotel and restaurant associations can organise flying squads to check if outbreak norms were being followed.These association said member establishments not adhering to rules will be removed, while shopping centre representatives said they could deploy "COVID marshals" to check people in malls, while entry into food courts will be restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dont-force-us-to-implement-strict-lockdown-maharashtra-cm-gives-last-warning-101615657730985.html

13-03-2021||Kolkata||CM Banerjee more qualified than protégé-turned-adversary Adhikari, earns less||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is educationally more qualified than her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari and her annual earning has shot up ten times in the last five years, while Adhikari’s has dropped by a few lakhs, say their affidavits filed with the Election Commission of India.Banerjee, who decided to contest the polls from Nandigram in East Midnapore, filed her nomination on March 10. The BJP has pitted one of its most heavyweight candidates Adhikari against the TMC supremo. Adhikari filed his nomination on Friday.The affidavits show that 66-year-old Banerjee, a resident of south Kolkata, has completed her MA and LLB from Calcutta University. In 2016, when she contested the last assembly polls from Bhabanipur, she had also mentioned in the affidavit about completing BEd and having been trained in work education. Adhikari, who hails from Nandigram, on the other hand, is equipped with a master degree from Rabindra Bharati University.West Bengal is all set to witness one of the most high-pitched poll battles on April 1 when Nandigram goes to polls in the second phase with Banerjee and Adhikari pitted against each other. The crucial state assembly polls will take off on March 27.Also read: 'Save Bengal, don't vote for BJP' Rakesh Tikait appeals to Bengal votersThe affidavit also shows that Banerjee annual earnings have shot up around ten times from ₹1,72,910 in 2015-16 to ₹10,34,370 in 2019-20. Adhikari, however, has shown a decline in his total earning from ₹14,83,730 in 2015-16 to ₹11,15,715 in 2019-20.While Adhikari’s income comes from his business and pension as a former MP, Banerjee said that her sources of income are royalty, bank interest and others.“Banerjee does not take any salary as an MLA or as the state’s chief minister. She was a seven-time parliamentarian but has forgone the pension. She generates her income from royalties of books and music,” said a senior TMC leader.Banerjee has penned more than 100 books in Hindi, Bengali, English and Urdu. While 13 of them were released in the 2020 Kolkata International Book Fair, in the 2019 book fair she had released seven books, while in 2018 she had released nine books,” said a TMC leader.The list of books includes essays, a collection of poems, a set of political writings on current scenarios and books on Urdu shayaris. She has also written books on the uprisings in Nandigram, Singur and on the issue of demonetization.The Bharatiya Janata Party refrained from making any comments on the CM’s earnings.None of the two leaders has ever been convicted in any criminal cases neither any cases are pending against them.Apart from some cash in hand, some bank balance and NSC, Banerjee owns only around 9.75 grams of gold which is worth around ₹43,837 as per the current value. The total worth of her moveable assets is around ₹16 lakhs. She has no immovable assets in her name.Adhikari’s movable assets are worth more than ₹59 lakhs including few lakh deposits in banks, Kisan Vikas Patra, LIC policies and NSC. His immovable assets including agricultural lands and flats are worth around ₹46 lakhs.“In a democracy, it doesn’t matter who is rich or poor or who is more educated and less educated. What matters is how well a leader is accepted by the people and how the leader has performed if he or she is in the government. Mamata’s simplicity is a good political strategy even though the cotton saree which she wears, the sandals and her watch are all costly enough,” said Amal Mukherjee, a political commentator and former principal of Presidency College in Kolkata.Whether it would be Banerjee or Adhikari, who would have the last smile could only be decided on May 2 when the counting of votes takes place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cm-banerjee-more-qualified-than-prot-g-turned-adversary-adhikari-earns-less-101615657327553.html
13-03-2021||Pune||Younger population infecting seniors with Covid-19, say experts||Around 25 per cent of the Covid-19 cases in the district have been reported from those belonging to the age group of 31-40 years of age while maximum deaths or 29 per cent of the deaths have been reported among those from the age group of 61-70 years of age, according to experts. Experts say the younger population is spreading the infection to the more vulnerable age group. As per the information from the district health office, as of March 10 the district has reported about 4.25 lakh cases of which over four lakhs had recovered and 9,341 have been declared dead. As per the age-wise bifurcation of the cases, maximum cases which are over one lakh which is about 25% of the cases have been reported in the age group from 31-40 while maximum deaths have reported from the age group of 61-70 years of age which is about 2,783 deaths. Among children in the age group of 0-10, the highest recovery rate could be seen as the case fatality rate is 0.1 per cent. While those aged between 11-20 years of age have shown a CFR of only 0.2 per cent. The maximum fatalities in the senior citizens age group are evident in the fact that they are vulnerable and could easily succumb to the infection. Dr Abhiit More, AAP leader and Jan Aarogya Manch member which works in public health said, “It is obvious as this age group belongs to the productive age group and they come out and interact with multiple people and then they carry the infection to their parents. The senior citizens at home are more vulnerable as they are old and suffer from multiple comorbidities. The younger population has to be more cautious and not let down their guard. They have to continue to follow Covid appropriate behaviour.

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Hear the silent cry||It was not uncommon for gardeners at large schools with playfields shrouded in wild grass or greenskeepers at the Chandigarh Golf Club to bring back adorable bunnies cupped in their hands. Children would drool over them. These leverets of the wild Rufous-tailed hares were usually unearthed while slashing ‘waste’ grasses and shrubs. In the countryside encircling Chandigarh, hares were common. At night, they would astound travellers on a dusty track by getting transfixed in car headlights or race along for a distance. But these ‘lesser forms’ of biodiversity have been relegated to grandpa memories or rare sightings. Our children will never savour the joy and wonder of cradling a wild bunny.Known as ‘saiha’ or ‘seha’ in Punjabi, hares have reduced due to the application of fertilisers and pesticides, and the reclamation of grasslands and scrublands for crops and colonies. An increasing population of stray dogs also takes a toll on hares. Hare meat is a delicacy. Tribal or village poachers with hound packs leave hares with minimal chances of escape. When wounded by gunshot, hares let out the most heart-rending and piteous cries not unlike human children tortured by stereotypical stepmothers. The day is not far when hares will virtually disappear from the countryside like the hedgehogs or ‘jhar chuhas’ of yore.Teri bindiya reDepictions of Nature in painting are lush in expression and symbolism but their interpretation, or the so-called ‘meaning’ embedded in them, may elude audiences uninitiated to aesthetic review. Herein, lies the beauty of art that it can lend itself to differing interpretations or the construction of a ‘story’ according to the particularities of a viewer’s sensibilities. At the recent 19th all-India annual exhibition hosted by the WE Group of Contemporary Women Artists at Government Museum and Art Gallery, a painting depicting the gentle beauty of the water world and washed in soft, understated colours caught the eye, though no award was bestowed on it.Painted by Seema Gupta of the faculty of visual arts, Banaras Hindu University, viewers wondered at the meaning of the half-moon-like lady immersed like a Durga Puja idol. “The round bindi on her forehead seems indicative of the circle of continuity, rejuvenation and renewal; the depiction merges Nature into a mother-like figure. The universal mother beckons and nourishes all beings from the fish trying to embrace it to the lotus blooming under her care,” was the considered view of one visitor nurturing cultural and aesthetic sensibilities.The paintings were kept untitled —deliberately by organisers — to encourage interpretations free of the artists’ agenda. But left clueless, some viewers found Gupta’s work mysterious, and it was but natural for them to wonder what the artist had in mind. ‘Was the ethereal woman drowning with a gentle smile?’ Our cultures celebrate the ‘bindi’ but are there unseen, unfelt shadows to the brow’s luminous moon?When I spoke to Gupta, she revealed her work’s title: Inner Beauty. “When it comes to depicting beauty, it is the woman’s beauty which is forever foremost. However, many thoughts — unknown to all and more than those nurtured by men — race through a woman’s mind, like a fish wandering listlessly, going ‘idhar-udhar’ in the dark depths. Like the lotus, a woman presents a beautiful, happy face to the world, though her heart may be brimming with untold sadness,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzzhear-the-silent-cry-101615657605160.html

What’s more, visitors can be seen openly flouting the mask norms, putting their own and others’ lives at risk. With at least 1,000 private and government-run buses departing from and entering the city, the inter-state bus stand sees a huge footfall on a daily basis, thereby increasing the chances of infection. Harmeet Singh, a city resident who travels to Doraha every day for work, says, “Authorities should not drop guard at this point. The number of cases are increasing rapidly. With no checks in place, the chances of infection become higher and as there is barely any record of visitors or passengers, contract tracing may also prove difficult.” Rakesh, another visitor at the bus stand, said, “With no checking in place, everyone is just responsible for themselves. Even bus conductors do not wear masks.”While authorities stated that required steps will be taken to start screening of passengers, the buses staff claimed that it becomes difficult for them to perform their duty with a mask on. A PRTC conductor, requesting anonymity, said, “It becomes impossible for us to speak loudly, to inform passengers about the bus destination, while wearing a mask. Also, the mask sometimes causes itching due to the scorching heat.”Station supervisor Jasvir Sahota said, “The administration had deployed special staff for conducting thermal screening of visitors. I will check why it has been discontinued. Further, our staff members continuously ask visitors to wear masks and police have also been issuing challans to violators at the bus stand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-rising-covid-cases-ludhiana-bus-stand-authorities-drop-guard-101615657544546.html

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||2 FIRs lodged against farmers for illegal construction, digging borewell at Kundli||Rohtak A man from Punjab (Karam Singh) was booked by name in two FIRs registered against farmers for constructing brick-mortar houses and digging borewell along the highway at Kundli on the complaint of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) project director Anand Singh and Kundli municipal council secretary Pawan Kumar. Police also visited the protest site at Kundli and asked the farmers to stop all brick-and-mortar constructions. The FIRs have been registered under sections 283 (whoever, by doing any act, or by omitting to take order with any property in his possession or under his charge, causes danger, obstruction or injury to any person ) and 431(mischief by injury to public road, bridge, river or channel) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 8-B of the National Highway Act, 1956. In the second FIR, the police booked Punjab farmer Karam Singh and others under Section 188 of the IPC and Section 8-B of the National Highway Act, 1956, for digging borewell near KFC in Kundli. Kundli SHO Ravi Kumar said, “The complainants stated farmers have constructed homes along the Chandigarh–Delhi national highway and dug borewell. We visited the spot and asked the farmers to stop all construction.” Farmers getting summer-ready As the summer is approaching, the farmers protesting against three farm laws since November have started constructing low-cost brick houses at Tikri and Kundli-Singhu borders along the Rohtak-Delhi road in Bahadurgarh, eyeing for a long haul. Deepak Ahlawat, a farmer from Jhajjar said they had used tents and tractor-trolleys as shelter homes during the winter but as the harvesting of Rabi crop is on, the tractors are moving back to the villages. “We are constricting make-shift homes so that we don’t suffer in summers. We are also asking the farmers to help in harvesting the crops of those staying put at protest sites,” he added. “These permanent brick structures are being constructed by farmers at individual levels as a preparation for summers in order to install fans, coolers, and ACs, and to keep out flies and mosquitoes,” said Paramjit Singh of Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmers’ unions. “This government is having a misconception that the farmers will leave the site without getting their demands fulfilled. We won’t and that has been our stand since the beginning,” Abhimanyu Kohar, a senior member of SKM told PTI. “The construction of permanent houses tells everyone about the determination of our farmers. We are preparing for the long haul, six months or one year, we won’t budge,” he added. Beside concrete houses, the farmers were also seen beautifying the surrounding area by planting trees and flowers. They are also putting up benches and make-shift canopy to give farmers some respite from scorching heat during the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-firs-lodged-against-farmers-for-illegal-construction-digging-borewell-at-kundli-101615656824535.html

13-03-2021||Noida||Man nabbed for duping people on pretext of govt jobs||Noida: A 29-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for allegedly duping people of lakhs of rupees on the pretext of helping them get government jobs.The suspect was identified as Mukesh Kumar, a native of Deoria district, who was living with his family in a high-rise in Greater Noida West. He has worked with a public sector bank in Lucknow earlier, police said.“In Noida, the suspect would often hang out outside a cooperative society of a public sector oil marketing company in Sector 62 to show people that he lived there. He would use a different name and contact people through social media, pretending to be AGM of the company. Then he would offer to help them get jobs in that company for which he charged hefty fees,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1.Police officials said that so far five victims have been identified -- two from Rajasthan and the rest from Noida. The suspect has duped people of different amounts ranging from ₹4 lakh to 20 lakh, they said.“He has at least one more accomplice that we have identified. We are working to nab him as well. We recovered two fake appointment letters from him as well. He had recently purchased an SUV and used two iPhones which were also seized. During questioning, he also revealed that he had spent over ₹35 lakh in his father’s treatment in Lucknow,” said the ACP.Kumar was nabbed from Sector 62, police said, adding that his bank accounts are being looked at and will be frozen.The suspect, a graduate from Gorakhpur University, has been duping people for over 18 months now, said police.

13-03-2021||Other||Guest column: The nuts and bolts of vaccinating a country||There is no magic in magic, it’s all in the details,” said the master storyteller, Walt Disney. As India rolls out vaccines across the country, this advice should encourage officials to focus on the nuts and bolts of vaccination.The inoculations will require granular planning in scheduling, determining disseminating centres, sending communications to recipients, recruitment of adequate volunteers, safe storage and transportation of vaccines, maintenance of records, watching for side effects and keeping track of second jabs. Ideally, all information should be stored digitally so that health authorities can easily access it during follow-ups.Countries have begun with determining priority groups. Generally, these are health workers, the army and police.Senior citizens, the aged, and infirm, may have comorbidities. These citizens should be told to register with local hospitals and then visit on predetermined days for inoculations. Those who are unable to travel should be inoculated at home. The challenge will be to vaccinate millions of ordinary citizens under the age of 60. The census data with local governments will be of immense value in managing micro-localities. They will help to establish the exact number of people, their location and the doses to be administered daily. Citizens will have to be inoculated by geographical zones. Depending on the quantum of vaccines available, municipalities will have to prepare schedule for vaccinations by locality and communicate them digitally. They can allocate time schedules as per specific zones .A key element in inoculating the population will be to determine the exact number of doses to be disbursed daily to vaccination centres. This is akin to the demand forecasting models employed by corporations. Municipalities can calibrate the number of doses required in any town or locality through computer modelling. The model would need input such as population size, ages, locations of people and indicative ratios of people coming for inoculations in neighbourhoods and transport availability. The recruitment and training of an adequate number of health workers to inoculate citizens could prove challenging. Even retired health workers such as doctors and nurses should be asked to pitch in for administering jabs in nearby hospitals. Vaccines should be stored in the cold storages of hospitals and health clinics. The help of the private sector can also be sought, for accessing their cold storage facilities and disseminating the vaccines.Health authorities should maintain meticulous records of the names, ages and contact details of people who have been inoculated. This will also help to ensure that they return for the second jab.Inoculating a billion people in India is a tough call and as such we should enrol the private sector actively. Large corporations such as Tata and Unilever have their own clinics with doctors and medical staff in offices and factories. These companies should be given vaccines to inoculate their staff .While vaccinating slums, it would be useful to establish vaccination centres on sites. Vaccination can be undertaken in educational institutes. If there are enough vaccines, we could order them online. Pharmacies could pack ‘do-it-yourself’ kits. This can happen in 24 to 30 months.

13-03-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand govt clears 75% quota for locals in private sector industry||The government of Jharkhand has approved an employment policy that requires 75 per cent of jobs in private sector industrial units to be reserved for locals, sources in the government said. The rule would be applicable for jobs up to the salary of ₹30,000 per month, officials said.Confirming the development, a minister who was part of the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday, said on condition of anonymity that the policy aims at reserving jobs for locals in the industrial units in the state."The cabinet has cleared the employment policy providing for reserving seats for locals. As of now, it will be implemented in the industrial units. In due course, other sectors could also follow," said the minister.The minister, however, refused to share the policy's blueprint, saying it will be made public at an opportune time. Sources said the chief minister is likely to make a formal announcement over the decision coming week in the ongoing budget session of the Jharkhand assembly.Also read: JMM backing TMC in WB is different; alliances are state specific - J'khand CongSources said the government is unlikely to bring any bill at this stage to back the decision. "A separate Act is not required as the new features in the employment policy could be implemented through an executive order cleared by the cabinet," a source said.Reserving jobs in the private sector was a poll promise of the ruling dispensation for the 2019 assembly election, besides increasing quota for the scheduled categories in the government jobs and educational institutions in the state in proportion to their population.Another important decision that was taken in the cabinet meeting, sources said, was giving a nod to paying an annual unemployment allowance for the trained youths registered in the state for jobs but yet to be employed.Reacting to the development, the opposition BJP said while they welcome any decision that is for the state’s youth, the party said they have doubts over effective implementation of such schemes of the Hemant Soren government.“We welcome anything good for the locals. We would comment on the decision of the government only after the government comes out with the draft of the policy officially. However, we have serious doubts that these schemes would help the beneficiaries. It is likely to meet the same fate as the agricultural loan waiver announcement which has hardly benefitted the needy as yet,” said Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo.BJP government in Haryana has recently come up with a similar decision reserving 75 per cent of jobs in the private sector for the locals. However, the salary cap in the northern state has been kept higher.Reacting to the upcoming policy of the Hemant Soren government, president of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FJCCI), Praveen Jain Chhabra said in-principle they were not against such a reservation policy but the government should simultaneously help in developing skilled labour force within the state.“Basically, the labour in the industry is classified as unskilled and skilled. Most of the unskilled labours employed in the industry here are locals. As far as skilled labour goes, a certain percentage of such workforce could be from outside. We would like the government to push for setting up skill development centres, as they have also talked in the industrial policy, and help the industry in recruiting workforce locally,” said the FJCCI president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-govt-clears-75-quota-for-locals-in-private-sector-industry-101615655721262.html

The trio is among nine people facing charges of kidnapping and torturing Rahul Mehta, the only surviving heir of his family, in April 2017 to secure the general power of attorney of his 338-square-yard house and selling it to Manish’s brother for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019. Constables statement did Rajdeep in According to the FIR, lodged on the complaint of Mehta’s tenant Pradeep Ratan, the inspector, who was the then SHO of the Sector-39 police station, had failed to take action against Mahajan, bouncer Surjit Singh and Shekhar, who had forcibly occupied Mehta’s house. During investigation, sources privy to it said, two constables exposed Rajdeep’s involvement in the property grab case. In their statement before the SIT, the constables said the complaint lodged by Ratan in January 2019 was brushed aside as a dispute between landlord and tenant, even when the complaint was about house trespass and forcible occupation of a house. Ratan had alleged that the property grabbers had also assaulted him and misbehaved with him. However, the SHO, who himself dealt with the matter, ignored this as well. Rajdeep is accused of being part of the conspiracy, and being aware of the house grab and treatment meted out to Mehta by the accused. The police will be questioning him about the circumstances under which he obliged the accused by not acting on the tenant’s complaint. They also want to question him about the whereabouts of the complaint as well as the mental health certificate of Mehta, which was allegedly removed by him. Ratan had alleged in the FIR that Rajdeep removed the certificate, which was attached with his complaint, and kept it in his pocket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sho-arrested-in-chandigarh-house-grab-case-sent-to-two-day-police-custody-101615655264354.html

Even though the drive for senior citizens began just this month, they constitute the major chunk with 11,963 getting the jab so far. Meanwhile, only 931 comorbid people in the age group of 45-59 years have been vaccinated.Apart from them, 6,336 frontline workers and 4,955 healthcare workers have been covered. Of them, 1,982 and 2,903, respectively, have got the second shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-panchkula-logs-62-cases-highest-this-year-101615654304248.html

13-03-2021||Other||Random forays: Innovative young officers can change the country||Times are currently so sullen that any innovative initiative undertaken in any district of India is bound to draw ‘oohs and aahs’. Angst-ridden news permeates our consciousness with such alarming regularity that any heartening story of compassion and change for the better is likely to resonate affably with our highest thought levels.Young officers from medical services, defence services, administrative services, police services, allied services, technical and other services have largely served the nation with great valour and grit, especially in recent times. Some of them have shone like beacons of excellence and have blazed a creative trail in public service to pull the populace out of many a quagmire.Young IAS officer Aditya Ranjan’s ‘co-bot’ innovation during the pandemic in a Jharkhand district, south Sikkim district collector Raj Yadav’s village adoption scheme, Shashanka Ala’s campaign against malnutrition in Mizoram, IPS officer Sanjukta Parashar’s already legendary campaign to combat Bodo terrorists in Assam are some relatively recent instances of high-performance work by civil servants in the face of grave challenges. Such tales of far-reaching and path-breaking efforts should kindle in other officers across the land the innate urge to create some magic of their own for the larger good. The common man seeks and indeed yearns for better governance at the ground level and will clutch at any straws of succour that the system can throw up. By breaking the dusty mould and ideating differently to provide an embalming touch, an officer of any department can make a mark in his or her own sphere.Furthermore, budgetary allocations or government sanctions are often not needed for undertaking certain innovations in governance systems. An officer can innovate and break the mould without needing approval from ‘higher authorities’ in many cases. Keeping one’s immediate superior informed is a good idea though! Why allow the familiar ego conundrum to stifle a good cause in the making?One of the most soothing-to-the-soul ideas that someone happened to come up with during a previous avatar was the ‘aadar samman’ initiative, which entailed treating the elderly with utmost respect in all offices of the district. They were welcomed, guided, aided and given a cup of tea wherever possible in government offices, big and small. Those above the age of 70 were also counselled by psychologists, legal advisors and financial experts on their personal matters as part of the initiative. The district police, in the meantime, stepped up the beat system of policing and conducted regular contact programmes, especially in localities inhabited by elderly persons living alone.Another initiative that worked well was to increase the number of public dealing hours per day in the office of the Licensing Authority instead of allowing the staff to spend half the day in compilation and calculation work. Outstanding staff members were issued certificates for their efficiency. Speedier disposal of pending applications and a welcome boost to the image of the administration was the result.Every official, at whatever level or vertical he is operating, can certainly infuse a certain amount of energy in his team by taking command and being a forthright communicator with a no-nonsense yet caring approach. That balanced acumen to deliver the goods without stepping on people’s toes is rare but can be cultivated by all young officers as they grow in the service.The concept of mentorship of young officers is much-needed idea too. I had brought this up earlier too, in this column. The police services have adopted such mentoring in parts, but there is a need for it to be comprehensive and meticulously implemented. Youngsters in various services are usually left to fend for their own selves and often their immediate bosses do not have the time or the wherewithal to guide them. Willing and able mentors need to be identified in each service.The willingness, and indeed yearning, to make a mark and solve some of the country’s problems, even at a minor scale, has to be the aim of every sarkari newbie. The whirlpool of systemic forces will very soon sweep them off their feet if they don’t dig in with such determination at the very outset!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/random-forays-innovative-young-officers-can-change-the-country-101615653764197.html

However, the meteorological (MeT) department has predicted another wet spell here for the next two days.“Since (Saturday) morning, we witnessed mostly dry weather, but there are chances of light rain at isolated places during the night,” a MeT official here said, adding, “There will be moderate precipitation at some places for the next two days.”Due to the overcast skies, the maximum day temperature has plunged while the night temperature has been hovering around normal.“On Friday, the day temperature in Srinagar dropped 10 degrees to settle at 4.6°C as against a normal of 14.7°C,” he said.The minimum temperature in Srinagar on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday was 3.8°C, while Pahalgam and Gulmarg recorded minimum night temperatures of -0.7°C and -2.6°C, respectively.On Friday, the higher reaches of Kashmir had received fresh snowfall while rain lashed other parts of the valley as the weather conditions remained erratic.Qazigund in south Kashmir recorded a maximum of 30.8mm rainfall in 24 hours ending Saturday morning while there was 6.5cm snowfall in Pahalgam in south Kashmir, and 2cm snow was recorded in the northern district of Kupwara.The Jammu-Srinagar national highway, which was closed for traffic on Friday, remained shut on Saturday too.The officials said the road was hit by landslides at Ramban.“The work to clear the road is going on. It is yet to be decided whether the road will be opened tomorrow or not. There is a prediction of more rainfall on Sunday,” said an official of the traffic control room.Meteorological department director Sonam Lotus has predicated erratic weather till March 15. “We expect a significant decrease in rain from March 12, but the weather is likely to remain erratic till March 15,” he said while warning about the possibility of landslides and avalanches at vulnerable spots as the land is fully saturated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/another-wet-spell-likely-in-valley-from-today-101615653652479.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to pay farmers through ahrtiyas, says state minister||Punjab food, civil supplies, and consumer affairs minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Saturday said that the state government is paying the farmers through ahrtiyas (also known as commissioning agents) as per the provisions of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act.Ashu also said that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh made it clear that the payments made to farmers will directly reach them through ahrtiyas. “Accoridng to the rules of APMC Act, we are paying farmers through ahrtiyas. The chief minister made it clear that payments will directly reach farmers through ahrtiyas,” Ashu was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Ahrtiyas are commissioning agents who help farmers sell their crops to buyers. Ahrtiyas facilitate the transaction between farmers and buyers - the buyers can be a person, a firm or a company or a cooperative society or a government agency or even to a public undertaking agency, a public agency or a corporation - and receive a commission for facilitating the transaction following which they pay farmers money for their crops.The minister's declaration comes in the backdrop of the farm laws protests which allows the farmer to operate outside APMCs, which negates the role of the ahrtiyas as farmers can now sell their produce to any prospective buyer anywhere in the country. The Centre on the other hand believes in sending the money to farmers directly in their bank accounts, which the Punjab government is reluctant to do.The Centre last month had said that the direct transfer of payments of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers’ accounts is a method ‘to check diversion and avoid delays’. It stressed that the Punjab and Haryana governments need to ‘compulsorily’ use electronic modes of payment to pay MSP to farmers.Ashu along with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had sought permission from the home minister Amit Shah last month to disburse the payments for the upcoming wheat procurement, expected to begin from April 1 in Punjab through the commission agents. The Centre had asked the Punjab government to make the payments directly or through Ahrtiyas, according to an HT report.Earlier on Monday, the Punjab chief minister said that the Centre’s move on direct payment to farmers is an act of provocation after the Food Corporation of India (FCI) sought land records from the Punjab government to make e-payment to the farmers directly for crop procurement, according to a PTI report.“The system of paying farmers through ahrtiyas is a time-tested system in place since 1967. Farmers hold an excellent relationship with ahrtiyas and can depend upon them when they face financial difficulties during adverse situations, can farmers rely on big corporate houses in times of crisis?” the chief minister said.Arhtiyas are also a major part of the ongoing protests against the farm laws at Delhi’s borders. In December, the IT department had conducted raids on several ahrtiyas following which the commissioning agents closed mandis across Punjab for four days in protest. Farmers' leaders and Punjab ministers called the move an attempt to defame the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-pay-farmers-through-ahrtiyas-says-state-minister-101615652300622.html
13-03-2021||Other||Ahead of bypoll, politics heats up in HP’s Fatehpur segment||Even as the schedule for bypoll in Fatehpur assembly segment is yet to be announced, political temperatures have already started rising in the constituency.The seat was vacated after the death of sitting legislator and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania on February 12.While Congress has almost finalised its candidate, the BJP is keeping its cards close to the chest. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Saturday visited Fatehpur to gauge the public mood and doled out sops with an eye on the elections.However, the bypoll would not be an easy one for the saffron party, which is on a winning spree in the state since 2017. Former Rajya Sabha member Kripal Parmar is the front-runner for the BJP ticket. But a rival camp in the party is trying to push for Baldev Thakur’s name. Thakur contested the 2017 assembly polls as an independent candidate and polled more than 12,000 votes resulting in narrowly losing the election. Just ahead of the CM’s visit, a poster against Parmar was pasted overnight in the constituency.Former MP Rajan Sushant who has floated his own outfit “Apni Party Himachal Party” is also ready to queer the pitch for BJP. He had contested the 2017 as an Independent and polled more than 6,000 votes.On the other hand, Congress would probably field Bhawani Singh Pathania, son of late Sujan Singh Pathania to cash in sympathy votes.Bhawani, who worked the top position in a private insurance company, is a political greenhorn who inherits the legacy of his father and would be expected to carry it forward. Like his father, Bhawani is popular for his humble behaviour.CM doles out sopsMeanwhile, eyeing a win in the bypoll, CM Jai Ram Thakur on a day-long visit doled out sops to Fatehpur assembly segment on Saturday.He announced sub-tehsil for Raja Ka Talab to be opened in the premises of the office of commissioner (relief and rehabilitation); ₹2 crore for building a government degree college; ₹20 lakh each for creation of sports facilities in Rahan Stadium and Ex-Servicemen Bhawan in the first phase; upgrade of various schools and new road projects to link rural areas.Addressing a public meeting at Rehan, the CM said his government got only two years to serve the people as one entire year was lost to Covid-19 pandemic. “Still, we have been able to live up to the expectations of the people,” he said, thanking them for their support in fighting coronavirus.He urged the people to support the government in the upcoming elections to the four municipal corporations (MCs) and by-election in Fatehpur.Earlier, the CM laid foundation stones of nine developmental works of Public Works Department and Jal Shakti Vibhag worth ₹29.27 crore in the Fatehpur sub-division.Addressing the rally, state BJP chief Suresh Kashyap said the BJP will win all the four MCs and Fatehpur segment in the upcoming polls. He urged people to provide their full support to the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ahead-of-bypoll-politics-heats-up-in-hp-s-fatehpur-segment-101615653284143.html

A trap was laid and the accused was arrested after a brief exchange of fire, they said. "A shootout took place in the early hours of Saturday between a police team and Gehlot in which he got injured," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said.One pistol with two live rounds and one revolver loaded with four live rounds were recovered from his possession along with the car, he said.Interrogation revealed that the accused killed an Uttam Nagar-based property dealer named Mehta to take revenge from him for hatching a conspiracy to kill his uncle Parveen Gehlot, who was a member of Manjit Mahal-Pradeep Solanki gang, he said.His uncle was engaged in grabbing properties illegally with the help of gang members. There was a property dispute between Parveen and Pardeep Solanki following which, Vikas Dalal, who was a sharp shooter of their gang, killed Parveen in May 2019 on the directions of Solanki. However, Dalal was also killed in the incident, the officer said.After his uncle was killed, Kamal decided to take revenge but was arrested in two robbery cases. He was lodged in Tihar jail where he joined Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali, a rival gang of Manjeet Mahal and Pradeep Solanki gang, police said.After coming out from jail, he killed Vikas Mehta by shooting him in the head thrice. He also took pictures after murdering him, the officer added.Pawan Gehlot, who is father of accused Kamal Gehlot has already been arrested for conspiring to murder Mehta, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/21yearold-wanted-criminal-held-following-shootout-in-west-delhi-police-101615652670044.html

When his wife answered the door bell, one of the men put a gun to her head and forcibly took away his daughter, a student of Class 12.As his younger daughter raised the alarm from the roof, the complainant and some villagers pursued the accused’s Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire till Jagatpura village and even smashed its windowpane with sticks, but they managed to speed away.The father said after he came to know of his daughter’s online friendship with Raja around four days ago, he had confiscated her mobile phone. But, Raja started calling his wife’s phone and also threatened to kidnap his daughter. “The accused and the girl have been friends for three months. She is aged 18 as per her documents,” said Harvinder Singh Virk, superintendent of police (SP, City) Mohali. Raja and his accomplices have been booked under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sohana police station. “A manhunt has been launched to trace the accused and rescue the girl,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/18yearold-girl-kidnapped-from-home-at-gunpoint-in-mohali-101615652684199.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Reclaiming the lost art of letter writing||For someone who grew up writing letters, from just about the time I learned to form short sentences in the early 60s, it is difficult to recall to whom I wrote the last letter and when. Perhaps, it was sometime in the late 90s as by the start of the new millennium even season’s greeting cards had become a thing of the past and one had started picking up cards with standardised messages and emailing them. Soon, one began simply sending a single message to all friends on Facebook with a pretty picture in tow. And for some years now it has just been festive messages on WhatsApp. But many have wondered, in prose and sometimes in poetry, about what became of all those letters that one wrote on stormy nights and sent to many a destination.Letters: Then and nowWe are quick to adapt and accept change as inevitable, thus not much thought has been given to what Gen Z has missed by forgoing this form of communication that had been nurtured for thousands of years in different cultures and chiseled to perfection. A few years back when my four-year-old granddaughter came back from a school excursion brimming with questions as she had visited a post office, I realised how she knew nothing of what to our generation had been a way of life. There was a tug at the heart when she asked all kinds of questions. “Tell me Naani, what is a post office?” she asked. Trying to explain it all to this child of a different world a hundred memories stirred in my mind and I was reminded of a Punjabi folk song by the legendary Surinder Kaur ‘Tainu deangi panj patase veh munshi khat likh de’. The song has an unlettered village girl pleading with the clerk to write a letter to her husband who is far away and the price she offers for this task is five sugar crystals!Now, before I go off on a tangent let me come to the point. I have this refreshing book in hand, in which present-day children have written letters of all kinds to the famous and the infamous. Forgive me, I will romance the letter another time though it is long overdue. The book is called ‘Unlocking Minds: Covid-19’ and its pleasing pastel cover has a notepad and a pen as and a letter beginning with ‘Dear Bhagat Singh’ and the Greek poet Sappho besides envelopes addressed to Adolf Hitler, Rosa Parks and Neil Armstrong! This amazing collection of letters, penned by young minds, is the brainchild of Chandigarh-based writer-academic Kanwalpreet Singh. Many would remember Kanwalpreet for penning sensitively the autobiography of much-loved pioneering woman activist of Punjab, Oshima Raikhy.Admiration and angstTalking about ‘Unlocking Minds’, Kanwal says: “This book is a first of its kind where Millennials have written letters to famous personalities in the form of a heart-to-heart talk, sometimes in admiration and at other times in angst.When I floated this idea of letter writing amid the pandemic, my young friends said they loved the concept. Soon we got down to work by framing a proposal and circulating it. A lot of positive response came from the young ones, when we gave the call in April 2020.” Children and adolescents were given enough time to read, research and then put down their thoughts on paper and their hard work shows in the way they have been able to deal analytically with the lives and impact of dictators, politicians, artists, poets, sports persons and many others.The list of personalities chosen is interesting and varied. It includes Benito Mussolini, Mahatma Gandhi, Indira Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, Ruskin Bond, MF Husain, Charlie Chaplin, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Karl Marx and many more. Students of all age groups participated in the epistolary exercise from Class-3 student Dhiren Aggarwal to Class-12 student Ameek Kaur, who penned a poignant letter to the Hathras rape victim.The book also incudes some essays on lockdown experiences and interviews by students with frontline warriors ranging from doctors to safai karamcharis. A fine effort by one and all.The letters, of course, are the mainstay of the book and before signing off I go back to the internet to browse through hundreds of nostalgic and heartwarming quotes encapsulating the spirit of the lost art of letter writing and would like to leave you with a quote by Alena Hall: “There’s something sacred and romantic, in the broadest sense about communicating in the way generations before us once did. It’s how grandma and grandpa kept their love alive during wartime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-reclaiming-the-lost-art-of-letter-writing-101615651784942.html

Little did they know, that only after a few months, they will have to fight a war for their country as young officers.Out of the 338 cadets from this course who were commissioned into the service, seven officers lost their lives in the war. These 13 war veterans who are now in their 70s and live in Pune, gathered at the National War Memorial with their families to pay tribute to their late course mates.“It was a golden moment for all of us when as young officers we were commissioned into the service. I remember exactly 50 years before on this day (March 13, 1971) our passing out parade was taking place at OTA Chennai and Chief of the Army Staff General Sam Manekshaw was the chief guest. In a matter of a few months we taught a war under his leadership,” said Col (Retd) Alok Ghosh . He was commissioned in the Regiment of Artillery during the 1971 war. “After the completion of the course, we were commissioned in different departments and at various places. But we all are still in touch and try to meet once in a month,” said Col (Retd) Ghosh.Brigadier (Ret) Hari Sahi (73), was merely a 23-year-old officer in Army Service Core when he received an order to train the young fighters of Mukti Bahini in August 1971. “Our camp was in the deep jungle on the eastern border. We trained the young officers in Muktivahini for three weeks and later advanced towards Bogura. Though the actual war had begun on December 3, 1971, the preparation was on from several months,” Brigadier (Retd) recalled.Colonel (Retd) Abhijit Verma (73) was commissioned in engineering and he also trained Mukti Bahini fighters for several months. “We trained them how to blow up the bridges, how to use the equipment. Even after the war was over I was still in newly formed Bangladesh for the restoration work,” said Colonel (Retd) Verma.Captain (Retd) Tanaji Pawar (72), meanwhile, was part of the Maratha Light Infantry during the 1971 war. “My regiment was at the Hilli bridge. It is the place which was in East Pakistan near Balu ghat. I was guarding the bridge against the enemy forces. We got to fight the war just in a matter of a few months. We got the opportunity to fight for our nation,” said Captain (Retd) Pawar.Colonel (Retd) Yeshwant Mane was posted on the western border of India much ahead of Jaisalmer to hold the enemy on that side. “I was in Engineering and our job was to stall the enemy on the western border. We fought in the desert and every time I nearly escaped death. My soldiers fought fearlessly. I consider myself fortunate to have received an opportunity to serve the nation,” said Colonel (Retd) Mane.According to these war veterans, this war also have them a perspective on humanity. “After an enemy soldier surrenders, he is not an enemy anymore. We give them food, give shelter. In the war of 1971, 93,000 prisoners of war were captured. It the historic figure in modern human history,” said Major (Retd) Bajaj who was commissioned in Punjab Regiment in the 1971 war.The battle of Bogura was a major battle fought in the 1971 war. Major (Retd) TS. Bevli was part of this battle. He remembered the bravery of his observation post officer S Parmar who was later awarded Vir Chakra. “I saw him taking a bullet in his chest. Fortunately, he survived that injury. Leadership means everything in the Army. I operated a mountain gun in this battle,” said Major (Retd) Belvi.These also remembered the moment when they received the news of the enemy’s surrender. It was a moment of jubilation and of the pride they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/golden-jubilee-of-1971-war-veterans-pay-tribute-to-martyrs-recall-war-days-101615651364265.html

Four sacked teachers, along with 10 other teachers, and two bus drivers, have been protesting while using loudspeakers on the school premises since February 24 seeking their reinstatement. They were sacked in September last year after the school administration allegedly found them indulging in ‘anti-school’ activities. The protest has started at the school gate, but they entered school premises 17 days ago. The court said, “The matter involved in the present case is with regard to the future of thousands of students. The examination of these students is yet to be conducted and a peaceful atmosphere is very much essential for the above purpose,”On March 3, the court had directed protesters to take their protest to over 100 metre away from the premises of school. The protesters, however, did not comply with the order.Anish Kant Sharma, advocate for plaintiff, informed the court that neither the protesters are moving from school nor SHO of Ajitwal is ready to move anything to remove the protest. “The SHO is claiming that there is no direction to him to remove the protest, so police cannot do anything,” Sharma informed the court, adding that the future of over 1,000 students is at stake, but the administration was not doing anything. Sharma added, “The protest is totally illegal. The school administration is compelled to hold examinations at Gurudwara Sahib in the village, but there are also other ceremonies like ‘Anand Karaj’ and Bhog. On these dates, examination of students cannot be arranged,” he informed the court. Due to the protest, the school administration was forced to cancel the ongoing pre-board examinations and classes. Board exams are to start at the school from Tuesday.After the court order, Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans also ordered the SHO to implement the court order. Later, heavy police force, especially women cops have been deployed at school by district cops. The protest, however, was still on inside the school till the filing of this report. Nihal Singh Wala DSP Parsan Singh said, “We will remove the protest from the school soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-orders-sho-to-remove-sacked-teachers-protest-from-moga-school-101615648664059.html

Nandigram is the assembly constituency in the eastern state from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), who is seeking a third term, will contest.“We’re going to Nandigram to tell people that crops are not being purchased at MSP (Minimum Support Price). We’ll appeal to them to not vote for BJP as they’ve robbed the entire country,” Tikait, who has been credited with single-handedly reviving the movement after violence during farmers’ rally in Delhi on January 26, said, as per news agency ANI.West Bengal: Sanyukt Kisan Morcha held a 'mahapanchayat' in Kolkata against 3 farm laws"We're going to Nandigram to tell people that crops are not being purchased at MSP.

A maximum number of penalised people are from Pune city followed by rural Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, said, officials.Saurabh Rao, Pune divisional commissioner, said, that the penalties collected on mask violations are not a means of revenue for the administration. He said, “We do not have any intentions to increase the penalty amount from the current ₹500. However, we will come down heavily on people who continue to flout Covid-appropriate behaviour. Collecting fines for mask violations is not a means of revenue for the administration.”Ayush Prasad, chief, executive officer, Zillla Parishad, said, “We have penalised people in almost every village and sometimes even people below the poverty line are fined, but they refuse to wear masks and opt to pay penalty. Despite repeatedly appealing to the citizens to wear masks we find many flouting the norm.”As of Friday (March 12), Pune district has reported over 4.33 lakh of which 4.02 lakh have recovered and 8,170 have been declared as dead, according to the state health department. Currently, 21,788 are active cases undergoing treatment in hospitals or in home isolation. Pune continues to report the highest active cases in the state.As of now, the district’s positivity rate is about 14.3 per cent which is almost near the positivity rate which the district saw in August 2020, 19.6%, just a month before the September 2020 peak.Multiple analysis has shown that the district might witness its second wave peak in April 2021 which could be severe if restrictions are not in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-6lakh-people-fined-in-pune-for-violating-covid-norms-101615645903983.html

13-03-2021||Pune||Garden-goers, small businesses unhappy with fresh restrictions||With the summer vacation fast approaching, residents are unhappy over the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s decision of closing down public gardens in the city during evening hours. On Saturday, joggers, senior citizens, youngsters returned home with a pale look on their face with gardens authorities barring entry inside. “The garden will remain open only during morning hours from 6am to 10am, according to the district administration’s order issued on March 12. There are 200 gardens within the PMC limit and the normal rush was back in the garden from January after they reopened in November 2020. “My daily routine of evening walk will be disturbed again with the garden closing down. We have a group of senior citizens who come every day to the garden,” said Vijay Bhide who visits Tatyasaheb Thorat garden (also known as Shivaji garden), near Karve Putla. The garden department had to suffer losses of ₹11 crore during 11 months (March 2020 to January 2021) will be suffering more with the evening closure. The garden department revenue is generated from the exhibitions of flower, fruits and plants and selling saplings which is not happening at the moment. “With cases increasing, this decision was important to stop fresh Covid-19 cases as the crowd is almost back to normal at every garden. The department will suffer more losses, but we don’t have many options,” said Ashok Ghorpade, superintendent of gardens, PMC. “I prefer evening jogging than morning since there are more people in the garden in the morning but now I think I will switch again to the morning session,” said Vikram Joshi who went back to his home without jogging from Tatyasaheb Thorat garden. Street eateries fears lossesGanesh Khole of Sukhwandi Dablei centre who owns his business outside Tatyasaheb Thorat garden is worried if a lockdown will be imposed again. Khole fears he won’t be able to earn anything if a lockdown is imposed again. “70 per cent of customers who frequently visit us are from the garden but now it is closed again. It will impact the business,” Khole said. Parshuram Fawaday, Punam Bhel centre at Sambhaji Garden, JM road said, “The PMC has also closed the garden in the afternoon which makes operating the business more difficult for us.” There are 18 street eateries at Sambhaji garden premises which are also known as Hawkers area No 35. “Most of them ran away after the first lockdown. Few of them had started their business but they will remain closed from today. Our peak business hours are 4pm to 10pm,” added Fawaday. “Since January, the rush of people has increased. We keep on asking people to maintain a social distance and wear masks.

13-03-2021||City||TRS' litmus test as two crucial MLC seats in Telangana go to polls on Sunday||The elections to two vacant seats in the Telangana state legislative council from graduates’ constituencies will be held on Sunday and are being described as a litmus test for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi headed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.Polling will be held from 8 am to 4 pm in two graduates’ constituencies, each comprising three districts: Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar and Warangal-Khammam-Nalgonda. As many as 10,36,565 graduates including 3,67,808 women will exercise their franchise at 1,530 polling stations in these two constituencies.What makes this electoral battle more significant is that these six districts account for 75 out of 119 assembly constituencies in the state, thereby reflecting the mood of educated voters and indicating a possible outcome of the state assembly elections scheduled in 2023.“The victory or defeat in these MLC elections doesn’t make much of a difference to the TRS in terms of the numbers in the 40-member state legislative council as it has a huge majority with a strength of 36 members. But a defeat will indicate the voters’ perception against the ruling party which will have a bearing on its prospects in the coming elections,” political analyst Suresh Dharur said.Also read: Telangana alerts border districts amid Covid-19 surge in Maharashtra, KarnatakaThe immediate impact of these elections is expected to be on the by-election to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat likely to be held in April, besides elections to Khammam and Warangal municipal corporations, dates for which are yet to be decided.That is precisely why the TRS has taken the MLC elections to these two seats very prestigiously. The ruling party has already sensed the changing mood of the people with its defeat, albeit with a lesser margin, in the by-elections to Dubbak assembly seat in Medak district, followed by a serious drubbing in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections.The TRS has mobilised all its resources to win these two seats at any cost. For the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar graduates’ constituency, the party president has chosen Surabhi Vani Devi, daughter of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao.It is a strategic move on the part of KCR since the state has been celebrating the birth centenary year of Narasimha Rao, the only Telangana leader to rise to the position of the Prime Minister of the country. Naturally, the TRS wants to cash in on this Telangana sentiment.The TRS mobilised all its party machinery to campaign in support of Vani Devi. Right from the party working president and KCR’s son KT Rama Rao, daughter K Kavitha and nephew T Harish Rao, the entire battalion of cabinet plunged into action, covering every section of graduates’ community.KCR held an interaction with state government employees, who constitute a large chunk of graduate voters and promised them a salary hike of 29 per cent, as against 7 per cent recommended by the Pay Revision Commission.Since Vani Devi herself is an academic, the TRS made extensive campaign among the teaching community to attract their voters. “It is a masterstroke of KCR to field her in the MLC elections, as being the daughter of the former Prime Minister, she commands tremendous goodwill among the educated voters,” Dharur said.On the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in high spirits after its victory in Dubbak and an impressive show in the GHMC elections, is keen on repeating its performance in the MLC elections. It has once again fielded its sitting MLC N Ramachander Rao, who has huge support among the advocates, in Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahabubnagar constituency.What makes the contest more interesting in this constituency is the entry of Osmania University professor K Nageshwar who represented the seat twice in the past, as an independent. He is a prominent face among educated voters.The Congress fielded former minister G Chinna Reddy and TDP its state president L Ramana, but both have very bleak chances. Besides, as many as 88 other independent candidates are also in the fray.In Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda graduates’ constituency, where 71 contestants are in the fray, the fight is mainly between TRS candidate Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, the sitting MLC and Professor M Kodandaram of Telangana Jana Samithi.Kondandaram, once a protégé of KCR during the Telangana movement, fell apart from the latter and floated his own regional party before the 2018 assembly elections. Though he has not achieved any success in the electoral battle till now, he commands tremendous respect among the educated Telangana youth. That makes his chances of winning the MLC seat brighter.The BJP has fielded its general secretary G Premender Reddy, who has a considerable cadre base in Warangal, but the party has little presence in Khammam and Nalgonda and that might prove disadvantageous to him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trs-litmus-test-as-two-crucial-mlc-seats-in-telangana-go-to-polls-on-sunday-101615642947708.html
13-03-2021||Patna||RJD's Tejashwi Yadav says no chief minister is as 'weak' as Nitish Kumar||Slamming the Bihar government over the issue of liquor smuggling by a kin of a minister in the state cabinet, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Saturday claimed that no chief minister in the country is as "weak" as Nitish Kumar."The allegations of smuggling of liquor against a minister is a serious matter. The government must discuss this in the house. When there are serious allegations against his minister, Nitish Kumar has been absent. The government is scared and nervous. They are not allowing the Opposition to speak. They fear that we will show the evidence. There is no such weak chief minister in the country as Nitish Kumar," Yadav told mediapersons here.Hitting out at Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tarkishore Prasad, Yadav said, "The deputy chief minister is not a constitutional post. When the speaker is allowing me to speak then why is he interrupting. Who does give him the right to dictate the speaker? This government has made those people ministers who do not aware of the constitution."The RJD leader alleged that the state government has destroyed Bihar in every aspect."There is high inflation. Unemployment is at its peak. From farmers to students, all are unhappy. Women are not safe. The government is not allowing us to put our views in the House. It is a dictatorship. Vidhan Sabha has become the office of Janata Dal (United) and Bharatiya Janata Party," said Yadav.Earlier in the day, Tejashwi, Tej Pratap Yadav and other RJD MLAs held a protest march towards the Raj Bhawan after walking out of the Bihar assembly. They met the Governor and raised the issue before him.Notably, there was a ruckus in the Bihar assembly regarding the allegations of smuggling of illicit liquor against state minister Ramsurat Rai. The controversy surfaced after illicit liquor was recovered earlier this week from a school in Muzaffarpur run by Rai's brother.In 2016, Nitish Kumar banned alcohol consumption in Bihar making it a dry state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjds-tejashwi-yadav-says-no-chief-minister-is-as-weak-as-nitish-kumar-101615642336630.html

13-03-2021||Other||Andhra Pradesh's local job quota law cleared 20 months ago yet to pick up pace||A legislation passed by the Andhra Pradesh assembly, nearly 20 months ago, to reserve at least 75% of jobs for local candidates in private sector and public private partnership companies in the state has started slow on account of low industrial activity in the state, the lack of adequately trained local candidates, and the government decision to give time to companies to meet the quota.The Andhra Pradesh Employment of Local Candidates in the Industries and Factories Act, 2019 was passed in the state assembly on July 17, 2019. The legislation is yet to be implemented in full, as the state government has chosen to go slow in enforcing the law. “For existing industries which want to go in for expansion or fresh recruitment, we have given three years’ time to implement the new reservation law,” state industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy said.The state’s law has come into focus because of Haryana’s recent law, reserving for locals, 75% of jobs (paying under ₹50,000 a month) in new units, even in the private sector. The Andhra Pradesh law doesn’t mention a salary cap. The Andhra government insists that all new units submit details of the total workforce required under the heads skilled, semi-skilled, administrative and managerial employees.“The department of industries will grant the no-objection certificate (NOC) only after ascertaining that 75% of employees in all the departments are locals,” the minister said.A company can be exempted if it writes to the government that it requires specialised manpower, not available locally, but this will require an examination by the state industries department. “In such cases, the employers need to give an undertaking that they will train and engage local candidates within three years in close collaboration with government agencies. Otherwise, the NOC would be withdrawn,” Reddy said. Interestingly, there haven’t been too many new projects in the state in these 20 months.According to data from the industries department, between October 2019 and September 2020, 44 large and mega industrial projects were approved in the state with an investment of ₹22,282.16 crore, seeking to provide employment to 18,385 people; in the same period, as many as 10,019 micro, small and medium enterprises were proposed at an investment of ₹2,979.86 crore, aimed at providing employment to 76,716 people.According to Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation general secretary Potluri Bhaskar Rao, many of these ventures could not take off, due to coronavirus pandemic. “A few companies in the MSME sector have come up, but they could not find a suitable workforce locally,” Rao said.Vasireddy Murali Krishna, secretary of Federation of AP Small Industries Association, who owns a small-scale chemical business in Krishna district, said that generally, no industry or factory would prefer non-locals to work in their companies if sufficient local talent is available.“It is easy to get the work done with the locals. But where is the trained workforce locally? Even if we employ the locals as per the government guidelines, there is no guarantee that they would stick to the job. On the other hand, if we employ non-locals, they will work for at least a few years.”A businessman associated with the state unit of the Confederation of Indian Industry said on condition of anonymity that while most medium and small-scale industries employ only locals, irrespective of the enactment of the legislation by the state government, it is the “big players who engage people from outside the state in all their industries or major projects”.The businessman gave the example of the Polavaram irrigation and hydel power project built on Godavari river.”The majority of the workforce is from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Can the government insist on employing only local employees?” Hari Prasad, managing partner of Gautami Pumps and Valves said almost 30% of his employees are from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. “Unfortunately, there is a largescale attrition among the locals, whereas the non-locals stick to their job.”Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation chairman Challa Madhusudhan Reddy admitted that there was not enough local talent in the state, and added that as a result, the government was not strictly implementing the 75% rule. He added that the government has emphasised skill development to increase their employability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-pradesh-s-local-job-quota-law-cleared-20-months-ago-yet-to-pick-up-pace-101615641920960.html

The Ahmednagar police had moved an application before the court seeking attachment of Bothe’s property after April 11.Jare’s mother Sindhubai Waykar had lodged a case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) at Supa police station in the district.The accused arrested earlier had spilled the beans and revealed that Bothe had ordered them to kill Jare and even paid money for executing the murder“Six teams carried out a search operation and arrested him at 6.30 am. We were working on various leads and the operation lasted for five days. At three spots, he managed to checkmate the police, but we finally managed to nab him in one of the locked room of a hotel room in Hyderabad, “ said Patil.“A lawyer Janardhan Atkule, who protected him and three others who helped him have also been arrested. The number of arrests is likely to increase as we are investigating the role of all those who helped Bothe evade the law,” Patil said.With Bothe’s arrest, the total number of accused arrested in the case have gone to ten to date, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prime-accused-in-jare-murder-case-arrested-in-hyderabad-101615639063019.html

Devesh Trivedi, an IIT Delhi graduate, faced a similar problem a few years back, but he did not let it go. He decided to find a solution, using technology, and reducing human intervention. Trivedi, along with Sanchit (who only goes by his first name) founded Inspektlabs, an inspection-as-a-service software startup in 2018. Their software uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate photo and video-based inspection of assets like cars. Inspektlabs reduces the cost of inspection and time of insurance and automotive companies by almost 95 per cent, with their differentiating factor being the ability to detect not only the object, but also the state of the object, such as a scratch on it. Trivedi is an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi 2008 alumni. He worked as Senior Data Scientist at Inductis for 3.5 years and then did his MBA from the Indian School of Business in 2013. Trivedi has also worked with McKinsey as a managing consultant for 4.5 years. Sanchit is a computer vision specialist. He is also an IIT Delhi 2009 alumni and has finished his MBA from the Indian School of Business in 2014. He worked with the Indian Oil Corporation, Wipro and IBM in his initial career for six years. He then co-founded Curill, an artificial intelligence-technology powered healthcare startup in 2016. Sanchit then joined Zomato in 2018 as assistant vice-president, analytics, Zomato Gold. Sanchit and Trivedi have known each other for the last 10 years. Trivedi says, “After I left my job in February 2018, I was looking for some startup ideas. Once, I rented a car, but when I returned it, I was charged heavily for damages which I was not responsible for. That is when I started looking deeper into this issue. I realised then, that there is no automated way to detect damage to a car. I had worked with some insurance companies during my previous two jobs. I had some connects there, and so I worked on this idea.” Concept of Inspekt Labs is bornTrivedi says, “We are a computer vision tech platform. Computer vision means applying artificial intelligence and machine learning on images and videos to extract insights from that data. We are presently focussing on automated car inspection where the end-client is the insurer and the automotive industry. Our team of data scientists, PHDs, mechanics, and adjustors combine AI and inspection expertise, for example in a car crash, to automatically detect the damage.” Overcoming a cold start On the initial hiccups, Trivedi says, “We found a way to collect data and built a very large damaged-car image library in-house. As a result, we do not require or store client’s images for training and production. Also, we mask all personal information before processing images or videos, and do not store any personal data. We now have data of millions of damaged assets in photos and videos and have filed international patents for select damage categories.” “Our first customer was Liberty General Insurance. To raise funds, we needed to have good traction. Initially, I put in my own money. Later, in July 2020 we raised $0.6M in a pre-series A round led by Better Capital of Vaibhav Domkundwar and Titan Capital of Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal and other angel investors.” Future plans “We are initiating a series A funding round. We are in talks with multiple VCs. Our broader vision is to include different product categories like detecting damages on cell phones, bikes. We are working with several automotive players outside India wherein the focus is multi-fold. For example, we are working with an OEM where we capture the video of the car before and after it enters a workshop. It helps us determine whether there was damage, what was repaired and what was not repaired, or whether there was any incremental damage or not. Currently we have clients in Japan, India and US and we are now expanding to other countries mostly Europe.” Kashish Nagpal, an employee at Inspekt Labs, says “It has been an amazing journey so far. I started out as an intern two years ago, to focus on computer vision aspects of the product. It has been a great to see the company scale quickly across multiple countries.” Founders’ speak“We are a computer vision tech platform. Computer vision means applying AI and machine learning on images and videos to extract insights from data,” said Devesh Trivedi, founder“We are in talks with multiple VCs.

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Four MC, six nagar panchayats in Himachal go to polls on April 7||Four municipal corporations of Dharamshala, Mandi, Palampur and Solan besides six nagar panchayats will go the polls on April 7. Issuing the notification on Saturday, Himachal Pradesh state election commissioner P Mitra said voting will take place from 8am to 4pm and counting of votes will begin immediately after polling ends. The process of filing nominations will start on March 22 and end on March 24. The scrutiny of papers will be done on March 25 and candidates can withdraw their nomination by March 27. The municipal corporation elections are being fought on party symbols this time. The state assembly had passed a Bill in this regard recently. With the announcement of the poll schedule, the model code of conduct has come into force within the municipal areas of the four towns. The code will be in force till the completion of the poll process. While the Dharamshala Municipal Corporation was formed in 2015, the three other civic bodies were upgraded to municipal corporation from municipal council last year. The six nagar panchayats are Chirgaon and Nerwa in Shimla district, Ani and Nirmand in Kullu, Kandaghat in Solan and Amb in Una. The nagar panchayats were also created last year but elections couldn’t be held there along with elections for other urban local bodies in January. CM blows poll bugle in Dharamshala On Saturday morning, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur met BJP ward heads and in-charges for Dharamshala Municipal Corporation to chalk out the poll strategy. Addressing the meeting, Thakur said party workers would discharge whatever responsibility the party entrusts them with to ensure the BJP’s victory in all 17 wards of Dharamshala. Thakur said the election is for a local body, so local issues will remain prominent, but workers should also propagate policies and achievements of the state government among the people. He said party officials, in-charges and workers should keep an account of the problems of the wards so that they can be resolved. He said corruption in the Congress-ruled municipal corporation and failure to carry out development works despite the town having the smart city tag would be the poll plank of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-mc-six-nagar-panchayats-in-himachal-go-to-polls-on-april-7-101615637083511.html

That day it was the occasion of Holi and the complainant and their children were hungry after celebrating the festival. She further said that the pizza was delivered late as opposed to 30 minutes delivery time frame given by the company. However, she chose to ignore the same and took a bite of the pizza. It was at that moment they realised that it was a non-vegetarian pizza and there were pieces of meat instead of mushroom, the complainant said in her complaint.Her lawyer Farhat Warsi told the consumer court that Deepali immediately called customer care and raised a complaint on their "gross" negligence and delivering a non-veg pizza in a house of pure vegetarians.Then on March 26, 2019, a person who referred to himself as the district manager of the pizza outlet, made a call to the complainant and gave an offer of serving pizzas to the whole family of the complainants at the outlet free of cost. However, the complainant told him again that this is not a simple case, as they are assuming it since the (opposite party) has spoiled the religious practices of the complainant and gave her a permanent mental agony, she would have to go through "several long and expensive rituals" which will cost her lakhs of rupees during her entire life.At this, the district manager of the pizza outlet replied that since he is not authorised to negotiate in terms of money, he would hand over the matter to their own legal team, the complaint copy reads.She said that the nature of the response from the opposite party was "very casual", an offer of serving pizza free of cost was nothing but a "mockery an insult to the social and financial status" of the complainant."That the opposite party's negligent manner of performance has contaminated complainant body with food mixed with animal meat that was acquired by killing and cutting short the life given by God to any animal. In her religious belief killing any animal and eating its meat is a "paap" (sin). The opposite party has a deceitfully involved complainant in that sin of eating animal meat. They have wounded her soul giving her mental agony for her whole life. They have ravaged her religious belief," the petition said.Deepali has urged the consumer court to direct the opposite party to provide the claim of ₹one crore to her and also direct the pizza outlet to pay the complainant compensation for mental harassment and financial hardship caused by the opposite party.A Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has asked the pizza outlet to file a reply to the woman's complaint and has listed the matter for further hearing on March 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-moves-consumer-court-over-delivery-of-non-veg-pizza-seeks-rs-1-crore-compensation-101615636412058.html

13-03-2021||Bangalore||Shwetha Srivatsav: If there are 50 films being made for men, we need 50 for women too||It’s time for Shweta Srivatsav’s fans to rejoice. The Kannad film actor, who has been away on maternity leave since she gave birth to her daughter, Ashmitha, in 2017, is coming back to the silver screen with Hope, a film being produced by snooker player Varsha Sanjeev. “The film was offered to me and shot during the lockdown. We shot it in just 34 days and I’ll be dubbing for it in May. It revolves around administrative and legal issues, as well as political corruption,” says Shwetha. About her sabbatical from cinema, she says that staying away was a conscious decision. “I’ve been busy enjoying motherhood. Plus, visual media is such that you have to be a ceratin way physically to be in front of the camera. At that time, I was feeding my baby and it wouldn’t have been fair either to her or even the producer,” says the actor, adding that “networking is key in the industry”. “These things matter, but I am very bad at it. I suck at PR,” she laughs. Well, does she think her peers are good at PR. “I don’t know, I’m not in touch with anybody. I’ll just say that if an artist is growing, we should be happy for them. This planet needs creative people.”And creativity was the reason the Mukha Mukhi (2006) actor took up Hope. “It is such a good film, and a creative concept... maybe my daughter brought in luck,” she smiles, adding that she was “petrified” to go to work, leaving her behind. “Particularly on days that I had a double call sheet, I would miss my daughter so much, but I could do justice in front of the camera. Thankfully, my parents live right below my house. So, they took care of her. My husband is an angel. He is an amazing father, and I think that’s what women empowerment is about; parenthood has to be shared!”Up next, the actor says she’s being choosy because she wants to work in films that are “for women and about women”. “If there are 50 films being made for men, we need 50 for women. Only then the mindset will change. It’s a sad state of affairs right now. If you see, in the ‘70s and ‘80s there were amazing films being made for women. That disappeared, and from 2000 onwards, you don’t see that. That needs to change,” she says.

Teachers must work with students for two months. Thereafter, a short test should be held to assess their learning outcome. The test could be of 15 to 30 minutes or it can be oral.

"Caste and money factors played a key role in appointments to government jobs. Teachers were not motivated to go to schools, and, in many cases, proxy teachers were running schools while regular teachers were engaged in other pursuits.”Adityanath said out of the four years of his rule, one year was spent fighting the Covid-19 situation.

13-03-2021||Pune||Pune district admin to propose Covid vaccination for all above 18 years||Amid a rise in Covid cases in the district, civic officials and health experts have highlighted the need to undertake vaccination for all residents of Pune district above 18 years of age. The Pune district administration will send an official proposal to the Centre and state governments regarding the same.After the weekly meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said that the district administration would follow up with the central and state governments to increase vaccination.Pune district reported 3,264 new Covid-19 cases, on Friday, according to the state health department. The figure took the progressive count of the district to over 4.33 lakh of which 4.02 lakh have recovered and 8,170 have been declared as dead. Currently, 21,788 are active cases undergoing treatment in hospitals or in home isolation.Rao said, “Pune has maximum active cases in the country and is reporting highest new cases in the state and so for the same, we will follow up with the central and state government to increase the vaccination in the district.”“Currently, Pune’s positivity rate is 17 per cent and we are at 11th position in the state. A policy decision needs to be taken to allow Pune to open up a universal vaccination drive for all above 18 years irrespective of their comorbidities,” he said.Rao added that issues like prioritising the areas which reported a higher number of cases during the first and second wave and logistics were also discussed during the meeting. He said, “We have to take note of the administrative and medical preparedness. If we get the additional vaccines we also discussed the time frame in which it would be possible to vaccinate beneficiaries.”“The health experts have suggested that we could vaccinate the entire population above 18 even with no comorbidities which could prevent the severe second wave. Logistics and priority issues are also being discussed and we will follow up on the same,” he said.Pawar said, “The Niti Aayog members and central team members have also proposed to expand vaccination drive among those above 18 years even without comorbidities. The administration will send an official proposal. Meanwhile, I have spoken to a few MPs from the district, Girish Bapat, Supriya Sule and others to raise this issue in the Parliament .”Although the efficacy of both the vaccines is being debated especially given mutated variants, experts believe both vaccines have established that the severity of symptom in an infected and vaccinated person is far lesser compared to an infected non-vaccinated person.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid advisor to the state government who was also part of the meeting, said, “Both the vaccines, Covaxin and Covishied have proven to reduce hospitality and severity of symptoms even if they are infected after vaccination. It is beyond doubt that both the approved vaccines reduce the probability of transmission and of hospitalisation which would be a great success.”According to a study presented by Tata consultancy services and Prayas it has been estimated that the second Covid wave could see 47-52 per cent of the peak of the first wave, September 20, 2020. Without any restrictions in place, the number of critical patients could go up to 47 per cent of what the district saw during the first wave and with some restrictions in place, this could come down to 29 per cent.Rao also added that if the Centre permits then the vaccination centres could be increased and the number of beneficiaries could be taken up to one lakh daily compared to about 24,000 beneficiaries being vaccinated currently.“To increase testing we will provide additional aid to Sassoon hospital which will increase their testing capacity from 700-1,000 per day. National AIDS Control and Research Institute (NARI) and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (ISSER) where the testing is stopped would be brought on board now,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-admin-to-propose-covid-vaccination-for-all-above-18-years-101615632943358.html

There is a need to end politics over it (vaccine) given that it is a scientific fight not a political one. That is why we should work unitedly," Vardhan said.The efforts of our scientists are praiseworthy as due to their labour we have achieved all this. Year 2020, apart from being a Covid-19 year, will be remembered as the year of science and scientists, he added.He said that initially there was only one laboratory in India for Covid-19 testing. "But we have 2,412 testing facilities now," he added."We were the first in the world to isolate the coronavirus. We isolated its mutation. And our scientists helped the ICMR in vaccine. People have praised it (vaccine). Some people tried to create confusion, but truth is unbeatable," he said.Talking about the rising infection cases, the minister said this "disturbing trend" was due to the carelessness and misunderstanding."People think that as the vaccine has come and all is well now," he said, while urging them to follow the Covid-19 rules for protection against the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/over-six-covid-19-vaccines-in-offing-in-india-harsh-vardhan-101615631010823.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra vaccinates nearly 255,000 on Friday, highest single-day jabs so far||Maharashtra on Friday administered 254,956 vaccine doses against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an official of the health department told news agency PTI adding the day’s vaccination count has been the highest in the state till now. The total vaccinations have now climbed to 2,689,922, he said.The western state started its vaccination drive on January 16 with jabs given to all health care and frontline workers under the first phase. Under the second phase of the drive which started on March 1, people above the age of 60 and between the ages of 45-59 with specific comorbidities are being vaccinated.The above-mentioned official highlighted that of the total vaccinations on Friday, the most number of doses were administered to those above the age of 60 (155,995) while 31,043 people belonged to the age group of 45-59 with co-morbidities. Nearly 852,000 senior citizens and 150,000 others between 45-60 years have been vaccinated till now, he said.The state government on March 11 had allowed all vaccination centres to be functional round the clock in order to ramp up the vaccination drive. But, this provision was only pertinent to those centres that had sufficient staff.Maharashtra has recorded 2,282,191 Covid-19 disease cases and 52,723 related deaths till now. On Friday, 15,817 fresh cases were recorded, which have been the highest since October 1 last year, when 16,476 people were tested positive for the coronavirus disease. The state has been seeing a rise in its daily tally since February 10 which has caused the authorities to impose lockdowns, night curfews, curbs in several districts to control the spread of the disease.The Union health ministry on Thursday expressed concerns towards the upward Covid trend in Maharashtra and said cases were increasing due to a fall in testing, tracing and a lack of adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Echoing the ministry’s remarks, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul labelled the situation in Maharashtra as worrisome. Referring to the complete one-week lockdown imposed in Nagpur from March 15-21, Paul said one should not take the virus for granted as it ‘can come up unexpectedly’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vaccinates-nearly-255-000-on-friday-highest-single-day-jabs-so-far-101615628717410.html

First, the Hemant Soren government brought employment policy to the Legislative Assembly and clarified its plans. During the previous BJP government, the people were given jobs. Around 65,000 contract workers have become unemployed since then. The Jharkhand government is cheating the youth by false promises," the BJP Rajya Sabha MP told ANI over the phone.Hitting out at the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-led government, he said the promise of employment to 5 lakh people annually has not been fulfilled."There is a big gap between the Jharkhand government's words and actions. This confuses the people. In his manifesto, Soren said that we will give employment to 5 lakh people annually and if they do not provide employment then they will give employment allowance. He further said he would resign if this was not fulfilled. In such a situation, it seems that the government of Jharkhand is the government of announcements," he said.Earlier, Haryana Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya has approved a bill that would provide 75 per cent reservation in the private sector jobs for the people of the state.The Haryana State Employment Of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, which was passed by the state assembly last year, will provide a quota for local people in private sector jobs that offer a monthly salary of less than ₹50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-govt-only-makes-announcements-never-fulfills-them-bjp-state-chief-101615628649446.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Fourth illicit liquor making unit unearthed in Amritsar in a fortnight||Barely a week after busting an illicit liquor manufacturing racket, the Amritsar rural police on Saturday unearthed another illegal production unit at Kotli Sakka village in Ajnala sub division in its biggest operation under the Red Rose campaign of the state government. This is the fourth such racket busted in Amritsar district in a fortnight. During a nine-hour search and cordon operation, the 150-member team, led by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya, confiscated 12 stills, 126-tonne of lahan (raw material used for making illicit liquor), 360 litres of illicit liquor, 1,830 kg of jaggery, 12 tarpaulins, 24 drums, 20 cans, 12 LPG cylinders, four motorcycles and two cars. The police rescued two bonded labourers, who had been forced to work at the unit, besides three accused, identified as Gurbir Singh, Bhagwant Singh and Balwinder Singh of Kotli Sakka village. A search is on for those involved in taking the supply of illicit liquor from the accused. Two of the accused, Bhagwant and Gursewak, already face 10 and five cases under the Excise Act, respectively. Nine more people allegedly involved in the racket have also been booked under the Excise Act at the Raja Sansi police station. The police invoked sections of the bonded labour Act against the three arrested accused. A Maruti Suzuki Swift and a Tata Indigo car were being used to supply the illicit liquor in Amritsar and its adjoining districts. Property of accused will be frozen: SSP Addressing a press conference, SSP Dahiya said, “We acted promptly on a tip-off and found that the accused had been running the business on a par with a liquor manufacturing distillery. Our investigation to ascertain the links of the accused is on.” The SSP said the police were identifying the property earned by the accused through the illicit business. “This property will be frozen,” he said. More recoveries in the offing Stating that it was the biggest operation so far under the Red Rose campaign of the state government, he said more recoveries are expected as they pursue the case. On March 11, the police had unearthed an illicit factory at Chappa Ram Singh village of Baba Bakala sub division, where 13 tonnes of lahan and two live stills were recovered. Five accused were arrested. On March 5, the police had recovered 58 tonnes of lahan, 4.61 lakh ML of illicit liquor, nine stills, 41 drums, six LPG cylinders, 22 kg of opium plants and 10 tarpaulins from Lakhuwal village in Ajnala. On March 1, an illicit liquor manufacturing unit was busted at Khiala Kalan in Ajnala. Nearly 110 tonnes of lahan and 1,780 litres of illicit liquor were recovered. Eight people, including three women, were arrested.

13-03-2021||Delhi||Menstrual health in focus: A noble thought for female cops on duty||Female cops have been displaying immense courage and leading from the front, whenever the need arises. It is, hence, vital to empower them in discharging their duties. And one way to do so is to care about their menstrual hygiene. With this thought in mind, sanitary pad vending machines are being installed at various police stations in the Capital. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Delhi Police, in a bid to break taboos around menstruation, installed sanitary pad dispensers at RK Puram and Connaught Place Police Stations, on International Women’s Day (March 8). “In our country, talking about periods and sanitary pads is still a taboo. But, this move will help female staff on duty and the public at large. Anyone can come in at any time to collect a pad from the police station. It’s priced at ₹5, which makes it economical and accessible,” says Rajesh Sharma, Station House Officer, RK Puram Police Station. New Delhi district police stations also have these dispensers now. “We’ve installed 15 sanitary pad dispensers in the female washrooms of police stations, units and offices of New Delhi district. We recently celebrated Women’s Day with great gusto, and honoured the contribution of women in the field. At the same time, we realised the problems that female officers face on duty face, during their periods. We have long working hours and hence, the need for such a facility was identified,” says Anjitha Chepyala, Additional DCP-II New Delhi District, who inaugurated the dispensing machine at Connaught Place Police Station.“Such initiatives should be replicated at other stations as well,” says Amit Goel, Additional DCP South West. “When people come to the police station and see a dispenser here, providing access to pads, they will surely realise menstrual health should be prioritised. This will also provide a comfortable environment to our women officers,” he adds.Women officers working at Delhi Police stations, where such machines have been installed, hail the move as a step towards equality at the workplace. “We have 30 female officers here. Kabhi bhi kisi ko bhi zarurat pad sakti hai; sometimes visitors also require pads. Now, we have a way to deal with such emergencies! It’s important that such dispensers are installed at every station, and myths and taboos around menstruation are removed. Jagrukta ki yeh ek achhi pehel hai,” says Manjusha, Inspector (Investigation) at RK Puram Police Station.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/menstrual-health-in-focus-a-noble-thought-for-female-cops-on-duty-101615624604850.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||Journalist connected with NCP worker's murder, arrested in Hyderabad||A journalist, who was on the run for the last three months in connection with the murder of a woman NCP worker in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar, was arrested from a hotel in Hyderabad on Saturday, police officials said.Bal Bothe, who worked for a Marathidaily in Ahmednagar, was arrested in the morning. He is currently being brought to Ahmednagar, where he will be produced in a court, they said.NCP worker Rekha Jare (39), who headed Yashaswini Mahila Brigade, a woman's organisation, was killed at Jategaon Phata in Parner tehsil of Ahmednagar by two unidentified motorcycle-borne persons on November 30 last year when she was going from Pune to Ahmednagar in a car along with her mother, son and a friend.According to a senior police official, Bothe is accused of hatching a conspiracy to kill Jare as he feared that she would lodge a complaint against him over some issues.Also read: South Mumbai murder: Domestic help, his friend held"We arrested Bothe from Hyderabad on Saturday morning in connection with the murder," Ahmednagar Superintendent of Police Manoj Patil said."He was hiding in a hotel room in Hyderabad. The room was locked from outside just to show that there was nobody inside. However, our team broke open the door and apprehended Bothe," he said.According to Patil, six teams, comprising senior police officials, were on the lookout for Bothe, who had given slip to police three times.Apart from Bothe, the police also made four fresh arrests in the case. While three of them were held in Hyderabad, one person was arrested in Ahmednagar, he said.One of them is identified as Janardhan Akule, who is accused of harbouring Bothe in Hyderabad, Patil said, adding that Akule is known to have harboured several criminals in the past.With their arrest, police have so far held 10 persons in connection with the case, he said.Patil said that the operation (to nab Bothe and others) had been going on for the last five days. However, its preparation was on for the last one-and-a-half months after they got a tip-off."Our six teams of senior officials- of the rank of additional SP, deputy SP and police inspectors- had been camping in Hyderabad and were in search of Bothe," he said.The other accused arrested earlier in the case had told the investigators about Bothe's alleged involvement in the crime.Based on a complaint lodged by Jare's mother, a case had been filed under IPC section 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) against unidentified persons at Supa police station in Ahmednagar, a police official said.In December last year, a court had denied pre- arrest bail to Bothe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/journalist-connected-with-ncp-worker-s-murder-arrested-in-hyderabad-101615620613260.html
13-03-2021||Bangalore||7,064 Karnataka villages don’t have a burial ground, says govt||Two days after returning from a pilgrimage to Tirupati, Lakshmikant Kandugal’s mother passed away. Since his village, Bankur in north Karnataka’s Kalaburagi district, did not have a burial ground, Kandugal donated his mother’s body to the district medical college.“I was a panchayat member and since 2011, I have been writing to various government authorities about the unavailability of a burial ground in my village. Two people in the village donated bodies of their family members as they couldn’t find land to bury them. So, I decided to do the same. I have pledged my body to the medical college as nothing seems to change anytime soon,” Kandugal said.According to the state revenue department, Bankur is among 7,064 villages in the state that do not have a burial ground. Unlike many states in the country, a majority from the Hindu community in Karnataka bury the dead, instead of cremating them. Among them are the Lingayats — the largest community in the state — and a large section of the Vokkaligas, another dominant caste in the state.According to C.S Dwarakanath, former chairman of the backward classes commission, burial has been a cultural practice in Karnataka for centuries. “In the Lingayat community, even before Basavanna (the founder of the Lingayat way of life), the communities that converted to Lingayat faith had been burying their dead,” he said.Though the lack of burial ground remains a problem across communities, it is the marginalised communities that feel the maximum brunt of it. According to an activist, there have been several instances of people burying their loved ones by the side of the road after facing discrimination at the hands of dominant communities.Dwarakanath said the lack of burial grounds, especially in a state where burying the dead is a common practice, was a matter of concern. “Those suffering the most are the ones from the backward classes. As the upper castes started to find it difficult to get land for burial, denial of land to Dalits increased...,” he said.K.A Obalesh, an RTI activist from Davangere district, said there were instances of people burying their dead by the roadside. “As you pass through Kadajji, one can find several graves along the roads. In these villages, Dalits were neither allowed to enter the burial ground nor did they own the land,” he added.According to R Mohanraj, state convenor of Dalit Sangharsha Samithi, two Dalits were murdered in a case of discrimination in Hoskote on Bengaluru’s outskirts. “The incident took place around six years ago in Yemandahalli village, where Dalits were not allowed to use the common burial ground... When a funeral procession passed through the burial ground of upper castes, violence erupted in the village and two people from the Dalit community were killed,” he said.Mohanraj said his organisation led protests in front of the district headquarters in Tumkur and Hassan, highlighting the demand for burial grounds. “However, Karnataka revenue secretary Mahendra Jain said the government has allocated funds in the budget to provide burial grounds. “We have asked senior officials in every district to convert government land into burial grounds. Strict instructions have been given to them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/7064-karnataka-villages-don-t-have-a-burial-ground-says-govt-101615613489472.html

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Revenue deficit takes big jump in Haryana budget||An escalating revenue deficit coupled with an increasing debt liability mirrored the state of finances in the budget estimates for 2021-22 fiscal presented by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday in the assembly. Khattar’s second budget was to a large extent blemished by the pandemic situation where the borrowings for 2021-22 have been estimated at 38.41% of the consolidated fund and 30.80% of these being projected for repayment of debt and interest. With revenue receipts of about ₹76,135 crore falling abysmally short of the 2020-21 estimation of about ₹89,964 crore due to the pandemic and lockdowns, the revenue deficit for the next fiscal is estimated to be about ₹29,193 crore as compared to ₹20,856 crore in the current fiscal, a massive jump of ₹8,337 crore. As per the budget document, both the tax and non-tax revenue receipts have taken a hit. The chief minister expected to earn ₹60,580 crore from tax revenue and ₹29,383 from non-tax revenue when he presented his maiden budget last February. What he actually was able to garner was ₹52,479 from tax revenue and ₹23,655 crore from non-tax revenue, data showed. “Even the projected tax revenue ( ₹60,162 crore) and non-tax revenue receipts ( ₹27,571 crore) for 2021-22 fiscal do not convey the confidence of the government as these are lower than the 2020-21 estimates,’’ said a financial expert. In his over two-hour long address as the finance minister, Khattar took solace in the fact that his government has been able to successfully contain the debt liability by keeping it below 32.6 % to gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio limit recommended by 15th Finance Commission for 2021-22. “The debt to gross state GSDP) ratio is at about 23% for 2020-21 revised estimates and the projected debt to GSDP ratio for the next fiscal is about 25% debt,’’ he told the assembly. The chief minister also said that the government did not utilise borrowing space of around ₹8,585 crore during the current fiscal by adopting fiscally prudent measures. “We managed to maintain our borrowings around the original provisions of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. As the central government has allowed that the unutilised borrowing space can be carried over, we have decided to utilise these proceeds as per requirement for the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) which will be anchored in a specially created reserve fund that will have the facility of rollover of allocations across years,’’ the CM said. However, the budget allocation for the health and family welfare department in times of coronavirus pandemic left lot to be desired. A comparison of the estimates presented by Khattar and his predecessor Capt Abhimanyu showed that budget allocation for health and family welfare department 2018-19 was ₹3,126 crore in 2018-19 which was increased to ₹4,201 crore (about 34% more) by Khattar in 2020-21 estimates. However, the increase in 2021-21 estimates is a mere 9.7%. Additional chief secretary, finance, TVSN Prasad during a post-budget presentation briefing said that the comparison should be made between the 2020-21 revised estimates and the 2021-22 budget estimates. “What matters is the actual number and not the estimate. Therefore, the increase would be more than 14% if we compare the actual spending (about ₹4,000 crore) 2020-21 as against the 2021-22 estimates,’’ Prasad said. The budget speech also added up a sum of ₹394 crore allocated to sports department to the health sector allocation to arrive at a swollen allocation of ₹7,731 crore for 2021-22 estimates for health and wellness. The ACS, finance, however, clarified that actual allocation for health, medical education, Ayush, ESIC and FDA was ₹7,337 crore. The 15th finance commission had recently pointed out that health expenditure is only 4.8% of Haryana’s total revenue expenditure. “The pandemic apart, availability of health infrastructure and healthcare professionals in Haryana is hardly enough to meet its regular needs,” the commission said. KEY HIGHLIGHTS POOR Under the Mukhyamantri Antyodya Parivar Utthan Abhiyan, a new scheme, poorest 1-lakh families will be identified initially. Education, skill development, wage employment, self-employment and job creation will be adopted and tailored to each family to ensure a minimum economic threshold of ₹1.8 lakh per annum.

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Private job quota law found no mention in Khattar’s budget speech||The BJP-JJP government’s recently enacted law providing for 75% of the new employment to local candidates in private sector jobs in Haryana did not find a mention in the budget speech of chief minister ML Khattar on Friday. Though officials said the private sector job quota law does not warrant a financial liability and it was not necessary to incorporate it in the budget speech, political observers are sensing a political meaning in the omission. “The RSS functionaries are hostile to this law. Even the BJP knows that it is a stillborn legislation which will be challenged and struck down by the courts. It seems the BJP-led state government is trying to keep it a low-profile matter,’’ said a political analyst. The quota law though was mentioned in the Governor’s address on March 5. “The budget speech is not only about finances but also the policy and vision of the state. The omission is striking,” said an official.It is well known that the BJP top brass, including chief minister ML Khattar, was not keen on enacting the private sector job quota law, a move piloted by Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), BJP’s alliance partner in the state. Khattar during a briefing on February 7 last year had sounded non-committal on the prospect of enacting a law to provide 75% reservation in private sector jobs to Haryana youth. The draft Bill was also deliberated many times by the cabinet and vetted by the Law Secretary who had raised objections regarding the constitutional validity of the proposed law. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana, legal experts said, was in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g) which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. In fact, two BJP central ministers in separate response to Parliament questions on private sector reservation had replied in the negative. In reply to a query on whether the government proposes to formulate any scheme to implement reservation in appointment in private companies, the then Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, CR Chaudhary had told the Lok Sabha in March 2018 that a coordination committee for affirmative action for scheduled castes and tribes in the private sector was set up in 2016 by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP). In accordance with the decisions of the committee, apex industry associations - Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), prepared a voluntary code of conduct (VCC) for member companies centered around education, employability, entrepreneurship and employment to achieve inclusion. Former Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment, Vijay Sampla had in response to an un-starred question on whether the government intends to provide reservation in jobs to persons belonging to the SC/ST category in the private sector had told the Rajya Sabha in May 2016 that there is no such proposal. The governor also sat on the quota Bill for close to four months before assenting to it. A near similar ordinance approved by the cabinet in July last was however reserved by the governor for the consideration of the President. Though the ordinance was withdrawn by the cabinet in October last, the Union Labour and Employment Ministry which examined the ordinance had advised the state government against enacting such a law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-job-quota-law-found-no-mention-in-khattar-s-budget-speech-101615582300632.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana announces free education for all students in all govt schools||The classrooms of government schools in Haryana are set for ₹700-crore digital makeover even as the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government on Friday announced “free education” for all students upto Class 12 in government schools. “We will also provide books free of cost to students of Class 9 to 12, apart from not charging any fee. The concept of free education is already in place till middle school, now we have extended this up to Class-12 in government schools,” education minister Kanwar Pal told Hindustan Times. Khattar, who also holds the finance portfolio, allocated ₹192 crore for what he said is aimed at “ensuring quality education and opportunities” to students of disadvantaged groups. Special Education Zones (SEZs) will be created to improve the enrolment from these groups. A Gender Inclusion Fund (GIF) of ₹115 crore will also be created to provide higher financial assistance to girl students in these SEZs. Not just this, the education department received an outlay of ₹18,410 crore (2021-22) against the 2020-21 revised estimates of ₹15,629 crore--- an increase of 17.8%. The proposed outlay of ₹18,410 crore includes ₹9,014 crore for elementary education, ₹5,899 for secondary education, ₹2,793 crore for higher education and ₹705 crore for technical education. Under its ambitious plan to introduce technology-driven teaching practices across the government schools in the next four years, the state government also plans to upgrade classroom infrastructure through blended learning models to improve learning outcomes. And to promote technology-driven learning in all government schools, which will include provision of digital tablets to students, digital classrooms etc, chief minister Khattar, who presented the budget estimates, allocated ₹700 crore exclusively for digital-driven teaching initiative keeping in mind how the Covid-19 pandemic has altered the lives of children in profound ways especially due to the statewide closure of schools. “In this light, the state government aims to achieve a distinct place on the educational map of the nation by implementing most of the components of the National Education Policy (NEP) before 2025,” he told the Vidhan Sabha. Aarohi, Kasturba Gandhi and Mewat Model schools will be upgraded to the level of Model Sanskiti Schools, while the ongoing ‘Super-100 programme’, which provides coaching to meritorious students appearing for JEE/NEET exams, will be started in Hisar and Karnal as well. Backing his idea of having KG-PG classes in one campus, Khattar proposed to set up such systems in Kurukshetra University and Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, this year and allocated ₹20 crore. “Such a system would be beneficial for students as they can access all levels of education in a single institution. This will curtail dropout rate and provide an ecosystem for holistic learning with focus on higher education and vocational training,” said the chief minister. The chief minister said the Haryana government has taken exemplary initiatives with the aim to enhance conceptual understanding of students from Classes 3-8 under the Saksham Haryana Programme. As a part of NEP, he said, Haryana will expand its efforts towards the Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission to provide early language and mathematical skills to students from classes 1 to 3, impacting 6 lakh students from 8,400 schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-announces-free-education-for-all-students-in-all-govt-schools-101615582000611.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Kanchan, the ‘YouTuber’||Long hair. Same-same dresses. And all three are dancing together this morning in a corner of this south Delhi public park.As if fairies have taken over a secret spot, thinking no one else was around.The young women laugh. “No, I want to be a YouTuber,” says one of them, clearly the group leader. But Kanchan Patwa corrects herself immediately. “I’m already a YouTuber... I have my own channel with lakhs of followers.”Kanchan currently has 219K subscribers on her YouTube channel. She is a dancer, and lands up daily in one of the very many Delhi destinations (Connaught Place, Dilli Haat, Lodhi Road, etc.), where she makes short videos of herself dancing to film songs, later uploading them on her YouTube channel.“My dream is to make my channel more successful, with millions of followers... it should become so wildly popular that [film] heroes and heroines should want to dance with me.”At 23, when everything might seem possible, Kanchan is hopeful. A commerce graduate, she doubles up as a tuition teacher to “paas-pados” (neighbourhood) kids “in all subjects” to fund her daily travels — she doesn’t want that burden to fall on her parents with whom she lives in north east Delhi’s Shastri Park. “ I also give dance classes in Bollywood free style to youngsters and ladies of the neighbourhood.”Kanchan’s parents are supportive of her endeavours, “but sometimes papa gets worried about who will marry me if I dance so much”. He runs a wedding cards shop in Chawri Bazaar.Every day, Kanchan leaves for shoots to scenic markets by 8am, so that “I can complete the shooting while the shops are still closed”. She often operates alone (and mostly dances barefoot) but today she is with her elder sister, Kirti, and a friend, Divya, who is in 10th standard. “My school is closed due to the coronavirus,” Divya says. She also lives in Shastri Park.It took the three women about two hours to get here from their home. “We first took an auto, then the Metro, and then we booked an Uber,” says Kanchan. Referring to their identical dresses, she says, “We got these from a footpath stall in Bhajanpura... the skirt was for ₹300.”Now Divya holds the phone — the shoots are always done through Kanchan’s (seen left in the pic above) mobile phone camera — and the other two hold hands and start to dance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-kanchan-the-youtuber-101615581624237.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Agri sector gets lion’s share in Haryana budget 2021-22||The agriculture sector grabbed the lion’s share in the Haryana budget that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled on Friday with a sharp 21% hike in farming outlay. Already on the back-foot due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party (BJP-JJP) coalition government has attempted to reach out to the disgruntled farming community through the 2021-22 budget proposals. While reiterating the resolve to achieve the national goal of doubling farmers’ income, Khattar said the government was “indebted to farmers” whose “toil and hard work has made Haryana the food bowl of the country.”“Agriculture is the mainstay of our economy and we are committed to doubling farmers’ income and ensuring their wellbeing,” Khattar said in a clear bid to reach out to peasants who have not been letting the ruling party leaders hold government functions in their villages. ‘Har Khet, Swasth Khet’ A special campaign christened “Har Khet Swasth Khet” will be started in the coming fiscal to focus on soil health and help farmers make cropping choices based on soil quality. At least 125 soil-testing laboratories will be established in schools, colleges, and technical universities in 2021-22. Developing additional 1,090 hectares of saline-affected area, 5,000 hectares of fresh water area in the next four years, setting up a centre of excellence at Garwa village in Bhiwani to develop saline-affected areas for shrimp culture, establishing 10 small fish feed mill plant units and a goat breeding centre at Loharu in Bhiwani are among the slew of schemes announced to improve the income of the farmers. “Against ₹5,052 crore outlay of 2020-21, we have increased the agriculture budget by 20.9% with ₹6,110 crore outlay for 2021-22,” Khattar, who also holds the finance portfolio, said in a media briefing. Of the ₹6,110 crore outlay, ₹2,998 crore has been proposed for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, ₹489 crore for horticulture, ₹1,225 for animal husbandry and dairying, Rs125 crore for fisheries and ₹1,274 crore for cooperation. The BJP-JJP coalition government has also proposed to spend ₹5,081 crore on the irrigation sector. Soil health and cropping choicesKhattar said the objective of “Har Khet Swasth Khet” is to provide an end-to-end solution to farming from soil health, crop choices, inputs, processing and marketing. The campaign for collection and testing of soil samples of each acre will be launched from April, 2021, covering the entire state in coming three to four years. At least 17 new static soil testing laboratories and 59 mini-soil testing laboratories are being established in mandis and government buildings to provide doorstep soil-testing services to farmers. Khattar said about 125 soil-testing laboratories will be set up in schools, colleges, technical universities and institutions during 2021-22. “This will benefit farmers on one hand and introduce a unique earn-while-you-learn opportunity to students, on the other,” Khattar said. The students of agriculture and horticulture universities will have mandatory linkage with field-level activities as part of their curriculum. Kisan Mitra Yojana According to Khattar, under the Kisan Mitra Yojana, at least 1, 000 farmers’ ATMs will be set up in the state in partnership with banks. The main objective of this move is to facilitate farmers through multiple services like cash withdrawal, cash deposit, balance enquiry, pin change, new pin generation, mini-statement, cheque book request, Aadhaar number updation, loan request, mobile number updation and registration of problems and feedback etc. Zero budget, organic and natural farming In yet another initiative to make agriculture viable and provide fresh farm produce to consumers, the government plans to promote zero budget farming and organic/natural farming. The target is to cover one lakh acre cropped area under this initiative in the next three years. Training will be provided to farmers in these techniques, while testing and certification laboratories will be established to promote marketing of farm produce grown with these techniques. Other initiatives Three bio safety level-II laboratories, with rapid and RT-PCR diagnostics of avian influenza and other poultry diseases, are to be set up in Hisar, Sonepat and Panchkula. Artificial insemination services to be expanded to goats for genetic up-gradation of breeds and to enhance the income of poor goat farmers. A goat breeding centre is to be established at Loharu, Bhiwani.  ₹50 crore allocated to strengthen Gaushalas. A new milk plant, with a packaging capacity of 3 lakh litre per day, is to be set up in southern Haryana to cover the National Capital RegionA new milk chilling plant will be set up at Sherla village of Loharu tehsil in Bhiwani. This plant will process milk to make and market sweet meals under the VITA-based brand name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/agri-sector-gets-lion-s-share-in-haryana-budget-202122-101615581401196.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get park for safe e-waste disposal||The Capital will soon get an e-waste management park for the safe and scientific disposal of electronic products such as appliances and e-vehicle batteries, according officials in the Delhi Lieutenant Governor’s office.“The Delhi chief secretary will head the drawing of the plan for this facility, after consulting the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) and the ministry of electronics and information technology,” a senior government official said on Friday.The official also said the proposal will also work on a system to incentivise citizens and agencies, to encourage the safe disposal of e-waste.In the absence of a protocol for its disposal and management, the Capital has been struggling to handle e-waste.A 2019 study conducted by environment NGO Toxics Link found at least 15 e-waste processing hot spots in the city that were operating without any health or environmental safeguards.Senior government officials said Delhi L-G Anil Baijal, along with K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor to government of India, on Thursday chaired a meeting with officials from the Delhi government, the three municipal corporations, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and representatives from the above-mentioned union ministries, to discuss the need to working out a mechanism for the safe disposal of e-waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-park-for-safe-e-waste-disposal-101615580962165.html
13-03-2021||Other||Night curfew in Ludhiana: Rise in cancellations leaves hospitality industry jittery||Imposition of night curfew within two weeks of limits on gatherings at indoor and outdoor events has led to a rise in cancellations, greatly impacting the district’s hospitality industry.Owners of various hotels, restaurants and marriage palaces complained that within a day of the announcement of the night curfew, customers had already started calling to cancel or postpone bookings, hitting business by over 50%. The administration on Thursday had announced night curfew in the district from 11pm to 5am in view of the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases.“Clients visiting Ludhiana for corporate visits and those planning night events have started cancelling their bookings. Uncertainty over the extent of the night curfew is certainly going to cause huge losses to the hospitality sector,” said Manjit Singh Nagpal, who owns a hotel and a marriage palace.Instead of imposing a curfew, business owners said the administration should stress on enforcing safety protocols and bringing the violators to task. “Footfall at restaurants increases post 9pm. If we have to shut shop at 11pm, people will simply avoid dining out. Though the severity of the pandemic is understandable, there seems to be no end to the troubles of the hospitality sector that has been reeling under losses since the lockdown last year,” said Bhupinder Basant, owner of Basant Restaurants in Ludhiana.President of the Ludhiana Hotel and Restaurant Association, Amarvir Singh said, “The administration should understand the ramifications of the curfew on the sector. Not only will owners suffer huge losses, impact on business will translate into large-scale unemployment as well.”“Several customers wish to shift their bookings to day time, but it’s not entirely possible, as on several days, slots are booked for both morning and night hours,” said Amarjit Singh Sant, president, Marriage Palace Welfare Association.The hoteliers also rued that the administration had allowed factories to continue operations though they employed hundreds of labourers, while hotels, that followed all norms and guidelines issued by the government, were facing restrictions. Amarvir said they will take up the matter with the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/night-curfew-in-ludhiana-rise-in-cancellations-leaves-hospitality-industry-jittery-101615580380413.html
13-03-2021||Other||Encroachments near Buddha Nullah cleared: Occupants decry MC action||The municipal corporation (MC) on Friday razed dozens of illegal structures along the Buddha Nullah at Kundanpuri, New Kundanpuri, Upkar Nagar and adjoining areas, amid resistance from their occupants.Left without shelter, hundreds of labourers and their family members, who had been living in these buildings for decades, claimed the demolition took place without any notice. They were at work, while the MC razed the structures, damaging their household articles and belongings, they complained.However, assistant town planner (ATP) MS Bedi said, “Notices were served to the encroachers and illegal properties were also marked with red paint over the past few days. The drive commenced after conducting demarcation process and will continue in the coming days.”Suresh, a resident, said, “We were not even aware that these labour quarters had been established on encroached land. We have been living here for over a decade. There were over 50 quarters in the building in which we were residing and the owner used to collect ₹1,600-2,000 as rent against each quarter.”Another labourer, Prince said, “We were not aware of the drive. I was at work when someone told me about it. We have been paying rent to the building owner, who claims he was not aware of it either. MC should have given us some time to find another accommodation.”As per MC officials, over 70 encroachments were razed during the drive on Friday after issuing notices. The action came to pave way for a road at the site and beautification of the area, along with installation of chain-linked fences around the nullah to restrict residents from dumping waste. The three-metre-high and two-metre-wide fence is being installed under the Smart City Mission at a cost of ₹13.39 crore.Last year, MC had identified around 960 encroachments along the nullah that had reduced its width, resulting in overflow of wastewater during monsoon. The demarcation process was carried out by teams of different departments, including MC, revenue and drainage.‘We have registries of plots, pay taxes’ Some of the property owners said they have registries of their properties and had also been paying taxes to MC for years. “MC has also issued unique identification number for some of the properties and electricity metres have been installed by PSPCL,” they added.One such property owner, Charanjit Singh said, “I own a 200 square yards plot since the 1990s and have even shown the registry of the plot to MC. I have also won a case regarding ownership of the land in court. Yet, the MC officials have asked me to demolish the house by myself or they will. A 400 square yards property was divided into two parts and I purchased 200 yards out of it. Now, MC is claiming that the other portion is legal, but mine is not as per revenue records.”Another building owner, Harinder Singh said his 50 square yards building was razed even when he had registry of the plot. He added that he will move court against MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/encroachments-near-buddha-nullah-cleared-occupants-decry-mcaction-101615579780715.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Handwara narco-terrorism case: ₹91 lakh recovered from Samba village||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recovered ₹91 lakh from an agricultural field in Ramgarh sector of Samba district, barely 5km from the Indo-Pak international border, on Friday. A police officer said, “The cash was recovered from a pit in an agricultural field in Gurwal village on the disclosure of one Ramesh Kumar, who had been recently arrested in a narco-terrorism case,” said a senior police officer. On March 1, the NIA had arrested four drug traffickers — Altaf Ahmed Shah of Dangherpora,Ganderbal; Showkat Ahmad Parray of Wangipora Sumbal, Bandipora; Mudasir Ahmad Dar of Shopian and Amin Allaie alias Hilal Mir of Sangam, Anantnag in the Handwara narco-terrorism case. The police had seized 21kg heroin and ₹1,35,89,850 from the drug traffickers. Kumar was also arrested in the same case. “Investigation revealed that Kumar had received the cash proceeds of drugs from narco-smugglers based in Kashmir valley for himself as well as for further channelisation to different terrorist entities. The investigation in the case continues,” the statement said.The case was initially registered on June 11, 2020 at the Handwara police station in Kupwara district. On June 11, while checking vehicles at Kairo Bridge, Handwara, police had checked a vehicle at a check post and during the search ₹20 lakh along with 2kg heroin was recovered from the car of one Abdul Momin Peer. A chargesheet was filed on December 5, 2020, against six accused in the NIA special court in Jammu. “Peer’s sustained interrogation had led the NIA to unearth the drug syndicate operating on the directions of handlers in Pakistan,” said the officer. Investigation revealed that the accused drug peddlers were involved in cross-border smuggling of heroin in huge quantities from Pakistan and were supplying the same in J&K and other parts of the country. They were also in regular communication with the operatives of proscribed terrorist organisations Lashkar-e-Taiba(LeT) and Hizbul-Mujahideen (HM), using encrypted chat platforms. The proceeds of sale were being used to finance the activities of proscribed terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul.

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to bring big retail to Sector 17||In a bid to give a major fillip to Sector 17 and draw shoppers back to the city’s commercial heart, the Chandigarh administration is planning to bring “a big retail” to the sector. “The plan is to have an anchor store like the one exists in shopping malls. Such stores are major crowd pullers and enhance the footfall,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.Sector 17 in the past few years has lagged behind due to new shopping malls coming up within the city and its vicinity. “The introduction of an anchor store will definitely spur activity in the sector and help it recover some of the ground lost to the shopping malls,” said the official.Space for such an anchor store would be given in one of the existing buildings and the project would neither require new constructions nor any change in the architectural plans, the official added.As per the proposal, the ground floors of 17 and 30 bays buildings will be allotted to a commercial establishment, on competitive bidding basis, solely for the purpose of creating a prominent retail space. “Currently, offices of Haryana and Punjab governments are operating from these buildings. The administration has been trying to get these vacated as most of the offices earlier being run from here have either shifted to Panchkula or Mohali,” said the official.Bringing vibrancy to Bank SquareThe project is a part of the ‘Sector 17 Rejuvenation Plan’, which envisages a major revamp in the infrastructure, buildings’ facelifts and renovations in Sector 17.Particular emphasis is being laid on creating greater vibrancy in the northern plaza and near the bank square.“The area around the 17 and 30 bays building, which is in proximity to the bank square, present a forlorn picture after the office working hours. Earlier, there was plan to let out these buildings for office spaces. But, it was dropped as this would not attract increased visitors to the area, specifically after working hours. So, big retail has now been opted for,” the official said.In lines with this plan is to create an art gallery and museum in the Town Hall building (DC office) near the 17 and 30 bays building.“A new building will house all offices of the district administration. It will come up on the vacant two-acre land near Hotel Shivalikview, have six floors, excluding the ground floor, and parking for at least 600 cars in the basement. Plans are ready for the building,” the official said.Once new DC building comes up, the Town Hall building will be conserved and converted into an art gallery and museum. The administration will also soon start the beautification of the northern plaza as a part of the rejuvenation plan.The department has already initiated the process of restoring the facade of the government and private buildings in the sector. An urban park behind Neelam theatre is also coming up. “As of now, the football stadium and area around it covers nine acres. For this project, it will be increased to 12 acres. Work on part of it is already under process,” said the official. The construction of a 40mx40m city map in front of Neelam Theatre is in its mid-construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-to-bring-big-retail-to-sector-17-101615579360397.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC plans to discontinue afternoon water supply||The Chandigarh municipal corporation is planning to shut down the afternoon drinking water supply in the city. It expects to save more than ₹14 crore annually through this move.Currently, the MC supplies water in the city for 11 hours: five in the morning, two in the afternoon and four in the evening. According to the plan, supply will continue for 11 hours by increasing the duration by an hour each in the morning and evening.MC commissioner KK Yadav, who has initiated the proposal, said: “The demand for afternoon supply is not very high. We are spending around ₹14 crore on it. For the MC, it is much less expensive to increase the morning and evening supply by an hour each.”The civic body contends that after the morning supply, there is a break in supply till afternoon, which empties water pipes. To restart the supply and create water pressure, additional power input is needed. “Ultimately, electric pumps and other machinery have to be continuously used. Also, given their numbers, it is very difficult for MC workers to continuously work on it,” said Yadav.The MC is running a heavy deficit in the drinking water supply as the tariff remained stagnant between 2011 and 2020. In 2019-2020, it spent ₹215 crore on water supply, and earned only ₹87 crore. With the September 2020 water tariff hike, it expects to add ₹60 crore in receipts from the supply. However, it will have to forego it if the UT administration approves the General House’s latest resolution to go back to the old rates till the pandemic ends.“The proposal to discontinue afternoon supply will decrease the financial burden on the MC, which will ultimately make water supply cheaper for the residents,” said Yadav.After the proposal was brought before the MC General House on March 9, it was referred to the water supply and sewerage disposal committee.Councillor and committee member Shakti Prakash Devshali said: “A final decision will be taken after considering views of all resident welfare associations and the general public.”Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said: “Residents don’t mind if the afternoon supply is discontinued as long as the supply is increased in the morning and evening, and the MC rolls back the water tariff hike.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-plans-to-discontinue-afternoon-water-supply-101615579121428.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Nod to high-density plantation on 5,500 hectares in J&K||The Jammu and Kashmir government has given its nod to setting up high-density plantations on 5,500 hectares after the administrative council, which met under the chairpersonship of lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha in Jammu on Thursday, approved the implementation of high-density plantation scheme in the horticulture sector with the support of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. “This step will go a long way in enhancing the quality and quantity of horticulture produce and doubling farmers’ income,” the government spokesman said.The fruits identified for high-density plantation are apple, walnut, almond, cherry, litchi, and olive. The produce will be planted in suitable agro-climatic zones for six years from March, 2021.“The new high-density plantation scheme has provisions to provide 50% subsidy to orchardists for the same accompanied by a loan facility for raising 40% of the remaining capital. The scheme will also provide subsidies to growers on account of expenditure related to micro-irrigation, plant material, and anti-hail nets. Under the scheme, preference will be given to farmers with landholdings of less than 4 kanal,” a spokesperson said.“The high-density plantations are expected to make horticulture profitable through superior yields, higher yields per hectare, early harvest, and introduction of insect and pest- resistant varieties thereby saving the expenditure on disease and pest control,” the spokesperson said.NAFED will also install a high-tech laboratory for certification of horticulture produce as per international standards, virus-indexing laboratories, and will arrange for imports of specified qualities and species from identified countries.In the last two years, 5,000 kanals (625 acres) of high-density orchards have been established in the Valley. They are likely to start producing fruit within one or two years. Medium-density plantations that bear fruit after five years have been set up over 48,000 kanals ( 6,000 acres) across Kashmir, as per official data.Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat says, “We are way behind on our target to convert old orchards into high density or medium density ones. But once it is done the production will go up. Area-wise Kashmir is on the top but when it comes to production we are still far behind. Thus, we are encouraging growers to replace old orchards with new ones.”Of late, the J&K government has taken several steps to boost the sector by providing high-yielding plants to growers. “Around 2 lakh quality plants have been grown in public sector nurseries and distributed among the famers in Kashmir,” Bhat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nod-to-high-density-plantation-on-5-500-hectares-in-jk-101615579120368.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Weekend may be cooler after rain spell: IMD||The national capital on Friday received light rain, thunderstorms and strong winds, which helped pull back the rising temperature in the city. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said lower temperatures are likely to persist over the weekend, and Saturday morning may see light showers.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecast centre, said till 7pm Friday, the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, received around 6mm rain.“The entire city received light rain on Friday. We started receiving the first spell around 7.30am, and it lasted for around two hours. Some areas in Delhi also received rain in the evening,” Srivastava said.The Palam weather station received 2mm rain, Lodhi Road 4.1mm, Aya Nagar 2.1mm and the Ridge received 0.5mm of rain on Friday.Scientists said the rain was the result of a western disturbance passing over the north-west region.A western disturbance is an extratropical storm that originates in the Mediterranean, bringing with it rain and a drop in temperature. It is mostly associated with winter rain in India.Met officials also said Friday was mostly windy, which led to a drastic fall in daytime temperature. The maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 30.7 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s normal.This was down from 35.2 degrees Celsius, recorded on Thursday, which was the highest this winter so far.The minimum temperature on Friday was 17.9 degrees Celsius, three degrees above what is considered normal for the season.The strong winds also led to a marginal improvement in the pollution levels. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of the city was 218, in the “poor” category. On Thursday, the AQI was 242, also in the “poor” category.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the improvement in air quality will continue till Sunday.“Expected rainfall is likely to contribute to AQI positively. The average AQI is likely to improve to the moderate category on Saturday. Moderate to poor AQI is forecasted for March 14 and March 15,” the Safar forecast read.Four struck by lightning in GurugramFour men were injured after lightning struck a tree under which they were taking shelter from the rain in Gurugram’s Sector 82. A video clip which went viral online, showed them falling to the ground moments after the lightning strike.The incident took in the residential township Vatika India Next and the four men were attached with its horticulture department.The injured, identified as Shiv Dutt (43), Lali (32), Anil Kumar (32) and Ram Prasad (38) were rushed to a hospital where Prasad was reported to be critical and the rest were stable and recovering.Krishan Kant, station house officer of Kherki Daula police station, said, “Ram Prasad is admitted in the intensive care unit and is in critical condition,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekend-may-be-cooler-after-rain-spell-imd-101615578978928.html

13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Police inspector arrested in Chandigarh house grab case||Probing into the Sector-37 house grab case, the special investigation team (SIT) on Friday arrested Chandigarh Police inspector Rajdeep Singh.Posted as the station house officer in Sector 39 at the time of the incident, he is accused of inaction. The SIT had summoned him to join the investigations, following which he was arrested. This is the fourth arrest in the case after journalist Sanjiv Mahajan, realtor Manish Gupta and Satpal Dagar, brother of deputy superintendent of police Ram Gopal, were arrested last week. Meanwhile, the SIT after questioning the DSP has ruled out his involvement in the case. Police last week booked around 10 people, including slain bouncer Surjit Singh, for kidnapping and torturing Rahul Mehta, the sole heir of his family, in April 2017 to secure the general power of attorney of his 338-square-yard house and selling it to Manish Gupta’s brother for ₹2.9 crore in March 2019. The FIR mentioned that inspector Rajdeep Singh had failed to take action on a complaint filed against Sanjeev Mahajan, Surjit Singh and Shekhar, who had forcibly occupied Mehta’s house.“No one whose involvement is found in the case will be spared,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Rajdeep was a part of the conspiracy and was aware of the house grab and treatment meted out to Mehta by the accused, said a senior police official privy to the investigations.

Though the girl had a bloated stomach in the past few months, the parents had brushed it aside as flatulence. However, later they took their daughter to a hospital and discovered that it was a pregnancy at an advanced stage of 30 weeks.The petition stated that the family lives in a slum at Govandi, and the petitioner has three children. After the eldest of the three, who suffered from epilepsy, was cured by a man, the family trusted him, and he started frequenting their house. The petition alleged that the man started stalking the survivor. Seven-eight months ago, on one of the days, he found the minor alone and entered the home and raped her. He raped her on two occasions and threatened the minor against disclosing the act to her parents. After the pregnancy was detected, the father lodged a police complaint against the man. As the girl was a minor, she was sent to the child welfare committee at Mankhurd. Cusher submitted that the girl would not understand the implications of the pregnancy, and with every passing day she was undergoing irretrievable changes which will have a direct impact upon the foetus as well as on the survivor. He added that the continuation of pregnancy could pose severe trauma to the girl, and therefore, her father sought termination of the pregnancy under section 5 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-moves-bombay-hc-seeks-nod-to-end-minor-daughter-s-31-week-pregnancy-101615578760291.html
13-03-2021||Chandigarh||Terror, talks will not go together is guiding doctrine of govt: Chrungoo||Senior BJP and Kashmiri Pandit leader Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo on Friday said that while the ceasefire agreement at the level of director general of military operations (DGMOs) of India and Pakistan was a welcome development yet it needed to be reiterated that India’s current policy regarding Pakistan was guided by the doctrine that ‘terror and talks won’t go together’. Chrungoo was addressing a webinar held by the Centre for Peace & Progress, New Delhi on the topic ‘Improving Indo-Pak Relations.’Chrungoo said if peace has to be permanent , Pakistan has a greater responsibility to stop cross-border terrorism, insurgency and lending support to misadventures across the line of control and the international border. “While following the Pakistan media, it has been observed that the people in Pakistan preferred to have the India- made Covid vaccine than the one made by China. It is hoped that the policy of Pakistan regarding the ceasefire with India is not guided by the India-made vaccine demand in Pakistan and is pursued even after such a need of Pakistan is fulfilled by India. The people and the governments in the region shouldn’t be guided, in any way, by the western countries’ media and debate on Indo-Pak relations. The relations should be independent of the western media narrative on the relations”, Chrungoo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/terror-talks-will-not-go-together-is-guiding-doctrine-of-govt-chrungoo-101615578700429.html

The announcement was made following chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackray’s promise that the fresh date will be declared on Friday.“Following instructions from the state relief and rehabilitation department, the commission had decided to postpone the exam. Now, the same examination will be held on March 21,” stated the order issued by MPSC on Friday.The exam was to be held on Sunday (March 14), which was postponed considering the spike in the Covid-19 cases. The decision had led to demonstrations by aspirants at Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Sangli, Amravati etc.On Wednesday, the state relief and rehabilitation department had issued a letter that stated, “It would be inappropriate to hold MPSC exams in the backdrop of restrictions imposed as precautionary measures to arrest the spread of coronavirus by local administrations in different districts and cities, hence exams should be deferred.”Taking a serious note of the demonstrations, CM on Thursday called a meeting to review the situation. He expressed regret over inconvenience to the aspirants and promised that the fresh dates will be declared by Friday. Taking a veiled dig at the Opposition, he also asked students to not get “provoked”.The exams, which had been scheduled for April 2020, had been delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak, and were postponed four times since then, aspirants said. Recruitment for various posts in the state government is held through MPSC, and thousands of youth from all over the state appear for it every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mpsc-declares-march-21-as-next-date-for-recruitment-exam-101615578583486.html

The survey is being conducted to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the railway corridor. The survey will provide ground data details in four months. “Ground survey is a crucial activity for any linear infrastructure project as the survey provides accurate details of areas around the alignment. This technique uses a combination of laser data, global positioning system (GPS), flight parameters and actual photographs to give accurate survey data,” said a senior NHRSCL official.The proposed 736km high-speed corridor will connect Mumbai with Nagpur, Wardha, Malegaon, Jalna, Aurangabad, Shirdi, Nashik, Igatpuri and Shahapur towns.NHSRCL has stated that the trains will be operated at a speed of 320km per hour. Passengers travelling by rail from Mumbai to Nagpur are likely to save up to 50% of their commuting time after the route is ready. At present, the shortest distance by train between Mumbai and Nagpur is 11.30 hours by Duronto Express.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbainagpur-high-speed-corridor-nhsrcl-starts-aerial-survey-101615578519696.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||Couple held guilty of minor’s sexual assault move Bombay HC||The elderly couple who were convicted and sentenced on Thursday for sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl have moved the Bombay high court (HC), challenging the judgment of the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The special court on Thursday sentenced the 87-year-old man and his 81-year-old wife to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of ₹1,000 each for sexually assaulting the child in 2013. The couple was also asked to pay compensation of ₹50,000 to the girl.The special judge, Rekha N Pandhare, while sentencing the couple, observed that the survivor was a minor and the accused were her grandparents’ age. The case against the couple was registered with VP Road police station in September 2013 for sexually abusing the girl who stayed in the same building as theirs in Girgaum.In her statement to the police in 2013, the girl said the couple, whom she addressed as dada (grandfather) and dadi (grandmother), stopped her while she was returning home and made her sit on a swing. She said the ‘dada’ slapped her, while the ‘dadi’ held her tight. She claimed dada then disrobed her and sexually assaulted her. The girl said when she tried to run away, the dada spat on her before letting her go home.The couple’s lawyer Dinesh Tiwari on Friday moved an appeal before the Bombay HC challenging their conviction and consequent prison term. In their appeal, the couple claimed that they were falsely implicated by the parents of the survivor out of previous enmity.The court has held the couple guilty based on the testimony of the survivor who was eight years old when deposed. The couple in their appeal claimed that the testimony given by the victim is not reliable. “The judge failed to appreciate that the survivor and her mother have given different versions of the alleged incident,” stated the appeal. They further claimed that the prosecution had failed to examine crucial independent witnesses in the case.Seven witnesses were examined during the trial that began in 2017 when the accused were out on bail. The court relied on the girl’s testimony recorded almost after four years after the complaint was filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/couple-held-guilty-of-minor-s-sexual-assault-move-bombay-hc-101615578463243.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||No politics over patriotism, Kejriwal implores in House||Speaking in the state assembly on the last day of the budget session, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said there should be no politics over patriotism, which was the theme of the Delhi Budget released earlier this week.“I want to ask the BJP — if not in India, will our flag be unfurled in Pakistan? If not in Delhi, will the Indian flag be unfurled in Islamabad?” Kejriwal said in his speech in the Assembly, concluding discussions on the 2021-22 budget, which was passed by the House on Friday.The Delhi government in the Budget, presented on Tuesday, allocated ₹45 crore to set up national flags across 500 locations in the city.The budget session in the Assembly was adjourned on Friday, ahead of schedule, with speaker Ram Niwas Goel citing risks posed by the uptick in Covid-19 cases in the Capital over the past few days.Kejriwal also said, “I fail to understand why the BJP and the Congress are opposing the setting up of flags across Delhi. What makes them oppose this? This is a remarkable move, they should support it. There should be no politics when it comes to patriotism… Keeping politics aside, we have supported the Central government in every good decision that they have made until now. I remember, PM announced Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan in 2014, I went to a slum area with a broom. I remember going to India Gate with a yoga mat when the PM announced a Yoga initiative. This year we have planned a Yoga programme for Delhi.”“After I announced that we will provide free pilgrimage to the Ram temple in Ayodhya for the elders in Delhi under an existing government scheme, the BJP and the Congress have been criticising the decision. I do not understand why. Is it a crime to provide our elders with a free pilgrimage to a place of worship such as Ayodhya?” said Kejriwal.During the day’s proceedings, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia reiterated that the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) idea of patriotism stresses on “quality education, good governance and equality”.Speaking before Kejriwal, Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said, “Delhi’s development is patriotism for us. Good schools, good hospitals, good facilities for all, equality, cleanliness, generating jobs, endorsing artists, supporting the marginalised is patriotism for us. If we carry patriotism in one hand, we carry the Constitution in another. We are not like the BJP which carries so-called patriotism in one hand and a knife in the other. Your [the BJP’s] way of being patriotic is dangerous.“You talk about patriotism and you stopped protesting farmers from reaching Delhi. You put iron nails on roads and blocked their way. You have been calling farmers traitors. The same farmers’ sons are also serving the country at the borders. Shame on you,” he said.His comments led to a heated exchange between BJP and AAP legislators in the House, after which the eight BJP MLAs staged a walk-out. The AAP has 62 MLAs in the 70-member Assembly.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “The government is talking about Singapore, travelled all the way to 2047 in the garb of presenting a vision. I am not sure who among us will be alive to see if per-capita income in Delhi touches Singapore’s per-capita by 2047… They have announced free Covid-19 vaccines at the centres in Delhi government hospitals. But how many people go to these hospitals? They are so bad. This reflects in the poor turnout at the vaccine centres in Delhi government hospitals. Bike ambulances in Delhi are yet not functional and the government does not address the issue in the upcoming budget”.His party colleague, Anil Bajpai, said, “It is good Kejriwal has adopted Ram Rajya, but he will have to go through an ‘Agni Pariksha’ (test of fire) to achieve it.”Delhi Congress vice president Mudit Agarwal said in a statement, “CM Kejriwal is again spreading lies by saying that Congress party has objections over people of Delhi going to Ram Mandir and over 500 Flags, I would like to remind CM Kejriwal that the policy of Pilgrim Visit was started during Sheila Ji’s (former chief minister Sheila Dikshit) regime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-politics-over-patriotism-kejriwal-implores-in-house-101615578101197.html
13-03-2021||Other||Maharashtra govt tables new ESZ proposal for Thane Flamingo Sanctuary||The state government wrote to the Union environment ministry on Wednesday, proposing to notify an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of 48 square kilometres (sq km) around the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS). The move will increase the area earmarked for protection by the forest department, which had initially proposed to include just 34.06 sq km within ESZ. An ESZ is a buffer area created around a wildlife sanctuary or national park to reduce developmental pressures.The forest department said it has also increased the maximum width of the originally proposed buffer area to a maximum of 3.98km, as compared to 3.5km earlier. At its southern-most point near Vashi bridge, the width of ESZ is 0km, while at its northernmost point at Thane-Kalwa bridge, the width is 2km. Spread across 1690.5 hectares (ha) across Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Kanjur and parts of Mandale village, TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species, among other mammals such as jackals. In May 2018, the state had declared it a flamingo sanctuary. On May 16, 2019, HT had reported that the originally designated ESZ did not protect mangroves, mudflats and salt pans towards eastern portions of the sanctuary. About 1,400ha of mangrove forests towards Navi Mumbai side weren’t covered in the ambit of the original ESZ delineation because they were already declared as reserve forests under the Indian Forest Act. They are also covered under CRZ (coastal regulation zone). However, last February, the ministry recommended their inclusion in ESZ, which has now been sent for approval,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests, mangrove cell. “The solution is to declare TCFS as a wildlife sanctuary under the Wildlife Act. An ESZ notification won’t offer much protection as seen in case of Sanjay Gandhi National Park where developmental activities are undertaken inches away,” said D Stalin, director, NGO Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-govt-tables-new-esz-proposal-for-thane-flamingo-sanctuary-101615578220563.html

On October 1, the state had recorded 16,476 cases. The active cases have increased to 110,485 – 4.84% of the total cases. The toll reached 52,773, with 56 casualties. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 1,647 fresh cases, highest in four-and-a-half months, since 1,609 cases were reported on October 21. The total number of cases in the city stands at 340,290. There are 11,083 active cases in the city. Mumbai also reported four deaths on Friday due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 11,523. The case fatality rate in Mumbai is 3.3%, and the recovery rate is 93%. The overall growth rate of cases in the city is 0.35%, and the doubling rate has gone down to 194 days, from 205 days on Thursday. Of the 56 deaths, 32 occurred in the last 48 hours and eight in the last week. The rest 16 deaths are from the period before last week, health officials said. The rise in Covid-19 cases started from February 10, forcing the state to impose a complete lockdown or partial curbs in several districts and cities of the state. On Friday, a two-day lockdown was announced in Parbhani. It will be imposed from 12am on Friday midnight till Monday, 6am. It reported 80 cases on Friday and cumulative figures reached 9,194 cases. Dhule, too, has imposed a four-day janata curfew from March 14 to 17, during which, except essential services, all other establishments will remain closed. The local administration has also barred weekly markets till the end of the month. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday directed the local administration to improve contact tracing in areas where the number of cases is high. He ordered strict implementation of preventive measures for containment zones to arrest transmission and take action against all those found violating the rules. To review the spike, the chief secretary called a meeting with divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and chief executive officers of all districts and cities on Friday. “The preventive measures need to be implemented more effectively in districts where the positivity rate is high. Contact tracing should be increased along with daily testing numbers,” chief secretary said in the meet. “The local administration should immediately start implementation of preventive measures in containment zones. In urban areas, corporation and police officials should coordinate to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is followed by the people and ensure action against offenders. Fine people for not wearing masks. Also, ensure strict and regular monitoring of home isolated patients,” he directed. Kunte also asked them to vaccinate more people from areas with a high positivity rate. The state government will also try to provide more stock of vaccines, he said. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said the cases will come down only when people start following Covid protocols seriously. “Unless people follow norms and avoid crowding, the situation won’t come under control,” he said. Dr Lahane said the spike in cases is limited to eight districts, including Mumbai, and thus it would not be appropriate to call the rise a “second wave”. “Maharashtra has 36 districts whereas the cases are rising only in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Jalgaon, Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola. We cannot call it “second wave” unless the rise is spread to more districts,” he clarified. With 9,410 cases, the combined tally of the eight cities and districts which comes to 59.49% of the total cases reported on Friday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray already indicated the need to bring in lockdown restrictions in some areas to arrest the spread. On Thursday, he also said the decision will be taken in the next two days. With 1,845 cases, Pune city recorded the highest number of cases across the state. The combined tally of the city and district went up to 2,423 in a day. Nagpur city reported 1,729 cases, second highest after Pune. The combined tally of the city and district comes to 2,067 cases. Maharashtra covered 2,434,966 beneficiaries through its vaccination drive after 80,705 people were inoculated on Thursday. Of them, 72,100 were given the first shot of vaccine and 8,605 were administered second shots who have completed a mandatory gap of 28 days. The figures also include 62,781 beneficiaries who are general public. Of them, 51,775 are citizens above 60 years of age and the remaining 11,006 are aged 45 years and above with comorbidities.Around 12 districts didn’t conduct vaccination drives owing to Mahashivratri following which the daily number of those immunized was much less than the previous day, the officials said.Starting from January 16, the state has covered the first shot of 804,099 healthcare workers (HCWs) and second shot of 309,222 HCWs.

13-03-2021||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran death: ATS recreates crime scene at Thane creek||The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which is probing the death of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, 48, who was allegedly the owner of the car left near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s with loose explosives and was found dead in a creek on March 5, recreated the purported crime scene using a dummy of the same height and weight early Thursday morning. The team also quizzed Hiran’s elder brother Vinod for two hours on Friday. Later, Vinod and Hiran’s son Meet were taken to the ATS office in Wagle Estate in Thane where they were questioned from afternoon till the time of going to print. The team also called ambulance drivers who took Mansukh’s body from the creek to the hospital and saw a five-layer mask on his face. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is conducting a parallel probe into the death, also visited the crime scene on Thursday. Meanwhile, Sachin Vaze, the police officer who was transferred out of the crime branch over his alleged link to the Hiran death case based on Hiran’s wife Vimla’s statement, will join the Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) of Mumbai Police on the ground floor of the Mumbai Police headquarters. The unit handles citizens’ grievances, licences issued by Mumbai Police and other public-related services. Elaborating on the probe, a senior IPS officer said the team of around eight to 10 ATS officials that visited Reti Bunder first consulted with the locals on low and high tides. The team was also said to be accompanied by an officer from the India Meteorological Department to examine the weather conditions and flow of the creek on March 4 and 5. ATS officials feel Hiran’s body was hurled into the creek during low tide, said the officer. During the recreation, the dummy got stuck in the mud, the officer said, adding the ATS team had hired a fisherman’s boat and took the dummy around 30m inside the creek from where they again threw the dummy to see the direction from which the body could have come. After analysing the crime scene and speaking with fishermen, ATS officials feel the culprits might have killed Hiran somewhere else and dumped the body here. His last mobile location was Vasai and Virar, said the officer. Sajjad Nakkad, a Mumbra resident, who has been working for the ambulance service for two years, said, “I went to the ATS office with my employer, Abdulla. I was part of the team that got out Hiran’s body. We were shocked to see the five-layer mask on his face. Later, we took the body to Kalwa civic hospital. We are cooperating with the police.” A fisherman from the area said, “We often help the disaster management team to search bodies. I was there during the rescue of Hiran’s body. There were no injuries. We have told the police everything we know.” ATS officials are collecting from Hiran’s building and other structures in the vicinity the CCTV footage for a month, added the officer. The process of Vaze’s transfer started after leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue in the state Assembly. He alleged that Vaze had used the same Scorpio found near Ambani’s house months before the incident, and sought Vaze’s arrest. Home minister Anil Deshmukh then announced the officer’s transfer in the legislative council on Wednesday. A day after the Scorpio was found parked on Carmichael Road, Deshmukh released a video statement stating that the Mumbai crime branch would investigate the case. Vaze, who was heading the crime intelligence unit, had taken the lead in the investigation. The Scorpio was traced to Hiran and he was called in for questioning by several agencies. He said he had registered a complaint that the SUV was stolen between the night of February 17 and February 18. He was found dead on March 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mansukh-hiran-death-ats-recreates-crime-scene-at-thane-creek-101615577920267.html

The court then directed the agencies to file a progress report in two weeks and posted the next hearing for March 30.A division bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale, while hearing petitions filed by Smita Pansare and Mukta Dabholkar, kin of the slain activists, was informed by advocate Abhay Nevagi that the investigating agencies had not been able to nail the culprits or conclude investigations. The two women sought a court-monitored probe. The court was informed that while the CBI had filed three charge sheets in the Dabholkar case, the CID had made no progress in the Pansare case.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the CBI, assured the court that the agency would file a fresh progress report before the next hearing. Advocate Mankunwar Deshmukh also said a progress report would be filed.After hearing the submissions, the bench said it did not doubt the intentions of the agencies but “the incidents happened in 2013 and 2015...

13-03-2021||Other||Row over proposer: Bombay HC lets candidate fight Parsi Punchayet trustee poll||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP) to allow a candidate to participate in the elections for the trustee on Sunday. BPP had rejected the candidate’s form after it was informed by members of the community that one of her proposers had ceased to profess the Zoroastrian faith after she had submitted her form, and hence it should not be accepted. HC held that as the woman had complied with the procedure for filing her nomination, it was the panchayat’s duty and not the candidate’s to verify if her proposer was a Zoroastrian. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Vinay Joshi, while hearing the interim application in a suit filed by Dr Zuleika Homavazir, was informed by advocate Rajiv Singh that the plea was moved for urgent hearing as a single judge bench of HC had rejected the claims of his client. Singh informed the court that the single judge had failed to take note of the fact that BPP had not followed proper procedure while rejecting the nomination. According to Dr Homavazir’s application, she had filed her nomination form with the first proposer, and it was seconded by another proposer. She submitted that she had verified that both the names were present in the member and donor register before requesting them to propose her name as a candidate. However, after she filed her nomination form, rumours of the first proposer having renounced the Zoroastrian faith and embracing Christianity surfaced. BPP‘s chief executive officer (CEO) asked Dr Homavazir to verify the development, failing which her nomination would be cancelled, as the proposer had to be a practicing Parsi. As she could not get the requisite verification from first proposer, BPP’s CEO cancelled her nomination form. Singh informed the bench that even if it was assumed that the first proposer had renounced the faith, his name was not removed from the register, and the proposer was expected to confirm if the candidate was a Parsi and not the other way around. He also claimed that BPP’s CEO did not follow the proper procedure to verify if the proposer had renounced the faith by giving a 30-day notice to the renouncer, and hence, the rejection of Dr Homavazir’s nomination was invalid. After hearing the submissions, the court held that as there was no proof of the first proposer having renounced the faith, and as BPP’s CEO had not followed proper procedure, the rejection of Dr Homavazir’s nomination was invalid. HC directed the panchayat to accept her nomination form for the election and also gave her the liberty to inform the members of the community of her candidature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-proposer-bombay-hc-lets-candidate-fight-parsi-punchayet-trustee-poll-101615577440204.html
13-03-2021||Kolkata||Mamata out of hospital amid political slugfest||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee was discharged from hospital on Friday, two days after she was injured at an event in Nandigram, as her protégé-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari filed his nomination as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from the seat, setting the stage for a prestige fight in the south Bengal constituency.Banerjee’s injury continued to dominate politics in the poll-bound state. The Trinamool Congress and BJP met the election commission separately, and two reports on the Wednesday incident — one by the state chief secretary and another by poll observers — were submitted to the poll watchdog.Also Read: Mamata injury draws new Bengal battle lineA senior police official said on condition of anonymity that the state government report suggested the chief minister was standing on the footboard of the vehicle and something made the door of the car close and injure the 66-year-old. The report didn’t specifically mention what made the door close, said the officer.Banerjee, who sustained bone injuries in her left ankle and foot, was allowed to go home at her insistence but will have to obey restrictions on movement, said doctors. Around 7.30pm, she was wheeled out of the hospital in a wheelchair and is unlikely to hit the campaign trail before Monday.“She would be able to move around with certain ‘non weight-bearing’ restrictions, which she has been explained. She has agreed to abide by all those restrictions,” said Monimoy Banerjee, director of the state-run SSKM Hospital.Earlier in the day, Adhikari, the incumbent legislator from Nandigram, filed his nomination for the March 1 poll but steered clear of commenting on Banerjee’s injury. He was flanked by two central ministers, Smriti Irani and Dharmendra Pradhan.“Only the BJP can return you your money by selling off the assets, which the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized, once it comes to power. No one else will be able to give you the money back,” he told a rally, referring to ongoing probes in chit fund scams in the state.The TMC, however, hit back and said the BJP was making false promises. “Two central agencies have been investigating the cases since 2013-14. How can he say that if the BJP comes to power, it would return the money by selling off the assets seized by central agencies?” TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh asked.The TMC held silent protests across the state and held rallies in support of Banerjee, who is seeking a third consecutive term in the eight-phase polls starting March 27. “The game is on. A wounded tigress is more aggressive,” said state minister Firhad Hakim.A five-member TMC delegation met election commission officials in Delhi for an hour and submitted a memorandum. “Injuries to Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram were not a result of an unfortunate incident but that of a conspiracy. The events leading up to the attempt on her life leave no doubt that the attack was part of a deep-rooted conspiracy,” TMC MP Saugata Roy told reporters.Hours later, a BJP delegation met EC and demanded a probe. “The party also requested the election commission to make public the video of Banerjee’s rally in which she got injured,” said party general secretary Bhupender Yadav.On Wednesday, Banerjee alleged she was attacked by four-five men without any police presence at the spot, prompting EC to seek a report. “EC directed us to submit the report by 5pm. It has reached by 5pm. It is a confidential report, the details of which can’t be shared,” said Alapan Bandopadhyay, chief secretary of West Bengal.The report suggested that some people managed to get close to the chief minister but didn’t specify the exact sequence of events, said the police officer quoted above.“There were frequent changes in the chief minister’s plans as a result of which last-minute security arrangements had to be made. But it is not true that there were no police personnel at the spot,” said the officer, requesting anonymity.A section of eyewitnesses claim the CM was standing on the footboard when the vehicle’s door hit an iron pillar jutting out of the road, injuring the leader. This theory was rubbished by TMC leaders, who said there were no scratches or dents on the car.Two EC appointed observers – Ajay V Nayak and Vivek Dubey — went to Nandigram on Friday and spoke to senior officials. A poll panel official said the observers sent their reports to Delhi. A virtual meeting was likely to be held between EC officials in Delhi and the observers on Friday evening.In Kolkata, the six-member medical board that treated Banerjee wanted to keep her under observation for another 48 hours. “But due to her repeated requests she was released with appropriate advice and instructions,” said Monimoy Banerjee. Doctors said she was told about the dos and don’ts and the medical board would re-examine her after a week.The plaster on her left leg was removed in the morning to examine the injury. The medical board found satisfactory improvement. “The size of the hematoma has diminished considerably. The bony injury in her ankle has also shown marked sign of improvement. New plaster slab has been done,” Monimoy Banerjee added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-out-of-hospital-amid-political-slugfest-101615576089147.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||At Mumbai’s vaccination centres, long wait tires senior citizens||More than 50 days into the nationwide mass immunisation programme, several vaccination centres in the city are struggling to manage crowds and senior citizens are being made to wait for 90 to 120 minutes to get vaccinated. On Friday, HT visited five medium-sized vaccination centres — Shri Harilal Bhagwati Municipal Hospital in Borivli; Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli; the jumbo Covid centre in Dahisar; Maa Hospital in Chembur, and Mahim Maternity Home — and found little infrastructure in place to make long waits comfortable for beneficiaries. Abhay Chaturvedi, 67, a resident of Mira Road, and his wife, Meera, 64, came to the jumbo Covid centre in Dahisar and had to wait in a long queue before they were able to enter the vaccination room. There were two tents at the entrance that offered shade to those waiting, but no sitting arrangements. “There are so many elderly people coming for vaccination. Some have knee and back pain so can’t keep standing long. But there is no chair available at these centres. We couldn’t even find drinking water,” said Chaturvedi. Crowd management has been a challenge for many centres, especially since glitches in the centralised Co-WIN app has meant those who registered on the app had to wait along with those coming for walk-in appointments. Jayanti Lal Shah, 94, a resident of Borivli, reached Bhagwati Hospital with an appointment on the app but had to wait for 90 minutes with others before getting vaccinated on Friday. Jayantilal Babubhai Desai, 70, who had also registered on the app, said he had to wait for 85 minutes. He said, “When I registered on the app last week, I was only given the date of appointments. But there was no mention of timing. So, even after registration, if I have to wait for hours, exposing myself to probable infections, then why would people register on the app?” With Co-WIN app giving appointment dates for the next month, many are trying their luck with walk-in appointments. “I registered on Thursday and was given the date of April 4 for vaccination. But I didn’t want to wait so long so got vaccinated with the registered documents on Friday,” said Uday Desai, 70, who is a Borivli resident. However, some vaccination centres, like Maa Hospital, do not offer the option of walk-in appointments. When HT visited the hospital, several elderly people were asked to return because they had not registered on the app. Applicants can register on Co-WIN on the app or through the website or via the Arogya Setu app. For many, the process of registering has been difficult. Laxmi Narayan, 69, who was turned away from Maa Hospital on Friday because she hadn’t registered on Co-WIN, said, “We have been trying to log into Co-WIN but couldn’t generate the OTP. So, we thought of coming directly to the centre. Now, we have been asked to go to Rajawadi for vaccination where the walk-in facility is available,” said Narayan’s daughter Sangeeta. The long waits at the vaccination centres have raised concerns of contracting the infection while waiting to be vaccinated. Kandivli resident Bakulesh Desai, 34, said, “I have been coming to vaccination centres with my relatives to provide them assistance and the situation is horrible everywhere. So I have decided to not get my 73-year-old father to get vaccinated, as I don’t want him to be exposed to the virus in the crowd.” When Ujwala Deshmukh, 70, went to the Rosa Gardenia health centre in Thane to get vaccinated on Friday. Her daughter-in-law, Janhvi, said, “My only concern was that the testing centre was way too close to the vaccination centre as they are risking senior citizens by being so close to people who are suspected carriers.” The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) currently has the capacity to inoculate 25,350 people daily and is planning to increase its capacity to 100,000. “We have got the permission from the Central government to allow another 49 hospitals and nursing homes for vaccination. Along with that, private hospitals can run the vaccination 24x7 in their premises. We will soon also increase the vaccination units which will further ease the crowd,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. State advisor Dr Subhas Shalunke emphasised the need to accord more decision making power to the state government. “If Maharashtra is recording the highest number of Covid-19 cases, then there is need for a more vivid planning which is not feasible in a ‘Centre-controlling’ situation. The state government would be given more leeway which will make things faster,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-mumbai-s-vaccination-centres-long-wait-tire-senior-citizens-101615576000370.html
13-03-2021||Mumbai||1 year of Covid: 6,099 civic staffers infected; 197 died in Mumbai||In one year since Covid-19 hit the city, more than 6,000 staff members of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) tested positive for Covid-19 and around 200 have lost their lives on frontline duty, according to BMC data.According to BMC officials, 6,099 civic employees were infected, of whom 5,066 have recovered and 197 have lost their lives.

For others, the compensation is in process. BMC officials said that maximum deaths were reported from solid waste management (SWM) department followed by health department. A civic official said, “SWM and health workers were on duty even during the strictest lockdown, collecting waste and treating those infected, and hence they have the majority of fatality.”The official added, “Since the past 45 days, the growth has slowed down and the number of deaths has remained same for nearly one month. Also, vaccination for frontline and healthcare workers started from January 16.”According to data from BMC, a total of 180,233 healthcare workers have been vaccinated in the city, followed by 120,115 frontline workers. Overall, 513,686 have been vaccinated which includes 213,338 senior citizens and those aged above 45 year with comorbidities.Meanwhile, Mahendra Zankar, secretary of Municipal Kamgar Sangh, said, “We are aware that families of all those who lost their lives on frontline duty have not been compensated yet. Though the spread has slowed down now as vaccination has started, we request BMC to fasten the process of giving ₹50 lakh compensation to the families along with job to one member from each family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1-year-of-covid-6-099-civic-staffers-infected-197-died-in-mumbai-101615575940194.html

13-03-2021||Gurugram||City records 88 new Covid-19 cases — highest in two months||With 88 new cases of Covid-19 being reported in the past 24 hours, the city recorded its sharpest spike in the past two months. While the total caseload has reached 59,698, the number of active cases has reached 551 — up from 513 on Thursday. The district until December 2020 recorded more than 100 new infections a day. It declined to 88 new infections on January 8. But the number of active cases stood at 772. Due to the decline in daily new cases to roughly 30 every day, the active case count had declined to 372 by February 1. Earlier this week, on Tuesday, 74 cases were registered, thereby recording a two-month high. Of all the active cases on Friday, 506 mild or asymptomatic cases are under home-isolation, while one mild case is under observation at the government Covid care centre. Another 43 are ‘moderate’ cases, who are displaying either symptoms of pneumonia or require oxygen support at secondary health care facilities, while one patient is currently receiving tertiary care at a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. The district also witnessed 50 recoveries on Friday. Gurugram’s chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said that the health department was expecting a surge in mid-March. Yadav said that cases were rising since many people had let their guards down and were not adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour. “The economy is open. As such, people are back to their normal routine and travelling as before. People need to stay vigilant and adopt measures such as social distancing and the regular use of masks,” said Yadav. Laying emphasis on testing, he said, “If people are travelling or mingling at crowded places or feel that they might have come in contact with a Covid-19 carrier, they should get tested at the earliest. They need to isolate and quarantine if they suspect themselves of having contracted the virus.” Yadav said that the health department had increased testing from 2,500 to 3,500 cases and will continue to take appropriate steps in accordance with the evolving situation. “We were expecting cases to rise in March. As the situation develops, we will take steps accordingly. We are conducting nearly 3,500 tests daily. If required, we will increase the testing further,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-records-88-new-covid-19-cases-highest-in-two-months-101615574260663.html

CCTV footage of the incident, which went viral, showed the four men falling to the ground moments after the lightning strike.The incident happened in the residential township Vatika India Next and the four men were attached with its horticulture department. All four of them were rushed to the hospital where the condition of Ram Prasad (38) was reported to be critical. He later succumbed to his injuries. The rest, Shiv Dutt (43), Lali (32), and Anil Kumar (32), were stable and recovering.Shakti Singh Chauhan, deputy general manager operations of Vatika India Next, said, “The horticulture team was working when it started raining suddenly at around 4.20 pm. Four of them rushed to take cover under a tree. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck them, and they fell unconscious. We received a call from a guard following which a quick response team (QRT) was sent to the park and they were taken to a private hospital in Manesar.”Chauhan said the CCTV footage was recovered from a resident’s villa which is part of the township. “The family members of the injured have been informed and a team is stationed in the hospital where they are undergoing treatment,” he said.The residents informed the police control room following which a team from Kherki Daula police station visited the township and recorded statements of the residents and management.Krishan Kant, station house officer of Kherki Daula police station, said that they have made a daily diary entry in the records and no case has been registered in the incident. “Ram Prasad is admitted in intensive care unit and is critical,” he said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people find shelter indoors in case of lightning, call emergency services (it is safe to use mobile phones), move a victim to a safer location (be aware of continued lightning risk) and if the victim not breathing, administer cardiac compressions (CPR) till help arrives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lightning-strike-injures-4-in-gurugram-residential-township-101615574260048.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||Man shot at by two snatchers in Sector 15||A 34-year-old businessman was shot at by two unidentified bike-borne men when he resisted their attempt to snatch his bag on Thursday evening in Sector 15, Part-2, said the police, adding that the bag contained ₹60,000 cash. The incident took place around 7pm, when the victim, Pankaj Gupta, a resident of Patel Nagar in Sector 15, was returning home from Delhi’s Chandni Chowk, where he works at a currency exchange company. As soon as he took a right turn from Jharsa Chowk, he saw two men on a motorcycle following him. Later they tried to intercept his scooter. Gupta said he initially thought that they were asking him for an address but then the pillion rider asked him to hand over the bag. “Before I could shout for help they tried to pull my bag. As a result, I lost control and fell on the road. The suspects tried to pull at the strings of the bag. When I resisted, they assaulted me. I shouted for help but no one came forward,” he said. Meanwhile, one of the snatchers allegedly took out his gun and threatened Gupta. But when he did not any pay heed to his threats, he allegedly pumped a bullet into his right arm.Ravi Kumar, one of the auto-rickshaw drivers who witnessed the incident, said after a few vehicles gathered at the spot, the suspects fled from the spot. “I had parked my auto-rickshaw on the other side of the road. Shopkeepers and passersby had stopped to help the victim but after the gunshot everyone got scared and left the spot,” he said. Gupta sustained a bullet on his right arm. He requested passersby to inform his father regarding the incident.Gupta alleged that although the police control room (PCR) van was stationed hardly 50 metres away from the spot, no one came forward for help. “The police team reached the spot after the suspects. They seemed to have a casual approach and did not even try to follow the suspects,” he said. The victim’s father, Ravinder Gupta (62), who works in a garment shop in Sadar market, reached the spot within 15 minutes and took his son to a private hospital. “My son will get operated on his right arm on Saturday and a rod will be fixed as his arm is fractured and cannot be cured through plaster,” he said, adding that his condition was stable. The area in Sector 15, where the incident took place, had reported similar incidents in the past. A case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code and sections of Arms Act was registered at Civil Lines police station on Thursday night. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said prima facie, it appeared that the suspects were following Gupta from Delhi but did not get a chance to target him. “They tried to intercept his scooter, when he applied brakes at a speed-breaker near Sector 15. They asked him to hand over the bag several times and later shot at him. We are scanning CCTV footage to identify the suspects and crime teams are working on it,” he said. The police also rebutted the allegations made by the victim that the police had a casual attitude.“The police teams were active and within minutes had informed the crime units to reach the spot. A dog squad and forensic team were also called on the spot to collect samples and scan CCTV footage,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/man-shot-at-by-two-snatchers-in-sector-15-101615574201541.html

While light rain prevailed in the morning hours until 10 am, and later during the day in patches, the evening saw gusty winds and lightning with a prolonged spell of rain. The maximum temperature also came down by several degrees due to the rain.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that light rain had taken place across Delhi-NCR on account of a western disturbance. “By Saturday morning, the impact of the western disturbance should cease. No further rain is predicted for the region in the coming days,” said Srivastava. While the IMD has said that two fresh western disturbances were likely to affect the western Himalayan region and the adjoining plains of Northwest India, the plains will not be affected.

But the local councillor said all rules were observed and that it was done to help the people.Forest range officer (Gurugram range) Karambir Malik said, “Our guards were patrolling at Arjun Marg in DLF Phase-1 when they saw a tree being pruned without permission from the forest department. They immediately stopped it.” The forest department registered a case against two persons under Section 4 of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Malik said a Peepal tree could only be cut under specific situations like if the tree was growing inside a house or posed a threat to life.The forest department’s complained named Sundar Bhatti, who works with the local councillor R S Rathee. “We had been getting complaints from people in the area that monkeys were spotted on the tree and that the animals posed a threat to people. As representatives of the public, we were only helping in solving their problem. We did not cut the tree, it was only being pruned,” he said.Councillor Rathee said, “None of the trees in the area had been pruned in the last four years. Senior citizen residents had been complaining that they were not getting enough sunlight. We were trimming the tree as per norms, but we stopped it when the forest officials asked us. We did not violate any rule.”In September 2020, the Gurugram Police registered a case against unidentified persons for allegedly chopping around 40 to 50 trees illegally, damaging a green belt and a drain in front of Block C of Mayfield Garden in Sector 50.Earlier, residents’ welfare associations have also been fined for illegal pruning of trees in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/forest-department-stops-tree-pruning-at-dlf-phase-1-101615574199389.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||Haryana government proposes to set up two film cities||The Haryana government has planned to set up two film cities in the state — one at Gurugram and the other at Pinjore. This was announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in his budget speech on Friday. The state government has been working on developing a film city for the last two years and, in 2018, it had come up with a film policy for Haryana to boost local production and provide latest facilities to filmmakers from across the country, who want to produce films in the state. “We plan to promote filmmaking across the state and facilities for the same would be created. We plan to develop two film cities, one at Pinjore and another at Gurugram, to give a boost to this industry,” said Khattar in his address. Earlier on January 15, the CM had announced the plan to develop a film city and said that project would be developed on the basis of a public-private partnership. Satish Kaushik, a Bollywood veteran, who is also the chairperson of Haryana Film Promotion Board, said that setting up film cities in Gurugram and Pinjore will give a boost to local artists and technicians. “The entertainment industry is expanding across the country. Local culture, traditions, language in Haryana can be utilised by the industry at both the local and national levels,” said Kaushik, adding that recent films shot in Haryana have won both critical acclaim and commercial success. Kaushik, who hails from Mahendragarh district in Haryana, further said that right incentives, subsidies and ensuring single-window clearances would ensure the success of the film policy and the two film cities.Earlier Khattar on January 15 had also announced that a state-level award will be given to artists in Haryana to encourage their work and to promote arts. In January 2020, the state government had changed the name of Haryana Film Cell to Haryana Film Promotion Board and the name of the High Powered Committee was designated as Governing Council. The decision to set up a new film city has been welcomed by the city-based businessmen and politicians, who said it was a timely decision and would promote both culture and artists and bring in business as well. “Several small films and advertisements were already being shot in Gurugram and setting up a film city is only a logical decision. It will not only promote local culture and art but also create job and business opportunities in the state,” said Rao Inderjit Singh, Gurguram MP. Realtors, meanwhile, said that government’s proposal to develop a film city was a boon for the region. “Creation of a film city will make a positive impact on Gurugram’s realty market and new employment opportunities will also be generated,” said Ashish Sarin, CEO, AlphaCorp.As per the film policy of 2018, films have been accorded the status of industry and granted benefits under the enterprise promotion policy of the state. It also made provisions for a single-window system, incentives for producing local films, promotion of film shoots in Haryana, provision for security to filmmakers, holding award functions, preventing piracy and several other measures to boost the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-government-proposes-to-set-up-two-film-cities-101615574140640.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||A year on, 27-year old recalls the stigma she faced on being Haryana’s ‘Patient Zero’||In a society that puts a lot of onus on being “numero uno (number one)”, the stigma of being “Patient Zero” and that too of a dreaded disease like Covid-19 was life-altering for a 27-year-old resident of Sector 9, Gurugram. A year ago, on March 13, she became the first known case of Covid-19 in the district as well as the state of Haryana. “In the early days of the pandemic, patients faced more stigma than they do now,” she says, while recalling her personal struggle with the pandemic. On Friday, a day when the Gurugram district reported nearly 60,000 Covid-19 cases, the 27-year-old looked spoke about how she coped -- with the shoddy surroundings of government hospitals, the constant nagging by people around her, and the stigma she had to face even months after being fully recovered“The stigma is now inversely proportional to the number of cases -- the more the cases, the lesser the stigma. Earlier, even a few months after recovery, I had to limit my evening walks as people who knew me looked at me differently. Although I used to wear a mask, I still felt that people were frightened of me. But, I don’t feel stigmatised now when I walk around.” Her diagnosis on March 13 marked the beginning of the pandemic in the district and the state. None of her family members tested positive but new cases from different parts of the city started emerging every day since March 13. On March 12 itself, when her sample was sent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, the Haryana government declared an epidemic in the state and issued a set of guidelines, “The Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020”. Within a few days, gatherings were limited, malls shut, small businesses closed and normal life, as we knew it , came to a standstill. For the woman, it all started with a vacation that she took with her cousin to Malaysia and Indonesia on February 22. A few days after returning home on March 4, she noticed the onset of symptoms like fever and cold. Her samples were collected on March 12 and she was confirmed Covid-19 positive within 24 hours. “I still don’t know how and where I contracted the disease,” she says. “That night, the health team visited our home, asking me to get admitted to the Civil Hospital. Two policemen were also put on guard outside my house,” she recalls. The next morning, she along with her mother reached the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 to get admitted.“There was no hospital staff to take care of my needs in the Covid ward. I was totally on my own. It was particularly frightened when I saw rats in the ward. I called my mother and asked her to get me out of there,” she said. The next day, she was admitted to a private hospital. “My mother was the rock upon which I relied throughout the entire episode. She kept me mentally strong,” she says. The way events unfolded affected her family too. “Our contact details were leaked and circulated on every WhatsApp group. My parents and I got calls from unknown numbers to confirm the news. Even neighbours harassed us by constantly asking about our well-being,” she said. The news and social media feeds made her more apprehensive.“I took a break from social media and limited my interaction to a few people related to work,” she said, adding that it took her months to be active on social media again. “Over time, with increasing awareness about the disease, the anxiety went away. But I still see people ignoring the safety guidelines in public spaces and that makes me nervous,” she says.Now that the vaccination is well underway, she believes that life will get back to normal soon. But she is not yet eligible for the vaccination. “I will take it when it is available for people of my age. Nobody in my family has taken the vaccine yet. But until we achieve herd immunity, we will continue to wear masks,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/a-year-on-27-year-old-recalls-the-stigma-she-faced-on-being-haryana-s-patient-zero-101615574139565.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||CM announces slew of infra and industrial projects in and around Gurugram||Haryana chief minister, who also holds the finance portfolio, announced the setting up of a Global City in Manesar and townships near major expressways near Gurugram, while presenting the state budget in the Assembly on Friday.The Global City is a proposed special zone that will contain both residential and commercial spaces. The land for the project falls in sectors 36, 36B, 37 and 37B along the Dwarka expressway and is expected to become an important economic and financial hub on the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor.The CM, who delivered his second budget, said the project would accelerate the pace of development in the state along with other asset monetisation schemes.To provide drinking water to Mewat, the minister said it was decided to construct a feeder canal of 100 cusecs capacity from the Gurugram Water Supply Channel near Badli running along the KMP Expressway.The Haryana Orbital Rail Corridor, being built at a cost of ₹5,618 crore, will augment rail infrastructure and enhance rail connectivity to un-served regions of the state, he said. It would serve as a feeder line for the Dedicated Freight Corridor and would contribute to the industrial growth of Haryana, he added.Khattar said that industrial and commercial township over nearly 3,300 acres near Kharkhoda in Sonepat and a Industrial Model Township over 1400 acres in Sohna were being developed. “These townships will be in the vicinity of KMP Expressway connecting the Gurugram-Sohna-Alwar highway. An Integrated Multi Modal Logistics Hub is being developed in the PPP (public-private partnership) mode... (it’ll be) the largest logistics hub in north India over 886.78 acres at Nangal Chaudhary, Narnaul with an investment of ₹4,000 crore. It has the potential to reduce time to move goods from 14 days to 14 hours,” said Khattar.The minister announced that a company was developing a mega project to supply batteries for smartphones and electric vehicles at IMT, Sohna for which the for which the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation had alloted 178 acres. The company will invest around ₹7,083 crore over the next few and generate around 7,000 jobs, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cm-announces-slew-of-infra-and-industrial-projects-in-and-around-gurugram-101615574140085.html
13-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram’s battle against Covid-19 is a year old today||A year ago on March 13, around 8.45pm, district epidemiologist Dr Ram Prakash was on his way home to Delhi’s Najafgarh when he got a confidential call from an employee of the state health department, confirming the first case of Covid-19 in Gurugram, and also in Haryana -- that of a 27-year-old woman resident of Sector 9. Prakash immediately called the chief medical officer, returned to his office, and headed straight to Patient Zero’s home along with his team. Thus began the battle against a pandemic -- the World Health Organization had declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 -- the likes of which the district had never seen before. Since then, 59, 698 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Gurugram and 359 people have died of the disease. Data shows that Gurugram, which experienced two severe waves of the infection until now, was among the worst-hit districts in Haryana. The district had to grapple with its own share of challenges — it had no prior exposure in handling a public health crisis of this magnitude; there were several delays in interdepartmental coordination; manpower and resources fell woefully short; and fear was spreading rapidly among the people in the absence of awareness about the disease. Still a workforce of just over 30,000 managed to best the dreaded infection -- from a peak of almost 1,000 cases a day in November , Gurugram managed to reduce the daily caseload to 16 (as on February 15). The test positivity rate, which had at one time climbed to 23% (last June) is currently 1.7%. To achieve this reduction, Gurugram stepped up testing; at one point conducting more than 3,000 tests daily. With several Fortune 500 companies having offices in the city, corporates, too, came to the aid of the district administration and cumulatively contributed nearly ₹30 crore for various Covid-related work.Interdepartmental coordination “Over 30,000 government officials and employees were part of an extensive exercise to curb transmission of infection in Gurugram. Coordination between various departments such as health, revenue, municipal corporation, agriculture, education and others was crucial,” said Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner. In June, during the peak period of infection, the administration allocated tasks among different departments to curb the infection -- if health department did the sample collection, MCG maintained the records on test reports. Based on the test results, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran(HSVP) employees worked on contact tracing, while co-ordinating with the health department, police and the district administration’s mobile wellness unit simultaneously. Panwar said, “Although Covid-19 comes under disaster management, there is only a flood control unit to handle a disaster. Covid -19 was new to everyone. Everything had to be done within short deadlines — from manufacturing masks and sanitisers to making personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for which we had to take permission from a government body in Coimbatore. Companies in the auto sector helped to manufacture these items.” Even for those involved in activities such as food and ration distribution, the challenges were similar. Mohit Sharma, chief warden, civil defence — he was recently felicitated with the Utkrisht Seva Medal by the Union ministry of home affairs for his contribution in handling the migrant labour crisis and ration distribution during the Covid-19 lockdown — felt that resource management could have been better. “Volunteers, small groups, residents’ welfare associations, which were involved in food and dry ration distribution, had scant idea how to handle a crisis like Covid-19,” Sharma said.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime branch, agreed that coordination problems existed. “Co-ordination between departments has always been difficult. The impact of the lack of coordination was felt throughout the course of the pandemic.”For better co-ordination, nodal officers, along with deputy commissioner and divisional commissioner, held meetings daily to discuss and clear all roadblocks. They came up with an internal application to access records related to Covid-19, from testing to contact tracing and identifying hot spot areas where containment needed to be strictly imposed. Making the most of resourcesIn the beginning, there were no arrangements or machinery to conduct large-scale testing or deliver timely results, recalled Dr Virender Yadav, who joined as Gurugram’s chief medical officer last June, when cases were at its peak in the district. “The reporting schedule, arrangements for hospital admission of severe patients and contact tracing were all in a disarray,” said Yadav, adding that department had only two RT-PCR testing machines at that time. “Handling a pandemic is challenging. It is once-in-a-lifetime kind of crisis, where it is difficult to predict how people will behave. The situations are dynamic and keep changing every now and then,” he said.The staff too lacked exposure to handle a pandemic. “After swine flu, none of us has experienced a major health crisis like Covid-19. Extensive training had to be given to the staff to handle the situation effectively. Even now, some of them are still hesitant about dealing with Covid cases,” Prakash said. Through a series of training sessions for health workers, installation of two RT-PCR machines at Civil Hospital to speed up testing, and by holding several testing camps daily, Gurugram made the most of the resources available at its disposal. The district also hired additional lab technicians to step up testing. Tackling fear ADC Panwar says fear in the initial months was so rife that relatives refused to perform the last rites of deceased Covid-19 patients. “Our people had to bury or burn the bodies. Families refused to collect the bodies and perform last rites,” he said. Those who directly dealt with positive persons and their families, like accredited social health activists (ASHAs), auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and lab technicians, were equally wary. “When people within the system are so wary, it becomes important to have leadership and motivational skills to keep your team going,” Yadav said. But creating awareness among the general population is still difficult, said ACP Sangwan. “People simply stopped wearing masks due to their lack of awareness. How many fines can the police issue? if people are not willing to take a contagious disease like Covid-19 seriously, even after a year, then there is little that police can do,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrams-battle-against-covid-19-is-a-year-old-today-101615574080645.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Light rain washes away pollutants, gives respite from rising heat||The national capital on Friday received light rain, thunderstorms and strong winds, which helped pull back the rising temperature in the city. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said lower temperatures are likely to persist over the weekend, and Saturday morning may see light showers.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecast centre, said till 7pm Friday, the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, received around 6mm rain.“The entire city received light rain on Friday. We started receiving the first spell around 7.30am, and it lasted for around two hours. Some areas in Delhi also received rain in the evening,” Srivastava said. The Palam weather station received 2mm rain, Lodhi Road 4.1mm, Aya Nagar 2.1mm and the Ridge received 0.5mm of rain on Friday. Scientists said the rain was the result of a western disturbance passing over the north-west region. A western disturbance is an extratropical storm that originates in the Mediterranean, bringing with it rain and a drop in temperature. It is mostly associated with winter rain in India. Met officials also said Friday was mostly windy, which led to a drastic fall in daytime temperature. The maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 30.7 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s normal. This was down from 35.2 degrees Celsius, recorded on Thursday, which was the highest this winter so far. The minimum temperature on Friday was 17.9 degrees Celsius, three degrees above what is considered normal for the season. The strong winds also led to a marginal improvement in the pollution levels. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQi) of the city was 218, in the “poor” category. On Thursday, the AQI was 242, also in the “poor” category. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the improvement in air quality will continue till Sunday. “Expected rainfall is likely to contribute to AQI positively. The average AQI is likely to improve to the moderate category on Saturday. Moderate to poor AQI is forecasted for March 14 and March 15,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/light-rain-washes-away-pollutants-gives-respite-from-rising-heat-101615574081168.html
13-03-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: 20-year-old gang-raped in moving SUV, three booked||Ghaziabad: A 20-year-old woman from Meerut was allegedly gang-raped by three men in a moving SUV on Thursday, the police have said. Officers said they have formed a team to investigate the case and that the suspects were allegedly known to the woman. On the basis of a complaint filed by the woman on Thursday night, an FIR was registered against the three suspects under sections 376D (gang rape) and 354 (molestation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Masuri police station, senior police officers said. According to police, the woman alleged that three men came to her house in Meerut and took her along in their Scorpio SUV to meet a prospective match for marriage.“The woman alleged that the three men told her to sit in the SUV around 10am on Thursday. She approached the Masuri police station around 11pm the same day and narrated the incident in which she alleged that the men drove around in their SUV with her inside and gang-raped and molested her. We immediately registered an FIR and formed a team to investigate the case. The woman has been sent for medical examination,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).All three suspects are around the 25-30 years age groud and are residents of Meerut, the police said. The woman alleged in her complaint that the incident took place in the car in Meerut. “The woman also told the police that the men dropped her near Masuri around 10pm and she later approached the police. She said that she had known the suspects for about a month when she met them at a friend’s wedding. She did not indicate use of any sedative during the incident and also said that her mobile phone was left behind in the car,” the SP said. Police said that the woman had married a man in Meerut about a year ago but soon the marriage ended in separation. According to the police, the woman in her complaint also alleged that the suspects had spoken to her mother a couple of times about getting her married once again. The woman also told police that on Thursday morning, her mother was not at home when the suspects had come to her house, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-20-year-old-gang-raped-in-moving-suv-three-booked-101615574079973.html
13-03-2021||Other||Sisodia orders probe in financial irregularities of 12 DU colleges||New DelhiDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday ordered a probe in the alleged irregularities in 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges which have not paid salaries to their teaching and non-teaching staff for months. The probe by Sisodia — who is also the state education minister — was ordered on a day when the 12 DU colleges received their grant-in aid for the fourth quarter from the government and a day after teachers launched an indefinite university shut down to demand for their wages.Sisodia questioned why colleges had not paid salaries to the staff for months despite the release of grants for the third quarter. “The non-submission of utilisation certificates seems to indicate financial irregularities. It seems like an attempt to avoid scrutiny and accountability. The Directorate of Higher Education is hereby directed to set up an enquiry committee – which should include senior account functionaries – to look into how the third quarter grants and existing surplus funds have been spent by these colleges,” Sisodia said on Friday. This is not the first time the government has alleged financial irregularities in these colleges. Last year too, the government had alleged that a special audit sanctioned by them had revealed financial irregularities in these colleges indicating a “big fraud” and “ghost appointments”.The 12 fully state-funded colleges in DU have been at the loggerheads with the Delhi government since 2019 over the formation of governing bodies and the delay in the release of grants leading to pending salaries of staff. The 10-member governing bodies in these colleges have people nominated by both the university and the Delhi government and are responsible for functions like appointments.According to the government documents seen by HT, the government has released ₹82.79 crore under salaries sub-head and ₹9.50 crore under general sub-head as fourth installment of grant-in-aid by the government. Of the 12 colleges, the government has not released any fund under salary head for Bhagini Nivedita College and Maharishi Valmiki College of Applied Sciences. A government official said this was because the colleges had “unspent funds.” Despite repeated calls and messages, college principals did not comment on the matter.The present cycle of the crisis started earlier this week when Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), after receiving representations from teachers of these state-funded colleges, announced a university-wide indefinite shutdown beginning March 11.DUTA President Rajib Ray said they will hold a meeting on Saturday to decide on the further course of action. “Though the fourth quarter grant has been released, there are still issues which need to be discussed like de-affiliation and the inquiry ordered into the government-funded colleges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sisodia-orders-probe-in-financial-irregularities-of-12-du-colleges-101615574079407.html
13-03-2021||Other||FasTag from next week at Yamuna Expressway||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Friday said FasTag service at the 165km Yamuna Expressway are likely to become functional next week while the operator – Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) – will also install a crash median on the highway.Officials of the JIL said that on Friday, they signed an agreement with a private bank which would help them with the software installation for FasTag services, besides which the operator was also awarded a ₹108 crore contract the same day for the crash barriers. The barriers are to be installed on the divider of the 165-km expressway which has witnessed several accidents since it was opened in August, 2012 said officials.The move comes a fortnight after the Yeida filed an FIR against the management of JIL on February 24 over allegedly delaying the installation of the crash barrier, which officials say can reduce fatalities in accidents. The Uttar Pradesh government had swung into action in 2018 after the Supreme Court had pulled up the state in response to a public interest litigation that had demanded adequate safety measures on the expressway. Following directions from the state government for a safety audit, the Yeida had roped in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi for a safety audit the same year, which had advocated the installation of crash barriers as one of the key measures for commuter safety.“The installation of crash barriers on the median of the expressway will be started next month as all tender formalities are in place. Also, the FasTag will be made functional on this Expressway so that commuters do not face congestion at toll plazas,” said Arun Vir Singh, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Yeida. The crash barrier will be installed within a year from the day work begins at the ground.“On Friday we signed an agreement with a private bank that will take required measures to start charging toll via FasTag as soon as possible. The fast tag installation work will not be delayed now,” said Ashok Khera vice-president of JIL.Unlike National Highways in the country, the Yamuna Expressway is managed by a private operator – JIL – which had not been using FasTag to charge toll from commuters. Since the toll collection was manual, the commuters were facing inconvenience on the expressway.The IIT Delhi safety audit had said that if the crash barrier is installed at the median of the expressway, it can act as a cushion.“A vehicle met with an accident on the expressway colliding with the median will not cross over to the other side and hit other vehicles, extending the damage. The crash barrier will minimise the damage and stop the vehicle from crossing over to the other side,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fastag-from-next-week-at-yamuna-expressway-101615574020525.html

Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant told HT that four people were called in for questioning, however, refused to elaborate further. An official in Bengaluru police, however, said that a person was detained from Sira in Tumkur district and three journalists from there different news channels were also questioned.Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant on Friday morning announced the formation of a seven-member team, comprising of Joint Commissioner Sandeep Patil (Central Crime Branch), DCP Ravikumar (CCB), DCP Central MN Anuchet and ACP Dharmendra among others to assist Addl CP Mukherjee.Within hours of its formation, the SIT detained the four individuals for questioning.Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday announced the formation of the SIT led by additional commissioner of police Soumendu Mukherjee.BJP MLA Jarkiholi stepped down as Karnataka’s water resources minister on March 3 amid allegations of sexual harassment against him. The formation of the SIT came a day after Jarkiholi claimed that he was aware of the political conspiracy being hatched against him for around four months.On Thursday, former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy questioned the decision to form the SIT. Speaking to the reporters in Bengaluru, he said, “I don’t know on what basis the order on constituting SIT has been issued… against whom will they conduct an investigation.

13-03-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Parents object to classroom teaching in Gautam Buddha University||Noida: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a section of parents has objected to the Gautam Buddha University’s (GBU’s) recent move asking its students to join the hostel and attend physical classes. The university has planned to resume classroom teaching from March 15 in a phased manner.Satyendra Bhati, whose son is a student of second semester BA-LLB programme, said that the parents have also written to the UP chief minister requesting him to allow online classes for the next three months till the Covid situation turns normal. “The university has been conducting online classes for the last one year, and online classes are doing well. The first semester exams were also held online. Now, we have got a notice that the students need to report to the university by March 15. The university will quarantine the students in the hostel for two weeks and from April first week, it will start the classroom teaching as per the notice,” said Bhati, a resident of Greater Noida.Bhati said that the second semester examination is scheduled in May. “We object to the university’s move because after the examination there will be a summer break. Why should students stay in a hostel just for one month when the situation is not conducive?” he said.Satyapal Singh, another parent, said that he is not confident enough to send his son for classroom teaching in GBU. “My son is a student of second semester LLB programme. I will not send him to the university till the situation turns normal. I feel that the university should allow students to complete next semester in online mode,” he said.University officials said that they have opened the campus in four phases after taking all safety measures. Prof Bhagwati Prakash Sharma, GBU vice-chancellor, said that the state government has issued guidelines to open academic institutions in a phased manner. “We have observed all safety measures and accordingly opened the campus for students,” he said.AK Singh, GBU spokesperson, said that the varsity first called the research scholars in February. “They were quarantined for two weeks and they are fine. We then called the last semester students, and then other existing students were called. They have also completed the quarantine period and are ready to join the classes from March 15. Now, the newly admitted students of the second semester are asked to join the classes,” he said.There are around 4,400 students in the GBU. “These students are required to produce a Covid-19 negative report before entry to the hostel. The university has a residential campus and outsiders’ entry is strictly regulated,” said Singh.The GBU spokesperson further said that the university is also organising mid-semester examination which carries 30% marks. “It will be good for the students to come to the campus for studies and exams. If any students do not want to come, their parents need to give an undertaking citing a valid reason. Those students can continue online studies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-parents-object-to-classroom-teaching-in-gautam-buddha-university-101615574019392.html
13-03-2021||Other||60-yr-old dies after fight with neighbour in Chandni Mahal, 4 arrested||New DelhiA 60-year-old man died after suffering internal injuries during a scuffle on Tuesday night with his neighbours in central Delhi’s Chandni Mahal area, police said on Friday. The police said that the fight started over the use of an elevator installed in the building. Four persons have been so far arrested in connection with the murder and have been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, said deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh. Police identified the arrested persons as Mukhtar Hussain,61, and his brother Mumtaz Hussain,60, occupants of the ground floor, and Mohammad Saleem,60, and his son Mohammad Salman,30, living on the first floor. “The building has an elevator that was installed some years ago but was defunct. The victim family living on the fourth floor wanted to get the elevator repaired, but the occupants of the ground and first floors opposed the idea. This led to a quarrel between the two groups,” said DCP Singh. Police said that on Tuesday, at around 7.23 pm, the police control room received a call regarding a quarrel at a residential building in Haveli Azam Khan in Chandni Mahal. A police team reached the spot and learnt that the occupants of the fourth floor of the building, Mohammad Shakeel, 60, and his son Mohammad Asad, 23, were “manhandled and beaten up” by the occupants of the ground and first floors, the police said. According to the DCP, Mohammad Shakeel suffered injuries in his stomach during the fight and he himself went to a nearby government hospital on a cycle rickshaw with another man. In his statement, Shakeel, who works as a cook, alleged that he was punched in his stomach. “Shakeel’s condition deteriorated during the course of treatment and he died at the hospital. There were no visible injury marks on his body. His preliminary autopsy report showed that he had a rib fracture. The final report is awaited,” said DCP Singh, adding that a case had been registered and four neighbours who were involved in the quarrel were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/60yrold-dies-after-fight-with-neighbour-in-chandni-mahal-4-arrested-101615574019975.html

Five more people succumbed to Covid- 19, taking the death toll to 12,386 across Karnataka, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.The meeting comes at a time when Bengaluru has witnessed a surge in cases over the last few days and is among the top 10 most impacted districts in the country, with 6,008 active cases out of the total 8,114 across the state, sparking fears of a possible second wave of infections.The BBMP on Friday identified another Covid-19 cluster in the Government Medical and Engineering College, where seven people tested positive out of the 158 who were screened for the virus.“All seven positive cases are traced, counselled and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, Jayanagar,” the BBMP said. The civic body added that the index patient was moved to Victoria hospital on March 8. The BBMP has instructed others in the hostel to follow safety protocols and alert authorities if they develop any symptoms and also that there would be a mandatory repeat testing in seven days.Karnataka is aiming to increase its daily vaccination count to contain the problem. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday was vaccinated along with K.Sudhakar, the state’s health minister.A total of 1,270,782 persons have been vaccinated across Karnataka, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bbmp-plans-covid-testing-in-crowded-markets-malls-101615573960544.html
13-03-2021||Delhi||Highest single-day Covid in over two months in Delhi||The trend of rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi continued on Friday as the city reported 431 new infections, the highest single-day rise in over two months, or since January 9, with experts warning that the Capital may be looking at the start of the fourth Covid wave.The seven-day average of daily cases, also known as the case trajectory, in the Capital has now been rising for 18 straight days – this number has gone from 134 for the week ending on February 22 to 339 in the last week. This means that Delhi is now reporting, on average, 200 more cases every day than what it was less than three weeks ago. With 72,031 tests conducted, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that test positive among total tested – stood at 0.60%, which was again the highest since January 9.To keep new infections in check, Delhi government officials said they are focussing on tracing as many as 30 contacts for every positive case recorded. “We are focussing on aggressive contact tracing. For every case, we are tracing a minimum of 30 contacts and keeping them under surveillance. We are trying to contain the infection before it has a chance to spread again,” said a senior district level official on condition of anonymity.Only half as many contacts were being traced on average in November beginning, when Delhi had witnessed its third surge in the number of infections. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had in November said, “If a person tests positive then his entire family and the people in contact have to be tested, thus more cases of Covid-19 were recorded. Earlier six-seven contacts of a positive person were traced, now this number has crossed 15.”The district official also added that in addition to contact tracing, focus was also on increasing the number of tests and vaccinations. “To control the spread, we are also testing more people to ensure we pick up as many cases as we can. This also helps in detecting asymptomatic cases among the floating population that travels between states. We already have protocols for testing international passengers,” the official said. The Centre on Thursday had said that Delhi-NCR was also becoming one of the regions of concern where Covid-19 was seeing an uptick. “There is spike in cases in Maharashtra and Kerala too. But there is a difference. The positivity rates in those states are high. In Delhi, the positivity rate has been lower than 1% for more than two months now. The government is prepared in all aspects of Covid-19 management, and we have maintained tests at scaled-up levels,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain told reporters outside the Delhi assembly on Friday. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if the positivity rate remains below 5% for over two weeks. In Delhi, 202,970 people over the age of 60 or over the age of 45 with comorbidities have received one dose of a vaccine against Covid-19. There are 261,165 frontline workers and 171,120 healthcare workers who have got at least one shot, according to government data. This means, only 3.1% of Delhi’s population of 20 million has received at least one dose of the vaccine. And, only 0.5% of the population has received both doses completing their immunisation. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “Our team did a modelling to see the impact of measures like masking and social distancing on the spread of Covid-19. What we saw is that even with vaccination, if we stop following these norms the number of cases could increase manifold. The recent serosurveillance study shows that over 50% of the people in Delhi have already been exposed to the infection and yet there is an increase in case. It will take a long time to develop that level of herd immunity through immunisation.” “We need to continue following the Covid-19 norms; there is Holi this month and celebrations should be curtailed to ensure we do not see a surge like after Diwali,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/highest-single-day-covid-in-over-two-months-in-delhi-101615573959385.html

Officials said that a total of about 10,900 beneficiaries will be vaccinated daily at the 45 government health-care centres.Ghaziabad at present is engaged in vaccination of senior citizens and people aged over 45 years having co-morbidities. Against the target of 93,480 for the current month, vaccination of only 20,887 people was completed in the district till March 11 with coverage of about 22.34%, the officials said. “We have added 20 more government health-care centres in order to increase our vaccination coverage. All the 45 government centres now will take up anything from 200 to 400 beneficiaries a day, and have been given a combined daily target of vaccinating 10,900 people. Besides, we also have 31 private hospitals engaged in paid vaccination. So, we intend to achieve our monthly target,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. He said that instructions were also received from the state officials to increase vaccination coverage. “The state health department officials have issued directions that the districts having population of more than 25 lakh should vaccinate more than 5,000 beneficiaries per day, while those with population below 25 lakh should take up vaccination of 3,000,” Gupta said. According to the officials, the district has been able to vaccinate an average of about 1,900 beneficiaries per day during the first 11 days of this month. Meanwhile, the district health department has also sent names of four more private hospitals to the state government and sought permission for them for start of vaccination. “The permission is yet to be received. Further, we may also open up our women hospital for six days a week in case vaccination process lags behind,” Gupta said. As per the directions of the state government, all the government health-care facilities engaged in Covid-19 vaccination should open three days a week on Monday, Friday and Saturday, while the district hospitals should operate six days a week for vaccination. The private hospitals were directed to operate for a minimum of four days in a week. Of the 45 government facilities, only the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital is open six days for taking up vaccination. According to the state control room figures, the number of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh has witnessed a minor increase since March 4. “The vaccination must be expedited considering the rise in Covid-19 cases. For this, they (the health department) must rope in more of private sector health-care facilities and even clinics which have proper infrastructure to handle emergencies. Otherwise, vaccination process will lag behind. Further, the matter will get complicated if more cases arrive and large portion of population remains devoid of vaccination,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-health-dept-ropes-in-20-more-govt-health-care-centres-for-covid-vaccination-101615573959925.html

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged off the celebrations in Connaught Place’s Central Park.Onlookers and passers-by were greeted by civil defence volunteers holding placards, banners lining Central Park, and LED displays screening the musical performances inside the park – which had restricted entry to only those with passes. Visitors also enjoyed street plays on the theme of deshbhakti by the artists who were doing a fellowship with the Delhi government.Also Read | ‘Deshbhakti’: AAP’s Budget sentimentSunita Varshney, 38, a marketing professional from Gurgaon, said she was pleasantly surprised to see Connaught Place “decorated” on a Friday. “The year has been tough for most of us. It is good to see the government organise such events to bring unity among us and increase our love for our country,” she said.The government chose March 12 to kick off the celebrations as Mahatma Gandhi had led the Dandi March – the famous civil disobedience movement of our freedom struggle – on this day in 1930.At Central Park, visitors were greeted with flex boards containing historical information and photos on the freedom struggle and history of Delhi. From revolutionaries of 1857 to important places of freedom struggle in Delhi, visitors to the park were found reading from all these posters on Friday evening.During the annual Delhi budget, the government had said that the 75 week-long programmes, organised by the tourism department, will highlight Delhi’s role in the freedom movement and its journey in the last 75 years.While inaugurating the event, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the government has made comprehensive plans to celebrate the 75 years of Indian independence in the coming weeks. He also said that it was time to work on the vision of our freedom fighters of what a free India should look like and stated that people of all castes and religions should have access to equal opportunities.From a separate curriculum on “deshbhakti” for children to installing 500 flags across Delhi, the CM said that his government would work on instilling a sense of patriotism and nationalism among the citizens. “In every home, the message on the lives of Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh and Baba Sahab Ambedkar, their struggles, sacrifices, vision, and teachings will be put across. 500 flags will be installed across Delhi..This will instil a sense of patriotism and nationalism in the people as they step out of their homes for schools and offices,” Kejriwal said, amid chants of Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram.The government also felicitated several eminent citizens from diverse field for their “exceptional contribution”, including beneficiaries of the Tirth Yatra scheme, artists, doctors, photojournalists, retired principals, activists and war veterans among others.“While events like these are welcome, instilling patriotism among citizens is a continuous process.

Authorities may also inspire young children to join NCC ,” said Colonel Ashok Kumar Tara, 79, who was felicitated on Friday.Tara is a war veteran who was awarded with Vir Chakra and had rescued the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the custody of Pakistani forces during 1971 war.The Delhi government’s event coincided with Centre’s ‘Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ which also began Friday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of India’s independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/street-plays-music-and-dance-performances-trivia-mark-first-deshbhakti-event-at-central-park-101615573901162.html
13-03-2021||Bangalore||Bodies donated, buried by road as villages in Karnataka lack burial grounds||Two days after returning from a pilgrimage to Tirupati, Lakshmikant Kandugal’s mother passed away. Since his village, Bankur in north Karnataka’s Kalaburagi district, did not have a burial ground, Kandugal donated his mother’s body to the district medical college.“I was a panchayat member and since 2011, I have been writing to various government authorities about unavailability of burial ground in my village. Two people in our village donated bodies of their family members as they couldn’t find land to bury them. So, I decided to do the same. I have also pledged my body to the medical college as nothing seems to change anytime soon,” Kandugal said.According to the state revenue department, Bankur is among 7,069 villages in Karnataka that do not have a burial ground. Unlike many other states in the country, a majority from the Hindu community in Karnataka bury the dead, instead of cremating them. Among them are the Lingayats — the largest community in the state — and a large section of the Vokkaligas, another dominant caste in the state.According to C.S Dwarakanath, former chairman of the backward classes commission, burial has been a cultural practice in Karnataka for centuries. “In the Lingayat community, even before Basavanna (the founder of the Lingayat way of life), the communities that converted to Lingayat faith had been burying their dead,” he said.Though the lack of burial ground remains a problem across communities, it is the marginalised communities that feel maximum brunt of the problem. According to an activist, there have been several instances of people burying their loved ones by the side of the road after facing discrimination at the hands of dominant communities.Dwarakanath said the lack of burial grounds, especially in a state where burying the dead is a common practice, was a matter of concern. “Those suffering the most are the ones from the backward classes. As the upper castes started to find it difficult to get land for burial, denial of land to Dalits increased. In several places in north Karnataka and even on the outskirts of Bengaluru, funeral processions are not allowed inside the village and people have to circumvent the village,” he said.K.A Obalesh, an RTI activist from Davangere district, said there were instances of people burying their dead by the roadside. “As you pass through Kadajji, one can find several graves along the roads. In these villages, Dalits were neither allowed to enter the burial ground nor did they own any piece of land,” he added.According to R Mohanraj, state convenor of Dalit Sangharsha Samithi, two Dalits were murdered in a case of discrimination in Hoskote on Bengaluru’s outskirts. “The incident took place around six years ago in Yemandahalli village, where Dalits were not allowed to use the common burial ground. They were forced to bury bodies of their loved ones in private properties. When a funeral procession passed through the burial ground of upper castes, violence erupted in the village and two people from the Dalit community were killed,” he said.Mohanraj added that his organisation led protests in front of the district headquarters in Tumkur and Hassan districts, highlighting the demand for burial grounds. “The government has the fund land that can be set aside for this purpose. But over the years, several governments have only been making statements in the legislative Assembly without taking any meaningful step on the issue,” he said.However, Karnataka revenue secretary Mahendra Jain said the government has allocated funds in the budget to provide burial grounds. “We have asked senior officials in every district to convert government land into burial grounds. Strict instructions have been given to them,” he said.“In many villages, there is a shortage of government land. In such cases, we have given orders to district administrations to purchase private properties. But many villagers are not ready to part with their agricultural land or in some cases they don’t want a burial ground to set up on their properties. At a village in Kalaburagi, where several people donated bodies to the medical college, a government land was provided but the quality of the land was an issue and private land was not available,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/7064-karnataka-villages-don-t-have-a-burial-ground-says-govt-101615573899392.html

On Wednesday, 409 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the national capital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe capital received a spell of rain, accompanied by thunderstorm, which brought respite from the rising temperatures that have been recorded in the last two months.From 35.2 degrees Celsius recorded on Thursday — the highest in the season so far — the maximum temperatures fell to 30.7 degrees Celsius on Friday. Strong winds continued to blow throughout the evening hours.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi range), Eish Singhal said, “We are carrying out enforcement of social distancing at India Gate. We are also issuing challans and using public service announcements to prevent crowding.”On Friday, while the area around India Gate remained out-of-bounds for the general — it has been shut since the Covid-19 lockdown was enforced last year — the lawns leading to the monument packed up pretty quickly as the weather improved.Khushboo Rathi, who was seen at the India Gate with her family, said that she had brought her kids for an outing ahead of the weekend since the weather had become pleasant.“We had come just to spend some time here, get some ice cream for the kids. We are ensuring that we are all wearing our masks,” Rathi said.Rakesh Jha, another visitor who had come with his friends, said, “We all thought of spending some time together. There was a phase in Delhi when the daily Covid cases being reported was in the thousands. Now, we are seeing only a few hundred cases daily. No one knows how long the pandemic is expected to last; we will have to learn to live with it now.”Experts, however, cautioned that with the recent spike in number of cases, residents and authorities will have to ensure that guards are not lowered.“We have seen what has happened to the other countries, the moment restrictions were relaxed there — cases saw a steep spike. A pandemic never goes away overnight and to prevent it from claiming more lives, we need to adopt maximum precautions. For the last two months, we had started witnessing a drop in the number of consultation calls for coronavirus symptoms. But we are seeing that these calls have started rising again,” Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh.Dr Maurya also said that following social distancing norms was all the more essential now to ensure the effectiveness of the ongoing vaccination drive.“Currently, the vulnerable groups have started receiving their first doses of the vaccine shots. It is imperative that we take the utmost care during this time so that the cases do not start rising again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thousands-crowd-india-gate-lawns-flouting-covid-norms-101615573839961.html

The bullet went through the minor’s left arm and his condition is stable, the police said. No one has been arrested in the case so far.Police said that the incident took place when the two suspects tried snatching the mobile phone of a man who worked for the 12-year-old’s father, who is into the tent and catering business.The boy and his father were among the seven-eight people who had rushed to the man’s aid, after assuming that the pistol the suspects were holding was a toy gun, the police said.A case of robbery and use of firearms was registered and teams were formed to identify and nab the suspects. The police are also scanning CCTV footage of cameras installed on the route that the suspects took while fleeing.“We have some clues about the suspects. Our teams are working on the case and the duo will be caught soon,” said joint commissioner of police (northern range) SS Yadav.Mohammad Mubarak, the goods vehicle driver, said that around 2am, he along with 10-11 people had come to a godown in Gali Number-8 to unload some catering items that they had ferried from a farmhouse in Alipur. Mubarak’s tempo was parked near the main Shalimar Bagh underpass-Max Hospital road, where the items were being unloaded.“I was standing near my vehicle and had taken out my cellphone to call my family, when suddenly two men arrived on a bike, pointed a pistol at me and threatened to kill me if I raised the alarm. The pillion rider put a gun on my forehead and asked me to hand over my cellphone,” said Mubarak.According to the driver, his employer and his 12-year-old son, who were standing some distance behind him, saw the men trying to rob him and started rushing to his aid. The suspects were about to leave when Mubarak asked them to return his driving licence that he had kept in his phone’s flip cover.“The bikers found a ₹100 note in the flip cover while looking for the licence. Meanwhile, my employer, his son and some labourers had almost reached me. They were all screaming that the pistol was a toy gun. The robber panicked and fired once. The bullet hit the arm of my employer’s son,” said Mubarak, adding that the robbers then proceeded to speed away with his phone.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani, on the other hand, said that the robber fired once when the labourers threw stones at them, while charging at them.“The injured boy was admitted to a nearby hospital from where he was discharged after medical attention. The bullet pierced his arm. His condition is stable,” said DCP Rangnani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12yrold-shot-at-during-robbery-in-shalimar-bagh-101615573839423.html

In this scenario, the issue relating to retrieval of target data without interference with the other data stored in the hard disk has to be meticulously looked into and at the same time, obtaining target data without creating any evidential vulnerabilities for future purpose has to be considered because it is important for the investigating officer to maintain authenticity and integrity of the target data,” the judge said.The court’s observations came while hearing a plea by Pracha, seeking modifications to a March 2 order of the court, where the judge had given police permission to search Pracha’s premises in Nizamuddin East.The court will now further hear the matter on March 19, by which time the police have to satisfy the judge’s queries.Pracha, who is representing several accused and victims in the Delhi riots cases, had said the demand for the hard disk is illegal as all documents are already in the police’s possession from the earlier search conducted on December 25, 2020.On Friday, Pracha said he stands vindicated as the judge has accepted his contentions on attorney-client privilege and is looking to safeguard the data of his other clients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-wants-police-to-clarify-how-they-will-ensure-client-data-is-not-breached-on-pracha-s-hard-disk-101615573779373.html

As many as 40 new bus routes are on the demand list. On October 25, PMPML started its Atal (aligning transit on all lanes) bus service, based on the concept of a distance of five km being travelled at a five-minute frequency for a ticket of ₹5.Nine new Atal routes were started in the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad area.Rajendra Jagtap, managing director of PMPML, said, “Though corporators are demanding bus services in their areas, we have formed a committee that will conduct a survey and study the feasibility of routes. After that, we will make a decision.”He added, “After lockdown, PMPML rationalised routes and rerouted the non-profitable ones. We increased routes in the fringe areas like Shirur, Sus, Talegaon, Wagholi, Phursungi, Yawat, Chakan, Shikrapur, and Lavale. Besides that, we have the Atal bus routes.”Dattatray Zende, traffic manager of PMPML, said, “Corporators have been demanding new routes for the last two-three months. However, we cannot start a service merely on the demand of corporators. We calculate distance, demand of public, population, and road infrastructure. We need two months to conduct surveys and then, 15 days to start a new route.”Shankar Pawar, a PMPML director and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator said, “Corporator Manjusha Nagpure and Anil Dhawade started routes in their areas. We have appealed to corporators to file applications to start new bus routes in their areas.”Dilip Vede-Patil, the BJP corporator from Kothrud, said, “We had suggested two circular routes in Kothrud which began last week. These new routes will help us to connect people. Most of the routes are passing through societies and are getting a good response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/with-polls-on-horizon-city-fathers-want-40-new-pmpml-bus-routes-started-101615558659900.html

There are only two places —Khairewadi (Central Mall) and SPPU Chowk — and both are in opposite direction of the 1.3 km long road,” said urban designer and architect Aditya Chawande. He along with NGO Parisar have proposed to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) a safe crossing for pedestrians on Ganeshkhind road at the road opening in front of Cosmos bank (near Range Hills corner). The complete barricading of the road by Maha-Metro has led to a longer detour length on the stretch of almost 1.3 km from SPPU chowk to Central Mall for pedestrians. Pedestrians are forced to risk their lives while crossing the 36m wide arterial road with speeding vehicles at Cosmos bank location. An opening is provided only for vehicles to take a U-turn for Senapati Bapat road and Range Hills road. The proposal was discussed and presented at the meeting of the Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) committee in February 2021. “PMC engineers agreed that the situation requires an intervention for Ganeshkhind road is an arterial road connecting Aundh, Baner, Balewadi, Hinjewadi and Pimpri- Chinchwad, and faces high traffic volume. The Shivajinagar-Hinjewadi Metro line work is also under progress along the stretch. The road has neighbourhoods like Bhosalenagar, Model Colony and institutional buildings like colleges, banks, malls, IT offices, restaurants, and commercial spaces. Naturally, the pedestrian footfall is high on this road, but the road lacks adequate safe crossings for pedestrians,” said Chawande. PMC engineer Dinkar Gojare and Chawande have been following up the proposal but it is delayed due to unavailability of PMC engineers. Chawande has proposed painted pedestrian crossing with stop lines and safe refuge space with fibre bollard and barricades, speed breakers at both the vehicle approach ends, signages and amber blinking traffic lights for night-time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pedestrian-crossing-proposed-for-ganeshkhind-road-101615476333665.html
