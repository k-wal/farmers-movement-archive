However, to be sure, most beds reserved for the treatment of the infection are still vacant. Currently, there are 5,700 beds earmarked for Covid-19 treatment in hospitals across the city. “There are more patients with Covid-19 admitted to the hospital compared to a month ago. The numbers started increasing about two weeks back, but are within control. The main reason for the increase seems to be the laxity among people in following Covid-19 norms — nobody is wearing masks, those who have been vaccinated do not follow protocols as they think they will not get the infection. Weddings have become grounds for spreading the infection — with some cases where many in the wedding party contracted the infection,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, at Max Healthcare. Dr Tickoo warned that Holi, due to be celebrated on March 29, is a cause of concern, with the risk of the infection spreading rapidly in large gatherings. “However, I think Delhi is unlikely to see a huge surge in cases because a huge proportion of the population has already been exposed to the infection,” he said. Delhi also recorded 425 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, continuing the increasing trend in the number of viral infections after a slight dip over the weekend when fewer tests were conducted. This is the fifth day this month that over 400 cases were reported, according to daily data provided by the Delhi government. With over 70,000 tests conducted, the city’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among total tested — at 0.61%. This is the highest positivity rate since the second week of January, two weeks after it dipped consistently below 1% for the first time in Delhi. The positivity rate is indicative of the spread of the infection. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had on Monday said authorities were working on keeping the infection in check. One of the measures was to increase the number of tests conducted, which went up to nearly 69,700 tests a day during the last seven days from 64,700 the week before and 59,221 the week before that. However, on Tuesday Delhi saw an increase in the number of the rapid antigen tests – which are cheap and quick but are known to throw up false negative reports for those who might have the infection. On Tuesday, only 56% of the tests were conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR test in comparison to 63.5% tests during the last seven days and 66% the week before that. “Delhi needs to conduct as many tests as they have the capacity for so as to detect as many infections as possible. The RT-PCR test is preferable as it is more sensitive that the rapid antigen tests that miss out on positive cases. The government needs to track and test as many contacts of a positive case to ensure that the disease does not spread,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-hospitalisations-inch-up-in-delhi-capital-adds-425-new-infections-101615919342890.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal orders release of pending funds to 12 state-funded DU colleges||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday ordered the release of pending funds, amounting to ₹28.24 crore, to the 12 state-funded colleges of Delhi University (DU) in order to enable them to pay salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff.The chief minister held a meeting with principals of these 12 colleges on Tuesday to resolve the ongoing tussle between the government and the colleges over funds. The colleges had alleged that the government either delayed the release of funds or gave “insufficient” grants, while the government alleged financial irregularities in these colleges and claimed they had surplus reserves. The issue further escalated last week when the Delhi government’s higher education department asked the governing bodies of these colleges to pass a resolution stating that the pattern of assistance as suggested by the Delhi government, and not that of the University Grants Commission (UGC), will be followed for the release of grant-in-aid from the government.The resolution was also to state that colleges can use “surplus funds” available with them for the purpose of paying salaries. The student society fund was to be excluded from “surplus funds” since a legal case on whether student funds may be used for salary purposes is pending before the court. The GBs of two colleges, out of the 12, on Saturday passed such a resolution.After Tuesday’s meeting, Kejriwal said, “The Delhi government has decided to release ₹28.24 crore, which is the amount that is pending with the Delhi government, to the fully funded Delhi University colleges. The Delhi government will only issue funds in the future based on the directions of the court on whether funds currently available under different heads can be used for salaries or not. We know and understand the plight of staff and teachers, and we do not want their salaries to be stopped till the time the matter is sub judice. We will release the amount so that the colleges do not suffer.”Kejriwal also said the Delhi government will send an invite to DU vice-chancellor (V-C) on behalf of Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia to have a dialogue with him on all pending issues. “Since the past few years, we have tried to initiate talks with DU authorities and the V-C, but there may have been differences, political and otherwise. Today is a new beginning,” he said.Sisodia, who was also present in the meeting, said since these colleges are fully funded by the Delhi government, they will have to follow the government’s pattern of assistance. “There should be 100% transparency in their accounts and budgets which is required to bridge the gap between the Delhi government and DU,” he said. The DU administration on Monday wrote to the Delhi government saying its 12 fully funded colleges are bound to follow the UGC norms in matters of budgeting and expenditure, and the government cannot change the pattern of assistance for releasing funds. DU spokesperson and dean of colleges Balram Pani said, “The university is always ready for a dialogue but we reiterate that the Delhi government cannot change the pattern of assistance in these colleges.”Hem Chand, principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College, said, “It was a very positive meeting. The government and the DU administration should now discuss and resolve the matter so that our staff do not suffer in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-orders-release-of-pending-funds-to-12-state-funded-du-colleges-101615919283127.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Two suspected hitmen arrested from Jaipur for multiple murders in Delhi||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said it has arrested two suspected hitmen of Kala-Jathedi-Lawrence Bisnoi gang from Rajasthan’s Jaipur for their alleged involvement in multiple murders in Delhi-NCR in the recent past.A ₹2 lakh reward had been announced for the arrest of one of the hitmen, Priyawart alias Kala,29, for his alleged involvement in two murders committed within a fortnight between February and March in Delhi’s Chhawla and Bawana, the police said.“Priyawart is the right-hand man of wanted (alleged) gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi, who is suspected to have left India,” said deputy commissioner of police (counter-intelligence, special cell) Manishi Chandra. The other arrested man has been identified as Rohit (single name only), 23. Both are residents of Delhi’s Katewada near Bawana.Police said on March 7, the two and their associates in Bawana area had allegedly abducted and murdered a civil defence volunteer, who was in uniform and returning home after duty. They had fired 25 shots at him. A fortnight before that, they had murdered one Naresh in Chhawla. On December 30, 2020, the suspects had shot dead their rival Shahbaz in Narela. A passerby was also hit and killed in the shooting. On October 9, 2020, they allegedly murdered liquor baron Sukhwinder alias Dhola by pumping over 25 bullets in his body in Sonepat, Haryana, the police said. DCP Chandra said the counter-intelligence unit started collecting information about Priyawart and his associates after they were found to be involved in a series of murders in Delhi and Haryana. “Technical and manual surveillance was mounted. The team had to be stationed at various locations in five different states for long durations to locate and track the suspects,” he said.On March 15, the DCP said the team received information that Priyawart and his associate Rohit were staying in a hotel on Park Street in Jaipur. The team reached there, caught the duo and brought them to Delhi. Their interrogation led to the recovery of two firearms from a hideout in Chhawla.Police said Priyawart turned to crime while studying at a government polytechnic in Sonepat by stealing a motorcycle. Once in jail, he allegedly developed contacts with criminals such as Sawran, Pradeep, Pawan Pandit and Sanjay Rathi. After his release on bail, in 2011, Priyawart along with his associates allegedly committed a carjacking and the vehicle was used in the murder of one Pardeep from Haryana, who was a prosecution witness against Priyawart’s mentor Sarwan, the police said.Priyawart stole another car from Kanjhawala and allegedly used that during the murder of one Vijay. In 2012, he allegedly committed another carjacking while attempting the kidnapping of a businessman. The attempt was foiled and Priyawart was later arrested by the Haryana Police.DCP Chandra said Sarwan joined hands with (alleged) gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jathedi and he entrusted Priyawart to lead the gang. “After the escape of Jathedi from Haryana Police custody in January 2020, Priyawart had close ties with him and (alleged) gangsters Kala Rana and Lawrence Bishnoi,” said Chandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-suspected-hitmen-arrested-from-jaipur-for-multiple-murders-in-delhi-101615919282148.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||In 24 hours: Chartered accountant gunned down in front of wife, another shot outside his house||Two men, one of them a 45-year-old chartered accountant (CA), were shot dead in two separate firing incidents reported between Monday evening and Tuesday morning at two different places under the territorial jurisdiction of north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar police station.While one person was arrested in the first case, the murder of a 32-year-old man in Azadpur village on Monday evening, the police are still working on clues in the CA’s murder, reported on Tuesday morning.There has been a spate of shooting incidents in the city of late. At least four firing incidents were reported between Friday and Sunday from different areas in north-east Delhi. One person was killed, and four others were injured in those shootings. Two back-to-back separate firing incidents took place within an hour at two different places falling under the territorial jurisdiction of the Defence Colony police station last Wednesday. A BSES contractual driver and a policeman were injured in those incidents. The attackers in both the cases were arrested.Recounting the latest incident, police said CA Anil Aggarwal lived with his wife and two children in a rented flat in Majlis Park near Azadpur. The family owns a property on Mahatma Gandhi Road that is less than a kilometre away from their home. A four-storey building is being constructed there and Aggarwal’s murder took place at the under-construction site, the police said.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said on Tuesday, around 10am, Aggarwal and his wife had gone to inspect the construction site. Aggarwal was speaking to a worker on the ground floor, when an unidentified man arrived there on a scooter. “The man was wearing a helmet. He came inside and shot Aggarwal from close range in the presence of his wife and the worker. The bullet hit Aggarwal in the neck and he collapsed. The attacker immediately fled on the scooter,” said the officer, adding that the scooter was later found to be stolen from central Delhi’s Patel Nagar on February 7.Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani said the police control room was informed about the firing and a team was rushed to the crime scene. The injured man was shifted to a nearby private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.“We have registered a case of murder and are probing it from all possible angles. Multiple teams are working on the case. All necessary evidence has been collected from the scene of crime, after proper inspection. CCTV footage has been procured and is being analysed. We have some vital clues and various teams are working on them,” said Rangnani.Police officers associated with the case suspect the possibility of a contract killing as the scooter used in the crime was a stolen one. “Personal enmity and financial dispute are also being looked into,” said another police officer, requesting anonymity.Nearly 16 hours before the CA’s murder, a 32-year-old man, identified as Suresh alias Banwari, was shot dead by a group of four persons outside his home in Azadpur village. The crime took place around 6pm Monday and Banwari sustained at least six gunshot wounds. The prime suspect, identified as Rajnish alias Raja, 21, was arrested on Tuesday, the police said.Police said Banwari, who had a criminal background, was standing outside his home when four persons arrived there and opened fire on him. Banwari sustained gunshot wounds to the chest and head. He was rushed to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. A case of murder was registered and the role of Raja emerged during the probe. Raja was caught following searches at his possible hideouts, the police said.DCP Rangnani said during the interrogation, Raja revealed that he and his friends had an enmity with Banwari and they planned his murder as a revenge killing. “Raja also disclosed that in 2016, he was apprehended in another murder case registered at the Burari police station. Our teams are conducting searches to nab the others involved in Banwari’s murder and recover the gun used in the crime,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-24-hours-chartered-accountant-gunned-down-in-front-of-wife-another-shot-outside-his-house-101615919222961.html

16-03-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad told to intensify Covid-19 testing, surveillance||NOIDA: In the wake of the surge in Covid-19 cases in states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab, the Uttar Pradesh government has instructed all the districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, to intensify the contact tracing, surveillance and vaccination. In a video conference with all the district magistrates and divisional commissioners of the state on Monday evening, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said that there is a surge in Covid-19 cases again in many states like Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka and Delhi, which could be the second or third wave of infection. “Apparently, there is a slight uptick in cases recently in some districts such as GB Nagar and Ghaziabad, which is a sign of caution. Be vigilant as Delhi and adjoining areas are seeing a sudden surge in the number of cases. Though we are giving the fight to the pandemic with vaccination, we are not in a position to lower our guard. It is advisable for the districts concerned to intensify the vaccination of eligible individuals,” Tiwari said. In March so far, as many as 146 new cases were detected in GB Nagar, while 144 new cases reported in Ghaziabad, witnessing a rise of almost 50% over the same period last month, according to the state health bulletin. In GB Nagar, the number of total positive cases was 25,686 on March 16, of which 78 were active and the positivity rate was 0.30%. Similarly, in Ghaziabad, the total positives went to 26,902 (102 active cases) with a positivity rate of 0.37% on March 16. The chief secretary further said that these districts need to intensify their contact tracing and surveillance to check spread of the infection as thousands of people from other states come daily there. “The district health department should take the list of passengers and conduct their proper testing and contact tracing. A thorough surveillance is the need of the hour,” Tiwari said. Tiwari also said that all the districts must ensure 100% vaccination of health-care and front-line workers, who missed the inoculation due to some reasons. “It is mandatory for all the districts to ensure 100% registration of senior citizens and persons over 45 years with co-morbidities. To ensure their inoculation, the vaccination booths must not be far away from their residences,” he said. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that contact tracing and surveillance have been intensified to check further spread of infection. “We’ve also restarted issuing challans against those who are flouting the social distancing and mask norms in the district,” he said. GB Nagar DM Suhas LY said that the health officials have been asked to increase the tracing and testing in the district. “Since vaccination can be the best way to protect us from the infection, the vaccination officials have been asked to increase the inoculation of eligible beneficiaries,” he said. In GB Nagar, the health department has inoculated over 36,277 people in March so far, out of 65,048 beneficiaries belonging to senior citizens and 45-plus with comorbidities, which is 55.76% of the target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-told-to-intensify-covid-19-testing-surveillance-101615918862889.html

Vishwa Nath, who got married about 18 months ago, died yesterday at a hospital in Delhi. Mohit died on Monday night at a hospital in Ghaziabad and he was unmarried. We are now arranging ambulances to take both bodies to our native place. I will return to seek justice for them,” said Rohit Kumar, brother of the two victims and a complainant in the case. In his police complaint, Rohit had alleged that the fire started due to explosion in chemicals used at the factory and implicated the factory owner. “We are investigating the cause of the incident,” the SP said. Chief fire officer Sunil Kumar Singh said that the cause of fire will be part of the investigation. “We came to know that there was an explosion during the mixing of chemicals on the ground floor. This led to a major fire and we had rushed to the spot. Fourteen injured were taken out and sent to hospitals then,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sahibabad-factory-fire-three-workers-succumb-toll-rises-to-four-101615918862101.html

16-03-2021||Noida||Power outage at UP Gate protest site for three days||For almost three days, farmer protesters at UP Gate have been without electricity. The increased load on the street light system, which the protesters had tapped into, caused a malfunction forcing them to now rely on generators to run washing machines, coolers, fans and even charge their phones.The farmers have been camping at the site since November 28 last year against the Centre’s farm laws. Tents had come up with protesters believing that their agitation would be a long drawn out one. The stir completed 100 days last week.“Our major camping area is without any electricity for past three days. The camps supports women, children, men and even a few kitchens. We are using generator sets now, but these can be operated for limited time only,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of UP-Gate farmers’ committee. He said that there were about 1,500 to 2,000 people at the camp. The protest is on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which is managed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The farmers’ equipment increased load on the cables, which have now been damaged. We are in process of repairing and laying new cables. But if the load continues, short circuits will happen again,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI. The UP Gate to Dasna (19.2km of phase 2) and Dasna to Meerut (32km of phase 4) of the DME project is scheduled to get complete by March 31. The farmers are demanding repeal of the three new laws and urging the government for bringing in a new law on minimum support price. The government on the other hand proposed stay on implementation of the three laws for a period of one and half years but the farmers’ unions did not approve the proposal. There has been a deadlock between the two sides and last time they held talks was on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/power-outage-at-up-gate-protest-site-for-three-days-101615918683544.html

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn tells PGIMER to stop paint work on heritage buildings||Raising objections over violation of heritage norms, the Chandigarh urban planning department has shot off a letter to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), asking it to immediately stop the external paint work on heritage buildings on its campus.The urban planning department letter comes in the wake of objections raised by Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) members over the white paint work being undertaken at the institute. In the letter addressed to the PGIMER director, the department pointed out that the campus is enlisted as a Grade-2 heritage precinct falling in the Heritage Zone-8.“The Heritage Grade–2 guidelines, which apply to the PGI campus, permit no external change, and only allow limited internal changes in these precincts and buildings, which do not affect the exterior of the same... Therefore, painting of the external facades is in violation of the heritage guidelines, which have been duly notified by the Government of India,” states the letter.On the instructions of the central government, an expert panel had prepared a report identifying important buildings, precincts and zones of the city to be declared as heritage, which was approved by the ministry of home affairs in December 2011. Subsequently, CHCC was constituted by the administration in April 2012 with the mandate to identify, preserve and conserve the city’s identified heritage.The expert panel had put PGIMER campus, which includes buildings designed by Pierre Jeanneret, in the category of Grade-2 heritage sites, which are of regional or local importance possessing special architectural or aesthetic merit, or cultural or historical significance, though of a lower scale than Grade-1 sites. Heritage Zone-8 extends along Madhya Marg from PGIMER to Sukhna Choe and includes institutional and commercial buildings besides green belts along it.Follow set preservation protocolSeeking directions to be issued to the concerned wing of PGIMER to immediately stop the ongoing external paint work, the letter further states: “These building facades be restored to their original character, for which the UT engineering department has formulated a protocol with the approval of the CHCC.”The engineering department is already undertaking restoration and preservation work of heritage buildings, including Capitol Complex, as per the protocol. The facade of government and private building in Sector 17 is also getting a facelift as per this preservation protocol.“Truthfulness of materials was one of the main tenets of Le Corbusier’s work.

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali admn gears up to manage patient load amid Covid surge||With Mohali district recording 1,903 Covid-19 cases and 22 deaths due to the virus this month, the administration is making preparations to manage the increased load of patients.Just 16 days into March, the district has seen a spike of 125% in cases and 10% in death toll, when compared to 840 cases and 20 deaths recorded in February. The number of active cases has shot up from 636 on March 1 to 1,442 on March 16 and recovery rate has dropped from 95% to 91.7% in the same period.As Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur — the designated Covid facility during the first surge in September, when more than 6,000 cases surfaced — has ended its contract with the state government, the administration has now made arrangements for 100 beds at Chandigarh University, Gharuan, and 10 beds at the de-addiction centre in Sector 66 for Level-1 (L-1) category patients. Facilities under L-1 category deal with uncomplicated cases. Patients are generally asymptomatic and can roam around in the ward. Cases that require more attention, wherein patients are generally bedridden and are put on drip or need oxygen support, are sent to L-2 category hospitals, whereas critical patients are shifted for specialised treatment to hospitals with L-3 facilities.Additional deputy commissioner Aashika Jain said: “We held a meeting with representatives of all the leading hospitals in the district and directed them to ramp up their L-2 and L-3 bed capacity and postpone elective surgeries as far as possible to dedicate requisite resources towards the treatment of Covid patients.”Hospital administrations have also been told to update the health status of critical patients daily so that all available resources may be pooled to contain the case fatality rate, she said. It stands at 1.8%.Jain said district and subdivisional government hospitals and community health centres have been directed to create room for L-2 patients. As far as L-3 facilities are concerned, most private hospitals in Mohali have five to six beds, but all are occupied.The district administration will also rope in medical staff, including doctors and paramedical staff, on contractual terms as per the norms. Last time, 14 such medical professionals joined on contract, which ended in November last year. 100+ cases for seventh dayMeanwhile, the district reported 100+ cases for seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, with 192 people testing positive. The peak was reached on Sunday with 206 cases. Meanwhile, four patients died, taking the toll to 407.Mohali city continued to report bulk of the cases, with 178 on Tuesday. The district’s total stands at 22,218. With 83 patients being discharged, the number of those cured reached 20,368. As many as 27,319 people have been vaccinated so far, including 12,119 senior citizens, 1,904 in the comorbid group, 7,284 healthcare workers and 6,012 frontline workers. The second dose has been administered to 4,579 people.

16-03-2021||Lucknow||Agra builders’ firm booked under PMLA||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the directors and promoters of an Agra-based builders firm, Kalpturu Buildtech, said officials here on Tuesday. The firm’s directors and promoters, Jai Kishan Rana, Ashok Rana, Manjeet Kumar, Bipin Singh Yadav, Rajkumar Yadav and others associated with the firm had been made accused in the case. The company’s registered office is situated at Friends Tower, Sanjay Palace, Agra, said a senior ED official. The investigation was taken up on the basis of various FIRs registered at different police stations of Agra and Mathura. The cases were registered against the aforementioned individuals for duping gullible investors by luring them to put money in schemes floated by the firm, said an ED official. He said the company was building a residential flat complex in Churmura village of Mathura and floated a scheme for pre-booking of flats, assuring buyers that at the time of booking of flats that if they pay a recurring amount per month for a certain period they would have the option of either taking the possession of the booked flat or taking the invested principle along with the interest amount. Also, the buyer had an option to opt out of the scheme after certain recurring payments. The directors assured the return within a certain period of time, he added. “When the investors demanded returns on their investments, initially the accused asked for some time to arrange the payment or assured the investors that the flats would be ready shortly. After a considerable amount of time and hassle when the investors demanded their returns, the directors of the company refused to pay them back and threatened them of dire consequences,” he said, adding: “It is gathered that the company followed a similar modus operandi in Panipat, Hisar and other districts of Haryana and duped people there.” He said the FIRs reported so far suggested that the investors allegedly duped people of around ₹7.39 crore and this amount could be more as there was no mention of the amount in a few FIRs. “The ED is identifying the movable and immovable properties of the company and related persons. The role of the directors, promoters of the company and other persons will be under scanner and properties earned by them using hard earned money of the public will be attached very soon,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/agra-builders-firm-booked-under-pmla-101615918323242.html

He also claimed that various senior officials in the administration and police were not attending phone calls from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), despite directives. “When BJP leaders were making claims about their victory in the next state Assembly polls from the dais during the party’s working committee meeting (on Monday in Lucknow), several office-bearers and leaders were raising their voice against the misgovernance under the party’s rule,” Yadav said in a press statement released by the SP here.

The same found a mention in the party manifesto which was recently released for the April 6 elections.The former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) supremo died after prolonged hospitalization in 2016. “When MG Ramachandran (MGR) died in hospital, the then health minister announced his death but no party leader kept the public informed about Jayalalithaa’s health and death,” said Stalin, holding the AIADMK leadership responsible for her death.In 2017, the ruling AIADMK formed a one-man commission led by retired justice Arumugasamy — as a judicial probe was one of the demands of deputy chief minister OP Paneerselvam to merge his warring faction with that of Palaniswami to provide stability to the fledging AIADMK government.The Arumugasamy Commission has so far been extended nine times after examining more than 100 witnesses. “It was OPS’ demand to probe but he has not appeared before the commission after several summons,” said Stalin. “EPS is blaming us because he wants to cause a distraction. If that’s what they think why hasn’t the commission summoned me? I’m ready to face them,” he said.After the AIADMK released its manifesto, a day after the DMK did, Palaniswami said that it was “Stalin and Karunanidhi who are responsible for Jayalalithaa’s death as they caused her stress by filing corruption cases (disproportionate assets case) against her.”Actor-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam also stated in its resolutions that “people have a right to know about the truth that happened,” referring to Jayalalithaa’s death and on the murder of her security personnel in April 2017 in her summer retreat bungalow in Kodanad. Haasan also campaigned in Salem on Tuesday.Stalin started his campaign in Salem by going on an unplanned walk in a market in the city centre of Shevapet. He interacted with the trader community such as the Marwadis and the Chettiars. Later, he addressed a public rally from a campaign van on a local ground where at least 5,000 party supporters were gathered.Meanwhile, Palaniswami attacked the DMK- Congress combine at the Aranthangi constituency of Pudukottai where he criticised the manifesto of more than 500-promises saying that a party should only promise which can be implemented. The CM also recalled late Karunanidhi’s promise to provide two-acre land to people, which he said, was never implemented and the same would happen with the DMK manifesto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/war-of-words-between-stalin-palaniswami-over-late-j-jayalalithaa-s-death-101615916282512.html
16-03-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram among 30 most polluted cities in world despite improvements||The Millennium City was among the 30 most polluted cities in the world in 2020, according to a report by a Swiss group that ranked cities based on their air quality measured in terms of the levels of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5) that can enter the organs and cause lasting damage. While Gurugram ranked 24th among the world’s most polluted cities in 2020, it markedly improved from the 7th spot in 2019 and 1st spot in 2018. Officials said that Gurugram’s steady improvement is due to increased monitoring in the city by all stakeholders, although independent experts said that the meteorological conditions and the lockdown played a much bigger role in the ranking. S Narayanan, member secretary of Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “The fact that air quality of Gurugram has been improving over the past two years is visible on the ground. This is due to increased monitoring by stakeholders like Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, who regularly work to ensure that air pollution is kept under control.” As per the latest report, Gurugram recorded an annual average particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration of 75.3 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) in 2020, as against the average PM2.5 concentration of 93.1 µg/m³ in 2019. The report states that PM 2.5 pollutant was chosen for the report because “it is currently understood to be the most harmful to human health due to its prevalence and far-reaching health risks. Exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to negative health effects like cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness, and premature mortality.” In the National Capital Region (NCR), Gurugram fared better than Ghaziabad (2), Noida (6), Greater Noida (7), Delhi (10) and Faridabad (11). The annual average PM2.5 concentrations in NCR cities were recorded at 106.6 µg/m³ in Ghaziabad, 94.3 µg/m³ in Noida, 89.5 µg/m³ in Greater Noida, 84.1 µg/m³ in Delhi and 83.3 µg/m³ in Faridabad. In the state, Faridabad’s air quality ranking dipped to 11 this year from 18 in 2019. Explaining Faridabad’s fall in ranking, Narayanan said, “We admit that Faridabad still needs to work more to improve the air quality, with better monitoring on the ground.” The report also ranked Bandhwari, a village located about 20 kilometres from Gurugram and is also the site of Haryana’s largest landfill at 22, with an annual PM2.5 concentration of 77.6 µg/m³ this year. The ranking of Bandhwari improved by 12 places since 2019.Experts, however, are of the view that the improved air quality is due to meteorological factors and the lockdown to fight Covid-19. Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality consultant in Delhi-NCR said, “The improvement in Gurugram’s air quality can be attributed to meteorological factors and elongated impacts of the lockdown like reduced emissions and traffic movement. There was not much change on the ground by the authorities. Another reason could be a reduction in cracker bursting hotspots in the city.” The report lists transportation, biomass burning for cooking, electricity generation, industry, construction, waste burning, and episodic agricultural burning, as major sources of air pollution in the country. Elaborating on the poor air quality in the country, the report states, “Despite widespread air quality improvements during 2019 and 2020, air pollution in India is still dangerously high. India continues to dominate annual PM2.5 rankings by city – 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities globally are located in India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-among-30-most-polluted-cities-in-world-despite-improvements-101615916222640.html

Police said that the victim, who was working as an executive for an electrical contractor in the city, left behind a suicide note blaming contractors for his death. The man in the suicide note alleged that he had not received his salaries for the past few months despite paying to labourers for the work, police said. The incident took place on March 12 when a traffic policeman posted at Sohna Chowk took the man to the civil hospital after he consumed poison on the road. Police informed the victim’s wife about the incident. When the wife reached hospital, doctors declared him dead, said police. In a statement recorded before police, the victim’s wife said that her husband was not paid by the contractors. “My husband had paid workers from his own pocket and even that amount was not reimbursed by the contractors. He was disturbed due to financial problems. Disappointed with contractors, he consumed poison to commit suicide,” she said. Police recovered a purported suicide note from his pocket where he has alleged harassment by contractors for not paying him. During investigation police found some bank transactions and a contact number of a tea shop at the district court, said police. Subhash Boken, Gurugram police spokesperson, said that when police reached the tea vendor, he told them that the victim often had tea at his shop and shared his financial issues with him. “The tea seller also shared some video clips in which victim had narrated his financial problems and how he was duped by executives of two private companies,” he said. On the basis of the complaint by his wife, a case was registered on Tuesday against four people, including two contractors and two executives of private companies, under section 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Shivaji Nagar police station. “A case has been registered and we are verifying the facts.

Only 24 people got vaccinated on Monday night, health department officials said, adding that they could rethink about the decision. However, the officials said that they will keep working on it for at least one week before taking a final call. The department has designated one government and five private hospitals for night vaccination. According to the officials, only three people got vaccinated at the designated private hospitals while remaining 21 beneficiaries got vaccinated at the government hospital in sector 10. The five private hospitals designated for night vaccination are Artemis, Max Hospital, Medanta, Paras Hospital and Fortis, they said. Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said that the purpose of the round-the-clock vaccination drive is to ensure that maximum people can take advantage of extended time, but the response on the first day was below expectation. “We will try and reach out to the public in the next one week and also ask the private hospitals to focus on outreach. If the results are not favourable, then we will have to rethink this strategy as large resources are deployed on the night shift,” he said. Yadav, however, expressed satisfaction over the mega vaccination drive, which was held on Monday as the health department managed to vaccinate over 12,000 people in the city. “All stakeholders, including the private sector, will be motivated to expand the outreach in coming days and cover maximum beneficiaries,” he said. A senior doctor at a private hospital said that more time should be given to the round-the-clock initiative as slowly people will come forward and take advantage of this facility. “The 24x7 drive will help those people who are not able to access it during the day. The beneficiaries can also avoid the day crowd. We want to request people to avail this unique opportunity to boost their immunity against this contagious virus and help break the chain of infection,” he said, wishing anonymity. Meanwhile, the additional chief secretary (health), Rajeev Arora, said that given the response to the vaccination outreach, which led to the inoculation of about 150,000 beneficiaries on Monday across the state, the department has decided to observe every Monday as ‘mega vaccination day’. “The department has ensured that the vaccination centres are in close proximity to people’s residences even in the rural areas, and for which the number of vaccination centres has also been enhanced,” said Arora. As per details shared by the health department, on Tuesday, 3,452 beneficiaries over 60 years and 1,052 between the age of 45 and 59 years with comorbidity were vaccinated, besides 504 health-care workers and 933 front-line workers were also vaccinated in 89 sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/24x7-vaccination-drive-against-covid-19-gets-muted-response-in-gurugram-101615916162867.html
16-03-2021||Gurugram||Regularising banquet halls on MCG’s agenda||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to take up the matter of regularising banquet halls in the city in its next House meeting, scheduled for Thursday. Of the 76 private banquet halls in the city, only one has been regularised by the civic body so far, according to the agenda for the meeting. In January 2014, the Haryana government approved a policy allowing all municipal corporations across the state to regularise banquet halls. The policy was, however, valid for only 60 days and a solitary banquet hall in Sector 9 was regularised under this policy.Despite seven years elapsing since the policy, as many as 75 banquet halls are yet to be registered under the MCG.Hence, to both increase its revenue as well as regularise banquet halls to ensure they are adhering to fire safety norms, among other safety measures, the MCG wants the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) to once again reinstate its policy, albeit with a few changes.“Regularising banquet halls is of great importance as such structures will be mandated to adhere to a list of guidelines and parameters, including fire safety norms. By standardising banquet halls, MCG can keep a vigil over its functioning and also increase its revenue simultaneously,” said Madhu Azad, mayor, MCG, who floated this agenda on behalf of councillors.In November 2018, a banquet hall in Sector 9 caught fire. Despite the fire being of low intensity, due to narrow entry passage and blocked paths, the fire department took more than 25 minutes to reach inside the premises.“There have been a few instances in the past where the fire department found fire safety violations in banquet halls or fire dousing equipment were found missing. Regularising them, hence, is important as the fire department can regularly check such structures and subsequently, issue or renew fire NOCs based on its findings,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer (ADFSO).Azad said that representatives of Haryana Party Lawns’ association had also raised the issue of regularising banquet halls in Gurugram with her two months ago and asked for changes to the existing policy, along the lines of the one adopted in Rajasthan.“The matter of introducing the policy along with few changes was also raised by several councillors during the pre-budget meeting held last week, following which it was unanimously decided to introduce this agenda in the next House meeting. We agreed with most of the suggestions of the association members and will also ask ULB, once the agenda is approved in the House, to incorporate these changes in their existing policy,” said Azad.According to Haryana Party Lawns’ Association president Anil Rao, the charge for regularisation under the Haryana government’s policy in 2014 was a hefty amount, a one-time payment, rather than one that could be renewed on an annual basis.“The biggest problem with the Haryana government’s 2014 policy was that they were asking a one-time payment amounting to around ₹1.5-2.5 crore, depending on the size of the banquet hall, for regularising the structure. Almost all the banquet halls operate on a lease basis in Gurugram. For the original owners, this policy was an expensive and unnecessary expenditure,” said Rao, whose association represents 72 of the 76 banquet halls in Gurugram.Rao said that representatives of the association raised the matter of regularising banquet under similar lines to the one adopted by the Rajasthan government, with members of the Haryana government in Chandigarh and Azad in Gurugram two months ago.“Under the Rajasthan government’s policy, an annual licensing payment of around ₹2 lakh- ₹5 lakh is paid per banquet hall. We made members of the Haryana government, as well as the Gurugram mayor, realise that such monetary value of payment can be made by a banquet hall administration themselves and would also lead to an increase in the local civic body’s revenue,” said Rao.In the MCG’s House meeting scheduled to take place at the John Hall in Civil Lines on Thursday, the MCG’s 2021-22 fiscal budget will be put forward before the House for approval, along with other agendas such as opening the policy of issuing licences to meat shop owners, MCG’s formal takeover of Maruti Vihar and Saraswati Vihar, constructing MCG’s office and allotment of land for constructing a new police station in Rajendra Park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/regularising-banquet-halls-on-mcg-s-agenda-101615916161844.html
16-03-2021||Gurugram||Schools to train bus staff before next academic session||The regional transport authority has asked the district elementary education officer to direct schools to hold behavioural training sessions for drivers and conductors of their school buses before the next academic session. The communique also directed that background checks of the school transport staff be completed before they are assigned duties.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said officials discussed the influence of the workers’ behaviour on children, during a road safety meeting in February. “In many instances, it was noticed that drivers used abusive language and their conduct with their colleagues was rough. A student spends up to two hours on a school bus, to and from home, every day and a positive atmosphere is required. They should not smoke in front of students and should also ensure they do not chew tobacco or spit out of the window while driving,” she said.The city has around 350 schools that use around 1,610 vehicles to transport children.Officials said that as many students have complained of aggressive behaviour by bus staff to their parents, the directions are to ensure that drivers follow traffic rules and behave appropriately when performing their duties.Schools have been asked to get the staff trained in personality development skills, including spoken English and gender sensitisation. A session on ‘good touch bad touch’ is also required to be conducted, according to RTA.Yadav said there are over 1,600 school buses in the city and many schools have not got the police verification of their staff. “If a driver or conductor is found ferrying students without verification, their driving licence will be confiscated and strict action will be taken against the school authorities,” she said.A monthly meeting with school representatives will be held after April once the next academic session starts, said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-to-train-bus-staff-before-next-academic-session-101615916104208.html
16-03-2021||Gurugram||Gangster’s properties to be auctioned on Wednesday||The police will auction two properties of a proclaimed offender and wanted man, Sube Singh, on Wednesday morning. Officials familiar with the development said that after failing to attract bidders in the two auctions over the last two years, four people have shown interest in the two plots and the team will start the auction process in Bar Gujjar village and Manesar industrial area at 11am. KK Rao, the police commissioner, said that in January 2019, the district and sessions court had accepted a petition to attach the property of Singh, following which the process was initiated. “Last year, the family had got a stay from the court for both the properties. This was vacated by the court on March 2 this year, after which we again initiated the process,” he said. Rao said that properties of all proclaimed offenders who are on the run can be attached through court and sold. “Before starting the process, 30 days are given by the court to the criminal to surrender in court or forfeit their property. This process is adopted only if the criminal is involved in heinous crimes or there is a danger to the maintenance of peace, and the law and order situation,” he said.Law enforcement agencies come across various issues while forfeiting and auctioning properties belonging to gangsters. First and most important thing is clarity on the title of the property. Unless the title of the property is clear, it cannot be auctioned, officials said.In many cases, relatives of the gangsters move challenge the forfeiture in court. In such cases, the agency has to hold the procedure as matter becomes sub judice, said an official with the Smuggling and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA). Citing an example of Dawood Ibrahim’s aide, late Iqbal Mirchi, whose three properties in Mumbai are worth around ₹500 crore, Rahul D’souza, former additional commissioner of SAFEMA, said, “Mirchi’s kin provided misleading information pertaining to the properties to the court to avoid the forfeiture. Because of this, the procedure got delayed and after agencies brought correct facts before the court and established that the said properties belonged to Mirchi, the procedure could be completed.”In February and March 2019, the police held similar auctions but there were no takers due to fear of being attacked by the Singh. The police said that it is imperative to attach properties of wanted persons as soon as possible as they might sell their properties and disappear from their trail. Singh is wanted in more than a dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Gurugram and Rewari, where he is suspected to be hiding. The police had announced a reward of ₹4 lakh for Singh’s arrest. He was declared a proclaimed offender in April last year. His wife, who is a sarpanch, is also absconding for the last few months, the police said, adding that they have written to the deputy commissioner to remove her from the sarpanch post. Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said that all procedures, including putting up notices in public places and courts as well as advertising in newspapers, have been followed. “The auction will take place for both the properties and special deployment has been planned. Also, police protection has been provided to the bidders and we will ensure they are not targeted by the family or gang members,” he said. The police said the initiative is to curb the financial muscle of criminals in the district. The financial value of Singh’s plots, a 1.3-acre one in Bar Gujjar and a 0.8-acre one in Manesar, is around ₹6 crore. If these properties remain unsold, the government can choose to rent them to generate revenue and the court will decide the date for the auction and other processes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gangsters-properties-to-be-auctioned-on-wednesday-101615916103468.html

The deceased man was identified as Vijay Surve (40), a resident of Mohan nagar area of Chinchwad, and was the former local leader of Shiv Sena in Mohan nagar.

Idrisi had separately asked for some ₹15,000-20,000 money from Rathod. Rathod asked him to help him with some work in exchange for the money. Idrisi helped him with the murder and then got the money he had asked for, so it was a form of contract killing too,” said Prakash.

Shendge’s resignation ahead of civic polls early next year has created a buzz in the city’s pollical circles. In December 2020, BJP’s ally the Republican Party of India Athavale RPI (A) demanded to share power in the last year of its rule in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The RPI (A)’s demand came immediately after BJP’s defeat in the graduate and teachers’ constituency legislative council election from the Pune division. The RPI (A) has been BJP’s alliance partner for the lok sabha, state and civic polls. Shendge’s resignation is linked with RPI’s demand for the deputy mayor post. However, leader of the house in the PMC Ganesh Bidkar refused to comment on the RPI demand. “The party has accepted the resignation and we will carry out the procedure to depute a new deputy city mayor soon,” Bidkar said. The BJP came to power in the PMC in 2017 by winning 98 of 162 seats. At present, the BJP has eight assembly seats in the city along with the Pune lok sabha seat. RPI was given the post of deputy mayor in 2017 and held it for two years. In 2019, BJP gave a chance to Saraswati Shendge as deputy mayor of Pune. PMPML director Pawar denies to resign The BJP has asked Shankar Pawar who is currently the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) director to tender his resignation, however he has refused to resign. Pawar said, “The party leaders have asked me to resign but I have denied. Former chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and city president Madhuri Misal appointed me as the PMPML director for two and half years. I just completed one and half years. Of those, one year has gone without doing anything in the PMPML. I have very limited time to do something for the development of PMPML.” Pawar said that party leaders are not bothered about Hemant Rasne who has got the standing committee chairman post thrice, however are asking me to vacate the post. “The party should give an equal opportunity to all elected corporators but it is not happening,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-deputy-mayor-resigns-ahead-of-polls-101615915863166.html

Suring cross examination, it was found that ₹23.60 lakh were paid and there is no record as to why the man power was increased from the required 84,” reads the report.On being contacted, director general health services Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj said that action has been taken as per orders and the officer has been chargesheeted. Dr Kamboj, however, did not comment on why the department took around seven years to take action against the ex-CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/7-yrs-on-haryana-health-dept-takes-action-against-ex-kaithal-cmo-101615915382934.html

16-03-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan wants 50% quota cap to be removed, some other states also agree||The Rajasthan government would ask the Supreme Court to remove the 50 per cent cap on reservation, an official statement issued on Monday said, making it the first state to say so. Many other states are in the favour of removing the cap as well.On March 3, the Supreme Court had sought responses from the state governments on whether they were in favour of extending caste-based reservation beyond the 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court in a nine-judge bench ruling given in 1992, famously known as the Indra Sawhney case.Although the order was in the case related to 16 per cent reservation to Marathas under the Other Backward Classes category, the top court wanted to know the views of the states as the states have been repeatedly trying to extend reservation beyond 50 per cent and have brought legislations in the state assemblies.“The (Rajasthan) cabinet expressed its opinion that in the Indira Sawhney case of 1992, there is a need to reconsider the 50 per cent limit decision for reservation,” a statement said. Rajasthan is the first state to take a call on the apex court’s order.The statement said that after the 102nd Constitutional Amendment, which gave constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes and mandates to suggest the castes that need to get the reservation, the legislative powers of the states has been curtailed.Also read: BJP corners Gehlot govt on phone tapping; demands resignation, CBI probe“The states can provide reservation under OBC category only if approved by the NCBC,” said a Rajasthan government official, explaining how their legislative powers have been curtailed.Maharashtra government is also in favour of removing the reservation cap. State public works minister Ashok Chavan, who also heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said we welcome the SC order and would demand the removal of the cap.“We had requested that the opinion from the states be sought as their petitions related to the reservation in government jobs and education is pending before courts. We also want that reservation power of the states, taken away by the 102nd amendment to the Constitution by the Central government, is restored,” Chavan said.A Chhattisgarh government official, aware of the discussions on the SC order within the government, said that the state government wants the cap to be removed and reservation to be given on the population ratio of each caste.“That is why the government had announced a 27 per cent reservation for OBC and 10 per cent for the poor families of the upper class. But this decision was challenged in the HC and the court has asked the government to provide quantifiable data. The government has constituted a Commission for Quantifiable Data, which is doing its work,” the official said.Bihar government is yet to file any response on the information sought by the Supreme Court, said state Advocate General Lalit Kishore. “The matter is still under the process of discussion and study,” he added. However, a government official aware of the developments said that the state government is of the view that the cap should be removed and would be filing a detailed response to the SC soon.Former Bihar minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Neeraj Kumar said that the reservation facility should be aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of the marginalised as per the caste-based census. “I hope that the state government would accommodate views of every section of the society while sending its report,” said Kumar.Punjab government officials said that they are yet to discuss the 50 per cent reservation cap and SC order with chief minister Amarinder Singh to take a call on the issue. The Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments have not discussed the issue as the ruling party leaders are busy with the upcoming state assembly elections, officials in the two states said.Former Rajasthan High Court judge, Pana Chand Jain, said seven states have crossed the 50 per cent cap on reservations and others also want to join the bandwagon for political gains.“The main motive behind the increase in this cap is to get votes and not social justice for which the reservation has been provided in the Constitution,” he said.He said that tampering with the 50 per cent limit would affect the quality of administration across the states.Jaipur based Dalit rights activist Bhanwar Meghwanshi said there is scientific logic behind the 50 per cent cap and it has been dealt with in the Indra Sawhney case. “I don’t agree with the state government’s view,” he said.In the Indra Sawhney case in 1992, the Supreme Court removed the 27 per cent quota for other backward classes (OBC) by excluding the creamy layer and imposed a 50 per cent limit.“The questions which we propose to consider are whether the judgment in case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (1992) needs to be referred to a larger bench or require re-look by the larger bench in the light of subsequent constitutional amendments, judgments and changed social dynamics of the society,” the SC said on March 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-wants-50-quota-cap-to-be-removed-some-other-states-also-agree-101615914782665.html

16-03-2021||Dehradun||Reviving Chipko: Uttarakhand women hug trees to prevent road construction||Tales of the iconic Chipko movement were revived when women in Uttarakhand’s Jakhani village in Bageshwar on Monday hugged trees in a bid to protect them from felling for the proposed construction of Kamedi Devi-Rangthara-Majgaon-Chaunala road. The women claimed that the forest is dedicated to a Goddess and trees are like children to them. Kamala Mehta, sarpanch of the area, said, “Chaunala village has already a road and as such what is the use of another road and cutting trees for the construction? We won’t let them cut our trees since felling trees will not only destroy the environment but also the natural water resources of our area.” Kamedi Devi-Rangthara-Majgaon-Chaunala, a 2-kilometre-long road was sanctioned in 2009 but due to the protests by villagers from two villages of Seri and Jakhani, the construction could not begin. Later villagers of Majgaon, a village next to Jakhani, approached the High Court for the construction of the proposed road and the HC directed for the construction. Last week, the villagers of Seri village staged a protest and halted the construction, but the local administration had continued the road work with the help of police. Also read: ‘Narendra Modi will be treated like Lord Ram in the future’ - Uttarakhand CMOne of India’s first major environmental movements, the Chipko movement of the 1970s became a rallying point for future non-violent environmental movements in India. The move even attracted international attention. Gaura Devi, from Uttarakhand’s Raini village in Chamoli district, had played a key role in the Chipko movement in March 1974 when contractors engaged by an Allahabad-based sports goods company came to the village to cut the Ash trees. The women of the village hugged trees and contactors had to return without any felling. In a similar way, women of Jakhani village, around 35 km from Bageshwar headquarter gathered in the nearby forest on Monday and hugged the trees of their forest to protest against the proposed felling of the trees. They said that they have dedicated the forest to a Goddess and taken a pledge to save the trees on the line of ‘one woman-one tree’. They maintained that they have taken care of them like their children and it is not possible to allow felling for a road. The villagers stressed that their area is already facing environmental problems. The felling of trees will not only deteriorate the environment but also dry the natural water resources of their area, they added. They shouted slogans against the government and the road project. The villagers warned that if the road is constructed, the administration should change the alignment of the road so that their forest could be protected. Ishwar Joshi, a junior engineer of the public works department (PWD), said, “Our department is constructing a road on the instruction of the district magistrate. Villagers of one village are opposing the felling of trees. We have informed our senior officials about the protest.” Devendra Pandey, a local social activist of the area, said, “Since the villagers have dedicated the forest to their Goddess for the protection of trees, they don’t even collect fodder and firewood from that forest. This is the reason that they staging a protest against the felling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/reviving-chipko-uttarakhand-women-hug-trees-to-prevent-road-construction-101615911362365.html

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||CAG detects post-matric scholarship scam in Haryana||Suspected fraudulent payments to the tune of multi-crore were released by manipulating Aadhaar numbers of students under the post-matric scholarship scheme between 2014-19 in Haryana, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).Not just this, 52% applicants were paid scholarships during 2015-19, while 37% approved cases didn’t get the scholarship.The technical education department didn’t pay ₹18 crore scholarship to 7,757 students though the amount was sanctioned and drawn from the treasury.The objective of the Union government-funded post-matric scholarship scheme is to give financial aid to the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Other Backward Class (OBC) students pursuing post-matric courses through recognised institutions. The students should be residents of Haryana to be eligible for the scheme.The financial irregularities range from “ ₹4.74 crore suspected fraudulent scholarship payments” made to students studying outside Haryana, to fraudulent payment of ₹9.65 crore scholarship as the CAG could not verify the details with supporting records.“The suspected fraudulent payment of ₹19 crore was made by manipulating Aadhaar numbers of students,” says the CAG report (2018-19 fiscal) tabled on the floor of Haryana Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday.Inadequate scrutiny of income/caste certificates, etc of students resulted in irregular payment of ₹2 crore scholarship.Funds drawn in anticipation of expenditure were kept in bank accounts and unspent funds were not deposited in government account resulting in loss of interest of ₹6.43 crore to the state exchequer.Rohitash institutesAs per the CAG report, the higher education department paid ₹11 crore scholarship to two colleges (Rohitash Degree College, Ateli, and Rohitash Institute of Management, Ateli) during 2014-18 for 3,598 SC/OBC students of these institutes.The CAG audit obtained registration data of all students admitted to these colleges from the affiliated universities and matched the details of all students shown to have studied in these Institutions with the university registration data.“These institutes had claimed and received payment of scholarship of ₹7.36 crore for 2,490 students who were not registered with the respective universities,” the CAG said.Also, 12 students of general category had claimed scholarship of OBC category and 182 students of general and OBC category had claimed scholarship of SC category resulting in excess claim.The details of 532 students for whom payment of ₹1.70 crore was made to the colleges matched with the university data, but their courses did not match with that of the university records.“Thus, payment of ₹9.65 crore scholarship in respect of 3,216 students was suspected to be fraudulent,” the CAG said.Lack of planningThe CAG pointed out lack of planning, deficiencies in financial management, inadequate scrutiny of applications of students, irregularities in disbursement of scholarship, suspected fraudulent payment, weak monitoring mechanism, etc.The total financial implication of the audit is ₹89 crore, including suspected fraudulent payments.The CAG pointed out that the number of beneficiaries in Haryana was declining in comparison to other states. The audit observed that pendency of cases with the department was one of the reasons for decline in the number of beneficiaries.“The principal secretary (welfare of SC and BC) told the CAG in May 2020 that decline in number of beneficiaries was due to processing of applications through online portal. The reply,” CAG said, “wasn’t convincing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cag-detects-post-matric-scholarship-scam-in-haryana-101615905482036.html

Only 10% of the targeted population under phase two, i.e. those aged 45-59 with comorbidities, and those aged 60+, estimated to be about 13% of the midyear population of 2021, has got their first dose as of March 13. This is about 1.48 lakh people who have got Covisheild, while the rest will now get the Covaxin vaccine. Despite a huge response form senior citizens, the district lags the state capital which has immunised 16% of its target population; and also Nagpur, which has 12% coverage of its target population under phase two.On March 12, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao stated that health experts in the city had been advised to open up vaccination for all above 18, to ensure that the spread is brought under control. He said, “This would be the best solution to stop the spread of the infection, our health experts believe, and so, we will take up this issue with the centre.” Pune has vaccinated 1.48 lakh people from this category, of the estimated 15.2 lakh of the mid- year population estimated as of 2021.As of Saturday, March 13, Pune district has 92,426 health care workers (HCW) who have got their first dose, and 31,283 HCWs who have got their second dose. While 57,605 frontline workers (FLW) have got their first dose and 3,369 FLWs have got their second dose.

Totally 3,32,905 vaccines have been administered in the district.The centre has told the state to ensure maximum vaccination in districts, especially where more cases are coming up. Pune is now also likely to face a vaccine shortage in coming days as the administration has received Covaxin stocks instead of Covishield. To avoid confusion the PMC has now listed hospitals as designated Covishield and Covaxin sites, and has decided to allow only one type of vaccination at one hospital. Three government hospitals have now been reserved as Covishield vaccination sites, while others will provide Covaxin as the first dose henceforth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-lags-mumbai-nagpur-in-phase-2-of-vaccination-drive-101615905240920.html

This is even as the positivity rate is moving up. The number of tests being done in Pune district is lower than Mumbai, even though the number of cases being reported is higher than the state capital. For Pune, the Covid-positive curve began moving upwards since mid-February and is refusing to flatten, despite restrictions in place. In the past five days, Pune district’s daily case load is constantly showing a surge, starting from 2,507 on March 11, to 3,066 on March 14. On March 15, Monday, Pune reported 2,183 cases. Tests were within the range of 15,500.On March 11, the district conducted 15,791 tests, then 15,836 on March 14, and 12,240 on March 15. While Pune conducted 73,894 tests in five days, starting March 11, and reported 13,831 cases, Mumbai had 98,665 tests with 8,541 cases, according to data shared by the state health office. Pune is currently reporting 25% of the new cases in the state and one in every 10 new cases in the country is from Pune.At any given time, every fourth or fifth Covid-19 case in the state is from Pune district. A second wave could see 40% of Covid19 patients turn serious, as seen in September 2020 the peak of Covid-19 in Pune, according to a report submitted by the Tata Consultancy Services and Prayas Health Group. Pune’s positivity rate has now been rising since January. While the positivity rate in September 2020 was 27.7%, it went down to 15.9% in October; 9% in November; 8% in December; 6and .7% in January. However, the positivity rate has been increasing since February, to 10%, and 14.3% between March 1-10. Positivity rate is the number of positives for every 100 tests. As per the WHO for better containment of Covid-19, the positivity rate should be below 5%. In view of the surging tally, the district administration has imposed several restrictions in Pune, including night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, and a 10 pm deadline for malls, hotels, bars and restaurants. “Growing cases is matter of concern for all of us. We appeal to all the citizens and traders to follow Covid-19 norms. Strict action will be taken against those violating guidelines,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. As per PMC, wards which were earlier reporting the highest number of cases, especially those located centrally and are congested, are now reporting a lower number of cases. The administration also believes that “herd immunity” developed during the first wave in these wards is the reason. Most new cases are coming from housing societies. The most affected wards are Hadapsar, Warje-Karvenagar, Wadgaonsheri, Dhankawadi, Sinhgad road and Kothrud. As of Monday, of the more than 22,000 active cases, 14,259 are in home isolation and 7,960 are in hospital. More than half of the active cases isolated in homes are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||With prestige at stake in MC polls, BJP, Cong tread cautiously in Himachal||With the municipal corporation elections in Himachal being seen as precursor to the Assembly elections, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress are treading with caution. A day after the state election commission announced the poll schedule for four municipal corporations – Solan, Palampur, Mandi and Dharamshala, the parties held series of meetings to the rev up their strategy for the elections and are treading cautiously to select candidates. The Congress said it will announce names of candidates in all 64 wards once the state election committee approves the candidates. The party’s state election committee will meet on March 21 to the decide on the names. The Congress has sought feedback from the local units on candidates for the civic body polls while the ruling partyis taking a survey to assess the ability of its candidates to win. “The party has sought reports from observers and its local units by March 19 and candidates will be the declared on March 2,” said Congress’ state party chief Kuldeep Singh Rathore , while accusing the ruling party of registering bogus voters to improve its prospects in corporation elections. “ The chief minister did nothing to improve the condition of the four towns during his regime and now he is making announcements about adding more facilities to the newly created municipal corporations,” said Rathore, adding that the Congress will come out with a vision document for the corporation. Himachal Pradesh’s BJP chief Suresh Kashyap held a virtual meeting with in-charges of all 64 wards of the four MCs to take stock of poll preparedness. The meeting was also attended by state party in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna and co-in-charge Sanjay Tandon. “The BJP is setting up committees in every ward to check rebellion. Besides it is also taking a survey to assess the candidates ability to win. The BJP is likely to announce its candidates on March 19,” Kashyap said, appealing all workers to reach out to 100% voters through door-to-door campaigning. He said ward meetings will be held regularly and all committees will be activated to fight these elections on war footing. State co-in-charge Sanjay Tandon said the BJP will fight the poll battle on ground and the main focus will be on door-to-door campaigning. “He also stressed that all frontal organisation should be on the forefront in all wards. The vision document will have details of issues being faced in each of the 64 wards,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-prestige-at-stake-in-mc-polls-bjp-cong-tread-cautiously-in-himachal-101615903860911.html

Vijay Talkies on Kelkar road was demolished, and now, the company which owns the Laxminarayan theatre has decided to close it permanently. Also, reconstruction work at Neelayam theatre has begun to reduce seating capacity from 1,200 to 400.“Single-screen owners expect some concessions from the government. The demand is for concession in property tax and electricity bills. There haven’t been releases of new films and hence, all the theatres haven’t been opened,” said Nitin Datar, president, Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India. Laxminarayan theatre which is near Swargate, a prime location in the city, was opened in 1976. Its operators have decided not to open it again. “There is no business viability in single -screen theatres. Through various sources people get to watch films. They have many alternatives such as TV and OTT platforms. In the last few years, people have turned their backs on single-screen cinemas and Covid is the latest blow. Now there is no other alternative, but to close it,” said Dilip Borawake, managing director of Borawake Theatres. Of its six single-screen theatres in Pune and Ahmednagar, the Borawake group has decided to shut four, including Laxminarayan. The state government had allowed cinema halls, theatres, and multiplexes to reopen from November 5, but single-screen owners hadn’t opened as they were only allowed to operate with 50 per cent capacity. New restrictions are in place in the city, and the hope for permission to operate at 100 per cent capacity has faded. “The current seating capacity of Neelayam is 1,200. We are reducing it to 400. In the current scenario, after business calculations, it is not possible to run a single screen for 1,200 seats. The remaining space will be used for commercial activities,” said Gaurav Shah, owner of Neelayam. Sadanand Mohol owner of Vaibhav theatre in Hadapsar fears that if the situation doesn’t change, single screens will soon become history in Pune. “There are hardly 15-16 single-screen theatres functioning in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Every month electricity bills have to be paid even though the business is not running. Single-screen owners have to invest from their own pockets. Almost all single-screens are over,” Mohol said. “Permission to operate the cinemas with only 50 per cent capacity, the recent imposition of night curfew and no new film releases are some of the reasons operators hadn’t opened yet. We are monitoring the situation and hopefully it will improve,” said Deepak Kudale, former president, Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India. Single-screen cinemas in Pune-There are 15-16 single-screen theatres in Pune, including the suburbs- Vijay talkies building was demolished and owners of the Laxminarayan theatre have decided not to reopen-Seat numbers in Neelayam being reduced Current challenges- No single-screen theatre in Pune has reopened after lockdown- Permission to operate only with 50 per cent- No releases of new films - Financial burden to pay property tax, electricity bills even if theatre has been closed - No permission to operate another business in that space - Losing audiences to TV and OTT platforms||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-last-show-for-single-screen-cinemas-laxminarayan-theatre-will-not-reopen-101615903801491.html

The firm’s directors and promoters, Jai Kishan Rana, Ashok Rana, Manjeet Kumar, Bipin Singh Yadav, Rajkumar Yadav and others associated with the firm had been accused of duping investors. The company’s registered office is situated at Friends Tower, Sanjay Palace, Agra, said a senior ED official. The investigation was taken up on the basis of various FIRs registered at different police stations of Agra and Mathura. The cases were registered against the aforementioned individuals for duping gullible people by luring them to invest money in schemes floated by the firm, said an ED official. He said the company was building a residential flat complex in Churmura village of Mathura and floated a scheme for pre-booking of flats, assuring buyers that at the time of booking of flats that if they pay a recurring amount per month for a certain period they would have the option of either taking the possession of the booked flat or taking the invested principle along with the interest amount. Also, the buyer had an option to opt out of the scheme after certain recurring payments. The directors assured the return within a certain period of time, he added.“When the investors demanded returns on their investments, initially the accused asked for some time to arrange the payment or assured the investors that the flats would be ready shortly. After a considerable amount of time and hassle when the investors demanded their returns, the directors of the company refused to pay them back and threatened them of dire consequences,” he said, adding: “It is gathered that the company followed a similar modus operandi in Panipat, Hisar and other districts of Haryana and duped people there.”He said the FIRs reported so far suggested that the investors allegedly duped people of around ₹7.39 crore and this amount could be more as there was no mention of the amount in a few FIRs. “The ED is identifying the movable and immovable properties of the company and related persons. The role of the directors, promoters of the company and other persons will be under scanner and properties earned by them using hard earned money of the public will be attached very soon,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-books-agra-builders-firm-for-duping-investors-101615903800868.html
16-03-2021||Other||Pvt doc accused of performing surgery at govt hosp, probe ordered||LUCKNOW A probe has been set up after reports that a private sector doctor allegedly performed a surgery on his patient at the state-run Civil Hospital. “It was shocking information for us, hence we have set up a probe, the report of which will be submitted in two days,” Dr SK Nanda, chief medical superintendent, Civil Hospital on Tuesday. The doctor accused of using the government set-up for private practice had been working at the Civil Hospital as senior resident, while doing MS (orthopaedics). He had resigned in September when asked to do Covid duty. “The charges are of serious nature hence probe is being done. The doctor had left hospital, saying he would not be able to do Covid duty,” said Nanda. It has been alleged that the doctor examines patients at his private clinic located near the Civil hospital and has operated upon some of them at the Civil hospital, which is against the rules as no private sector doctor can utilise government health infrastructure for a patient under his treatment. However, a private sector hospital/doctor can refer a patient to a government hospital. On Monday also, the accused operated a patient, after which a complaint was filed. “Our staff knows that this doctor has resigned. How can he manage the operation theatre and other facilities that are allotted only against a patient and surgeon name,” asked Dr Nanda. The probe committee is looking into the details of the case. Though hospital authorities are yet to decide what charges could be leveled against this doctor, if found guilty, experts said the first onus is on the hospital staff. “It is an administrative lapse. How can an outsider use facilities at any hospital,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president, IMA, Lucknow.“There have been examples when private sector doctors have helped operate upon patients at government hospitals, but this is done via official channel and with due permissions,” he said.“We are also ascertaining if he came to consult a doctor in our hospital for his patient under the protocol laid down for patients coming to the OPD. We have qualified and competent doctors and do not need any support from an outsider,” said Dr Nanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pvt-doc-accused-of-performing-surgery-at-govt-hosp-probe-ordered-101615903500920.html

The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) operates 275 routes in the Kullu assembly segment. Apart from it, private operators have been allotted 159 routes. HRTC has restored bus services along 173 routes and 102 routes were still closed. Private operators have restored 152 routes while seven are closed,” he said.

Every state has been allotted land near the Statue of Unity in Gujarat,” he said. 
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Fatehpur bypoll: Anticipating rebellion, BJP ropes in its key troubleshooters||Sensing a rebellion brewing in the Fatehpur assembly segment that will be going to bypoll soon, the Himachal Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has deputed its key troubleshooters to quell any dissidence.Industry minister Bikram Thakur, who is considered to be close to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, has been appointed as in-charge while forest minister Rakesh Pathania is the co-in-charge for the Fatehpur bypolls.Former state BJP president chief and chairperson of the state finance commission Satpal Singh Satti will be the coordinator. The byelection to Fatehpur, a Rajput community dominated assembly segment in Kangra district, was necessitated by the death of sitting legislator and former Congress minister Sujan Singh Pathania.BJP state president Suresh Kashyap said these leaders have a vast experience in the field of electoral politics, election management and also played a key role in the Panchayati Raj elections.Fatehpur, which earlier was part of Jawali constituency, has remained a stronghold of the Congress. Late Congress minister Sujan Singh Pathania has won seven terms from this assembly segment, three in a row, including one by-election.BJP is hoping to wrest the seat from the Congress as the Opposition lacks a formidable face from the area. However, hoping to cash on sympathy votes, the Congress is mulling to field Sujan’s son Bhawani Singh Pathania from the assembly segment. Bhawani has served at top positions in a private insurance company and is known for his humility.The Fatehpur block of Congress has already sent a resolution to the party high command supporting his candidature for the by-election.Tightrope walk for BJP However, the BJP is in a tight spot over selecting a candidate as it is apprehensive of a rebellion within the party. At present, former Rajya Sabha MP Kripal Parmar is considered to be a frontrunner in the race for the ticket. However, a rival camp is pushing for Baldev Thakur’s candidature. Notably, Thakur had revolted against the party in the 2017 assembly election, resulting in Parmar’s narrow loss. Thakur had unsuccessfully contested the 2012 election from Fatehpur as a BJP candidate.Recently, posters had come up in Fatehpur area against Parmar labelling him an outsider. Parmar, originally, belongs from Pathankot but has been living in Fatehpur for decades.Amid uncertainty over the BJP’s candidate, another name, Pankaj Sharma, has cropped up. Sharma, a youth wing leader has served in the Indian Air Force. Meanwhile, the forest minister says the ability to win will be the main criteria for selecting a candidate. “The party will soon announce its candidate after mulling over certain key factors. “We have an edge in Fatehpur as 14 panchcyats of my constituency Nurpur have been merged in Fatehpur,” he said, adding that they will ensure that no rebellion takes place and everything is settled amicably.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fatehpur-bypoll-anticipating-rebellion-bjp-ropes-in-itsr-key-troubleshooters-101615898941125.html

His entry came as a shot in the arm for the BJP as his father, Sukhram, is credited with bringing the telecom revolution and wields considerable influence in the state. After winning the polls, Sharma was appointed power minister. However, he was compelled to give up his Cabinet berth after his son Ashray contested elections to the Lok Sabha on a Congress ticket. A visibly disgruntled Anil Sharma said, “Two years have passed since I stepped down as minister. Today, I do not know whether I am part of the party or not. I am never invited to party meetings. My name is not on foundation stones being laid for different projects in Mandi assembly segments.” Jai Ram is ignoring me, says Anil Sharma Sharma says he felt isolated in the party . “This is the first time that I have not been invited to the Shivratri fair. So, despite being in Mandi I was not able to attend the festival. I was harassed and humiliated on public platforms. I don’t know under whose pressure chief minister Jai Ram Thakur is ignoring me.”He also alleged lack of development in Mandi. “People in Mandi had high hopes as our chief minister hails from the district. However, development projects initiated by me or the CM himself have been halted or left incomplete,” said the former minister.”Sharma said that he will soon hold a press meet in his hometown to highlight the bias meted out to Mandi with facts and figures. Sharma said he welcomed the government’s decision to upgrade the Mandi municipal council to a municipal corporation but was against including some rural area within its limits.“The CM had said in a public meeting that if people of rural areas were opposed to including villages within the municipal corporation’s limits, they will be excluded,” said Sharma. “However, the time to do so is over and the government will give a befitting response from the public in the MC elections,” he said.‘The party does not feel I am required’ On his role in the MC polls, Sharma said the government and party do not feel he is required so has not been given any responsibility. “I will not support this party in the elections,” he said.He also hit out at Jal Shakti Minister Mahender Singh for interfering and altering different development projects executed in Mandi, which he said have become a bane for people. He said he had different plans for Mandi town, but the CM always neglected them.Sharma said the decision to join BJP in the last assembly election was taken by his family and now people will decide the next course of action for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandi-mla-anil-sharma-refuses-to-campaign-for-saffron-party-in-civic-polls-101615896473182.html

The committee is yet to decide the date,” Tikait, the BKU spokesperson said, according to news agency ANI. Tikait and his supporters have been camping at the Delhi-UP Ghazipur border since the early days of the agitation.Yes we will block the border (Delhi-Noida border).The committee is yet to decide the date: Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait pic.twitter.com/zePJMQzx7fThe committee, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), is an umbrella body of more than 40 farmers’ unions, which is spearheading the protests against the three laws on the borders of Delhi since November 26 last year.Farmers belonging to Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) vacated the Delhi-Noida Chilla border on January 27, after blocking it for 58 days, in the wake of violent clashes between a section of farmers and the Delhi Police in the national capital on Republic Day.A day later, as the police moved in to vacate the Ghazipur border, Tikait broke down. The video of his tears went viral, prompting farmers from nearby states to join the BKU leader at the protest site, thus swelling the numbers which had started to decrease in the wake of Jan. 26 violence. Since then, Tikait has emerged as the face of the movement, addressing 'mahapanchayats' (farmers’ meeting) in various cities across the country. Recently, he also went to poll-bound West Bengal and addressed a mahapanchayat in the assembly constituency of Nandigram, from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee will contest, and urged voters to not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose government at the Centre passed the legislations last September.The BKU leader has also repeatedly warned that ‘lakhs of tractors will enter Delhi’ and gherao Parliament till a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) is given and the three laws are repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-will-block-delhi-noida-border-warns-rakesh-tikait-101615891916518.html

Police cordoned the area and arrested them with firearms and equipment.On the information provided by the arrested criminals, raids were carried in adjacent Rohtas and Buxar districts and other five members of the gang were arrested. They confessed their involvement in more than 15 cases of dacoity and loot across the three districts.The arrested criminals were identified as kingpin Ashok Musahar, gang members Mangaru Muasahar, Krishna Muasahar, Murari Muasahar Bhoda Muasahar and Bablu Musahar of Chitawan village, Umesh Musahar of Kaithi village in Rohtas district, Ajay Musahar and Dipak Muasahar of Khilafatpur village, Rinku Musahar of Katheja village in Buxar district, police said.Two pistols, a toy pistol, four live cartridges, ₹63,000 cash, 11 mobile phones, 19 pieces of looted gold and silver ornaments and a mini truck full of utensils, clothes and household items were recovered from them.The officers were stunned when the criminals said that burglary and dacoity was their traditional profession and they had no option but to repeat the same after coming out on bail, an officer said.Claiming it to be a big achievement, SP Kumar praised and awarded the members of the police team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/interdistrict-dacoit-gang-busted-in-bihar-10-including-kingpin-arrested-101615891913092.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||AAP to protest against Delhi NCT Bill tomorrow||The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will organise a protest on Wednesday against a Bill introduced by the Union government on Monday in Parliament that seeks to give overarching powers over Delhi’s daily functions to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor (L-G).“The AAP will organise the protest tomorrow [Wednesday] at 2 pm at Jantar Mantar over the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Aam Aadmi Party MPs [members of Parliament], Cabinet ministers in Delhi, and party MLAs [members of legislative assembly] will be present,” said Delhi minister Gopal Rai. “The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] has been left baffled by the recent loss in the municipal bye-polls to five wards and the AAP’s popularity across states. By bringing this Bill in Parliament, the BJP has made it clear that it wants to rule Delhi through back door by making the L-G more powerful.”Also Read | Kejriwal hits out at Centre over ‘unconstitutional, anti-democracy’ NCT BillRai called the Bill a conspiracy to make an administrative mess in Delhi again. “The BJP will act as an obstructionist in implementation of the policies in this year’s Delhi budget which focuses on patriotism and aims to further improve governance in Delhi.”AAP said in a press statement that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will be attending Wednesday’s protest at Jantar Mantar.Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said, “It is difficult to understand why AAP government is protesting against the central government’s move. It is only aimed at strengthening checks and balances in Delhi’s governance. Also, Delhi is not the responsibility of Mr Arvind Kejriwal alone. The central government too has its own share of responsibilities. Whenever AAP government has failed in any aspect of governance – from combating air pollution to ensuring water supply across the city – Kejriwal and AAP leaders have often blamed the central government. With the intervention of the L-G, such blame game will reduce. Also, the crux of the 2018 Supreme Court judgment was to bring more clarity in Delhi’s governance and the central government is trying to ensure that with the new Bill. AAP leaders are deliberately misinterpreting it to mislead people.”Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy introduced the Bill in the Lower House on Monday, where the government has a comfortable majority. The Bill says the “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in the context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly. It makes it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action.“The said Bill will promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the lieutenant governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of National Capital Territory of Delhi, as interpreted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” read a statement of objects and reasons, attached with the draft legislation, attributed to Union home minister Amit Shah.Shortly after the Bill was introduced, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the BJP of seeking to drastically curtail the powers of the elected government.On July 4, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the L-G could not interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and must act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-to-protest-against-delhi-nct-bill-tomorrow-101615891853114.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi remains world's most polluted capital for 3rd straight year, says study||New Delhi has remained the world's most polluted capital for third straight year in 2020, according to a study done by IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5.The study is based on India's annual average of particulate matter PM2.5, airborne particles with less than 2.5 microns in diameter.The air quality improvements across major cities in 2020 compared to 2019 include Beijing (-11%), Chicago (-13%), Delhi (-15%), London (-16%), Paris (-17%) and Seoul (-16%).“While many cities recorded temporary improvements in air quality due to lockdowns, the health impact of burning fossil fuels remained severe. Unfortunately, Delhi continued to be the most polluted capital city in the world in 2020. To see real, long-term improvements in air quality, governments must prioritize clean energy sources such as wind and solar and promote low cost, carbon neutral and accessible transport. Speeding up the transition to clean energy and clean transport not only saves lives, but also dramatically reduces healthcare-related costs,” said Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, according to IQAir.The study said that last year, Delhi's average annual concentration of PM2.5 in a cubic meter of air was 84.1, which was more than double the level of Beijing, which averaged 37.5 during the year.According to a recent study by Greenpeace Southeast Asia Analysis and IQAir, air pollution caused an estimated 54,000 premature deaths in Delhi in 2020.Last year, Delhi's residents, who breathed some of the cleanest air on record in summer months due to the coronavirus lockdown, battled toxic air in winter, following a sharp increase in farm fire incidents in the neighbouring states of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-remains-world-s-most-polluted-capital-for-3rd-straight-year-says-study-101615890181269.html

Naidu faces arrest if he does not comply with the notice, they added. The officials said a CID team issued the notice to Naidu at his Hyderabad residence.The CID issued notices to senior TDP leader P Narayana also. Narayana was municipal administration minister in Naidu’s cabinet.This comes four days after the CID on Friday registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Naidu under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 120 B (conspiracy) 166 (public servant disobeying the law), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document), and 217 (public servant disobeying law with intent to save a person from punishment or property from forfeiture). He has also been booked under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act.The FIR was registered on ruling YSR Congress Party lawmaker Alla Ramakrishna Reddy’s complaint. According to the FIR, a copy of which HT has seen, farmers of Reddy’s Mangalagiri constituency in Amaravati told him that influential people in the previous Naidu-led Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government cheated them by taking away their land illegally. Farmers have alleged that some middlemen created insecurities stating the government might take away their assigned land without giving any compensation, it added.The FIR said Reddy verified the orders issued by the then government and found several irregularities in acquiring assigned land, thereby “causing irreparable loss” to the people belonging to Scheduled Castes (ST) and Scheduled Tribes (ST).A deputy police superintendent conducted a preliminary inquiry before the FIR was registered.Also Read | YSRCP sweeps Andhra local body electionsA special investigation team has been probing alleged irregularities in land pooling in Amaravati after Naidu proposed it as the capital of Andhra Pradesh l when the state lost Hyderabad with the creation of Telangana in 2014.TDP’s Andhra Pradesh unit chief K Atchannaidu dismissed the allegations as a political witch-hunt. He wondered how the CID could register the case against Naidu on the basis of a complaint by a ruling party lawmaker. “Ramakrishna Reddy is not an SC or ST. How can the CID file a case against Naidu under the SC/ST law?”Atchannaidu said the lands were acquired for the capital under a pooling scheme after taking the farmers’ consent.

16-03-2021||Other||Civic Sanskriti: Why street vendors must not become a Covid-19 casualty||Around this time last year, for the first few days, or weeks, of lockdown it was great to have quiet streets. But soon, we were longing for the simple pleasure of a paani puri, some chahal pahal – the colour, sights, sounds and smells that street vendors bring to the cityscape. Hawkers and vendors are an age-old part of cities around the world. They are entrepreneurs and help make urban life richer in many ways. Street vendors provide fresh vegetables, food, and many essential goods and services in our neighbourhoods. You don’t need to go too far, and less travel means less road congestion and pollution. Some important services like cycle repair and mochi (cobbler) are provided mainly by these roadside workers. Street vendors are a “low carbon” supply-chain link – important in this era of climate change! Each individual display rack, cart, cycle or kiosk makes do with very little space, energy, or material resources – it is jugaad and innovation! Often, the same space is used by multiple vendors, exhibiting a resource efficient and adaptable design we should be proud of. For example, street space used by a fresh juice vendor for early morning walkers may be used later by a paani puri vendor for evening fun-seekers. Importantly, street vendors, like autorickshaw drivers help make our streets humane and safe. They are often “eyes on the street”, keeping streets active and reducing crime. They are “first responders” in the case of traffic accidents, coming to the aid of victims. Street vending is an important means of livelihood in cities. Kashinath Nakhate, state secretary, National Hawkers Federation, estimates there are at least 70,000 street vendors in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, though the pandemic has caused considerable changes to the sector. Some street vendors returned to their hometowns. Some people have taken to street vending when they could not continue their regular jobs or occupations. “Municipal authorities, public and philanthropic groups can do a lot to facilitate street vending and help individuals, families, and the city economy recover from the disruptions of the lockdowns,” says Avinash Madhale, programme coordinator, CEE, who recently held a dialogue with vendor groups on this topic. The central government recently introduced SvNidhi loans for street vendors. These can help, though vendors end up losing a few days of livelihood in getting the paper work together. Implementing the Street Vendors Act would help a lot. This Act was passed by the central government in 2014 with the aim of protecting and supporting the livelihoods of street vendors. As per this law, municipal authorities have to conduct regular surveys to enumerate street vendors, and with the help of street vendors’ associations hold elections to choose representatives to the Town Vending Committee (TVC). The TVC and city would then provide vending certificates, ensure serviced and designed vending spaces, especially in natural markets where vendors and customers congregate, charge a vending fee and prepare schemes for welfare and training of street vendors. Unfortunately, the Act has not been implemented in Maharashtra. Ironically, street vendors who are just trying to earn their living are often called “Illegal” or “a nuisance”, while state and city governments have fallen short of the law. Mecanzy Dabre, deputy general secretary, National Hawkers Federation, says, “Implementing the Act would help facilitate as well as regulate street vending. Proper vending zones and street designs would benefit the public. Vendors would not have to face harassment from authorities or pay bribes. Formalising vending fees would give the city a new revenue source for upkeep and regulation of street vending zones.” The TVC and city authorities should involve vendors and resident associations to determine vending zones. “Post pandemic, street design initiatives are even more essential as the importance of daily needs within walkable distance has re-emerged”, advises Prasanna Desai, Architect and Urban Designer. “Accommodating and locating hawkers spaces strategically is very critical. Absolute care is needed to design safe, functional vending spaces providing clear movement space and not forcing pedestrians to walk on the carriage way.”Corporate groups and NGOs could help in several ways: enabling apps and phone connectivity to reach customers; technology support such as cool boxes to keep vegetables and fruits fresh; solar, energy efficient devices for heating and charging needs; business incubation and easy loans to support entrepreneurship and innovation; training on hygiene, safety, and customer service. Considering the enormous contribution of workers like street vendors, construction workers, hamals, waste collectors, and domestic workers to the economy, cities should focus on the Ease of Doing Business in the Informal Sector. Anyone ready to get that score going?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-sanskriti-why-street-vendors-must-not-become-a-covid-19-casualty-101615878831957.html

However, the fear of getting a jab still looms large, given the number of misconceptions surrounding it. And here is where millennials have decided to step in and help alleviate the fear. Today, on National Vaccination Day, we talk to some youngsters in Delhi-NCR who’ve been giving pep talks to their parents and grandparents on why it’s vital to get vaccinated. “As youngsters, we have far greater access and ease in using technology than our parents. It is our duty to use that advantage and talk to them about getting vaccinated. I’ve been sitting with my umiji and talking about how vaccination is a safer way to build protection against a highly contagious and serious disease,” says Atifa Ahangar, a Gurugram resident who is part of the food and hospitality industry. She’s also been helping her parents understand how a vaccine is important to break the chain of being a Covid-19 carrier.Be it sharing online articles on the vaccine or scheduling appointments with healthcare professionals, youngsters are leaving no stone unturned. “It’s normal for our parents to hesitate in getting vaccinated, because the pandemic has taken a toll, mentally, on all of us, with so much uncertainty in the air. However, you just need to have a heart to heart discussion with your parents about how the vaccination is an important step to stop the pandemic and how it will help build immunity against the disease. If you research your options and make an informed, responsible choice, you will be doing a service to yourself and to those around you... I took my mother to our family doctor, so that she could clear all her doubts regarding the vaccination. A consultation with a healthcare professional helped her become more comfortable and confident, with regards to getting the vaccination,” says Sanjay Kataria, a Delhi University student. Youngsters have even made groups on various platforms to have conversations via text messages and video calls, about the vaccine. “I’ve made a WhatsApp group with my grandparents where we share all news and articles related to the vaccines and the pandemic. I think that has helped make each one of us aware about the various ways in which this pandemic is to be tackled. There are many times my grandmother video calls me to ask me about the new Covid-19 strains or the efficacy of different vaccines. We also talk about our fears and hesitation. I think an informed dialogue is always the way forward,” says Sangarika Tripathi, a Delhi-based IT professional who has scheduled an appointment to take her grandparents to get vaccinated.

He branded me with a hot spatula on both my hands, back and also my left cheek," she added.Late in the night, Puja called up his brother who took her, and her three-year-old child to his home in Kalwa.After municipal councillor Vaishali Patil took up the matter with police, an FIR was registered on Friday. Acting on the woman's complaint the Powai police on Monday arrested Chauhan."He has been booked under sections 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 506-2 (criminal intimidation), 323 (assault) and 504 (abuse) of Indian Penal Code. He would be produced in court on Tuesday," said an officer from Powai police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-beats-wife-with-hot-spatula-over-suspicion-of-affair-arrested-police-101615865075145.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Traffic on Delhi borders continues to be affected||Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remained closed fully or partially for traffic movement on Tuesday as farmers continue their protest against the three farm laws. Vehicular movement from Delhi to Ghaziabad through Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border was restored a little after Sunday midnight, as the police opened one of the six carriageways that had remained closed for the past 48 days, since violence broke out during the farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day. But the Ghazipur border as such continues to remain closed for motorists coming to Delhi from UP. In their advisory, Delhi Traffic Police have asked commuters to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders. The Delhi -Noida Chilla border was also open for commute on both carriageways.

They can also enter Delhi through Noida. The entry and exit points between the national Capital and Haryana – passing through Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Manyari and Saboli and Mangesh – continued to remain closed. The traffic police also advised motorists travelling between Delhi and Haryana to take alternative routes via Lampur Safiabad, Palla and Singhu school toll tax borders or other routes passing through Gurugram and Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-traffic-on-delhi-borders-continues-to-be-affected-101615864672204.html

16-03-2021||Delhi||‘Will give toolkit suspects 7-day notice before arrest’: Police tells court||The Delhi Police on Monday told a city court that it would give seven days’ prior notice to Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob, Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk and climate activist Shubham Kar Chaudhuri in case the police believe that their arrest is “unavoidable and imminent” in the toolkit case.Accepting the police submission, the three sought to withdraw their pleas seeking anticipatory bail and additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana, accordingly, disposed of the petitions. The trio, along with climate activist Disha Ravi, has been charged with sedition for creating and sharing a toolkit on social media related to the ongoing farmer’s protest against the three farm bills.While hearing arguments on anticipatory bail pleas of Jacob, Muluk and Chaudhuri, Rana also noted the police submission that technical evidence is being gathered and information has been sought from intermediaries such as Signal and Telegram “whose USP is to be reluctant in sharing the information”.The police told the court that information also has to be sought from Zoom and other social media platforms while also claiming that of the 70-80 participants in the Zoom meeting of the Poetic Justice Foundation held on January 11, allegedly attended by the accused, information has been obtained with respect to just two participants.Appearing for the police, additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that the investigation is at an initial stage and technical analysis has to be done.The police said Muluk had deleted all images and whatever else was on there on his device and these can’t be retrieved.To this, Rana remarked, “What will you do in custodial interrogation then… You can’t do it to create fear. You have to show me how you would collect evidence during interrogation”.The defence counsels said they would withdraw anticipatory bail pleas provided police agreed to give them advance notice of seven days in case they intend to arrest their clients.Noting their submissions, the court disposed of the pleas by the trio. It directed the police to give seven days’ notice if it gathers enough evidence to arrest the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-give-toolkit-suspects-7-day-notice-before-arrest-police-tells-court-101615863863806.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||No end in sight for traffic nightmare at Ashram||The traffic nightmare at Ashram intersection is likely to continue well into May this year, with the Public Works Department (PWD) on Monday saying that diversions on the Mathura Road-Ring Road junction — put in place due to the construction of an underpass — is likely to stay in place for another 45 days at least.The PWD said that barricades from the Ashram junction, which has led to vehicles being diverted towards New Friends Colony on Mathura Road, will be removed only by May. The entire underpass project will be completed by end of June 2021.The delay comes as multiple agencies work out of sync and will mean people coming from Noida and East Delhi via this route – one of the arterial connections – have little option but to spend upwards of 40 minutes (or more during peak hours) till the diversions remain in place in one of the Capital’s busiest and most important intersections.A pile-up of vehicles waiting to turn right also eats into the space for those going straight to Lajpat Nagar. This route is often used by ambulances ferrying passengers to critical care facilities such as AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital.The Delhi traffic police, on the request of the PWD, had introduced a new diversion plan for the intersection from March 3, following which vehicles coming from Noida and Sarai Kale Khan now have to take a compulsory left turn on Mathura Road towards New Friends Colony traffic signal, located 600 metres away from the intersection, and then make a U-turn. Commuters can then take a left turn to go towards Lajpat Nagar on the Ring Road or go straight towards Nizamuddin or Bhogal. Earlier, vehicles could directly make a right turn towards Nizamuddin or go straight on the Ring Road at the Ashram intersection.Commuters complained that because of the main intersection being completely closed, travel time on the stretch has increased by at least 40 minutes.PWD officials, however, said the work on the intersection was “crucial and complex” and required restriction of traffic in order to meet the June deadline for completion of the 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and the CSIR Apartments on Mathura Road. The project has already missed one deadline in December last year and is on course to miss its March deadline as well.“We will take at least one-and-a-half months more to finish construction work on the central portion of the underpass, which falls right at the junction on the Ring Road, below the flyover. The nature of work here is complex because there are a number of utilities, such as water pipelines, that need to be shifted, beside deep digging work being carried out. The traffic on this portion has been diverted towards New Friends Colony so that we get more space to finish this segment of work as soon as possible,” a PWD official said.Ashram, which is one of the busiest stretches in the Capital, sees over 350,000 vehicles passing every day during peak rush hours of morning and evening. The traffic situation, which was already chaotic before the new plan was introduced, has now got worse, especially for emergency vehicles moving from nearby hospitals. Currently, vehicular movement is blocked at the intersection, below the Ashram flyover, traffic police officers said.“Because of the ongoing construction work, the traffic movement in Ashram has been hugely impacted. Hence, it is important that work here be completed fast so that commuters get some respite and space can be cleared out before PWD begins work on the extension of the flyover on the Ring Road,” a senior Delhi traffic police official said.PWD officials justified the “complete blockade” as much needed to meet the June deadline. UTTIPEC — the apex body for approving infrastructure projects — had approved the underpass project in January 2016, which was to be completed by March 2018. The project finally got the nod of the expenditure finance committee of the Delhi government in 2018. On December 24, 2019, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal laid the foundation stone with a December 2020 deadline. This was extended to March 2021, and further till June.“Ashram crossing is now a perennial choke point. For the last five-six years, I have been seeing some sort of construction activity here. Passing through this stretch has now become a nightmare. I now have to spend at least 30-40 minutes extra to reach my home from Noida due to the new traffic plan,” Preeti Pandey, a resident of Bhogal, said.Subhash Chand, head of traffic engineering and safety division at the Central Road Research Institute, said traffic jams on the stretch is a result of poor site management by the construction agencies. “Even without closing the entire intersection, you can facilitate smooth traffic flow and also complete your work within the deadline. This can happen with efficient site management, which the PWD is ignoring. You are supposed to ensure that there are ample signage to warn commuters of the diversion. You also need to ease the traffic into the construction site, which is also not happening,” Chand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-end-in-sight-for-traffic-nightmare-at-ashram-101615862933714.html

16-03-2021||Delhi||BJP backs move; a ‘black day’ for Delhi, says Cong||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday welcomed the Centre’s move to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act and give overarching powers to the city’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G), even as the Congress termed it as a “black day” for the city.The bill, introduced in Parliament on Monday, said “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly and made it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action, reviving a power tussle over the governance of the Capital between the Centre and the elected AAP government.The Congress, which governed Delhi for 15 years before being defeated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2013, slammed the BJP for curtailing the powers of an elected government as well as the ruling party in the city for being a “mute spectator” despite the knowledge that the Union Cabinet had, in February, approved a proposal to amend the Act.Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said, “It is black day and a black decision, as it curtails the power of a democratically elected government. This will destroy Delhi’s democratic powers. But the ruling AAP party and a weak CM are equally responsible. The decision was approved by the Cabinet in February. Why didn’t Kejriwal, who is known for sitting on dharnas, protest against it? Why didn’t his ministers or MPs voice their dissatisfaction? All Kejriwal did was tweet.”BJP leaders, however, welcomed the Centre’s decision, and the party’s Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta said most administrative powers in the Capital will continue to rest with the state government.“Even after the amendment Bill, 75% of administrative work and power will rest with Delhi’s government. It will be better that the Arvind Kejriwal government concentrate on good governance and developing Delhi, instead of starting a new power struggle.”Meanwhile, accusing the AAP of misgovernance, BJP leader Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly, called the L-G the “ultimate” authority in Delhi.“Public money is being wasted, due to which Delhi is in a mess. No new development work has been initiated by this government. As Delhi continues to be a Union Territory, the L-G has the ultimate power. The Centre has only defined the powers more clearly. As for their charge of losing elections, the BJP won all seats in Delhi for a second term in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The Centre has the people’s support,” he said.Former Congress MLA Anil Bhardwaj said, “If the Bill is passed, it will be a black day for Delhi, the murder of democracy, and a clear violation of the basic tenets of the Constitution.”The BJP hit back and said the Congress, when in power in the state and Centre, failed to give Delhi full statehood.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said, “The Congress should answer why their government didn’t give full statehood to Delhi. Their government was in power [in the Centre] when the GNCTD Act was passed in 1991. The state government was not given all the powers. When the BJP came to power [in Delhi] in 1993, the ultimate authority was the L-G. In fact, at that time, important departments like Delhi Jal Board, DTC, DESU and others were not with the Delhi government. There was cordial coordination between the Centre and the-then CMs (Madan Lal Khurana and Sahib Singh Verma, both of the BJP), who brought these departments under the Delhi government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjpbacks-move-a-black-day-for-delhi-says-cong-101615862170393.html
16-03-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh govt issues rules for 15-year-old vehicles||The Madhya Pradesh government has issued a notification regarding old government and private vehicles, according to which vehicles that are over 15 years old will not be registered in the state. This is in tandem with the Centre’s scrappage policy introduced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman according to which cars that are older than 15 years would be required to undergo mandatory emission tests.In its notification, the Madhya Pradesh government has also said that cars older than 15 years will need a ‘fitness certificate’. This will be applicable for both government as well as private vehicles and the policy is expected to be implemented from April.Apart from this, fitness certificates have now been made compulsory for new private vehicles of the state. It is believed that this rule will be implemented from April, along with the Centre's scrappage policy. The state government will also impose a green tax on older vehicles and has sent its report for the same to the Union ministry of transport and highways.Owners of vehicles who choose to scrap vehicles older than 15 years will also be given benefits by the state government—a maximum of 10 per cent discount on purchasing a new car and 1 per cent will be recovered from them in form of green tax. The state government will implement the rules after the Centre’s approval.According to the Centre’s scrappage policy, cars that have aged more than eight years will have to undergo a ‘fitness test’ and if they fail the test, owners will not be allowed to drive them anymore. On the other hand, if the cars pass the test, a green tax would be charged on them to renew the fitness certificate. The fitness certificate will be valid for five years. In addition to this, car owners will be asked to scrap vehicles that are older than 15 years and purchase new ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-govt-issues-rules-for-15-year-old-vehicles-101615861316308.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze case won't be over till Mansukh Hiren's killer is revealed: Fadnavis||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday stated that Sachin Vaze's case will not be over until Mansukh Hiren's killer is revealed.Speaking to media persons here, Fadnavis said, "Let me tell you that Sachin Waze's case is not over yet. It won't be until Mansukh Hiren's killer is revealed."Fadnavis had earlier accused the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra for protecting Vaze.Sachin Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency on March 13 for his alleged role and involvement in the Antilla bomb scare case.Waze, who was leading the investigation of Mansukh Hiren's death in the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), was arrested days after being transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre at the Mumbai Police Headquarters.He was summoned to the NIA office on Saturday to record his statement, in connection with the recovery of explosives from a car parked near Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai.Later, he was arrested under section 286, 465, 473, 506(2), 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, and 4(a)(b)(I) of the Explosive Substances Act 1908.A car carrying unassembled explosive materials was found abandoned at Carmichael Road in South Mumbai on February 25, near the house of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-case-won-t-be-over-till-mansukh-hiren-s-killer-is-revealed-fadnavis-101615857361526.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze suspended again, CCTV grab under probe||Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze was suspended by Mumbai police on Monday following his arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with its probe into the recovery of explosives from an SUV parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, even as his brother Sudharm Vaze filed a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court against the arrest, claiming that Vaze was being made a “scapegoat” by “certain political powers”.Vaze, 49, remained the centre of political debate as leaders from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said his arrest would allow further investigation into ruling Shiv Sena leaders. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar met on Monday afternoon to deliberate on damage-control measures. According to leaders of the ruling coalition, Pawar and Thackeray discussed a strategy to find a way out of the crisis. Thackeray also met Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole.Vaze, a former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch, was initially the lead investigator after a Scorpio car carrying 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, with no detonator or timer) was found near Antilia on Carmichael Road on February 25, but the case was transferred to the NIA on March 8.Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner S Chaitanya said: “API Sachin Vaze has been placed under suspension by an order of the additional commissioner of police, special branch.”The NIA collected CCTV footage from the Mumbai police control room as well as from several sites in Mumbai and Thane. After a CCTV grab showed a person walking near Ambani’s residence, the NIA is investigating whether that person was Vaze. Two NIA officers also visited Vaze’s house in Saket, Thane on Monday afternoon, to question his family.Sudharm’s petition stated that Vaze cooperated with the NIA gave them all the corroborative pieces of evidence and yet, after several hours of interrogation, he was arrested without being served a copy of the FIR or being informed of the nature of allegations against him.This is the second time that Vaze has faced suspension. In 2004, he was suspended after being arrested for the alleged custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, an accused in a 2002 bomb blast that took place in Ghatkopar. Vaze eventually left the force in 2007. He was reinstated in 2020 after the suspension order was revoked. His reinstatement has been challenged by Yunus’s mother in the Bombay high court.Vaze is also under the scanner for the mysterious death of 48-year-old Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to the Scorpio found outside Ambani’s residence. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5.Vaze was transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre last week, after leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis sought his arrest following the statement of Hiran’s wife Vimla that she suspected Vaze had a hand in the death. Since then, Vaze has also become the subject of a political slugfest between the coalition partners of the MVA government and the opposition BJP.“Sachin Vaze has been suspended once again. But why, how, on what basis and who reappointed him on June 6, 2020? It should be investigated. Persons responsible must be punished,” BJP leader Kirit Somaiya tweeted on Monday.BJP legislator Nitesh Rane on Monday alleged that Yuva Sena leader Varun Sardesai was linked to Vaze in the latter’s alleged extortion racket from bookies during the previous Indian Premier League. Rane demanded that the NIA seek the call detail records of Vaze and Sardesai. Sardesai refuted these claims and said, “The allegations that the BJP legislator made today are baseless and therefore I am going to file a criminal defamation against legislator Nitesh Rane. He should either apologise in 7 days for false allegations or face legal action and prove them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-suspended-again-cctv-grab-under-probe-101615855894179.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Centre moves to cut powers of Delhi govt||The Union government on Monday introduced in Parliament a controversial bill giving overarching powers over the city’s daily functions to the Centre-appointed Lieutenant Governor, prompting fierce protests from the Delhi government and reviving an old power tussle for control of the Capital.Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy introduced the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in the Lower House, where the government has a comfortable majority. The bill said “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly and made it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action.“The said bill will promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the lieutenant governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of National Capital Territory of Delhi, as interpreted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” read a statement of objects and reasons, attached with the draft legislation, attributed to Union home minister Amit Shah.Shortly after the bill was introduced, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of seeking to ically curtail the powers of an elected city government.“After being rejected by people of Delhi (8 seats in assembly, 0 in MCD bypolls), BJP seeks to drastically curtail powers of elected government through a Bill in LS today. Bill is contrary to Constitution Bench judgement. We strongly condemn BJP’s unconstitutional n anti-democracy move,” he said.On July 4, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the L-G couldn’t interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and must act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia called the bill unconstitutional and undemocratic. “After this bill is implemented, the elected government of Delhi will mean nothing. This is a dangerous amendment,” he told a press conference.Delhi holds a unique position in India’s administrative framework. As a Union territory, it is governed by the 1991 Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act that provides for both an elected assembly and an L-G appointed by the Union home ministry. But unlike full states, many important departments such as land, police and personnel appointments don’t come under the purview of the city government and report directly to the L-G. Political conflict for administrative control of the prestigious national capital is decades old but came to a head in 2015, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swept to power and repeatedly clashed with the BJP over transfer and appointment of top bureaucrats. The former also accused the latter of trying to rule the city by proxy.In July 2018, the top court ruled the L-G was bound to listen to the city’s elected government and couldn’t act independently, prompting the AAP government to claim victory. All decisions by Delhi’s council of ministers must be communicated to the L-G but his concurrence was not required, the five-judge bench headed by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ruled.The amendment introduced on Monday decisively tilts the balance of power in favour of the L-G. It bars the Delhi government from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rule made till this act comes into effect will be void, according to the bill. It further says that the Delhi assembly won’t be able to make rules for regulating, its procedure and the conduct of its business which are inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Parliament. According to the Centre, the amendments seek to clarify the expression of government in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court.“The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the legislative assembly and a council of ministers for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 44 of the act deals with conduct of business and there is no structural mechanism provided in the act for effective time bound implementation of said section. Further, there is no clarity as to what proposal or matters are required to be submitted to Lieutenant Governor before issuing order thereon,” the statement of objects and reasons stated.“It further seeks to ensure that the Lieutenant Governor is necessarily granted an opportunity to exercise the power entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of article 239AA of the Constitution, in select category of cases and also to make rules in matters which incidentally encroach upon matters falling outside the preview of the legislative assembly,” the statement added.The AAP government opposed these provisions. “The Bill says- 1. For Delhi, “Govt” will mean LG Then what will elected govt do? … 2. All files will go to LG. This is against 4.7.18 Constitution Bench judgement which said that files will not be sent to LG, elected govt will take all decisions and send copy of decision to LG,” Kejriwal said in another tweet. Sisodia said the BJP was trying to dilute elections and electoral mandate by using unconstitutional means to pass undemocratic laws. “This Bill will stall Delhi’s progress by giving undue powers to the L-G. All the decisions taken by the Delhi Government, for the growth of the city, have seen an intrusion by the L-G. Files regarding the progress of Mohalla Clinics, CCTV installations, free electricity, water and schools have collected dust in the L-G’s office, owing to lack of support from his office,” he said.The BJP rejected the charges and welcomed the amendment. “Public money is being wasted due to which Delhi is in a state of mess. No new development works have been initiated by this government. As Delhi continues to be a Union Territory, the L-G has the ultimate power. The Centre has only defined the powers more clearly,” said BJP and leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly RS Bidhuri.Lawyer Gautam Bhatia argued that the amendment violated the Supreme Court’s 2018 judgment. “Most of the provisions are specifically designed to nix the ongoing enquiry by the Delhi assembly into the 2020 riots...look at the proposed amendment to Section 33, which specifically bars the Delhi assembly from constituting committees to enquire into ‘the day-to-day affairs of the administration’, and makes it applicable with retrospective effect,” he said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-moves-to-cut-powers-of-delhi-govt-101615853974371.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A terrace under the semal||There are many beautiful terraces in Delhi, but this one might be the most beautiful of all—at least at this time of the year. When semal trees are still in bloom, and that their red flowers set alight every surface they fall upon.Kiran Bhushi’s second floor apartment lies right under the branches of a gigantic semal, in south Delhi’s Khel Gaon. And this evening the terrace is covered with semal’s pulpy flowers, dropping one after another.“The other day one fell on my friend’s wrist, and she said it hurts,” mutters Ms Bhushi. Wearing a peach-coloured tussar silk sari, she has just returned from work. A sociology professor, she reigns alone in this house. Almost alone, one must say. For her apartment is unofficially shared by Maharani, a neighbourhood cat who often chooses to lounge for long hours in Ms Bhushi’s apartment. Right now the cat is helping herself to her meal bowl in the terrace corner. It is impossible to read Maharani’s mind, but her behaviour suggests that she doesn’t care much for all the semals scattered about her.Mr Bhushi remarks that Rajrani, her part-time housekeeper, isn’t exactly fond of semal either. Her reasons are more practical, since she is in charge of cleaning the terrace. Besides, the flowers are slippery and you can fall and break a bone, warns Ms Bhushi. And the tree sheds a tad too many leaves.The professor now sits down on one of the three iron chairs arranged around an iron table—all littered with the fallen semals. Maharani too settles nearby. The chairs are green, and remarkably similar to the green metallic chairs of the famous Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, which are actually so iconic that their exact replicas are sold on Amazon. Ms Bhushi has indeed extensively travelled in France, but the fact that her chairs are similar to those of a Paris garden is completely unintentional. “I picked them from a footpath stall in Saket, and painted them pea-green during the lockdown.”As the semals continue to fall about her, one naturally wonders if the terrace will still be beautiful once their season ends.It will then have beauty of another kind, Ms Bhushi says. The terrace will have more colours—the yellow of the sunflowers, the saffron shade of nasturtiums, the pink of the bougainvillaeas and the white of petunias. “Most white flowers come in summer, and bloom at night, and then my terrace will be full of perfumes. I will sit down here in the darkness and watch moths sitting on these flowers… Jasmines will be blooming soon, too. Champas will also come.”And these semals will then not be missed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-terrace-under-the-semal-101615853318556.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Ariz Khan given death in Batla encounter case||A Delhi court on Monday handed the death penalty to alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorist Ariz Khan, accused of killing police officer Mohan Chand Sharma during the Batla House encounter of 2008, and said that his “despicable act has forfeited his right to live”.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav concluded “it is a rarest of the rare case where convict deserves maximum sentence provided under the law”.The court said that nature of offence and manner of committing the crime aroused extreme indignation to society. It stressed that the offence was not an ordinary act but a crime against the State, and that Khan, while committing the offence, acted like a dreaded and well-trained terrorist who did not deserve any leniency.“[The] convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live. After balancing mitigating circumstances against aggravating circumstances, it is concluded that it a rarest of the rare case where convict deserves maximum sentence provided under the law,” the court said in its order“It is the level of magnitude, decree of brutality, attitude and mindset of wrong doer behind the crime along with other factors which makes it a rarest of the rare case. Protection of society and deterring criminal is a vowed object of law and this is required to be achieved by imprisonment of appropriate sentence. The most appropriate sentence for convict like Ariz Khan @ Junaid @ Anna @ Salim will be death penalty.…,” it added.It imposed a fine of ₹11 lakh on Khan, while directing that ₹10 lakh be immediately released to the family of Special Cell officer Sharma, a celebrated officer who succumbed to injuries following the shoot-out on September 19, 2008. It also asked the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to look at granting more compensation to the family.The encounter took place days after serial blasts ripped through the Capital and killed at least 30 people. Acting on anti-terror igence, police stormed into a house in Batla House locality in Jamia Nagar looking for the alleged perpetrators. A bloody gunbattle followed in which two of Sharma’s colleagues were injured and two terrorists killed.But the encounter quickly became politicised with activists and some politicians alleging that the people killed were not terrorists but university students. Police also detained several residents, fuelling local discontent. Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said he believed the encounter was fake and in 2012, party leader Salman Khurshid said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi cried after she saw images of the encounter. Teachers and students of Jamia Millia Islamia organised protests and approached the Delhi high court, demanding a judicial probe. The National Human Rights Commission(NHRC) later conducted an inquiry on the direction of the Delhi high court and cleared Delhi Police.The court said that Khan indulged in the “abhorrent and brutal act” of firing on a police party without any provocation, and this showed he was “not only a threat to society but is also an enemy of the State”. It noted that Khan was also involved in blast cases in Delhi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh in which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured, and that this demonstrated he “continues to be a threat to the society and the nation”.On March 8, the court convicted Khan, 35, saying that he and his associates “intentionally” and “knowingly” committed murder of inspector Sharma. It held Khan guilty of murder, attempt to murder, obstructing public servant on duty, causing grievous hurt and non-appearance despite being declared as a proclaimed offender (PO). Khan was pronounced a PO in 2009 and arrested by the police in 2018 after being on the run for nearly a decade.The Batla House shoot-out took place days after five serial blasts in Delhi on September 13, 2008. Inspector Sharma of Special Cell got a tip-off about terrorists involved in the blasts hiding at flat No. 108, L-18, Batla House, Jamia Nagar. When Sharma with his raiding team reached the spot, a shoot-out broke out between the police and the alleged terrorists. Two of them — Mohammad Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid — were killed during the encounter, while Sharma was shot on his shoulder and abdomen. He succumbed to his injuries on February 19, 2008. Two of the terror suspects, Ariz Khan and Shahzad Ahmadm, managed to flee the spot . Ahmad was arrested on Jan 1, 2010, and handed a life sentenced in July 2013, Khan was arrested on February 14, 2018.Maya Sharma, wife of MC Sharma, said she wanted to thank the judiciary. “We have got a huge relief after 13 years. Finally, justice has been delivered after our 13 year-long struggle. The court has done justice to us. Until now, we were in a position of wait and watch,” she told PTI.The judge said that there was no evidence on record that Khan during investigation or trial showed any signs of reformation or repentance. “The convict eluded investigating agencies for almost ten years despite coercive process against him...There is no evidence on record that convict during investigation or trial showed any signs of...repentance,” the court said.Advocate MS Khan, Khan’s counsel, said that he would appeal against the judgment in a higher court. He said that it still remains a mystery as to whose bullet hit Sharma, and it is more surprising that on this basis, the court awarded the death sentence. He also contended that the judgment was based on assumptions.The BJP welcomed the verdict. “The people of the country today expect an apology from leaders of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party who all along called Batla House encounter a fake encounter, insulting the martyrdom of policemen killed in the encounter,” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said in a statement.Asked for his reaction on the verdict, Congress’s Digvijaya Singh said, “What do I say on that? Judiciary did its work.”Retired IPS officer, Karnal Singh, who was the JCP, special cell, Delhi Police at the time of the encounter, said the vedict “vindicates the stand of the special cell”. “(This) shows that the crime branch did an excellent job. The special cell also did an outstanding job in investigating the serial blast case and apprehending the IM terrorists. Of course, during the process, we lost our best inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who had done many operations against the terrorists. It was a great loss to the Delhi Police.” On questions raised on the shootout, he said, “It’s unfortunate that we do not have a national consensus on terrorism. People start speaking against the police officers without even verifying the facts...That was unfortunate.”Welcoming the verdict, former IPS officer Prakash Singh said, “I think it’s a matter of satisfaction because there was so much of controversy for political reasons. The lesson...is that people should not jump to conclusions and suspect the police version...It’s a good ending and a right message should go to the people who think that they can fire at policemen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ariz-khan-given-death-in-batla-encounter-case-101615843845460.html

The case was first registered with Kandivli police station and then transferred to the crime branch. The trial in the case is pending before the special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca) court for trial. Pujari’s gang members are already facing trial in the case. As per the prosecution, a Kandivli-based property consultant had approached the police, claiming that he had received threat calls from Pujari for taking up a redevelopment project of a housing society in Dindoshi. The crime branch sought Pujari’s custody for 20 days. Pujari’s lawyer DS Manerkar objected to the plea, claiming that his client cannot be remanded for these many days. The defence also pleaded that the police had already questioned Pujari since February 22 and hence, the officers had enough time to question him. After hearing the arguments, the special court remanded Pujari to police custody till Saturday. Pujari is already under arrest in connection with a 2016 firing case outside Gajalee Hotel in Vile Parle. On Monday, the special Mcoca court remanded him in judicial custody in the firing case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-police-s-crime-branch-arrests-gangster-ravi-pujari-for-extorting-property-consultant-101615837911449.html

A division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the petition of the minor’s father, was informed by his advocate Ashley Cusher that the girl weighed only 38 kilogrammes and was physically incapable of delivering the baby. Cusher further submitted that as the teen would be mentally and physically traumatised if the pregnancy was not terminated, the father’s plea be allowed under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. Based on the father’s plea, the court had asked the JJ hospital medical to examine the child. On Monday, government pleader Poornima Kantharia placed the report of the medical board before the court. The report, based on the opinion of four doctors, was unanimous in its conclusion that allowing the pregnancy to term or terminating it at an advanced stage of 32.4 weeks, had similar risks for the minor. The report stated that as terminating the pregnancy at this stage would require the mother and child to be kept in intensive care till they were fit for discharge, it would be better to continue the pregnancy to term. After perusing the report, the court held that it would go by the observation of the experts, and hence, did not permit the termination of the pregnancy. The bench also said it would like to know about the progress of the pregnancy and the condition of the minor after two weeks. Cusher then requested the court to make a note that in the event of the survivor or her child suffering any fatal consequences at the time of delivery, the DNA sample of the baby be preserved to ensure that the perpetrator of the heinous act could be nailed conclusively. The court, however, said that it would decide on the request in the next hearing after two weeks. The Govandi girl was raped by the family’s acquaintance, who had helped treat the ailment of her sibling. The man, taking advantage of the fact that the girl was alone in her house, raped her on two occasions seven-eight months ago. Though the minor had developed a bump, her mother had brushed it aside thinking it was flatulence. However, late in February, an elder from the locality advised her parents to take her to the hospital, following which the pregnancy came to light. Thereafter, a case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) was registered by Deonar police against the accused and he was arrested. The girl was handed over to the child welfare committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-rejects-13-year-old-rape-survivor-s-plea-to-terminate-advanced-pregnancy-101615837672766.html

Punjab Police had framed Verka in two ‘fake’ terror cases — one in 1992 and the another in 1998. He was acquitted in both cases in 2000 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, Verka had approached an Amritsar court seeking compensation for his ‘harassment’ and ‘torture in police custody’.The court of additional civil judge, senior division (ACJSD), Amritsar, in 2013, had “decreed” to the state government to pay ₹10 lakh compensation into the plaintiff’s account in three months. The compensation, however, was not released. Later, the court had attached the cars of the Punjab director general of police (DGP) and DC Amritsar to force the authorities to pay the compensation to Verka. The compensation amount was also enhanced by 6% annual interest to ₹14.85 lakh. On March 1, the court had ordered Amritsar district treasury officer (TO) Manjit Kaur to pay the compensation amount from the DC’s account. The court had also directed the TO to appear in person on March 15 in court, in case she fails to release the amount to the plaintiff. On Monday, the TO recorded her statement before the court putting the onus on the deputy commissioner, and said the amount can’t be released until a treasury bill in this regard is not signed by the DC. ACJSD Baljinder Singh then directed the DC to issue the treasury bill forthwith. Verka’s counsel Lalit Joshi had appeared in the court. Deputy commissioner Khaira said he had not received any such order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-orders-rs-15-lakh-relief-to-amritsar-man-acquitted-of-terror-charges-20-years-ago-101615837671419.html

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Around 4 lakh people already inoculated in J&K: DG family welfare||Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed around 1.24 lakh coronavirus cases and 1,974 deaths since the first case was detected in March. However, the vaccination drive in the Union territory is on track. Around 77% frontline workers have received vaccine jabs and 20 more centres have been setup across the UT. J&K’s director general family welfare, MCH and immunisation Dr Saleem-ur-Rehman speaks to HT’s Mir Ehsan about the UT’s progress. Excerpts:How many people have been vaccinated in J&K so far? Till March 14, a total 3,63,450 people have received their first dose of vaccination, of which 1,00,591 are healthcare workers. Around 76,964 healthcare workers have received the first dose (77%) and 28,732 have also received the second dose (29%) . Of 2,76,559 frontline workers, 1,98,655 received the first doze (72%) and 22,060 the second dose (8%). Among those aged above 60, as many as 81,064 have received the jab (7%). How is people’s response? Are people reluctant?So far, we have received a good response from people and in the coming days we will step up the drive. We initially started with 5,000 jabs and on Saturday (March 13) we inoculated 43,000 people. The percentage of second doses administered is also increasing. People can either get their second dose after six, eight or 12 weeks. Most people delay the second dose to bolster their immunity. At present, we are receiving an overwhelming response with many people enquiring about the address of vaccination centres. How many centres have been established in J&K for vaccination?We started with 250 vaccination sites that have been increased to 350. At present, we are running 772 sites across the UT. We increased the number of vaccination sites after we started administering the jabs to those above the age of 60. We do not want our senior citizens to face any problem while locating these centres. We have even established centres at far off places in different regions.Notably our wastage is far less than the national average. We have set up two control rooms in Jammu and Srinagar, apart from adverse effects post immunisation control rooms at every place. We have not seen any major adverse affect in J&K due to immunisation.Are people reluctant to get vaccinated?Whenever any new vaccination drive is started anywhere, initially people are always apprehensive. Here also people were afraid but once we launched this program, senior J&K health officers and heads of medical institutions were first to get vaccination. We also launched a social media campaign. Around 4 lakh people have been vaccinated and not a single case of death has been reported. Is there a dearth of vaccines?In the coming days or weeks we will require more vaccines. The government has promised us an adequate stock as the number of people showing up to get vaccinated is increasing by the day. We are prepared to meet any target. We have an adequate supply of vaccines in all districts. The Centre has asked us not to stock any vaccine as an adequate supply will be sent to us.Will increased vaccination bring down the Covid count? Yes, it will help bring down the numbers. In J&K, the disease is well under control but people and officials will have to be vigilant, especially about travellers. We should devise a mechanism that will help us prevent the entry of new strains of virus in the UT. So far, our health system and administration has remained successful in bringing down the numbers from what they were around three to four months ago. Are Covid cases rising in J&K?At present, we do not have any evidence that suggests that cases are rising in the UT. Even hospitals meant for Covid patients have vacant spaces. We are closely monitoring the data and testing travellers to ensure the new strains do not enter our UT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/around-4-lakh-people-already-inoculated-in-j-k-dg-family-welfare-101615837374139.html

The school’s authorities, however, claimed that the possession was cancelled due to some vested interests. On Monday when the LIT officials reached the spot to take possession of the land, the school’s management and teachers tried to lock themselves up inside the rooms to stop the staff from sealing the campus. A police team from PAU police station, led by station house officer Jaskanwal Singh Sekhon, had to use force to pull the staff members out of the premises before sealing the property. The LIT has given the management 10 days to clear the residential portion of the site to avoid further action.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said, “We had received a complaint earlier about the misuse of the land allotted for running the school. During inspection last year, it was found that the school was not being run at the allotted site. Further, we found that the management had also failed to clear the dues following which the matter was taken up with the government through a resolution approved by the LIT. The government then cancelled the allotment in view of the discrepancies.” Meanwhile, the school management claimed that over 200 students study in the school and by sealing the campus, the LIT was pushing their future into the dark. Allottee Narinder Kumar and principal Rohan Sharma said they had all necessary documents but the LIT had been stopping them from paying the dues. They added that the building plan was also approved by the LIT. Sharma said, “The action was taken due to some vested interests even when a case regarding the same is sub-judice in the court. Over 200 students study in the school and after this action, their future is in the dark.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-improvement-trust-takes-possession-of-school-land-amid-staff-resistance-101615837372962.html
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||HC restrains Sangrur admn from electing Lehragaga MC president||The Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained the Sangrur district administration from convening a meeting for the election to the office of president, municipal council, Lehragaga.The high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Parkash acted on the plea of Surinder Singh and Surinder Kaur, two independent candidates for MC polls, and sought response by March 17. They claimed in the court that they had defeated Congress candidates from their respective wards and results too were announced, but subsequently, the certificates of winners were not handed over to them and after allegedly fudging the poll records, Congress candidates were declared as winners.They have blamed then ex officio returning officer and SDM Jivan Jot Kaur for alleged fabrication of records. The officer waylaid the entire process of fabrication as after declaring the petitioners as winners, she forged and fabricated the form number- 35, the court was told, adding eight independents and seven from the ruling Congress won on the total 15 seats. It is because of this that record was “fudged”, their counsel DS Sobti told court. Voting for the MC took place on February 14 and counting was held on February 17.The plea says an inquiry was conducted by an IAS officer, Sanjay Popli, into the complaint made by the petitioners, who gave a detailed report to chief election commissioner. The report shows that entire process was sabotaged only to “please” the political bosses. The officer not only abused her power but exceeded her jurisdiction in criminal conspiracy with tehsildar and naib tehsildar, it has been alleged, further submitting that the state election commissioner has already written a letter to the government to immediately suspend Kaur as she has been found “guilty” in the report. However, no action has been taken so far. The plea demands direction to declare result as per “actual counting” record and “ignore the forged record” and action against the returning officer. It also says either EVMs be moved out of Punjab or be placed in the security cover of the CISF or CRPF. It was also demanded that election to the post of president not be held on the basis of result declared by the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-sangrur-admn-from-electing-lehragaga-mc-president-101615837251394.html

The party has put up hoardings in Gujarati in Ghatkopar, extolling the community members to join the MNS party. The campaign is the brainchild of party’s Cine Workers’ Association office bearer Bharat Bhanushali, who has taken the initiative in Ghatkopar’s Pant Nagar area. Defending the move, Ameya Khopkar, the cine association’s head, said it was imperative to attract the Gujarati community members. “Bhanushali is a Gujarati who lives in an area dominated by the community. He has campaigned in Gujarati to attract the community members to our party fold. I don’t think there is anything wrong with this,” said Khopkar. When Khopkar was asked about party members ransacking shops having Gujarati signboards, he said MNS continues to oppose them. “We are firm on having Marathi signboards, but this is about the party’s enrolment drive,” said Khopkar. Thackeray had objected to Gujarati signboards posted outside hotels on highways during his Gudi Padwa speech in 2018. Following this, MNS workers had vandalised signboards of at least six hotels in Vasai, as they were in Gujarati. The incident had sent shockwaves among the community members. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Hemraj Shah, who had launched party’s ‘Mumbai ma jalebi fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda’ campaign to woo Gujarati voters, said that the community members “will not fall prey to MNS”. “On the one hand they hate Gujaratis and spare no opportunity to hurt them, and on the other, indulge in such campaigns. Our community will never support MNS,” said Shah. Currently, Gujaratis play an important role in the politics of Mumbai, and enjoy substantial numbers in areas such as Ghatkopar, Walkeshwar, Borivli, Kandivli, Mulund and Goregaon. They are strong supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and hence, the Congress, Sena and MNS are trying to woo them to their fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mns-puts-up-hoardings-in-gujarati-to-woo-community-in-mumbai-101615837134143.html

The varsity reported 15 fresh cases Monday. The first case on the campus was reported on Friday. The university reopened on February 1.The state health department has declared three more hostels as micro-containment zones and sealed hostels for at least 10 days. Earlier, two of the hostels were declared containment zones. Civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said the cases are reported in boys’ hostels only. “We are collecting samples from all hostels and taking all precautionary measures to curtail further spread of the virus. Those who have been tested positive are asymptomatic,” he said. It appears that no social distancing norms and mask wearing guidelines were adhered to in the hostels, which led to outbreak, said the civil surgeon. Over 2,500 students from nine hostels are expected to be covered under sampling process initiated by the health department. Dr Singh said no student has been hospitalized as yet. Registrar Gurbinder Singh said they are cooperating with the health officials and adhering to their protocol. “We have completely cordoned off nine hostels and have moved positive students to a special isolation hostel setup by the varsity. These students are provided special care and meals are provided at their rooms only,” he said. He added that other students have been put under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the hostel premises till further clearance from health department.

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Primary schools reopen in Kashmir after a year||Primary schools reopened in Kashmir on Monday, a year after being closed due to the pandemic.Students from Nursery to Class 5 started attending schools in a staggered manner in order to adhere to social distancing norms and avoid crowding. The students and teachers wore masks and used hand sanitisers. “My son was delighted to go to school today. See-saws and slides have suddenly came back to life in schools,” said Mohammad Asif, the parent of a Class-4 student in north Kashmir.While many parents have decided to send their wards to school but there is a general anxiety among parents as well as teachers.“My son told me that they were not allowed to eat anything at school. They were not even allowed to talk freely with each other. The teachers often advised students to sanitise their hands,” said Nayeema, the parent of a Class-1 student in Srinagar.Saqib Ahmad, a primary school teacher of a government school in Srinagar, said that they have divided each class in two to teach in shifts during the day .“Our students have missed out in 2019 and 2020. Schools have hardly opened for the past two years- first owing to the situation (following abrogation of article 370) and then due to pandemic in 2020. We will have to innovate ways to resume their education,” he said.The government had deferred the opening of primary classes till March 15 after a number of schools reported positive Covid cases, following opening of schools for students of Classes 9 to 12 classes from March 1 and for students of Class 6 to 8 from March 8. The colleges opened on February 15 across the UT.In March 2020, the government of Jammu and Kashmir had ordered closure of all academic institutions, including schools, colleges and universities, across the Union Territory in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak.Most schools have divided the number of students into two and asked the parents to send their wards on alternate days. Some schools have also decided to teach in two shifts during the day to divide the class strength by half. Some schools have not yet opened primary classes. Rafiq Rather, chairperson of Teachers’ Forum, said government schools should get funds for sanitisers and masks. “Many primary government schools are overcrowded owing to lack of accommodation. The schools should also get funds for sanitisers. There should also be frequent medical checkups,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/primary-schools-reopen-in-kashmir-after-a-year-101615836951291.html
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||6th finance panel to examine state’s fiscal health, suggest framework for restoration||ChandigarhThe 6th Punjab Finance Commission, which expressed concern over non-release of funds and shortfall in compensatory payments by successive governments to local bodies in Punjab in the past decade, has decided to examine the economic and financial health of the state and provide a broad framework for a medium-term fiscal consolidation programme. The commission, headed by former chief secretary KR Lakhanpal, will look at augmenting the Consolidated Fund of the state, outcomes of 15th Union Finance Commission (UFC) and 6th Punjab Pay Commission (PPC), effect of Covid-19, impacts of urbanisation, growth and structural transformation of Punjab economic on the state finances, according to its interim report on devolution of funds to local bodies in financial year 2021-22. These structural issues will be addressed by the commission in its final report for financial years 2021-22 to 2025-26 in addition to making recommendations on the principles governing devolution of funds panchayats and municipalities, determination of the taxes, duties, tolls and fees to be assigned to or apportioned, grants-in-aid from the Consolidated Fund and measures needed to improve the financial of local bodies. The final report is to be submitted by December 31, 2021. Financial crisis Pointing out the deep financial crisis in the state, the commission said the worsening fiscal position has seriously eroded the government’s capacity to invest in infrastructure, education and skill development and public health and nutrition, which underpin the future growth of the state. The commission said it can provide a broad framework the way forward and it is for the state government to flesh out the details. “Without fully factoring in the outcomes of recommendations of the 15th UFC, 6th PPC and fiscal shocks due to Covid-19 on the state finances addressing certain structural an important bearing on the PRIs (panchayati raj institutions) and ULBs (urban local bodies) evolving into self-governing entities, mere transferring financial resources to them from the state government will of little avail,” according to the report tabled in the state assembly last week. The way forward Lakhanpal said the shrinking size of the pie is the real problem and calls for pressing in hard budget options. “These structural issues needed to be attended to on priority. We are not saying these should be addressed overnight or over five years, but directionally we should move towards resolving them. The doability or political expediency of it is the decision of political executive,” he said. The decision to factor in the impact of Covid-19, pay commission report and the decision of the central government on recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission on the Consolidated Fund of the state was taken in a meeting Lakhanpal and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh three months ago. Another decision in the meeting, according to the interim report, was to amend the terms of reference (ToR) of the committee accordingly. However, a senior official said the terms of reference of a State Finance Commission and the Central Finance Commission are given in the Constitution itself. “Their domain is very well defined and cannot be altered by the state government. If it wants to comment upon the fiscal position of the state, it is not within its purview. This has been communicated to the commission in writing,” said the official. In a meeting on January 11, special secretary, expenditure, Abhinav Trikha, also told the commission that there appears to be no need to amend the existing structural issues, barring a few, are covered by the existing ToR. Structural issues to be addressed in final report -Augmenting the consolidated fund of the state -Outcomes of 15th Central Finance Commission, 6th Pay Commission and effect of Covid-19 on state finances-Impacts of urbanisation, growth and structural transformation of Punjab economy on state finances -Statutory mechanism for implementing its recommendations and compensatory payments to ULBs -Identification of new revenue handles, raising and rationalisation of user charges and unproductive expenditure of local bodies -Unlocking the capital/wealth (land, buildings, etc) within local bodies-Exploring possibility of establishing metropolitan areas in or around cities having more than 5 lakh population||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6th-finance-panel-to-examine-state-s-fiscal-health-suggest-framework-for-restoration-101615836891353.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Sachin Vaze’s Shiv Sena connection||While the Opposition claims that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was not keen on acting against Sachin Vaze, the Mumbai Police officer suspended on Monday after his arrest by the National Investigation Agency in connection with the security scare at Mukesh Ambani’s home, Antilia, the cop was never an active member of the party he joined in 2008, according to insiders. Vaze, a 1990-batch officer of the state cadre, was known as one of Mumbai Police’s ace sharpshooters and is said to have killed 63 persons in his career. He was suspended from the police force in 2004 in connection with the murder and destruction of evidence in the Khwaja Yunus custodial death case. He made repeated attempts to get reinstated between 2005 and 2007, but did not succeed. He resigned from the force, but that too was not accepted. The following year, in 2008, he joined the Shiv Sena. Party insiders said his entry into the party was not surprising as Vaze and other police officers who gunned down gangsters in Mumbai were often appreciated by Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. Vaze earlier said he had joined the party with the backing of Sena leader Eknath Shinde, a leader from Thane district. “Vaze was never an active member of the party. He took the primary membership in 2008, but never renewed it and therefore it expires automatically,” said a senior party functionary, requesting anonymity. However, Vaze never formally resigned from the party. Vaze and other “encounter specialists” like Pradeep Sharma, Praful Bhosale, Daya Nayak, Vijay Salaskar gained prominence in the force during the Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government between 1995 and 1999. “These sharpshooters grew under the Sena government. Balasaheb appreciated these people, sometimes through his editorials, and in private as well,” another functionary said requesting anonymity. Vaze’s reinstatement into the police force happened in June 2020, months after Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray took charge as the chief minister. The opposition BJP has been targeting the Shiv Sena over the entire episode. Sena leader Sanjay Raut has been defending the police officer by calling him a “capable” and “honest” cop. Last week, Thackeray said the Opposition was painting him out to be “Osama Bin Laden”. The party functionaries and leaders who spoke to HT maintained the party has no link with Vaze and if he was found to be involved in any wrongdoing by the anti-terrorism squad, which was probing the case before the NIA took over, the government wouldn’t have protected him. BJP leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, however, said in Pune on Sunday that the unwarranted support and trust by the state government led Vaze to think he could do anything and so he allegedly planned and executed the scare near Antilia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sachin-vaze-s-shiv-sena-connection-101615836711194.html

Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced a new list of 87 members of the working committee. There are 101 members in the working committee and the vacant positions will be filled soon. According to the Akali top brass, party’s patriarch Parkash Singh Badal and five-time chief minister, will continue to be at the top of the hierarchy as patron. In Harsimrat’s nomination, party sees an opportunity to rehabilitate her after she had resigned from the Narendra Modi cabinet last year as a mark of protest against the three farm bills. Her resignation coincided with the party’s decision to cut four-decade ties with the BJP. In the recast, many new faces have been inducted, including Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and SAD’s Delhi wing president Harmeet Singh Kalka. Both were inducted to keep party’s flock together keeping in mind the DSGMC polls expected to take place later this year. In the list of office-bearers announced a few days ago, party’s old-timer and Badals’ confidante Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhundar has been given a pivotal role as secretary general. He replaced Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who resigned from the party’s second senior-most post after the incidents of sacrilege of the holy scriptures. He had formed a separate Akali faction SAD (Democratic). “The core committee that often meets at short notices to take decision and ponder on key issues concerning the party has members chosen from the working committee,” said party senior vice-president and spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur, its former presidents Kirpal Singh Badungar and Gobind Singh Longowal also figured on the list. The party has tried to strike a balance of region, caste and age in the recast done after a gap of five years.

16-03-2021||Other||Sachin Vaze’s kin moves Bombay HC, says ex-cop’s arrest by NIA is illegal||Sudharm Vaze, the brother of suspended Mumbai Police assistant inspector Sachin Vaze, has moved a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court (HC), claiming that the former cop’s arrest by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 was illegal and unlawful. Sudharm’s petition stated that though Sachin Vaze had cooperated with the central agency, he had been detained without following the due procedure established by law, and hence, he should be brought before HC, and NIA should justify the detention. The petition filed through advocate Sunny Punnamiya has averred that Sachin Vaze has been an upright and law-abiding officer working with the Mumbai Police for 17 years but was made a scape goat by some political powers, based on the allegations of Vimla Hiran, the wife of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran who was found dead in a Mumbra creek on March 5. Following the discovery of Hiran’s body, his Vimla had approached the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was investigating the case of the explosive-laden car found outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiran. Vimla told ATS that she suspected that her husband was murdered. After a case of murder was registered against unknown persons, Vimla started spreading false and baseless allegations against Sachin Vaze, the petition by Sudharm alleged. It further stated that NIA also registered a first information report (FIR) against unknown persons the very next day. In his petition, Sudharm claimed that due to Vimla’s allegations, Vaze anticipated his arrest and hence approached the sessions court for anticipatory bail, but it was rejected on March 12. The next day, Vaze was called for interrogation by NIA, which he duly obliged to, though he was not served a notice under section 41 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Sudharm further claimed that during the interrogation, his brother cooperated with NIA investigators, and gave them all the corroborative pieces of evidences. Yet, following 10 hours of interrogation, Vaze was arrested without being served a copy of FIR or informed of the nature of allegations against him. He was also not allowed to speak to his lawyers or family which was a violation of his fundamental rights, claimed the petition. The plea further stated that just before his arrest, Vaze had sent a WhatsApp message to his family, in which he had mentioned that he may be trapped by his fellow officers, and that he may not survive the ordeal. “The haste in which the petitioner’s brother was arrested, clearly shows some ulterior motives and huge political influence and interference with the sole intent to use the petitioner’s brother as a scapegoat to further certain political agendas of some big interested parties. The petitioner’s fundamental rights have been severely violated and the petitioner fears for his brother’s life and limb, as the respondent officers can go to any extent to extract an illegal and false confession from the petitioner’s brother,” the petition further stated. In light of these averments and the fact that proper procedure was not followed by NIA officers while detaining and arresting Vaze, the petition prays for directions to NIA to produce his brother before the court and justify his detention in accordance with the procedure established by law, and after hearing the parties, to set him free. According to Punnamiya, the petition has been numbered, and will be mentioned before the appropriate bench on Tuesday for an early hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sachin-vaze-s-kin-moves-bombay-hc-says-ex-cop-s-arrest-by-nia-is-illegal-101615836291169.html
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||Criminal cases against cops: HC issues show-cause notice to Punjab home secretary on perjury proceedings||The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued a show-cause notice to additional chief secretary, home, Punjab, Anurag Aggarwal why perjury proceedings should not be initiated against him. The order was passed in a matter in which high court had sought information regarding criminal cases against cops. The concealment about FIRs had come light in the hearing of a plea in December from Moga resident Surjit Singh, who had challenged his dismissal from service, due to pending FIRs. During proceedings of the case, it has come to light that at least 107 convicted cops, including SPs, DSPs, inspectors, and 840 facing serious criminal charges are still serving in Punjab Police. An affidavit was filed by Vijay Singh Chauhan, deputy secretary, department of home affairs and justice, Punjab, on October 8 disclosing the names of officers, who were facing criminal cases. However, petitioner’s counsel Balbir Saini contended that the entire information has not been disclosed. On October 28, the court sought an affidavit from Aggarwal. He filed an affidavit on December 10, but on allegations of discrepancies in the same, the court on January 14, asked him to personally look into the matter to ascertain factual aspects. On February 1 this year, he filed an affidavit admitting of wrong information in the December 10 affidavit. The high court bench of justice Anupinder Singh Grewal observed that it is apparent that the information, as sought by the court, was not forthcoming. Aggarwal should have taken due care and caution as it is expected from the administrative head of the department to disclose the entire information as had been sought by the court, the bench said, adding that concealment or not disclosing the information sought, amounts to swearing a false affidavit. “The filing of false affidavit has the tendency to subvert, obstruct, impede and interfere in the due course of judicial proceedings, which cannot be overlooked especially when the affidavit has been filed by a senior government officer,” the bench observed, adding that besides the contempt of court, such an act would amount to giving false evidence to court. Before directing institution of a criminal complaint before the competent judicial magistrate for the prosecution of the officer for perjury, I deem it appropriate to issue him notice, the bench added seeking his response within four weeks as to why directions be not issued for filing a complaint with the judicial magistrate for the offence of perjury. Questions how PPS posted as SSPs Giving an example, the bench said that Rajinder Singh Sohal, convicted in a criminal case has been posted as the SSP of Gurdaspur. He is a PPS officer and has been posted as Gurdaspur SSP, which is an IPS-cadre post. The continuation of such an officer at the post of the SSP, who is the district head of the police force, would erode the confidence of the people in the police administration apart from being an affront to the rule of law. Therefore, the competent authority should consider transferring him from the post, the bench said. It observed that there are several other PPS officers, who have been posted as SSPs of various districts in violation of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954. Impleading Centre as a party to look into these apparent violations, the court further said that it is apparent that there is arbitrariness in dealing with officers facing criminal cases. “In our system of governance administered by rule of law, the government cannot act like an absolute despot at its whims and fancies by patronising certain officers while imparting a step-motherly treatment to others,” it said, adding that the need of the hour to put in place a proper structure. Now, the government has been asked to file an affidavit by the next date to explain as to why PPS officers have been posted as SSPs of several districts. The bench also asked that government committee, which is in the process of framing a policy on action to be taken against cops with criminal cases/ convicted, would come up with a uniform policy while keeping in mind gravity and nature of the offence. The court has directed that till the committee arrives at a decision and considers the individual cases of the officers, no police officer who is charge-sheeted or convicted in a criminal case involving moral turpitude, shall remain posted at a post having public dealing. They shall not be assigned investigation, either as investigating officer or in a supervisory capacity and will not be posted in the vigilance bureau till the final decision is taken by the committee. They shall also not be posted in the district where their criminal case is being tried, the bench said seeking status report by April 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/criminal-cases-against-cops-hc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-punjab-home-secretary-on-perjury-proceedings-101615836231416.html

As soon as the CM started to reply to the debate, leader of opposition Mukesh Agrihotri asked him to reduce VAT rates on petrol and diesel. “The leader of opposition said the chief minister is also silent on the issue of inflation. There is no clarity regarding the implementation of the sixth pay commission.” Later, members of the Congress staged a walkout. The CM completed his response in absence of the Opposition.Thakur blamed the previous Congress government for fiscal mismanagement. “Our government has inherited a debt burden of ₹50,000 crore from the previous regime. Had the previous government had not taken this loan, the present government would not have needed to do so either. This government has raised loans within the limits set by the Reserve Bank of India.Taking a dig at the Opposition, he said financial mismanagement by the previous government had resulted in the ever deteriorating fiscal health of the state. The government has made provisions in the budget for the unemployed, employees and the poor. In his speech, he flayed the Opposition for using inappropriate words while mentioning names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur presented the budget for the upcoming financial year 2021-22 on March 6 in the state assembly. The budget was discussed from March 8 and 34 members of the Opposition participated in the discussionEarlier, the CM had introduced the Himachal Pradesh Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Amendment Bill in the House. After the passage of the amendment bill, the government can take loans up to 5% of state’s gross domestic product. Currently, this loan limit is 3%. Members of the Opposition criticised the amendment saying the government was going to increase the right to borrow after the amendment. Leader of the Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri and Communist Party of India (CPI) MLA Rakesh Singha opposed the amendment to the FRBM Act.Even before the CM had introduced the amendment bill in the House, leader of opposition Mukesh Agrihotri questioned the intentions of the government. He said that the ease with which the CM was introducing the bill is not really the case. He said it did not bode well that the limit for taking loans was being increased by 3-5%. He said the government was continuously taking loans, due to which the financial situation of the state was deteriorating. He demanded that the CM to withdraw the Bill immediately, instead of promulgating it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachals-budget-session-opposition-stages-walkout-101615836171119.html

The SIT also said the final supplementary chargesheet in the Behbal Kalan firing cases will be filed in the Faridkot court soon. SIT member and inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh said nine chargesheets have been submitted in the court in both the cases. One more chargesheet will be filed soon. “I have completed the responsibility which was given to me. I have submitted everything in the court and whatever is left will be filed soon as investigation has been completed,” he said. On one of the chargesheets wherein it was mentioned that the role of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal were under investigation, the SIT member said: “I will not name anyone. I want to make it clear that in the chargesheets, we have identified the roles of all persons involved in these incidents. You can see their (Badals) roles are identified in the first chargesheet, which was filed on May 27, 2019. But one chargesheet is yet to be filed in the court,” he said. “Genesis of police firing cases was sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari, so these cases are interlinked. Our team has worked so hard, there were attempts that this investigation should not conclude,” he added. On former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini, Kunwar Vijay said that SIT had interrogated him and he had been granted blanket bails by court. “He was summoned and interrogated in Chandigarh. We started the investigation on October 12, 2018, but he was granted blanket bail on October 11, 2018, before we started our investigation,” he said. When asked about the victim families’ allegation that the government was not perusing the cases properly, he said: “I don’t want to make any comments on their blames, but I want to tell you that I am also not getting the required support.” The Punjab Police teams had opened fire at the people protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura in Faridkot district on October 14, 2015. Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village had died in police firing at Behbal Kalan.

16-03-2021||Chandigarh||37 gangsters shifted to ‘dead zone’ Bathinda jail, no mobile signal for 2km||The Punjab jails department has shifted at least 37 dreaded gangsters to Central Jail, Bathinda, where a special ‘dead zone’ has been created. In this dead zone, there is no mobile connectivity, in a 2km radius. All communication from the Central Jail by the staff or prisoners (facility available at a fixed time) will be through landline. Seven ‘A’ category dreaded gangsters have been brought here over the past week, including Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, Neeta Deol and Dilpreet Baba. Six more gangsters will be brought here over the next two days.The Punjab government, vide a notification that additional chief secretary (home) issued on March 10, has already notified a radius of 2km from the walls of the Bathinda Central Jail as a dead zone. All telecom service providers have been sent this notice, asking these to stop all type of services in the notified area under Rule 2 of Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety), Rules, 2017. The Special Task Force (STF) had mooted the idea of a creating a dead zone, by writing a letter to the prisons department in December last year. Why was the need felt? For the prisons department, controlling the operations of gangsters and other criminals through mobile phones from inside jails had become a major headache. There was a proposal to install jammers inside jails as well, but the government rejected it, citing its low efficacy. The STF letter to the prisons department states that there has been numerous instances of misuse of mobile phones and smart phones by inmates to manage, plan, abet, conspire and assist in drug trafficking, cross-border trafficking of narcotics, smuggling of weapons, gang-related crime, extortion, murder and planning jail breaks. “Many inmates involved in the these serious offences have been using mobile communication within jail premises to threaten and glorify themselves and their gangs. Some of the gangsters even claim responsibility for heinous crimes on various social media platforms,” suggested the STF. Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Randhawa said the Bathinda Central Jail which will now be a dead zone, will not have any option of mobile network, and if there will not no network, use of mobiles will end. “Hardcore criminals will be shifted to 43 barracks in the jail and will be kept alone. These barricades will be guarded by the Central Reserve Police Force Battalions leaving, no scope of mingling of criminals with any ordinary guard,” said Randhawa, claiming that Punjab is the first state in the country to try this kind of experiment. “Bathinda jail is located away from any major population area. Thus, it can easily be converted into a dead zone,” an STF official behind the proposal said. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&STRAP/BLURBFor the prisons department, controlling the operations of gangsters and other criminals through mobile phones from inside jails had become a major headache||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/37-gangsters-shifted-to-dead-zone-bathinda-jail-no-mobile-signal-for-2km-101615835751142.html
16-03-2021||Other||Khwaja Yunus case: Sachin Vaze’s role remains untried in court||The trial against four policemen including suspended cop Sachin Vaze, implicated in the alleged custodial death Sayed Khwaja Yunus Sayed Ayub, a 2002 Ghatkopar blast accused, has been held up since 2018, shortly after it began, for the want of a special public prosecutor. Vaze and three constables were suspended from the police force in 2004 after they were arrested in connection with the death of the 27-year-old engineer in January 2003. The police, who had picked up Yunus in connection with the terror attack, claimed that Yunus had escaped while being transported to another district from Mumbai and had fallen into a gorge. However, an eyewitness later revealed that Yunus was allegedly beaten to death during interrogation. Yunus’s body was never recovered. In 2018, the eyewitness, Dr Abdul Mateen – also a suspect in the Ghatkopar blast case -- named four more policemen in the alleged custodial killing, which led special public prosecutor Dhiraj Mirazkar to move an application to include the cops in the list of accused. The state issued a notice removing Mirazkar as the special public prosecutor stating that he filed the application without seeking instructions. Mirazkar was unavailable for comments despite attempts to get in touch with him. “The case is now pending over the issue of the appointment or rather removal of the special public prosecutor,” said Vaze’s lawyer Raunak Naik. The Crime Investigation Department (CID) filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Vaze and three other policemen – constables Rajendra Tiwari, Sunil Desai and driver Rajaram Nikam – in 2004 for allegedly beating Yunus to death while he was in custody. History of the case On December 2, 2002, a bomb went off in a BEST bus parked outside Ghatkopar railway station, during the evening rush hour, killing two and injuring over 50 people. The Mumbai crime branch, of which Vaze was part, picked up a few persons including Yunus on December 25. On January 7, 2003, Yunus was reported missing from police custody. The police claimed that he escaped with two other accused while they were being taken to Aurangabad when the vehicle carrying them met with an accident in Ahmednagar district. An FIR was registered in connection with the incident at the Parner police station.However, during an enquiry into the so-called accident conducted by the special Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) court in Mumbai, Mateen, who was also one of the accused, revealed that he had heard Yunus being beaten, and later vomiting, in an adjacent cell. Mateen claimed that Yunus had likely died on January 6. This testimony was corroborated by a third accused in the case. The alleged custodial death case was handed over to the CID in May 2003. However, after seven months of no information, Yunus’s father Sayed Khwaja Ayub moved the Bombay high court requesting that the Central Bureau of Investigation probe the disappearance of his son. On February 25, 2004, the CID team said that they had found some evidence in connection to Yunus’s disappearance and arrested Vaze on March 3. The other three policemen were arrested later that month. All four were placed under suspension, pending investigation.In April, the high court directed the CID to record a fresh statement from Mateen and treat that as the FIR in the alleged custodial death case. The state appealed against this direction in the Supreme Court and lost, and eventually, a fresh FIR was registered in the Ghatkopar police station on September 16, 2004. The CID completed its probe in October 2006 and filed a charge sheet against 14 policemen, including the four suspended cops. In July 2007, the office of the Director General of Police forwarded the case papers to the state government, which accorded sanction to prosecute only the four suspended cops. An additional sessions judge framed charges against Vaze, Tiwari, Desai and Nikam, on March 19, 2011. In the meantime, Yunus’s mother, Asiya Begum, amended her petition pending before the Bombay HC for compensation and other connected prayers, and sought sanction to prosecute seven more Crime Branch personnel, in addition to the four suspended cops.In April 2012, the HC directed the state to pay Yunus’s family a compensation of ₹20 lakh, but rejected Begum’s plea regarding the prosecution of more policemen. Begum appealed against this verdict in the Supreme Court, and the matter is still pending before the apex court. Yunus’s brother, Hussain Sayed Khwaja Ayub Yunus said that their petition has not come up as yet. “It has not even been heard. We unfortunately do not have means to appoint a special lawyer for the Supreme Court. It is like justice delayed and justice denied.” Meanwhile, of the 19 persons arrested in connection with the Ghatkopar blast case, nine were discharged from the case and two, including Khwaja, died. On June 11, 2005, the special POTA court acquitted the remaining eight accused. The trial in Yunus’s death In January 2018, the prosecution examined Mateen, its first witness in the case.“After Mateen, no other witness has been examined,” advocate Naik said. In his deposition, Mateen named four cops who had also allegedly assaulted Yunus, and whose names were also part of the charge sheet filed by the CID in 2006: Praful Bhosle, Hemant Desai, Rajaram Vhanmane and Ashok Khot. On the basis of this testimony, special public prosecutor Mirazkar moved an application to add these four policemen in the list of accused and to try them alongside Vaze and the three constables. A controversy erupted over this with the state government claiming that the application was filed without taking instructions. The state issued a notification removing Mirzkar as the special public prosecutor. Yunus’s mother challenged the state’s notification in the Bombay high court. Meanwhile, in 2016, Vaze filed a petition before the HC challenging the framing of charges against him. Vaze resigned from the force in 2007 and joined the Shiv Sena, but he – and the three other suspended constables -- were reinstated in January 2020. Asiya Begum’s fight continues Asiya Begum filed a petition in the Bombay high court challenging their reinstatement last year. She claimed that the review committee which included chief secretary Amitabh Gupta and Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh did not have the authority to set aside the 2004 suspension order and hence the reinstatement order should be set aside. The state argued that the petitioner did not have a locus as the reinstatement order was an administrative decision. The petition had also stated that while the trial against the four suspended cops was pending, the review committee could not have issued orders to reinstate them. The petition was last heard on March 9, 2021 by a division bench of justices K K Tated and Riyaz Chagla. The hearing was adjourned to March 31 as Begum’s advocate Mihir Desai sought time to place the translated copies of official documents before the court. Yunus’ family reacts to Vaze’s arrest “Upar wale ke paas der hain, par andher nahi [there may be delay but not injustice in the house of God],” Hussain Sayed Khwaja Ayub Yunus, Khwaja Yunus’s brother said, after assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze was suspended on Monday, following his arrest by the National Investigation Authority, in connection with the explosives-laden car found outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s home last month. “If he had not be reinstated this would not have happened,” Hussain, 53, added. Yunus’s family has been fighting a long battle for justice since his custodial death in 2003, in which Vaze and three other cops were arrested and suspended. The first petition was filed by his father Sayyed Khwaja Ayub in 2004, before the Bombay high court. After Ayub died in 2004, Yunus’s mother Asiya Begum took the fight further. “I lost my father. Mother is almost 75 years now. It has been close to 20 years and still we don’t see any hope in case. When will this be over?” Hussain said referring to the trial against the four policemen implicated in his brother’s death. “The trial had just begun when they removed special public prosecutor and now there is none. When will the trial see the light of the day? We just want justice,” Hussain said. “We unfortunately do not have means to appoint a special lawyer for Supreme Court. It is like justice delayed and justice denied,” Hussain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khwaja-yunus-case-sachin-vaze-s-role-remains-untried-in-court-101615835631248.html

16-03-2021||Other||Sachin Vaze case: Sena’s Varun Sardesai to sue Nitesh Rane for defamation||Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Nitesh Rane has claimed that Yuva Sena leader Varun Sardesai has allegedly demanded a ‘share in extortion’ from former police officer Sachin Vaze. Sardesai is the nephew of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi. Sardesai has refuted all the allegations against him and said he would file a criminal defamation case against Rane. Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 in connection with the alleged conspiracy to plant an explosive-laden sports utility vehicle near the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani last month. Calling for an inquiry against Sardesai, Rane said that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) should check the call records and WhatsApp chats between Sardesai and Vaze, as it will disclose the Sena leader’s “role” in the case. In a press conference on Monday, Rane said that Vaze demanded an extortion amount of ₹150 crore from the bookies who were active during the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament between September and November last year. “Sardesai contacted Vaze several times and demanded a share in the extortion money which the officer was collecting from the bookies. Vaze had threatened the bookies, who were operating from various hotels or flats, of action if they did not pay him. The total amount demanded by Vaze was ₹150 crore. I demand that NIA should interrogate Sardesai and probe the call records between him and Vaze. It will help the officers reach more details of the case that they are probing.” Rane also alleged that CM has been shielding Vaze because of the former police officer’s links with his family members. The BJP legislator said that NIA has caught hold of the telegram chats between Vaze and a Shiv Sena leader from the western suburbs. “Vaze had met the leader on Saturday morning, hours before his arrest by NIA and discussed the case against him,” Rane said. Hitting back at Rane, Sardesai said that that he came from a “cultured and highly educated family” and that he would never do the things alleged by the BJP leader. Flanked by Sena leader and minister Anil Parab, Sardesai provided his and his family’s educational background details to media. “I gave you my background. Everybody here is well aware of the background that the Ranes come from as well as the gang they ran and the numerous cases of crimes including murders, kidnapping and extortion cases against them. The allegations which the BJP legislator made today are baseless, and therefore, I will file a criminal defamation against Rane. He can either apologise in seven days for the false allegations or face legal action and prove them,” said Sardesai. He further said that his move to take the legal route was to stop the “damage to his rising political career” in the future. The Yuva Sena leader also said that BJP has a habit of making baseless allegations to damage political opponents and that Rane’s claims were “painful”. “These allegations have no truth. Anybody gets up and makes allegation to damage someone,” he said. Responding to Rane’s claim that Sardesai has been given Y-plus security cover, the Yuva Sena leader clarified that he has received X-category security. Responding to Rane’s claims that Vaze had met a senior Sena leader, Parab said, “The responsibility of proving the allegations lies with the one who are levelling them. Investigating agencies have been probing the cases. They will probe these allegations too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sachin-vaze-case-sena-s-varun-sardesai-to-sue-nitish-rane-for-defamation-101615835271289.html
16-03-2021||City||Tamil Nadu assembly polls: Which way will Dravidian politics swing in 2021?||When Tamil Nadu votes to elect a new government on April 6, elections will be happening in a huge void. Both M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa, who shared the chief minister’s post between them for 32 out of the last 52 years, are no more. If we include the term of MG Ramachandran, whose political legacy Jayalalithaa inherited, the chief minister’s post was held between the three bigwigs for 42 of the last 52 years.Karunanidhi’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is now headed by his son MK Stalin. Stalin's son Udayanidhi is among the DMK candidates in these elections. The DMK was formed out of a split on the question of nepotism. Its founder CN Annadurai parted ways with his mentor EV Ramasami Periyar, who headed the Dravidar Kazhagam, which had come out of the Justice Party after Periyar decided to marry a young woman called Manimmai and named her as his political successor.The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which, when Jayalalithaa was alive, was a tightly controlled organisation and used to drive hard bargains even with parties that were much bigger in Indian politics. The party is now trying to set its own house in order. The AIADMK is also trying to maintain a separate identity of its own without undermining its alliance with India’s current dominant political hegemon, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Also read: In Tamil Nadu, the rise of MK Stalin’s son—Udhaynidhi StalinThat Sasikala, Jayalalithaa’s closest confidante, announced retirement from politics after coming out of prison and the AIADMK has included removal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in its manifesto underline these points.Beyond these obvious changes, the 2021 elections will also be interesting as far as Tamil Nadu’s long-term political landscape is concerned. An HT analysis underlines at least three interesting trends which have been developing in Tamil Nadu's political fabric.Elections have become close contestsThe AIADMK created a history of sorts by retaining power for the second consecutive term in the 2016 assembly elections. Political power had alternated between the DMK and the AIADMK since 1984. “However, the 2016 elections were among the most closely contested elections in Tamil Nadu -- if one were to look at median victory margins -- since 1971, the earliest period for which data is available in the database maintained by the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University. A median gives the middle value in a distribution.” A median gives the middle value in a distribution. A long-term look at victory margins also suggests that they have been declining in the post-1990 period.See chart 1: Median victory margin in Tamil Nadu assembly electionsThe two main Dravidian parties had unprecedented support in 2016. While Tamil Nadu’s politics has been dominated by Dravidian parties, first the DMK and then its offshoot AIADMK for decades, they never had more than two-thirds of the vote share between them until 2016. This changed in the 2016 elections when their combined vote share crossed 72 per cent. The Congress was the leading party in the erstwhile state of Madras. It was only in 1967 that the DMK won an election in the state which was renamed Tamil Nadu later.Since then the Congress has undergone two phases of decline. The first major decline in its vote share came with the AIADMK contesting its first election in the state in 1977 when the Congress was pushed to the third spot. With members of the Congress and the DMK forming their own parties in the 1990s – such as the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam – the Congress vote share suffered another big decline in vote share. The Left parties – Communist Party of India (CPI) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) - which did not see a decline in vote share with AIADMK’s entry in elections, have also seen their vote share reduce after the formation of many regional parties in the state. The BJP, so far, has been a marginal player in the state’s politics. "The fate of all parties except the DMK and AIADMK is largely contingent on their alliance or the lack of it with the major parties."See chart 2: Long-term vote share in Tamil NaduAlliance is a tricky business of both the DMK and the AIADMKThe statistics discussed so far clearly underline the importance of alliance formation in Tamil Nadu. In a state, where median victory margins are around 6 per cent and the two major parties, even at their peak have never crossed more than three-fourth of the total vote share, alliances matter a lot. However, both the DMK and the AIADMK are extremely cautious and reluctant when it comes to seat-sharing. While the DMK has given just 25 assembly constituencies (ACs) to the Congress, its biggest alliance partner in these elections, the AIADMK has offered just 20 ACs to the BJP. A look at past election statistics explains the reluctance on part of the two major parties to offer more ACs to their alliance partners. Both the DMK and the AIADMK perform better against the alliance partners of their opponents than each other. In other words, the probability of a loss is higher for both the DMK and the AIADMK on ACs which are given to alliance partners.See chart 3A and 3B: Strike rate of AIADMK and DMK against each other and each other’s alliance partners﻿﻿Whether Tamil Nadu maintains its trend of declining victory margins, the growing footprint of the two major Dravidian parties and alliances being a necessity and liability at the same time in 2021 will only be known on May 2 when the results are declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tamil-nadu-assembly-polls-which-way-will-dravidian-politics-swing-in-2021-101615834669247.html

According to parents, Dr Jiten Mody Junior College in Kandivli (West) organised a farewell event for Class 12 students and called students and teachers for the same on March 13. “The school is risking the lives of hundreds of students and teachers by organising such an event. At the events, no social distancing was followed and hardly anyone wore a mask even,” said a parent on the condition of anonymity. Parents said Kapol Vidyanidhi High School, a school under the same management, had also organised a farewell party for Class 10 students in February and had called 350 students each in two batches. School principal Reshma Hegde did not respond to repeated calls. RS Naikwadi, education inspector of West region said the department will issue a show-cause notice to the junior college. “We have received a complaint and have thus asked the junior college to furnish information on the event and how it was held despite strict guidelines against large gatherings and opening of schools for students,” he added. Earlier this year, parents of the students had complained about the school conducting offline prelims for Class 10 and 12 students. “We will look into the issue and take appropriate action,” said Sandeep Sangave, deputy director of Mumbai region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-college-under-scanner-for-holding-farewell-party-101615835150527.html

16-03-2021||Delhi||Bill cites SC verdicts, but may upset power balance||The Bill introduced by the Union home ministry in Lok Sabha to amend the 1991 Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) Act mentions that it relies on two judgments by the Supreme Court: a Constitution bench verdict on July 4, 2018 and a two-judge bench decision on February 14, 2019.Both these judgments delineated the respective powers of the Centre and the elected government of Delhi in administration of the national capital.The bill and its wording, however, have sparked anger from Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which said the proposed law violates the rulings.At the core of the controversy appears to be an amendment to Section 44 of the NCTD Act, which will insert a new proviso making it mandatory for the Delhi government to seek the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor before taking any executive action in pursuance of decisions by the council of ministers, or any other decision under any law in force in the Capital.The proposed course of action leaves no room for the elected government to exercise its discretion in deciding categories of matters which require a prior-consultation with the L-G, or to send files to the L-G after a decision is made by resorting to the executive or legislative powers provided under the Constitution.The Union home ministry has made this provision in spite of the five-judge bench in its July 2018 making it clear that the L-G is “bound to act on aid and advice of the council of ministers” in matters where the Delhi government acts in exercise of its executive and legislative powers, except relating to three subjects – police, land, and law and order.The Constitution bench held unequivocally that while it is necessary to apprise the L-G of all the decisions, it does not mean that his concurrence is required.“We have referred to the relevant rules of Transaction of Business Rules, 1993 which require that the Lieutenant Governor has to be apprised and kept in the loop of the various proposals, agendas and decisions taken by the Council of Ministers. However, a careful perusal of these rules nowhere suggests that the communication to the Lieutenant Governor is to obtain his concurrence or permission,” the bench had held in its majority judgment.The judgment also added that, “It has to be clearly stated that requiring prior concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor would absolutely negate the ideals of representative governance and democracy conceived for the NCT of Delhi by Article 239AA of the Constitution. Any view to the contrary would not be in consonance with the intention of the Parliament to treat Delhi Government as a representative form of government.”“...the decisions of the Council of Ministers must be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor but this does not mean that the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor is required,” it further said.The bench also suggested that “the Lieutenant Governor must work harmoniously with his ministers and must not seek to resist them at every step of the way,” while adding that “neither of the authorities should feel that they have been lionised.”Interpreting a provision in the NCTD Act that empowers the L-G to refer a matter to the President in case of a difference of opinion between him and the government, the five-judge bench had aid that the L-G “should not act in a mechanical manner without due application of mind so as to refer every decision of the Council of Ministers to the President.”Similarly, the 2019 judgment also acknowledged the L-G must be informed of all decisions of the elected government but this did not mean a requirement of concurrence by him.“We would like to add that normally, and generally, the L-G is expected to honour the wisdom of the council of ministers. He is also expected to clear the files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly. He is under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subject matter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, wherever situation so demands. That in fact is the facet of good governance,” held the 2019 judgment.It also asked the NCT government to give due deference to the unique nature of the role assigned to the L-G, underlining that “both should realise that they are here to serve the people of NCTD and that mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for the effective working of the system.”Another amendment seeks to invalidate retrospectively rules made by the legislative assembly of Delhi or committees/house panels to consider the matters of “day-to-day administration of the Capital” or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions.This provision could nix the peace and harmony committee’s inquiry into the role of Facebook in the February 2020 riots in north-east Delhi, and will lead to questions over most of the house panels constituted to consider matters of “day-to-day administration of the Capital”.Most importantly, the proposed amendment will make constitution of house panels and their exercise vulnerable to challenge before the courts since the objective of their setting up will either relate to the “day-to-day administration of the Capital” or “in relation to the administrative decisions”.At least at seven different places in the constitution bench judgment, the apex court has said that Delhi assembly has legislative and executive competence over all subjects except three subjects. The 2021 amendment cites the same judgment but has clearly sought to give an upper hand to the L-G and the Centre in administration of the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bill-cites-sc-verdicts-but-may-upset-power-balance-101615834511845.html

MU senate, over two days last weekend, highlighted the need for the university to invest more on digitising the varsity as a permanent solution.The senate, comprising elected and nominated members including principals, teachers and management members, works as a watchdog for the university. The body has the power to approve the varsity’s annual budget.“Thousands of students from the Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL) missed out on their first online exam in October last year due to an apparent ‘cyberattack’, which also was the reason for all IDOL exams to be postponed. Till date, no one has given any explanation for the attack or shared any report of the investigation,” said a senate member, demanding clarity. MU pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni, who chaired the senate this year, assured the senate members that the cybercrime department of the Mumbai Police is still investigating the matter and a report in the matter will be shared soon. He further clarified that the technical error during IDOL exams was not a cyberattack but a denial-of-service attack created due to excess users logging on the website at the same time. Many senate members also questioned MUs preparedness for online exams.This year, due to the ongoing partial lockdown, the annual MU senate meet was conducted virtually. Spread over two days, many senate members demanded that MU allocate funds in the annual budget for 2021-22 solely for “digital university”. “We (university) cannot be struggling for solutions every time a problem surfaces. There cannot be stop-gap arrangements anymore. We need a permanent solution because lives and futures of lakhs of students are at stake,” said another senate member.MU has allocated around ₹1 crore for digital university at present and plans to raise more funds in the near future to support this plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/need-one-time-solution-for-tech-glitches-university-of-mumbai-senate-101615834912560.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Antilia security scare to Sachin Vaze’s arrest: Maharashtra govt in damage control mode||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar got into damage control mode on Monday, following the major embarrassment for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, Antilia; death of the car owner, Mansukh Hiran; and arrest of police officer Sachin Vaze by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the scare. In the backdrop of the developments, the CM met Pawar on Monday afternoon at the former’s official residence, Varsha, as part of crisis management. Later, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole met the CM. Thackeray also met senior police officers from Mumbai police commissionerate to discuss the situation. He has believably expressed his unhappiness over the case and lack of control of the top officials on the affairs of the crime branch, said a senior official. Top leadership of both the NCP and Congress have told Thackeray that they were not happy with the way the entire episode was handled, especially the way the Shiv Sena defended Vaze, which could backfire if he is found to be involved in the case, as being pointed out by the NIA, said MVA insiders. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has squarely hit out at the Thackeray-led government and alleged Thackeray was shielding the officer. The MVA is likely to take a few corrective measures in a bid to put an end to the controversy and a few heads are likely to roll in the police department. Top leaders felt the case should have been taken seriously from day one and handled in a better manner. The two people who could face the music are Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and home minister Anil Deshmukh, according to MVA insiders. Singh may get transferred soon, as part of the routine development. Deshmukh may be shifted to some other ministry during routine reshuffle of cabinet in the near future. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar or water resources minister Jayant Patil may be considered as his replacement.”There is an impression among NCP top brass that Deshmukh has not been able to handle the home department effectively,” said a senior NCP minister. Besides, the state is likely to make an attempt to distance itself from the Vaze issue, pointing at it as a misdeed of a few officials, the insiders said. According to a senior NCP leader, Pawar is said to have expressed his displeasure over the attempt made by chief minister and home department to shield controversial police officer even though there were indications that he could be involved in some way. The NCP chief later held a meeting with senior ministers, including Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad. “Putting a full stop to reports of action against Deshmukh, Pawar said the party would wait till completion of probe by the anti-terrorism squad. He said that we should not stand by anybody found guilty,” said a senior minister, who was part of the meeting.The party leadership clarified that immediate action against Deshmukh was not necessary, but officers in the Mumbai Police force should be held responsible. “There is larger perception within the ruling parties that Deshmukh could not handle the department. Immediate action is unlikely. In fact, he was asked by Pawarsaheb to apprise the meeting about the current status of the case,” said an NCP insiderJayant Patil, who is also Maharashtra NCP chief, said, “Deshmukh has been doing his job properly…All the three ruling parties are of the view that if someone has committed a mistake, he should he held responsible and the responsibility be fixed. No one in the government is trying to shield anyone.”He also said that the ATS is still investigating the Mansukh Hiran’s death and the facts will come out before everyone. “If Antilia bomb scare would have remained with the ATS, facts would have come out before the people. They were probing in the right direction. Irrespective of the outcome, action will be taken,” the water resources minister said.“The party leadership is said to have told its leaders in the state that they are concerned about how the controversy has hurt the image of the MVA. Patole, in his meeting with the CM, has conveyed it to the latter,” said a Congress leader.Anil Parab, Sena minister and close aide of CM Thackeray, refuted the claims that cases, from Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in 2020 to Mansukh Hiran death case, have been poorly handled by the home department. “ In all these cases, there was a clear attempt to defame the MVA government. You mentioned Sushant Singh Rajput case, that probe is still not complete. There are no expected names in the charge sheet. It was only a ploy to defame. In all these cases, we have maintained that let the investigation get over. Whoever is found in the wrong will not be let off.” The Sena minister said that Vaze’s suspension was according to the law, where a public servant is suspended within 48 hours of his arrest. While speaking about the BJP’s reference to imposition of President’s rule in the state, Jayant Patil said, “There are norms for imposing the President’s rule in a state. The probe is going on and the state is determined to act against the guilty. If there is an intention to impose President’s rule, then the motive is clearly political. On merits, the truth will be out and the government will take action after the probe is completed,” the state NCP chief said, in his response.Patole, after meeting CM Thackeray, said they did not discuss the reshuffle in the state cabinet. “Officers are transferred in March-April anyway. Some officers may be transferred.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-security-scare-to-sachin-vaze-s-arrest-maharashtra-govt-in-damage-control-mode-101615834911136.html
16-03-2021||Other||Strict lockdown imposed in Nagpur as Covid-19 cases continue to rise||On the first of the week-long lockdown in Nagpur, the district reported 2,297 fresh Covid-19 cases and 12 deaths on Monday. Nagpur is the first city to go under lockdown in the second Covid wave, which is sweeping many parts of the country. Nagpur saw more than 2,200 cases for the third consecutive day on Monday, making it the biggest Covid-19 hot spot in Maharashtra. While the lockdown was aimed at keeping people indoors, many citizens ventured out citing various reasons. City police were out to implement stringent restrictions, and a few instances of people and police entering into an argument were reported. However, the number of people outside their homes reduced by after with stringent implementation of lockdown. “There will be very effective implementation of Covid curbs. We will not spare anyone violating Covid-19 norms,” said police commissioner Amitesh Kumar, who oversaw the implementation of lockdown since early on Monday. Kumar and his deputies from various zones were out on the streets to supervise the implementation of lockdown. Barricades were set up in all busy streets in the city and police were monitoring traffic movement. Vehicles were stopped to inquire why they ventured out. Announcing the lockdown, guardian minister for Nagpur district, Nitin Raut said it was imperative to impose the strict lockdown as cases were on the rise for the past week. Raut said, “Swab samples have been sent for genome sequencing to check whether there is any mutation in coronavirus in the district.” He also asked the district task force to study reasons behind the sudden spike in cases. He also made it clear that if cases continue to increase, the lockdown would be extended with stricter restrictions. On the first of lockdown on Monday, streets bore a deserted look. Schools, colleges, gyms and private offices remained closed while government offices were functioning with 25% strength. Essential services including medical shops, vegetable and grocery shops were allowed to function. It is for the first time that active cases in the district are higher than Mumbai and Thane, which are mass urban areas with bigger population as compared to Nagpur. The district administration has, however, made it clear that the ongoing lockdown would not affect the vaccination drive in its 128 centres across the city. It has allowed people to accompany those getting vaccine. The administration has also appealed to social organisations, non-government organisations to come forward to help senior citizens reach vaccination centres. In view of rising Covid-19 cases in the district, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has started hearing cases through video-conferencing from Monday and it will continue till March 21, according to a notice issued by the court registrar. Meanwhile, various traders’ bodies met Raut to register their objection to imposing lockdown till March 21. Citing that businesses were severely hit during the lockdown, traders said a fresh lockdown would come as a huge blow to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/strict-lockdown-imposed-in-nagpur-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-rise-101615834852603.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Antilia case: Sachin Vaze suspended again||The Mumbai Police on Monday suspended Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze following his arrest by the National Investigation Authority (NIA) in connection with its probe on the recovery of explosives from an SUV parked outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month, even as his brother Sudharm Vaze filed a habeas corpus petition in the Bombay high court on Monday against the arrest claiming that Vaze was being made into a “scapegoat” by “certain political powers”.Vaze, 49, remained the centre of political debate as leaders from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party said that his arrest would allow for further investigation into ruling Shiv Sena leaders.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar met Monday afternoon to deliberate on damage control measures. According to the leaders of the ruling coalition government, Pawar and Thackeray discussed a strategy to find the way out from the crisis. Thackeray also met Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole.Vaze, 49, a former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch was initially lead investigator after a Scorpio carrying 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, with no detonator or timer) was found outside Antilia on Carmichael Road on February 25, but the case was transferred to the NIA on March 8. Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police S Chaitanya said, “API Sachin Vaze has been placed under suspension by an order of the additional commissioner of police, special branch.”Also, the NIA questioned five people from CIU, including API Riyazuddin Kazi, API Prakash Howal, and three constables, on Monday. The NIA had also questioned Kazi and Howal on Sunday.Kazi was part of Vaze’s investigation team and NIA questioned him over the records made at Carmichael Road, where Antilia is situated, and in Hiran’s shop in Thane.The NIA also collected CCTV footage from the Mumbai police control room as well as from several sites in Mumbai and Thane. Two NIA officers also visited Vaze’s house in Saket, Thane on Monday afternoon, to question his family in connection with an explosives-laden SUV found near Ambani’s residence. The team questioned the family for over five hours and was still there by the time of going to the press. No one was allowed to enter the complex during this time, residents said.This was the team’s first visit to Vaze’s house after his arrest. Vaze’s brother, Sudharma Vaze said, “We have filed a writ petition and our lawyer has asked us not to talk to the media. We will make a statement to the media after March 25 to make our stand clear in the said matter.”Vaze was questioned for over 12 hours on March 13 by the NIA, along with other investigators in the case. However, only he was arrested late Saturday night, and produced before the NIA court the following day. He was remanded to the custody of the NIA till March 25.A habeas corpus petition, usually filed to challenge illegal detention or arrest.Sudharm’s petition stated that Vaze cooperated with the NIA, gave them all the corroborative pieces of evidence and yet, after several hours of interrogation, he was arrested without being served a copy of the First Information Report, or being informed of the nature of allegations against him. It further claimed that he was not allowed to speak to his lawyers or family members, which is a violation of his fundamental rights. This is the second time that Vaze has faced suspension. In 2004, he was suspended after being arrested for the alleged custodial death of Khwaja Yunus, an accused in a 2002 bomb blast that took place in Ghatkopar. Vaze eventually left the force in 2007. He was reinstated in 2020 after the suspension order was revoked. His reinstatement has been challenged by Yunus’s mother in the Bombay high court.Vaze’s lawyers Sudeep Pasbola and Raunak Naik had moved an application on Sunday before the special court, claiming that Vaze had been illegally detained by NIA officials since Saturday morning, and that they were also denied a copy of the remand application. They further told the court that Vaze’s family had not been informed about his arrest, and Vaze was not apprised of his rights and the grounds of his arrest.The court on Monday asked Pasbola and Naik to apply for certified copy of the remand application.Denying the allegations, NIA counsel Sunil Gonsalves told the court that Vaze was summoned by NIA officials on Saturday in his capacity as the previous investigating officer in the probe pertaining to the explosives found in the Scorpio.He said that there were discrepancies in various documents filed in the course of the investigation, and that Vaze, who did not have his cellphone on him, had further refused to give the contact details of his family members after his arrest.Vaze is also under the scanner for the mysterious death of 48-year-old Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was linked to the Scorpio found outside Ambani’s residence. Hiran was found dead in a creek in Thane district on March 5.Vaze had been transferred to the Citizen Facilitation Centre last week, after leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis sought his arrest following the statement Hiran’s wife Vimla gave to the Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) team investigating her husband’s death.In her statement, Vimla said that she suspected Vaze had a hand in Hiran’s death.Since then, Vaze has also become the subject of a political slugfest between the coalition partners of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“Sachin Vaze has been suspended once again. But why, how, on what basis and who reappointed him on June 6, 2020? It should be investigated. Persons responsible must be punished,” BJP leader Kirit Somaiya tweeted on Monday.BJP legislator Nitesh Rane on Monday alleged that Yuva Sena leader Varun Sardesai was linked to Vaze in the latter’s alleged extortion racket from bookies during the previous Indian Premier League. Rane demanded that the NIA seek the call detail records of Vaze and Sardesai.Sardesai, who is a cousin of Aaditya Thackeray refuted these claims and said, “The allegations that the BJP legislator made today are baseless and therefore I am going to file a criminal defamation against legislator Nitesh Rane. He should either apologise in 7 days for false allegations or should face legal action and prove them.”On Sunday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had come out in support of Vaze, as an “honest” cop, and said that the investigation into the case needed to proceed unassailed by politics.Sudharm’s petition filed through advocate Sunny Punnamiya stated that Vaze had been an upright and law abiding officer working with Mumbai police for 17 years but was made a scapegoat by some political powers based on the allegations of Vimla Hiran.

16-03-2021||Mumbai||University of Mumbai non-teaching staff to start physically reporting to duty||The University of Mumbai (MU) on Monday released a circular stating that non-teaching staff from all MU departments will now physically report to duty starting Tuesday until the end of the month. While class 1 staffers are expected to report for duty every day, class 2, 3 and 4 non-teaching staff are to physically report to duty on alternate days while maintaining 100% attendance, according the circular. The circular further states that class 3 and 4 non-teaching staff of the examination department too will be expected to maintain 100% attendance.“In the past few months, a lot of the university’s work has been pending, including paper work for National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grading process as well as other important work, which is why we had asked for all non-teaching staff to report to duty,” said MU registrar-in-charge Baliram Gaikwad. He, however, added that increasing number of the university staff has been unable to report to duty due to travel restrictions in local trains. “With rising Covid-19 cases, the university is allowing class 2, 3 and 4 non-teaching employees to come to work on alternate days,” said Gaikwad.The university has, over the past few months, approached the state government and the railways, seeking extension of essential services tag to the university staff. “We cannot postpone work anymore. And for our staff to be able to report to duty, it is important that the railways allow us to travel even during peak hours. Since we are yet to hear from the authorities and the fact that Covid-19 cases are also increasing, for the next two weeks we are allowing 50% attendance with alternate days rule,” said Gaikwad and added that the university will review the decision by March 31.In the first week of February this year, state education minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that colleges can reopen with not more than 50% attendance on campus at any given point of time. MU affirmed this move with a circular asking colleges to approach local civic authority or collectors office before restarting physical classes in a phased manner. The circular also shared Covid-19 safety guidelines prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure safety of staff and students.On February 12, however, after a meeting between officials from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and MU, civic officials asked to postpone reopening of colleges by a week until February 22 which has now been further postponed due to increasing cases of Covid-19 in the city.While the varsity is hoping to speed up all pending work by bringing back their staff, many members of the non-teaching staff unions are unhappy. “The university knows that Covid-19 cases are increasing, especially because of train travel. And they are still expecting all of us to report to duty. We hope the government will intervene in this matter and bring some relief to us,” said a member on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-non-teaching-staff-to-start-physically-reporting-to-duty-101615834791204.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees over 15,000 Covid cases for 4th straight day, slaps stricter curbs||Maharashtra on Monday saw 15,051 new Covid-19 infections, the fourth straight day of over 15,000 new infections, including one 16,000-plus case spike. The state’s case tally went up to 2,329,464, while active cases, too, rose to 130,547 — 5.60% of the tally.The surge in Covid-19 cases is likely to take a month to come under control, officials said. The spike has led to imposition of a lockdown or partial lockdown in several districts and cities of the state, even as state health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday clarified that no state-wide lockdown will be imposed, but instead stricter restrictions will be implemented to contain the spread. A few hours later, the state government issued an order banning all sorts of social, cultural, political and religious gatherings in the state. The order also imposed stricter punishments such as closing down establishments violating the rules for a period until the central government declares that the Covid-19 pandemic is no more a disaster. The fresh order will remain in place till March 31.“Hotels, restaurants, single screen theatres, multiplexes have been allowed to operate at 50% capacity by following restrictions such as no entry without masks, temperature checks before entry, hand sanitisers to be kept at various convenient locations, enough manpower to ensure wearing of masks as well as maintaining social distancing by visitors all the time,” stated the notification issued by the chief secretary Sitaran Kunte on Monday. In case of violation of this order, concerned establishment of the property will have to remain closed for a period until the Covid-19 pandemic stays notified as a disaster by the central government. Violation shall also attract penalties under the disaster act for the owner of the premises, it added.All offices except those that are related to health and essential services shall have to work with 50% capacity. Work from home should be encouraged and any violation will attract the same punishments determined for commercial establishments such as hotels, restaurants and cinema theatres, according to the order.The state government has allowed only 50 people to attend weddings and 20 people to attend last rites. Further, the state government has directed the management of all religious places to decide and declare the maximum number of visitors per hour depending upon the availability of space for movement and gathering with proper social distancing. “It is advised that convenient systems like online reservations for visits may be initiated,” said the notification.State health minister Rajesh Tope urged the people to cooperate by following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.“We have opened up everything. The government is not considering to reimpose lockdown, neither in Mumbai nor in the state. But we will be bringing strict restrictions to avoid unnecessary crowding. We have already directed the local administration as well as police to ensure people wearing masks and social distancing are strictly followed. I urge the people to co-operate by following Covid protocol,” Tope said on Monday.He also said that there is no shortage of Covid vaccines in the state. In fact, the government is looking to improve the figure of those getting vaccinated every day. “We are vaccinating around 125,000 people every day and are trying to increase the numbers. I urge all those above 60 years and those affected with co-morbidities to get immunised at the earliest because the chances of Covid symptoms getting serious in this category of people is much more than the rest of the categories. Despite rise in infectivity, the rate of asymptomatic patients is between 85 to 90% and they recover in seven days,” Tope added.Meanwhile, the state’s death toll reached 52,909 as 48 casualties were reported, of which, 27 were in the past 48 hours and seven happened in the past week. The remaining 14 deaths were from the period before last week, health officials said.Mumbai on Monday reported 1,713 fresh Covid-19 cases and four deaths, taking the total number of cases to 345,675 and toll to 11,539. The case fatality rate is 3.3%. Active cases in the city have also shot up to 13,309 from 8,294 recorded on March 1. The recovery rate in Mumbai is 92%. So far, Mumbai has conducted 3,574,056 Covid-19 tests, of which 15,697 were conducted within 24 hours up to Sunday night.With 2,094 cases, Nagpur city recorded the highest cases across the state. The combined tally of the city and district went up to 2,448 in a day. Pune city also reported 1,122 cases, third highest cases after Mumbai. The combined tally of the city and district comes to 1,485 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-over-15-000-covid-cases-for-4th-straight-day-slaps-stricter-curbs-101615834731255.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC extends interim protection for Sharjeel Usmani||While noting that Sharjeel Usmani, an accused booked by Swargate police station on February 2 under section 153A of the Indian Penal Code, was cooperating with the investigators, the Bombay high court (HC) accepted the state’s assurance that no coercive action would be taken if Usmani presented himself before the investigators. The court directed Usmani to attend the police station on March 18 and further observed that it was up to Usmani to impose a self-restriction from speaking to media about the investigation in the case. The matter has been posted for further hearing on March 22. Usmani, former student leader of Aligarh Muslim University, was booked by the police based on a letter by Pradeep Gawade, regional secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gawade alleged that Usmani had made a provocative speech at Elgar Parishad conference on January 30 in Pune. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by Usmani seeking quashing of the FIR filed against him and staying the proceedings arising out of it, was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that the speech had been taken out of context by Gawade. Desai further submitted that the speech needed to be looked from the aspect of what message was being sent by the speech, who was it addressed to, and the context in which it was made before deciding whether it was provocative. He added that it could be construed from the wordings of the speech that he intended to send the message that everyone should join and work together, and in that case no offence was made out against Usmani. He also added that as per the assurance in the previous hearing, Usmani had attended the police station as per HC’s directions and hence the protection from coercive action should continue. However, advocate Aniket Nikam, who was allowed to intervene on behalf of Gawade, opposed the petition and said young minds or even strong minds would get influenced by the manner in which the speech was made, and hence the petition should not be entertained. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik, for the state, informed the court that the police was not willing to extend the assurance of no coercive action as Usmani had been speaking to the media about the complaint against him. After hearing the submissions, the court noted that it would have to read the speech by Usmani in its entirety to ascertain his intent while saying “don’t trust Indian judiciary, parliament...and I say we are in a state of war...” and stated that the court was open to criticism. The court further asked Yagnik whether Usmani had cooperated as per previous directions. On receiving an affirmative reply, the court asked him to continue the earlier assurance of no coercive action provided Usmani cooperated with the probe. The court then directed Desai to tell his client to decide on whether he wanted to impose a self-restraint on himself from speaking to the media, to which Desai assured he would convey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-extends-interim-protection-for-sharjeel-usmani-101615834671276.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Is panel of developers feasible, Bombay HC asks state, BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to file an affidavit on whether its suggestion of setting up a panel of competent developers to ensure that development/re-development projects can be taken up and completed in a time-bound manner was possible. The suggestion was made while hearing a petition filed by some persons who claimed that though they had given up their homes for redevelopment in 2015, they were yet to get new homes as construction of the building by the developer was stuck at the plinth level. In light of many such petitions coming before the HC regularly, the bench asked the state and BMC to file their replies on the feasibility of setting up panel of developers. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by 37 members of a society, was informed by advocate MA Khan that all the petitioners were tenants of the civic authority, as the land of the tenement they lived in belonged to BMC. Khan submitted that in 2015 the members had agreed to a redevelopment proposal and vacated the building on the assurance that once the new building was ready, they would get new homes. However, as work on the new building was stuck at the plinth level, they were left without a roof over their heads. In view of this, they approached the HC for directions to the developer to complete the construction of the building as soon as possible. After hearing the submission, the bench noted that there was a tendency of developers who were not competent enough to undertake such projects or hand over projects to others after securing them, as a result of which people were rendered homeless. The court then observed, “We may also take judicial notice of the fact that a large number of litigants are knocking the doors of this court concerning projects, in which the developers have failed to fulfil their obligations to complete the construction for long years, either of slums scheme or such other redevelopment. This has created an alarming situation, to the effect that a large number of citizens are homeless and are made to suffer at the hands of such developers.” The court suggested that the state government ponder over the issue as to whether it was the need of the time that statutory authorities maintain a panel of registered developers, whose competence on all fronts to execute projects was tested by either the government or other statutory authorities and who could be entrusted with the work of development/re-development. This, the court said, would assure the citizens that construction, once undertaken, was completed in a time-bound manner. After making the observations, the court directed the state government and municipal authority to file an affidavit on the suggestion canvassed by the court, and also asked the advocate general to appear in the matter in the next hearing on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/is-panel-of-developers-feasible-bombay-hc-asks-state-bmc-101615834551247.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||ED attaches Rs35.48-cr immovable assets of Sushil Kumar Shinde’s daughter, son-in-law||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials have provisionally attached immovable assets worth ₹35.48 crore belonging to Raj Shroff and his wife Priti, who are owners of Jindal Combines Pvt. Ltd and Orlando Trading Pvt. Ltd, under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) in a bank fraud case linked to Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, promoters of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and others. Priti is the daughter of former Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. ED officials from Mumbai office confirmed the attached assets are two commercial properties admeasuring approx. 10550 sqft each in Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), Mumbai. The details of the properties surfaced during the ED’s investigation into the case registered against Wadhawans on the basis of an FIR registered by the anti-corruption bureau for siphoning off loan money to tune of ₹200 crore sanctioned by Yes Bank to Mack Star Marketing Pvt. Ltd. Wadhawans fraudulently transferred one commercial property of Mack Star located in Kaledonia building, Andheri East, to Jindal Combines Pvt. Ltd at a price of ₹9.39 crore (ready reckoner value ₹15.64 crore at the time) in 2014 and another commercial property to Orlando Trading Pvt. Ltd at an agreement value of ₹18 crore (ready reckoner value ₹19.84 crore) in 2016, ED sources said. However, they paid only ₹10 crore for the second property till date. The firms are receiving rent of ₹1.76 crore and ₹1.39 crore per annum for these two properties, respectively. Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan cheated Mack Star Marketing Pvt. Ltd by illegally selling above said properties without consent of the majority shareholder (DE Shaw Group, which holds 83.36% shares) of Mack Star Marketing Pvt. Ltd. at very low price causing loss to Mack Star, ED sources added. The total value of the attachment in this case is now ₹69.84 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-attaches-rs35-48-cr-immovable-assets-of-sushil-kumar-shinde-s-daughter-soninlaw-101615834492973.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||North Mumbai saw more Covid-19 cases in past 7 days: BMC data||According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Andheri, Mulund, Kandivli, Borivli, and Ghatkopar have recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases between March 6 and March 13, with more than 500 reported cases last week. Thirteen out of 24 wards in Mumbai have Covid growth rates higher than the city’s average growth rate of 0.39%. T ward, corresponding to Mulund, tops the list with a Covid growth rate of 0.59%. G-South ward, corresponding to Worli, has the slowest growth rate (0.22%). The lowest spikes have been recorded between Dongri and Mohammad Ali Road, Colaba and Fort, Marine Lines, Worli, Wadala and Matunga. Between March 6 and 13, Andheri (West) recorded 895 cases of Covid-19 and a growth rate of 0.56%. Mulund recorded 671 cases and a growth rate of 0.57%. Kandivli (West) recorded 599 cases and a growth rate of 0.42%. Andheri (East) recorded 576 cases and a growth rate of 0.41%. Borivli (West) recorded 536 cases and a growth rate of 0.42%. Ghatkopar recorded 510 cases and a growth rate of 0.44%. Highest growth rate does not correspond with most reported cases since for some wards, the base bases (total number of cases reported up to March 6) was lower, said civic authorities. A senior civic official said there could be multiple reasons why a ward has more cases but a slower growth rate. “Some areas have more hospitals in their jurisdiction. A ward close to the international airport, which is quarantining international passengers, is likely to record more cases. We also found certain clusters where higher number of cases were detected together.” Civic officials attributed the growing number of cases to a number of factors, including resumption of local train services for the general public and citizens not following social distancing norms. “Since the resumption of local trains for everyone, we have seen a spike in the number of new cases. We are recording maximum Covid-19 cases from high-rise buildings, which are turning into superspreaders. People are attending marriages, family functions without wearing masks,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Experts from the state’s Covid-19 task force also pointed out more tests were being conducted. “We are testing about 20,000-22,000 people each day and that’s why the number is high. However, the test positivity rate is alarming. Also, patients are now coming in with gastrointestinal symptoms. Before they realise they have Covid-19, they have spread it to the rest of the family which is also adding to the caseload,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force. Dr Rahul Tambe, senior consultant, internal medicine and infectious diseases, Nanavati Hospital, emphasised that it is essential for the public to wear masks, wash hands regularly and observe social distancing. “Vaccination alone can’t eliminate the risks of infection without strict adherence to basic preventive measures,” he said. BMC officials said samples from Covid hotspots are being sent for gene sequencing to see if any new variant of Covid-19 has developed in areas like Amravati, where the infection appears to be spreading at a faster rate. “We are sending samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune from hotspots for genome sequencing to find any possible mutation of the virus. Earlier, we were sending samples only from Seven Hills Hospital, but are now selecting samples from wards with more cases,” said Kakani. While at this time last year more cases of Covid-19 were being reported from slums, BMC said last week that 90% of the cases reported in January and February were from wealthier, residential buildings. Ward officers have increased testing in areas with more cases of Covid-19 and all high-risk contacts of Covid-positive patients must be tested on the seventh day. “The sero survey also showed that antibodies were fewer amongst those in high-rises as against those from the slums,” said Dr Pandit. As of March 13, the most active cases are in R-Central ward, (Borivli; 947 cases); followed by K-West, which covers Andheri (West) (918 cases); R-South, which covers Kandivli (West) (816 cases); K-East, which covers Andheri (East) (799 cases); and P-North, which covers Malad (West) (798 cases). The fewest active cases of Covid-19 cases are in B ward (Dongri and Mohammad Ali Road; 94 cases). Meanwhile on Monday, 44,683 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 39,505 received the first dose and 5,178 received the second dose. 30,298 beneficiaries were senior citizens and 4,500 were citizens aged above 45 years who also have comorbidities. There are 85 active vaccination centres in the city at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/north-mumbai-saw-more-covid-19-cases-in-past-7-days-bmc-data-101615834491919.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Some domestic passengers use fake Covid-19 reports to fly||Authorities said some passengers flying into the city are providing fake test reports at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to show they are Covid-negative. Terming these as “rare” instances, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said fake reports showing results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are being presented at the airport. There is no mechanism to track the veracity of RT-PCR test results. In November, CSMIA issued guidelines stating domestic passengers from Delhi, Gujarat, Goa, and Rajasthan are required to provide a negative RT-PCR test report undertaken within 72 hours prior to travel. Otherwise, they must undergo the test at the airport on arrival at their own cost. Kerala was added to the list in February. There is a team dedicated to conducting checks at CSMIA before passengers enter arrival halls. However, it is not possible for officials to cross-check the authenticity of each passenger’s report. According to BMC, some are presenting fake test certificates at the airport. “We got to know that some passengers take a Covid-19 negative report from a relative. Then with the help of Photoshop, they change the dates, names and PAN numbers. Within five minutes, they are able to create fake RT-PCR reports,” said a BMC official, requesting anonymity. Last week, BMC registered a first information report against a family based in Khar, who had presented a Covid-negative report that was exposed as fake when the test result with the laboratory showed as positive. “In the event of suspicion of a fraudulent report, BMC officials on ground at the airport are alerted to the incident for further action,” said a spokesperson from the airport. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “I don’t overrule that domestic passengers aren’t submitting fake test reports but such instances are rare.” Another tactic used by passengers from the five restricted states is reportedly to enter Mumbai via other neighbouring states. For instance, BMC noted some passengers coming from Goa had taken a flight to Bengaluru and then flown to Mumbai. “In that way, they skip screening at the airport as passengers from Bengaluru don’t have to show RT-PCR reports. If a passenger doesn’t reveal their travel history, it is not possible to cross check it,” said the BMC official. “Travelling from other states is one of the contributing factors to the rise of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. To control the possible spread of the virus, we are checking test reports,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. He added that if the public continued to flout rules, more stringent measures may have to be imposed. Velrasu said there is no accessible government database against which the veracity of Covid-19 reports may be checked live. “If people are showing reports from Maharashtra, then through the bar code, we can still verify the authenticity. But if passengers submit fake reports from other states, there is no way to check those,” he said. The regular Covid-19 test is available at a minimum cost of ₹850 at CSMIA. Results are delivered in eight to -24 hours. An express test is available at ₹4,500, which delivers results in 13 minutes. Self-quarantine is mandatory for international passengers from the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa. “CSMIA recently re-opened its Terminal 1 to further enhance health and safety of the passengers and personnel at the airport” reads the airport’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-some-domestic-passengers-use-fake-covid-19-reports-to-fly-101615834372383.html

Three passengers of the van were injured in the incident. The accident led to a three-hour traffic snarl on the Ahmedabad lane of the highway, as the authorities had to clear the damaged vehicles. By late afternoon, the highway was cleared for vehicles.The car driver has been identified as Shobitkumar Das. “Das was travelling to Mumbai, when he lost control over his speeding car. The car jumped the divider and landed on the Ahmedabad lane, where it collided with a van. After we learnt about the accident, we rushed Das to hospital, but he had already died. The three injured passengers are undergoing treatment at two government hospitals,” said assistant inspector Pratap Darade of Manor police station.Das has been booked under section 304 (a) (negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and his post-mortem report is awaited.

16-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt can’t change assistance pattern of 12 fully funded colleges: DU||The Delhi University (DU) administration on Monday wrote to the Delhi government saying its 12 fully funded colleges are bound to follow the University Grants Commission (UGC) norms in matters of budgeting and expenditure, and the government cannot change the pattern of assistance for releasing funds.The move comes a day before chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is scheduled to meet the principals of the 12 colleges. The principals have been asked to produce details of appointments, and surplus funds available with them.These 12 state government-funded colleges have been at loggerheads with the Delhi government over funds for a long time. Earlier, the colleges had alleged that the government either delayed release of funds or gave “insufficient” funds, and the government alleged financial irregularities in these colleges claiming they had surplus reserves.On Saturday, the governing bodies (GBs) of two of these colleges -- Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and the Sports Sciences, and Maharishi Valmiki College of Education -- passed a resolution stating that the pattern of assistance as suggested by the Delhi government, and not that of the UGC, will be followed for the release of grant-in-aid from the government.But DU registrar Vikas Gupta said the Delhi government cannot change the pattern of assistance. “These colleges were established as per the norms of the UGC in 1997. All these years, the government has been providing funds to these colleges in line with the UGC norms. Now, they are saying they will decide their own assistance pattern... Also, college governing bodies cannot decide this matter on their own -- they work under the control and supervision of the DU’s executive council. They are bound to follow the rules and regulations as prescribed by the executive council.”According to a resolution passed by the executive council-- the highest decision-making body of the varsity-- last December, the funds collected under different heads such as college development fund, hostel fund, student society fund, and admission process charges, can only be used for the purposes for which they were collected.However, the resolution passed by the GBs of the two colleges stated that the colleges can use “surplus grant in aid” drawn and available with them for purposes such as salary, allowance and other recurring expenses.The resolution further said these colleges cannot undertake any activity that entails a financial liability, such as making appointments, without taking prior approval from the Delhi governmentDU dean of colleges Balram Pani said the university on Monday wrote to the director, directorate of higher education, raising the issue.In its letter, the DU administration said, “The modification which has been processed by the directorate of higher education on a retrospective basis is against the law and has resulted in unnecessary and uncalled for panic and unrest among the academic fraternity in these colleges.”“Any attempt to curtail the autonomy and financial independence of these institutions will neither be a constructive step nor legally tenable as it would vitiate the act, statues, ordinances, and guidelines of the University…” it added.Earlier in the day, DU teachers’ association (DUTA), along with scores of students and DU principal association (DUPA), took out an “adhikar rally” from the office of DU’s acting vic-chancellor to Kejriwal’s office. DUTA also submitted a memorandum with the chief minister’s office over the alleged crises in these 12 colleges.Delhi government spokesperson did not provide a comment despite repeated requests for one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/funding-tussle-delhi-govt-can-t-change-assistance-pattern-of-12-fully-funded-colleges-says-du-101615834252275.html

The doctors from Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals of the north corporation had gone on a strike last year as well, which was later called off in October, on assurances that their salaries will be released. “Doctors of North MCD are deeply anguished and very disturbed due to non-payment of their salaries of last four months, which has made their life extremely difficult due to hardships forced on them. Today, we feel traumatized and humiliated as the corporation has once again forced us to beg and that too for our own due salaries,” said a letter by the municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association to the MCD commissioner. The letter said, “As most hospitals and many peripheral health units are also involved in vaccine administration, sampling, contact tracing and data reporting of Covid-19, hence suitable alternate arrangements will be made beforehand to avoid any hardship to patients and concerned government organisations/authorities. During the strike period, work at the casualty ward will remain unaffected. The responsibility for this strike shall lie with the government which forced us to take this bitter avoidable step.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doctors-in-north-corporation-threaten-to-go-on-leave-on-friday-launch-indefinite-strike-after-to-demand-pending-wages-101615834251708.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 368 new cases of Covid-19||With 368 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Monday, Delhi added fewer than 400 cases of the viral infection after four days. However, the dip in numbers is likely due to fewer tests conducted on Sunday, reported a day later in Monday’s health bulletin. The city had conducted just over 62,000 tests for Covid-19 on Sunday, compared to an average of over 71,000 tests conducted over the four days before that when the city had seen over 400 cases. To be sure, testing numbers usually see a dip on account of the weekendThis puts the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total samples tested – at 0.59%. The increase in positivity rate is indicative of increasing spread of the infection. However, experts believe that the spread is still under control till a positivity rate of 5% or less in maintained. The positivity rate in Delhi has been on the rise since mid-February, however, still remains below 1%. The average positivity rate over seven days stood at 0.56% as compared to 0.43% the week before and 0.36% before that. “The positivity rate in Delhi was over 15% at one time and the WHO (World Health Organization) says that it should be below 5%. The positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for a few months now and below 1% for nearly 2.5 months. In comparison, the positivity rate in Maharashtra is 16.46%, Kerala 3.54%, Punjab 4.81%, and Gujarat 1.78%. This means that the positivity rate in Gujarat is three times that of Delhi, Punjab six time, Kerala seven times, and Maharashtra thirty times,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. He added, “Till the positivity rate does not cross 1%, the infection is well control. The numbers are fluctuating a little. But, we are alert. We have increased the number of tests to over 70 thousand. We are taking all precaution.” The minister also said that people need to keep following all precautions, even during festivals such as the upcoming Holi, as the infection is likely to happen in waves. “It does not look like Covid-19 will just come to an end; it is likely to keep coming back. What we have learnt so far is that wearing masks is the best way to prevent the infection. Even those who have taken the vaccine should keep wearing masks.” Play dry Holi, he suggested. Experts said that one of the major cause of the increase in the infection is the complacency in following norms by the people after the infections went down. “People are going to markets and marriages. They are hardly interested in putting on the masks. This is because the number of cases has gone down, many think it is just like the flu, and others think that the vaccine will protect. Truth is, Covid-19 is not really like flu as most people have immune response ready for the common viral infection. Covid is new and not everyone has immunity to it. Vaccinating enough number of people will also take time,” said a senior pulmonologist from Safdarjung hospital, on condition of anonymity. On Monday, over 21 thousand people over the age of 60 years received their first shot against Covid-19 and 3,429 people between the ages of 45 years and 59 years with comorbidities did, according to government data. The number of hospitalisations are also on the rise. There were 607 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in various city hospitals as on Sunday night as compared to 489 at the beginning of the month. “There were very few admissions for nearly fifteen days, however, the number of admissions have started increasing over the last three to four days. Hopefully, the surge would not be like the one we had seen in November because many people have already been exposed to the infection and still others are getting vaccinated. There is a need to strictly enforce masking like the government was doing previously,” said Dr Rajesh Chawala, consulting pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-368-new-cases-of-covid19-101615834251177.html

Police said more than 150 people across the country have been duped in less than six months by these women. Several forged appointment letters of various airlines have been seized, the police said. Those arrested were identified as Sushmita (26), Chhaya (21), Akansha Sharma (21), Pooja (21), Roshni (24), Rekha (23) and Jyoti (29).Police said they had received information last week regarding a fake placement agency that was being run through a fake call centre in Ramesh Nagar.The complaint, received on e-mail, said the sender was cheated of ₹32,000 by the gang, which offered him a fictitious job.

16-03-2021||Other||Water shortage continues in parts of east, north-east Delhi||New DelhiWater supply continued to remain affected in parts of east Delhi on Monday — for the third consecutive day — even as the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) claimed to have completed the repair work of an interconnection pipeline that had resulted in shortage in the above mentioned areas for the last couple of days. A DJB statement issued on Monday said that water supply was restored in around 90% areas that had been impacted by the repair work. Supply in areas around Mayur Vihar Phase-I, II and III, parts of Trilokpuri, Shashi Garden, Acharya Niketan and Patparganj continued to remain affected till Monday evening. “Mayur Vihar and adjoining areas are at the tail end of the distribution system; hence it will take time for water to reach there. Rest 90% of all areas have all resumed supply,” DJB said in its response. The water utility agency had said on Sunday that supply to all localities will be restored by the evening or by Monday morning. However, even in areas like Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Mandawali, Shahadara, Ghazipur and Patparganj, where supply was resumed on Monday morning, the flow was thin. Residents also complained that the water being supplied was murky and raised a stench. Water supply in some areas in east and north-east Delhi was impacted on Friday, after the DJB began interconnection work on 1200mm diameter main lines at Jal Vihar and Greater Kailash. The interconnection work was started after complaints received by residents of Vikas Kunj, reporting major leakages at the GK main lines, which resulted in water entering the basements of their houses and posing a threat to the building structure. DJB on March 11 had issued an advisory to people that due to the repair work of pipeline, the water supply would be affected from 10am on Friday to 10am on Saturday. However, by Saturday the water utility agency had issued a fresh advisory, extending the timing of the shortage till the next day morning. On Monday, several residents took to Twitter tagging DJB’s official handle, asking when the water supply will be restored to these areas. “It has been over 72 hours since there is no water in MV phase-3. You said that the supply will be restored by yesterday (Sunday) evening. Pl (Please) find a sol (solution),” tweeted Prakash Tiwari. DJB officials said that throughout Monday, water tankers were being made available to residents of these areas free of cost, to make up for the shortage. “By evening supply had come in 99% of the localities and by Tuesday morning regular supply would continue,” a senior DJB official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/water-shortage-continues-in-parts-of-east-northeastdelhi-101615834193500.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||BJP welcomes Bill, Congress calls it murder of democracy||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday welcomed the Centre’s move to amend the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act and give overarching powers to the city’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G), even as the Congress termed it as a “black day” for the city.The bill, introduced in Parliament on Monday, said “government” in Delhi will mean the L-G in context of all legislation passed by the city-state’s assembly and made it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G’s opinion before any executive action, reviving a power tussle over the governance of the Capital between the Centre and the elected AAP government.The Congress, which governed Delhi for 15 years before being defeated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2013, slammed the BJP for curtailing the powers of an elected government as well as the ruling party in the city for being a “mute spectator” despite the knowledge that the Union Cabinet had, in February, approved a proposal to amend the Act.Delhi Congress vice-president Abhishek Dutt said, “It is black day and a black decision, as it curtails the power of a democratically elected government. This will destroy Delhi’s democratic powers. But the ruling AAP party and a weak chief minister are equally responsible for it. This decision was approved by the Cabinet in February. Why didn’t Kejriwal, who is known for sitting on dharnas, protest against it? Why didn’t his ministers or MPs voice their dissatisfaction? All Kejriwal did was tweet against it.”BJP leaders, however, welcomed the Centre’s decision, and the party’s Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta said most administrative powers in the Capital will continue to rest with the state government.“Even after the amendment Bill, 75% of administrative work and power will rest with Delhi’s government. It will be better that the Arvind Kejriwal government concentrate on good governance and developing Delhi, instead of starting a new power struggle.”Meanwhile, accusing the AAP of misgovernance, BJP leader Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly, called the L-G’s office the “ultimate” authority. “Public money is being wasted, due to which Delhi is in a mess. No new development work has been initiated by this government. As Delhi continues to be a Union Territory, the L-G has the ultimate power. The Centre has only defined the powers more clearly. As for their charge of losing elections, the BJP won all the seats in Delhi for a second term in the 2019 Lok Sabha. The Centre has the people’s support,” Bidhuri said.The Congress, however, said the move was against the basic tenets of the Constitution. Former Congress MLA Anil Bhardwaj said, “If the Bill is passed, it will be a black day for Delhi, the murder of democracy, and a clear violation of the basic tenets of the Constitution.”The BJP hit back and said the Congress, when in power in the state and Centre, failed to give Delhi full statehood. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said, “The Congress should answer why their government didn’t give full statehood to Delhi. Their government was in power [in the Centre] when the GNCTD Act was passed in 1991. The state government was not given all the powers. When the BJP came to power [in Delhi] in 1993, the ultimate authority was the L-G. In fact, at that time, important departments like Delhi Jal Board, DTC, DESU and others were not with the Delhi government. There was cordial coordination between the Centre and the-then CMs (Madan Lal Khurana and Sahib Singh Verma, both of the BJP), who brought these departments under the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-welcomes-bill-congress-calls-it-murder-of-democracy-101615834192353.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||‘Daily governance, House panels set to be affected’||The proposed amendments to the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act, 1991, if turned into a law, will have implications on day-to-day governance, and will also affect the functioning of the Delhi assembly committees, officials, bureaucrats and experts said on Monday.In a media briefing shortly after the bill was tabled in the Lok Sabha, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia addressed two amendments proposed by the Centre -- one, the definition of “government” to imply the Lieutenant Governor; two, the power of the L-G to look into matters other than the three subjects under his jurisdiction (public order, land, and police).Senior government officials said a third dimension to the proposed amendments suggests that Delhi assembly committees will not be allowed to enquire into day-to-day administrative decisions of the government.“This effectively implies that most of the House panels will become void, and the assembly rules from which these committees have been formed will also be void. The public accounts committee, which looks into the accounts of the government and the budgetary allocations, might go in such a case,” said a senior Delhi government official on condition of anonymity.The official added that the proposed amendment will also give officials some protection if they are summoned by any House panel as the definition of “day-to-day administration” is not clearly defined.“That way, several matters taken up by an assembly committee can be categorised as a subject of day-to-day administration. For example, if a committee is enquiring into the number of EWS category people who availed various government benefits and summons an official, the person can refuse citing the issue falls under day-to-day administration,” said the official.A second official added that if the Bill becomes law, the L-G will have to issue a “general” or “special order” clarifying the matter or subjects he would like to keep under his jurisdiction.“There will be increased friction between the legislature, the executive, and the Union government. This is because the amendment states that not just decisions of the council of ministers, but the opinion of the L-G will have to be sought on the decision taken by every minister. Delhi has seven ministers, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, and each of them issues dozens of orders/directives on a daily basis. The back-and-forth of files would only delay a lot of projects,” said the second official.PDT Achary, former secretary general of Lok Sabha, was of the view that the amendments were intended to strengthen the hands of the L-G and hobble the elected government. “This totally nullifies the 2018 Supreme Court judgment, which clarified that the L-G is bound by the aide and advice of the elected government, except for matters related to the police, public order and land in Delhi, which primarily comes under the L-G’s domain. There was no need for the concurrence of L-G on day-to-day administrative decisions except those three subjects,” he said.“But this peculiar amendment states the elected government will have to obtain an opinion from the L-G on all decisions. The L-G is under no compulsion to give his opinion on all decisions, which effectively means most of the decisions will be stalled or will be hanging in the middle,” Achary said.A third senior government official said instances of power tussle between the L-G and Delhi government reduced after the SC’s intervention in 2018. “If this Bill is passed, bureaucrats may be caught between the L-G’s office and the political executive,” said the official.Raghav Chadha, AAP MLA from Rajendra Nagar and chairperson of the Delhi Assembly committee for peace and harmony, said to directly curtail the powers of the Assembly committees is to indirectly limit the power of the legislative assembly which represents nothing but the will of the people of Delhi.“This Bill is an affront not only to the will of the people, but to the spirit of federalism. The legislative assembly committees have been an important tool deployed to oversee the functioning of the government and is an integral part of the administrative checks and balances that exist in a democracy,” he said.Lawyer Gautam Bhatia suggested several of the provisions of the bill are specifically designed to nix the ongoing enquiry by the Delhi assembly into the 2020 riots, and suggested that they could be challenged.“Look at the proposed amendment to Section 33, which specifically bars the Delhi assembly from constituting committees to enquire into ‘the day-to-day affairs of the administration’, AND makes it applicable with retrospective effect,” he tweeted.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta, “Even after today’s amendment Bill 75% of administrative works and powers will rest with Delhi’s government and it will better that instead of starting any new power struggle Arvind Kejriwal government concentrates of giving good governance and developing Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amendment-will-hit-daily-governance-experts-101615834192860.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Toolkit case: Delhi court disposes of anticipatory bail pleas of Jacob, Muluk, Kar||The Delhi Police on Monday told a city court that it would give seven days’ prior notice to Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob, Pune engineer Shantanu Muluk and climate activist Shubham Kar Chaudhuri in case the police believe that their arrest is “unavoidable and imminent” in the toolkit case.Accepting the police submission, the three sought to withdraw their pleas seeking anticipatory bail and additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana, accordingly, disposed of the petitions. The trio, along with climate activist Disha Ravi, has been charged with sedition for creating and sharing a toolkit on social media related to the ongoing farmer’s protest against the three farm bills. While hearing arguments on the anticipatory bail pleas of Jacob, Muluk and Chaudhuri, Rana also noted the police submission that technical evidence is being gathered and information has been sought from intermediaries such as Signal and Telegram “whose USP is to be reluctant in sharing the information”.The police told the court that information also has to be sought from Zoom and other social media platforms while also claiming that of the 70-80 participants in the Zoom meeting of the Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) held on January 11, allegedly attended by the accused, information has been obtained with respect to just two participants.Appearing for the police, additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that the investigation is at an initial stage and technical analysis has to be done.The court said the process would be time-consuming and custody (of accused) cannot be given to “instil fear”. The police said Muluk had deleted all images and whatever else was on there on his device and these can’t be retrieved.To this, Rana remarked, “What will you do in custodial interrogation then… You can’t do it to create fear. You have to show me how you would collect evidence during interrogation”.At this point, the defence counsels said they would withdraw the anticipatory bail pleas provided that the police agreed to give them advance notice of seven days in case they intend to arrest their clients.Noting their submissions, the court disposed of the pleas by the trio. It directed the police to give seven days’ notice if it gathers enough evidence to arrest the accused.The police had registered a case on February 4 for sedition, promoting hatred among groups and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg tweeted the ‘toolkit’ while expressing her support to the farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/toolkit-case-delhi-court-disposes-of-anticipatory-bail-pleas-of-jacob-muluk-kar-101615834191677.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||Gun goes off accidentally at wedding, two get hit by same bullet||An accidental firing by a man carrying an illegal pistol at a wedding in north-east Delhi’s Maujpur left him and another guest injured on Sunday evening, the police said.The man, identified by the police as 28-year-old Vishal Thakur, was arrested and booked under the Arms Act, said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east). “We have identified the source who provided the illegal gun to Thakur. We are trying to arrest him as well,” said the DCP.Sunday’s firing is the latest in a series of shooting incidents in north-east Delhi. Before that, between Friday and Saturday, three separate incidents of shooting left a man dead and two others injured in the district. The police said they have solved all those three crimes.The latest firing incident, the DCP said, was accidental, even though the gun itself was illegal, making the entire incident the result of a criminal act.Thakur, a resident of Shalimar Garden Extension in Ghaziabad, was attending a friend’s wedding in Maujpur on Sunday night when the firing happened. He runs a gymnasium in his neighbourhood.“Thakur and his friend, Suraj Dhaka, were leaving the function and getting on their motorcycle when the gun that Thakur was carrying accidentally went off. The bullet first pierced his thigh and then the knee of Dhaka sitting behind him,” said the DCP.Both men fell off the motorcycle and had to be taken to a nearby hospital even as the police were alerted.The DCP said an injured Thakur was soon arrested. Since it was difficult to immediately establish if Dhaka too had anything to do with the gun, no legal action was pursued against him. The injuries to both the men are not life-threatening, police said.Last year, there were 672 incidents of firearms used in crimes in Delhi, just a few number short of the 736 such incidents in 2019.

16-03-2021||Delhi||Carriageway from Delhi to Ghaziabad reopened||Vehicular movement from Delhi to Ghaziabad through Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border was restored a little after Sunday midnight, as police opened one carriageway that had remained shut for the past 48 days, since violence broke out during the farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day. The Ghazipur border as such continues to remain closed with farmers camping there for the past 110 days to protest against three contentious farm laws.All the six carriageways of Delhi-Meerut Expressway, NH-9, and NH-24 were completely blocked with multilayered barricading and deployment of police personnel following the violence that erupted during the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 (Republic Day). Movement of vehicles through the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border has remained affected since November 25-26, when thousands of farmers —who arrived from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand — occupied the roads after they were stopped from entering Delhi.As a result, the other five carriageways connecting Delhi and Ghaziabad are still closed.In a message posted on social media at 1.45am on Monday, additional deputy commissioner of police (east) Vinit Kumar said, “In view of the prevailing law and order situation at the Ghazipur border and keeping in mind the public convenience, the carriageway of NH-24 going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi has been opened in due consultation with the police officials of Ghaziabad, UP.”Earlier, on March 2, one of the carriageways had been opened for six hours before being blocked again, as police officers said there was no official order for opening the route.Motorists, who used the stretch on Monday, responded warily to its opening. “We are not rejoicing as the police may close it again. No one really cares about us,” said Sanjeev Kumar, a resident of Kaushambi who works at a finance company in south Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/carriageway-from-delhi-to-ghaziabad-opened-at-up-gate-after-remaining-shut-for-48-days-101615834130513.html

With the help of the audit report, the authority aims to figure out the land it can earmark for the development of industrial or residential plots.The agency will be tasked to carry out a survey across 54 villages and sectors, to determine undeveloped and non-government land available in the city.According to the officials, once the survey is completed, the agency will audit as to how much land can be used for the new projects, including industrial or residential purposes.“We will rope in a private agency, which will work on the audit report, and then decide on the development of the city,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer (CEO), Noida authority.The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the Noida authority to identify the land, which has already been acquired and can be used for the given purposes. The state government also wants to identify land belonging to private landowners and can be acquired for industrial or other purposes.The UP government also wants to identify the available government land, so that it can be protected from the land mafias. They grab lands and construct unauthorised properties, causing revenue loss to the government, said the officials.Right after coming to power, the UP government had directed the Noida authority to carry out a land audit of the available government land. The land department had conducted an audit, which showed that at least 250 hectares of land was to be acquired along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. But, due to shortage of staff, the department was unable to figure out the available government land in each village which could be used for different purposes such as residential, commercial or industrial, the officials said.“The authority had conducted an internal audit in 2018, but there is a need to hire an agency that can conduct the land audit for planning in the future,” Maheshwari added.The authority will also conduct a survey of around 550,000 square metres of undeveloped government land in City Centre, to understand if there is a requirement of land for group housing in the market. “Once we know about the demand for the land, we will float the scheme to sell this land,” according to Maheshwari.The authority has mixed-use land in City Centre, and it can sell it to the developers. The officials estimate that they can raise around ₹2,000 crore by selling this government land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-authority-to-rope-in-pvt-agency-for-land-audit-101615833531048.html

It aims to ensure that the C&D debris does not remain unattended on roads, pavements, in residential areas among others.Once a complaint is filed, the officials will collect the C&D waste — which causes sanitation and environment pollution issues — from the area concerned.“People can file their complaints with regard to C&D debris via the toll-free helpline number (18008919657) any time. They can also send their complaints through the WhatsAap number (9717080605),” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority.“Once the complaint is filed, our staff will contact the person concerned and collect the waste. The debris will be transported to our plant for treatment and recycling, as per the rules,” Mishra added.The C&D waste plant is built on 5 acres of land in Noida sector 80. There are 14 collection points where the waste will be collected and transported to the plant for recycling. However, bulk waste generators will have to pay for the collection of the C&D debris. Bulk waste generators such as contractors, realtors among others will be charged ₹494 per tonne, the officials said.“If bulk waste generators dump the debris at the plant in sector 80 directly, then they will have to pay ₹145 per tonne, for the recycling. However, the facility has been made free for the common people,” said Mishra.The authority will treat 300 metric tonnes of C&D debris at the plant on a daily basis and plans to make bricks/tiles out of the treated waste. It had sanctioned ₹81 crore for the plant on September 6, 2018, to handle the C&D debris properly. It now focuses on handling all types of waste, including the C&D debris, to score better in Swachh Survekshan 2021. Swachh Survekshan is an annual survey of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation in cities and towns across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-authority-opens-call-centre-to-address-c-d-debris-complaints-101615833530450.html

During the period, the city suffered 33 days under the ‘severe’ category and 74 under ‘very poor’ which are considered high levels in terms of air quality index (AQI), figures of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) have revealed . As per the UPPCB figures, only one day was under ‘satisfactory’ category, 10 under ‘moderate’ and 23 under the ‘poor’ AQI during the said period. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. The official figures indicate that water sprinkling on a total of 4,344km of different road stretches was taken up, besides roads of nearly 3,530km were also taken up for mechanical sweeping every week. As regards the enforcement, about 13,962 inspections were taken up and notices served to 395 erring persons or establishments, and 148 FIRs were lodged. Besides, penalty of ₹1.97 crore was imposed against different defaulters for spreading pollution. “The impact of air pollution has also been as a result of meteorological conditions. Besides, due to increase in traffic due to diversions in trans-Hindon areas, our two monitoring stations at Indirapuram and Vasundhara were high on pollution levels. We are working on a plan under which ₹60 crore was received by the municipal corporation,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. The traffic diversions in trans-Hindon have been in place since November when the protesting farmers arrived at the UP Gate and are camping there since then. “The Grap is generally observed from October 15 to February 15. This year, we have received directions from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on March 5 for lifting of ban on diesel generator sets. So, we are assuming that Grap has ended on March 5. The CPCB has also issued more directions which we need to take up regularly,” Sharma added.Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist, said that the pollution levels have been high during the winter season. “This is happening continuously for the past 4-5 years and officials have no clues whatsoever to deal with the situation. More ground level enforcement and a comprehensive study on wind pattern, changing meteorological conditions and contribution of sources, is must to deal with the situation,” Vashishtha said. In its directions, the CPCB has asked the state agencies to ensure that large construction sites adhere to norms and stringent actions should continue with special emphasis to hotspot areas. The funds of ₹60 crore received by the municipal corporation are specifically devoted to air pollution abatement measures. “Our work with regard to the funds is under tendering process. Further, we are also expecting to receive 50 electric buses from the state government once the infrastructure gets complete by April. The buses will largely help in reduce pollution, besides providing safe journey for local commuters,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-good-days-during-grap-period-in-ghaziabad-city-mostly-suffered-very-poor-aqi-days-101615833410612.html

Health officials said that they will conduct both the rapid antigen tests and the RT-PCR tests for the passengers arriving at Ghaziabad from the states having high incidence of Covid-19 cases. “We have deployed a team that will conduct random tests for 10-15% of passengers from states like Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. The railway authorities have also been requested to provide us a list of such passengers so that they can be screened at their homes as well. We will carry out rapid antigen tests for symptomatic cases, while random RT-PCR tests will also be taken up,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The officials said that during the past 10 days, about 122 positive cases were detected in the district and 35 of their 1,488 contacts were found positive. According to the state Covid-19 bulletin, Ghaziabad on Monday reported seven new cases, taking the overall tally to 26,887 which include 102 deaths.

We have also received directions from the state officials to increase our daily testing target. For this, we have formed five more teams, and now we have a total of 25 teams taking up testing and surveillance,” the CMO said. The Ghaziabad district is already assigned a target of conducting 3500 rapid antigen tests and 1700 RT-PCR tests per day. The officials said that the daily average of tests is about 2200 in the first fortnight of March and low since cases declined considerably during winters. “As a result, their contacts also declined, and it also affected daily testing.

This is an indication of a second wave, is what the experts have conveyed to me,” Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru on Monday.The chief minister held a meeting with the health department and other experts to discuss possible measures to deploy in order to contain the growing number of cases in the state.His statements come at a time when Karnataka and Bengaluru in particular has seen a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, raising cause for concern in the south Indian state, which has let its guard down to allow economic activities and bring in some much needed revenue to the cash-starved state.There were 932 positive cases reported across Karnataka on March 14 (Sunday) and seven deaths. Of this, 550 were from Bengaluru, including five deaths, taking the total number of active cases in India’s IT capital to 6,454, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.The meeting raises alarm among the city and state’s residents of any decision of a relapse into the lockdown as a measure to contain the growing number of cases. He said the government will watch how the public reacts to the requests of maintaining safety protocols for a week before deciding its future course of action.The chief minister also indicated further measures after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 17.“In order to balance economic activity and avoid lockdown, I request all citizens of Karnataka to wear masks, maintain social distance at public places,” he said.Yediyurappa reiterated that people should cooperate with the safety protocols to help the government refrain from announcing further restrictions or another lockdown.He said the health department should initiate talks with private hospitals to keep beds, oxygen tanks and other requirements ready like earlier.Yediyurappa said that authorities should increase vaccinations in districts that have seen a rise in Covid-19 cases. He acknowledged that the rate of vaccinations was not going according to the rate at which the state would require.The chief minister said the rate of vaccination among front-line workers was just around 58% and directed concerned authorities to increase the inoculation.Karnataka has so far vaccinated over 14.96 lakh people (first and second dose).The technical advisory committee also said that senior citizens should be identified with the help of voters’ list for vaccination. The committee also recommended setting up vaccination centres in large apartment complexes.The chief minister said that the earlier decision to impose a cap of 500 people will continue in marriages, public and political events and violators will be penalised heavily. The committee also suggested testing shopkeepers, bus drivers and others to identify cases at the earliest and contain them.The earlier directive of mandatory Covid-19 negative certificates for people coming from Maharashtra and Kerala will continue, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/experts-hint-at-possible-second-wave-of-covid-101615833233445.html
16-03-2021||Other||Project to construct bee fences launched to stop animal-human conflict||BengaluruThe Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) on Monday rolled out its pilot project, RE-HAB (Reducing Elephant-Human Attacks using Bees), as a measure to contain the growing instances of human-animal conflict in the coffee-growing region of Kodagu, about 225 km from Bengaluru.The project, estimated to cost ₹15 lakh, proposes to create “bee-fences” to mitigate human–elephant conflicts in the district, state and country.“The objective of Project RE-HAB is to thwart elephant attacks in human habitations using honey bees and thus reduce fatalities of humans as well as retaliatory deaths of elephants in the hands of humans,” according to the statement by KVIC.The project was launched at four locations around Chelur village in Kodagu district, located around the periphery of Nagarhole National Park and Tiger Reserve, and are known to be human-elephant conflict zones.The initiative comes at a time when there has been a growing number of human-animal conflict in Karnataka.According to data from the Karnataka forest department, there have been 17,561 incidents of human-animal conflict in 2020-21 as against 16,314 in 2019-20. A majority of this includes destruction of crops, plantations, attacks on cattle and livestock among other incidents, according to the department.The ecologically rich south Indian state is also home to over 6,000 elephants (2017), 524 tigers and 1,783 leopards spread across five national parks, 23 wildlife sanctuaries and one conservative reserve, which includes five tiger reserves.The statement added that the project served a dual purpose as it is also aimed at increasing the bee population, considered key to the environment as they are one of nature’s best known pollinators.The organisation has set up 15-20 interspersed bee boxes in the passage ways of elephant-human conflict zones to block the entrance of animals to human habitations. A string attached to the boxes acts as a trigger when elephants attempt to pass through, which will set them off and dissuade them from progressing further.“High resolution, night vision cameras have been installed at strategic points to record the impact of bees on elephants and their behaviour in these zones,” the department said.“It has been scientifically recorded that elephants are annoyed and even frightened of honey bees. Elephants fear that the bee swarms can bite their sensitive inner side of the trunk and eyes. The collective buzz of the bees is annoying to elephants that force them to return,” Vinai Kumar Saxena, the KVIC chairman, said in a statement.According to KVIC, over 500 people die every year due to elephant attacks in India, which is 10 times more than casualties caused by big-cats. Over 170 human fatalities have been reported in Karnataka alone and over 500 elephants have also died as a result of such conflicts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/project-to-construct-bee-fences-launched-to-stop-animal-human-conflict-101615833232900.html
16-03-2021||Other||Airport train services fail to attract daily passengers||Bengaluru: Less than 50 people on a daily basis use the airport train services that were launched by the South Western Railway (SWR) amid a lot of fanfare in January this year. Even though the ticket is priced at just ₹10, the ridership continues to remain low, according to SWR.The average cost of travelling to Kemepgowda International Airport here ranges from ₹700 to ₹1,400.Experts in the city are not surprised at the low figures. “The train runs at odd hours and the frequency is not great either. Considering the fact that the railway had shut down the service for some work (during the second week of February) shows there is a lack of consistency. It was obvious that the project would not be a success and will require more time to settle,” Srinivas Alavilli, head of civic participation of Janaagraha, a non-profit organisation working for urban governance, said.Even though a SWR spokesperson said that efforts are underway to revise the train schedule to attract more passengers, activists claimed that the service was nothing less than eyewash. Instead of a single service only to the airport, the work on the suburban line to the airport which has been delayed due to “bureaucratic egos” should have begun by now, they argued.The 41.40 km suburban line connecting Bengaluru city railway station to the airport via Yeshwantpur was approved by the Union Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs in October 2020. Following this, K-RIDE (Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Company), joint venture between the state and Centre, announced that the airport line would be a priority and be completed in three years.However, following a meeting between the government and the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), K-RIDE changed its plan to develop the direct airport line first.“Even though the BMRCL has not received approval for their airport line, they are asking K-RIDE not to prioritise the same. Clearly, they are concerned that the sub-urban rail would affect their plans to have a metro line to the airport,” Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a rail activist, said.“With minimal land acquisition requirements, K-RIDE could have ensured that the train chugs to the airport terminal within the stipulated time of three years. But because of this competition, the people of Bengaluru have been denied convenient transport to the airport,” he added.Activists also pointed at the lack of coordination between authorities responsible for public transport in the city. “The smooth integration of the bus, suburban rail and metro is the solution for providing a seamless transportation network. But the fact remains that there is a lack of coordination and an urgency to prioritise the work by these agencies,” Alavilli said.Experts believe that a plan to effectively use both the sub-urban rail and metro is still not on the cards.A former Indian Railway official, on the condition of anonymity, raised flags over the current plan for the suburban rail network.“If you look at the map of the proposed railway network, it is ‘urban rail’ rather than ‘suburban rail’ as it only reaches the edge of the city. Ideally, the suburban railway should have been connected to the district in the outskirts of Bengaluru like Tumkur and Chikkabalapur while metro should have been provided for commuting within the city,” he said.He added that when compared to other cities running sub-urban rails, the proposed 148 km is not good enough.“Bengaluru needs at least a 500-km long suburban rail network (according to the proposal, the suburban rail will be 148-km long). Mumbai has more than 700 km, Chennai has over 500 km while Kolkata has 1,500 km of suburban train. There should be long term planning for such development where commutation to Bengaluru from neighbouring districts would be faster. There is no such planning right now,” he said.A K-RIDE official, preferring anonymity, said that work has begun on the Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur- Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Byappanahalli- Rajanukunte lines.“This is because of government instructions. It is not that we will not work on the airport line, but it will happen much later,” the official said.The official refused to comment on the rivalry between the two agencies leading to the delay in the project. BMRCL spokesperson was not available for comments at the time of filing this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/airport-train-services-fail-to-attract-daily-passengers-101615833231753.html
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||4 Covid warriors test +ve month after getting 2nd shot in Mohali||Four healthcare and frontline workers who were administered the second and final dose of Covishield in February have tested positive for Covid-19 in Mohali. A similar case surfaced in Chandigarh too. Those tested positive include two doctors and a staff nurse of the civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, a field officer posted at the civil hospital in Lalru, also in Mohali district, and a healthcare worker at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Urging people not to hesitate from getting vaccinated due to such cases, doctors said that vaccines have limited efficacy and their importance lies in decreasing the chances of contracting the disease as well as its severity.“The level of antibody response varies from person to person. It is very much possible that a person tests positive after getting vaccinated. Data too suggests that the double dose efficacy of the vaccine is 62%. Getting vaccinated is important as it decreases the severity of the disease,” said Dr Madhu Gupta, principal investigator of Covishield vaccine trials at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research.Dr Deepak Chawla, nodal officer for immunisation at GMCH, said that after people are vaccinated, they are advised to keep taking precautions. “Vaccine is majorly effective against the severity of the disease, hospital admissions and death. It does not grant guarantee until a large segment of the population gets vaccinated,” he said.Mohali civil surgeon Adarshpal Kaur said the four staffers who tested positive have mild symptoms and are in quarantine. “The vaccination is being carried out by trained staff under the direct supervision of specialist doctors. We administer the shot with the surety that the person will not have any side effect and it will not endanger life. The vaccine is very safe and no one should hesitate from getting it,” she said. In Mohali, 7,051 healthcare workers and 5,819 frontline workers have got the first dose of the vaccine. Among them, 3,507 and 891, respectively, have got the second dose. In Chandigarh, 13,266 healthcare workers and 13,051 frontline workers have been vaccinated, with 4,603 and 1,622, respectively, getting the second dose as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-covid-warriors-test-ve-month-after-getting-2nd-shot-in-mohali-101615833231223.html
16-03-2021||Noida||Greater Noida car jacking: 4 cops sent to police lines for negligence||Greater Noida:Four police personnel were recalled to the district police lines on allegations of negligence following the Sunday evening robbery of a vehicle from an engineer in Greater Noida. The assailants, who carjacked the SUV at gunpoint in Sector Omicron around 6.45 pm on Sunday, are yet to be unidentified.Nishant Dhanda — an engineer with an MNC in Greater Noida, his wife, and their four-month-old daughter were going to a market in their Vitara Brezza. On their way to the market, Nishant had stopped and went out of the vehicle to buy vegetables from a roadside vendor in Sector Omicron. He had left the key in the SUV as his wife and daughter were inside it. The suspects hijacked the SUV while Nishant’s wife and minor daughter were in the rear seat of the vehicle.Dhandas are residents of Omaxe Palm Greens society in Sector Mu. The suspects had pointed a gun at the victims, boarded the car, and drove away with the vehicle. They had dropped the mother-daughter duo around 200 metres away from the crime spot. Nishant called the police helpline after the incident. A case of robbery under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 392 was registered at the Surajpur police station.The family had given their statement on Monday, but due to inaction, four police personnel were sent to the Surajpur police lines.“A police post in-charge, head constable, beat constable and a constable were removed from their duty for negligence in handling the case. First of all, they are liable as such an incident occurred in their jurisdiction area. Also, they didn’t pursue the robbers yesterday, and failed to take thorough measures like setting up check posts or a perimetre to nab them,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.A patrolling team had tried to chase the suspects but they managed to evade police in a housing complex in the area.Four police teams have been formed to solve the case. Senior officials claim that they have some important clues and the robbers will be nabbed soon.“We are working on certain angles and necessary action is being taken,” said the DCP.Certain vehicle theft gangs and other known criminals are on police radar in connection to the case.“We have been told that several teams have been informed to look into the case. My wife only sustained minor injuries on her leg when she was pushed out. She is traumatized but otherwise doing fine,” said Nishant.Apart from the cops who were recalled to police lines, eight station house officers in the district were also internally transferred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-car-jacking-4-cops-sent-to-police-lines-for-negligence-101615833170545.html
16-03-2021||Noida||Goons attack staff at Dasna toll plaza, one arrested||Ghaziabad: A group of at least 10 persons on Sunday night allegedly thrashed the employees at Dasna toll plaza on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway after an argument over the payment of toll. The assailants also vandalised the toll plaza, police said, adding that they have arrested one of the suspects. Police said the entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera installed inside one of the toll cabins, and an attacker was seen beating up the staff and also throwing chairs and breaking window glasses. According to police, the incident took place at around 10pm when some men in an SUV, a Maruti Brezza, had altercation with the toll staff about paying up the toll and later some unidentified men arrived on motorcycles and attacked the toll staff. “The men on motorcycles came about 15-20 minutes after the Brezza went away. There was some technical snag with the server at the toll, so the SUV could not be identified immediately. But we have deployed teams to trace the suspects. One of them was nabbed and others will soon be identified and arrested. The men are from nearby Masuri area,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). Police said that they lodged an FIR against unidentified suspects for rioting, robbery, causing hurt and criminal intimidation at Masuri police station. “The toll staff filed a police complaint in connection with the incident and police are taking up investigation,” said Mudit Grag, project director, National Highways Authority of India. The complainant, Rakesh Pathak, is one of the staff at the Dasna toll plaza. “They were 8-10 men who had come on four motorcycles to the toll at around 10pm on Sunday. As soon as they arrived, they started beating up the toll staff and also damaged the equipment and broke the window glasses. They also snatched ₹1,260 in cash from the toll staff and fled before issuing threats and hurling abuses,” Pathak said in his police complaint. In Ghaziabad, the 135km long Eastern Peripheral Expressway has toll plazas at Dasna and Duhai interchanges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/goons-attack-staff-at-dasna-toll-plaza-one-arrested-101615833050497.html
16-03-2021||Chandigarh||A year on, uncertainty surrounds reopening of Kartarpur corridor||Uncertainly prevails over reopening of the Kartarpur corridor, which provides Indian pilgrims visa-free access to the last resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan, even as its closure in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic completed one year on Tuesday. This despite the fact that members of the Sikh community have made scores of appeals to the Union government to reopen it so as to offer prayers at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, located just 4 kilometers from the international border. Dedicated to the 550th Parkash Gurpurb (birth anniversary) of Guru Nanak, the corridor was inaugurated by the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan on November 9, 2019. The corridor remained operational for only four months before governments of both countries closed it to curb the virus spread. Even during those four months, several controversies cast shadow over it, and the turnout of pilgrims remained low. Only 59,000 people used the corridor, even as India asked Pakistan to allow 5,000 pilgrims daily and 10,000 on special days.Citing improvement in the pandemic situation, the Pakistan government first expressed its willingness to reopen the corridor on June 27 last. It then announced to reopen it on October 3, but India did not take a call. As a result, the integrated check-posts on both sides of the border continue to wear a deserted look.Since the government has allowed opening of places of worship across the country, Sikh community leaders have made scores of appeals to the central government to reopen the corridor and lift the suspension, but to no avail. ‘Covid-19 outbreak is just an excuse’ Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said the government is keeping the corridor shut on the pretext of the pandemic. “The prolonged closure gives one reason to doubt the government’s intentions. When all religious places are open and thousands of devotees are visiting them, why are Sikhs being stopped from visiting their sacred shrine? We again urge the government not to remain adamant on the issue,” he said. Sukhwinder Singh, a Sikh leader from Agwan village near Dera Baba Nanak, said, “Indian Sikhs had to wait for 70 years for opening of the corridor. Now when the corridor was constructed by spending crores of rupees, it must be reopened.Also, the corridor also raised hope of development of historic Dera Baba Nanak town which has been in a state of neglect.”Punjab cabinet minister and Dera Baba Nanak MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said, “There should be no hesitation in reopening the corridor. I don’t understand the policies of the BJP government at the Centre. If pilgrims can be allowed to visit Nankana Sahib, why cannot they travel 3-4 km through the corridor for a few hours?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-year-on-uncertainty-surrounds-reopening-of-kartarpur-corridor-101615829211113.html
16-03-2021||Delhi||NCT Bill to have ‘dangerous’ consequences on India’s federal structure: Sisodia||The deputy CM said the two proposed amendments to the GNCTD Act include changing the definition of “government” to imply the L-G instead of the elected government.Addressing a press conference, Sisodia the bill, if turned into law, will have “dangerous” consequences on India’s federal structure.Calling the move “unconstitutional” and “undemocratic”, he said the bill overrides the Supreme Court’s judgment of July 4, 2018, which gave the elected government the power to take decisions on day-to-day matters except on three subjects — police, land and public order — which is directly under the control of the L-G.Sisodia said the Bill will stall Delhi’s progress. “The BJP has meddled with the welfare and provisions for the people in various states that it holds power in. Now it wants to ensure that the people of Delhi do not benefit from rightful provisions and initiatives of the Delhi government,” he said.“By bringing this bill in Parliament, the central government has made it clear that it wants to rule Delhi through a back door channel by making the L-G ever more powerful,” he said.Also Read | Sisodia orders probe in financial irregularities of 12 DU collegesThe deputy CM said the two proposed amendments to the GNCTD Act include changing the definition of “government” to imply the L-G instead of the elected government.“The second proposed amendment to the GNCTD Act is that all files will now have to go the L-G. This in itself is an anarchist move. If this is done, then what is the point of electing a government through elections,” he said.Sisodia read parts from the Indian Constitution and also from the July 2018 judgment of the Supreme Court to justify the Delhi government’s stand that the proposed amendments are unconstitutional.“The bill implies there will be no role of the elected government. Section 239A(a) of the Indian Constitution states that Delhi will have a state legislative assembly. It (the assembly) will have powers to make laws on everything except on subjects of land, law and order and police. It also states that there will be a council of ministers headed by a chief minister who will provide aid and advice to the L-G. In case of difference of opinion, the matter will be referred to the President by the L-G, this is what the constitution states,” he said.Sisodia further said that when the AAP government came to power in 2015, the BJP started interpreting the law in such a way that the then L-G started taking up files and projects saying he is the government.“We went to the HC, which ruled in the L-G’s favour but then we moved the Supreme Court, which gave an order in our favour. The Constitution bench stated that federal balance of states should be maintained,” he said. BJP leaders have, however, hailed the move, and said the amendments will “more clearly define” the L-G’s powers in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nct-bill-to-have-dangerous-consequences-on-india-s-federal-structure-sisodia-101615809410460.html
16-03-2021||Mumbai||In Mumbai, a bomb scare, a murder mystery, and terror angle: What we know so far||In a series of fast-paced developments over the weekend, the special National Investigation Authority (NIA) court at Kala Ghoda, Mumbai on Sunday remanded assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to custody till March 25, after the central agency arrested him late Saturday night for his purported role in planting explosives in a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25. On Monday, Vaze was placed under suspension.He was arrested under Sections 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 465 (punishment for forgery), 473 (making or possessing counterfeit seal), 506(2) (criminal intimidation, if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and section 4(a)(b) (1) (punishment for attempt to cause explosion, or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) of the Indian Explosives Act, 1908.According to a top NIA official who did not wish to be named, Vaze, who had been questioned for over 12 hours on Saturday, confessed to being part of a group that placed 20 loose gelatin sticks (unassembled, without a detonator or a timer) in a green-coloured Scorpio that was found parked outside Ambani’s residence, Antilia.“Sachin Vaze is part of the group that planted the explosive-laden Scorpio on Carmichael Road (near Antilia) on February 25. He has confessed to it,” the official said.Vaze has reportedly moved the Bombay high court challenging the grounds of his arrest, and the special NIA court will take up the matter further after the prosecution refused to give Vaze a copy of his remand application citing privilege and confidentiality.Vaze is also under investigation for his role in the suspicious death of 48-year-old Mansukh Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts businessman, who was linked to the Scorpio found parked outside the Ambani residence in South Mumbai. The case is being probed by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).Also Read | In Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray’s repeated encounters with crisesVaze was in the news all of last week — he was accused by Hiran’s wife Vimla of being involved in her husband’s death; leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis sought his arrest based on Vimla’s statement, causing a political storm during the last two days of the Assembly session; state home minister Anil Deshmukh announced that Vaze will be removed as the head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch till the investigation in this case was complete; he was interrogated by both the NIA and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which are probing related aspects of this case; and on Saturday, as he was being questioned by NIA officials, a Thane district and session court refused to grant him interim protection in his anticipatory bail plea in the murder case, stating that his “custodial interrogation was necessary”.The case continues to be a political flashpoint between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Speaking to reporters from Pune on Sunday, Fadnavis said that the arrest indicated that other names will soon come out, and put a question mark on how the probe was carried out earlier. “This isn’t a small plot. It is a major plot. There are many people involved in this. All those who are involved and the reasons for doing this will come out now,” he said. BJP leader Kirit Somaiya told news agency ANI that Vaze has more than six businesses and Shiv Sena leaders Sanjay Mashelkar and Vijay Gawai were his business partners.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday came out in support of Vaze. “I believe Sachin Vaze is a very honest and capable officer. He has been arrested in connection with gelatin sticks that were found. One suspicious death also occurred. It’s Mumbai Police’s responsibility to investigate the matter. No central team was needed,” Raut told news agency ANI.On Saturday, the 49-year-old cop, who had recently been shunted to the Citizens Facilitation Centre, updated the status on messaging application, Whatsapp. It ended with the lines: “I think the time to say goodbye to the world is coming closer.”Here’s what we know of Vaze’s role — and the investigation into this case — so far:A car outside Antilia On February 25, when Bharat Patil, a security officer at Antilia placed a call to the Mumbai police control room and the Gamdevi police station regarding a suspicious SUV parked opposite the multi-storeyed house where the Ambanis reside, Vaze, the head of the CIU, was one of the many officers who arrived at the scene.A Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) officer present there that day said on the condition of anonymity that the 2.5 kg gelatin was enough to trigger a low intensity blast, but that the gelatin sticks found in the SUV were not in the form of an assembled explosive device. The mark of a Nagpur-based company found on the gelatin sticks indicated that the explosive was procured from Nagpur where it is commonly sold for mining purposes.The same day, the Gamdevi police registered an offence in connection with the incidence against unknown persons under sections 286, 465, 473, 506(2), 120 B of IPC, and 4(a)(b)(I)Explosive Substances Act 1908.On February 26, Vaze was made lead investigator in the case and CCTV footage collected from a department store across the road from Antilia revealed that the Scorpio car had arrived the previous night accompanied by an Innova and the driver had left in the latter after sitting in the car for a few hours. The driver was not visible in the footage. The Innova was later found at the Mulund toll point but the night hours made it impossible to make out who was in the car. The case was, however, later transferred to a higher ranking officer of the ATS after the Opposition began to demand that the NIA be called in to investigate.Though its chassis number was wiped clean, and the registration number on the Scorpio was fake, the cops were able to link the car to Hiran within hours, primarily because the Thane-based businessman had reported it stolen on February 18.Also Read | Maharashtra: List of cities, districts where restrictions have been imposedIt turned out that Hiran had been using the car for the past three years, but it did not belong to him. It had been given to him by a certain Peter Newton in lieu of a payment that he had defaulted on. On February 17, Hiran had parked the car on the side of the road after the steering wheel got jammed while he was driving it. The next day, he visited the spot with a mechanic, but found the car missing. Hiran visited the CIU on February 26, and later spoke to the media gathered outside. He admitted that the car was indeed his, but it had not been in his possession for over a week.Between February 26 and March 4, Hiran was questioned by several policemen from various teams. Then, on March 5, his body washed up ashore at the Retibunder creek in Mumbra, in Thane district. All his belongings were missing, and his face was found covered with a scarf, with handkerchiefs stuck into his mouth.Last week, the Union home ministry directed the NIA to take over the investigation into the explosives from the ATS; the FIR filed in the Gamdevi police station was re-registered and on March 9, an NIA team landed in Mumbai and began its investigations. It visited the creek where Hiran’s body was found. It also went to Carmichael Road, examined the Scorpio that had been towed to the Yellow Gate police station premises, and sifted through existing evidence. It also met the various police officers who were part of the initial investigation, including Vaze, assistant commissioner of police Nitin Alaknure and ACP Sripad Kale. On March 13, the three were questioned for several hours, and but only Alaknure and Kale were allowed to leave by 9.30pm.The NIA on Sunday also seized a white Innova car used by officers of the CIU headed by Vaze. Officials claimed that the car was the same Innova which had tailed the Scorpio on the intervening night of February 24 and 25, when the SUV was parked on Carmichael Road across Ambani’s residence. The Innova, bearing registration number with MH01- ZA- 403, was picked up from the motor transport department in Nagapada, an official said. The NIA visited the department late Saturday night/early Sunday morning, and brought the Innova to its office in South Mumbai around 3am on March 14. It is currently parked in the MTNL building where the NIA office is situated. The Scorpio was towed to the Gamdevi police station and later, parked at the Yellow Gate police station, shortly after it was discovered outside Ambani’s residence on February 25.Also Read | From investigators to accused: Rise and fall of officers on the police forceA statement that set the ball rolling Two days after his death, Hiran’s wife Vimla recorded her statement with the ATS, which was now also tasked with investigating the murder. Her statement spoke at great length of Vaze’s connection to Hiran, and the Scorpio.In her statement, Vimla told the investigators that Hiran, who knew Vaze well, lent him the Scorpio [that was found parked outside Antilia] in November 2020. Vaze’s driver dropped off the car at Hiran’s shop in Thane, on February 5, 2021. The car, she stated, had been in possession of Vaze for four months.Vimla’s statement also revealed that Vaze had advised Hiran, a day after the businessman had written a letter to the authorities that he was being harassed by cops and a reporter, to get arrested. Vaze told Hiran on March 3 that he would be out on bail within a few days, Vimla’s statement read. Based on this, Hiran even approached his brother Vinod to seek legal advice, and was told that he would not receive anticipatory bail at this stage in the case.On March 4, Vimla said that her husband returned from his shop at 8.30pm and told her that he was going to meet a police officer named Tawade, somewhere along Ghodbunder Road. Vimala told the investigating team that when she tried calling her husband at 11pm, his mobile phone was switched off. Later at night, when Hiran had still not returned home, Vinod called Vaze who reportedly expressed surprise at the meeting and informed Vinod that Hiran had not mentioned that he was going to meet Tawde.The following morning, Hiran’s son Meet, and Vinod lodged a missing person’s report at Naupada police station. Hiran’s body was found by fishermen on March 5 around 10.30am. The Mumbra Police handed over the body to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa and filed an Accidental Death report. Prima facie, the police said, it seemed that Hiran had died by suicide. But Vimla contested that claim. In her statement, she told the ATS team that Hiran was too good a swimmer to have drowned.“Taking into consideration all the above circumstances, I am sure that my husband was murdered,” the last few lines of Vimla’s statement read. “I suspect Sachin Vaze could have committed the said murder.”Based on her statement, the ATS began to treat Hiran’s death not as a case of suicide or accidental drowning. The agency filed a First Information Report against unknown persons under sections 302 (punishment for murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender) 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.Also Read | In Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray’s repeated encounters with crisesThe ATS team questioned Vaze for several hours. On Friday, March 12, Vaze filed an anticipatory bail plea, which came up for hearing on Saturday. Public Prosecutor Vivek Kadu representing the ATS opposed the plea and said there was prima facie evidence linking him to both, Hiran and the car.Vaze’s lawyer KM Kalekar, in turn, argued that Vaze had been extensively interrogated by the ATS, including top officials, and had joined the investigation himself to allay any apprehension.In his application, Vaze stated that he was in Dongri, South Mumbai, at the time of Hiran’s disappearance on the night of March 4, when the businessman left his home and didn’t return. Thus, there was no reason to suspect him of committing murder of the deceased.But the Thane District and Sessions Court rejected interim protection and posted the anticipatory bail hearing to March 19.“This court is not agreed to grant interim bail because there is prima facie evidence and material against the applicant, the say of the ATS IO [Anti Terrorism Squad Investigating Officer] is necessary and custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary,” the court said.Vaze, the officer Vaze, who has been placed under suspension for the second time in his career, joined the Maharashtra police force in 1990 as a sub inspector. His first posting was in Gadchiroli, a Naxal-affected area and he was moved to Thane city police in 1992. It was here that he gained a reputation of being a good criminal investigator. He was later inducted in the Special Squad of Thane crime branch.In 2000, Vaze was transferred to the Powai unit of the Mumbai crime branch. It was during his stint here when, together with three other policemen, he faced a charge of murdering Khawaja Yunus, an accused in the December 2, 2002, Ghatkopar blast case when a bomb placed under the seat of a BEST bus parked outside Ghatkopar railway station went off, killing two persons and injuring several others.Yunus, an engineer, was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch, and later reportedly died in police custody. The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) charged Vaze and three other police personnel — Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai —with murder and destruction of evidence on March 3, 2004. Following this, Vaze was placed under suspension.He eventually resigned from service on November 30, 2007. The following year, he joined the Shiv Sena.The assistant police inspector was eventually reinstated in the police force on June 6, 2020. So were the three other policemen who were booked for their alleged involvement in Yunus’s custodial death. A dispute over the framing of charges in this case is pending before the Bombay high court.On Saturday, Vaze’s Whatsapp status made a reference to this case, when he wrote: “3rd March 2004. Fellow officers from the CID arrested me in a false case. That arrest inconclusive till date. Sensing the history is going to repeat. My fellow officers are on to falsely trap me.”At the CIU, Vaze handled a few high-profile cases, including the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case in which 15 persons, including Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), were arrested. The case pertained to Republic TV, owned by ARG Outlier Media, which had allegedly benefited from purported manipulations of TRPs. The CIU filed a voluminous charge sheet against Vikas Khanchandani, CEO of Republic TV, Dasgupta and Romil Ramgarhia, former CCO of BARC, earlier this year in January.Vaze was also part of the police team that arrested Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in November 2020, in connection with designer Anvay Naik’s suicide. The police said that Naik and his mother Kumud Naik were found dead in May 2018. According to a suicide note, Naik alleged that he and his mother were forced to end their lives because he was not paid his dues amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami and two others.Recent news reports indicated that Vaze had used the Scorpio while he was part of the team that arrested Goswami. However, the reports are as yet uncorroborated.Meanwhile, in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Thursday questioned whether BJP was targeting Vaze for reopening an abetment to suicide case against Goswami and probing the Republic TV editor-in-chief’s alleged role in the Television Rating Point (TRP) scam.A Tihar jail angle On Saturday, a Delhi Police special team interrogated Tehseen Akhtar, the last known chief of the now dormant home grown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), for seven hours after two smart phones were recovered from his barrack in Tihar’s jail number 8, one of which reportedly sent out a message that claimed responsibility for the explosives found in the SUV outside Ambani’s residence on February 25.A Telegram channel was created by “jaishulhind” [Jaish-ul-Hind] on February 26 and a message claiming responsibility for parking the vehicle outside Antilia, where Ambani lives with his family, was posted from that channel. A message seeking payment in bitcoin, a crypto currency, was also sent out on this channel, which reportedly had 10 members.The identity of the members is not immediately known as the maker of the channel closed the group the following day.During the course of their investigation, the NIA discovered the Telegram message and traced it to the Tihar jail. The Delhi Police’s special cell was informed that two phones – an Oppo and a Vivo; both smart phones – were active inside the prison. At 8pm on March 11, Tihar prison authorities conducted a raid inside jail number 8 and found both phones.Akhtar, a 30-year-old civil engineer from Darbangha, Bihar, is a close associate of arrested IM co-founder Yasin Bhatkal, and is known to the authorities as being both tech-savvy and an expert in making bombs.Also Read | TRP manipulation case: Republic TV not termed accused, says Mumbai PolicePolice were investigating whether Akhtar was involved in making the Telegram channel, as he is not the only one lodged inside the high risk cell of jail number 8. A second police officer said that Akhtar shares the cell with at least four other prisoners who have also been arrested on terror charges. The four men were arrested for being operatives of IM and Al Qaeda’s Indian sub-continent module.On Saturday, Akhtar reportedly confessed to using one of the phones, and the interrogation will resume on Monday.While most of the leaders behind IM are either convicted or behind bars, little is known about Jaish-ul-Hind.“[Akhtar] seems to have a role in recovery of mobile phones from Tihar but one thing is for sure that there is no terror outfit named Jaish-ul-Hind on the ground. It’s most likely that somebody has played mischief or old Indian Mujahideen (IM) members are trying to be in limelight by claiming to be somebody else. We are investigating Tehseen Akhtar and other angles. We do not want to rule out anything yet,” said a Delhi Police officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-mumbai-a-bomb-scare-a-murder-mystery-and-terror-angle-what-we-know-so-far-101615801130413.html
