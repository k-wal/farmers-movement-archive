The victim’s family members have alleged that the assailants fired more than 30 rounds and the man was shot nearly 24 times.The police too confirmed that multiple rounds were fired, but refused to give the exact count of bullet injuries that the man might have sustained, while stating that they were waiting for the autopsy report.Police identified the victim as Dalip alias Kunal, who they said had a criminal past and he was involved in seven cases of murder, kidnapping, robbery and hurt. The police suspect that Kunal may have been killed over personal enmity. His family, however, has accused a local criminal for the murder and said that the local goon had threatened his brother around two months ago. Kunal ran a meat shop at H-block in Dakshinpuri.“We have registered a case of murder and are probing it from all possible angles. Prime facie, personal enmity appears to be the reason behind Kunal’s murder,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.DCP Thakur said that the crime took place around 11.30pm outside Kunal’s meat shop and it came to their notice at about 12.45am, after a call was received from a hospital.During initial enquiry, the DCP said, it was learnt that Kunal was standing near his shop when the four men arrived on two two-wheelers and opened fire. Kunal was declared brought dead at the hospital, he said.Kunal’s brother Sunny said that his brother was with two other persons when the four men — all wearing helmets —arrived on a bike and a scooter and opened fire. “They fired 30-40 bullets. Doctors told us that my brother was shot at least 23-24 times. We were having enmity with a local gangster, who had threatened me over the phone around two months ago,” said Sunny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-shot-multiple-times-in-dakshinpuri-police-suspect-personal-enmity-behind-murder-101616610198104.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||Police probing snatching angle in CA’s murder after his gold chain is found missing||Eight days after a 45-year-old chartered accountant (CA) was shot dead at his under-construction building in a residential colony near the Adarsh Nagar Metro station in north-west Delhi, it has emerged that his gold chain was missing since the day of the murder.This missing chain, apart from other possible motives, has prompted the police to probe a snatching angle and are looking for a snatcher, who allegedly had committed a couple of snatchings in west Delhi, a few days before the murder of the CA, identified as Anil Aggarwal. The scooter used in the murder was also used in the other two snatchings, a police officer associated with the case said, requesting anonymity. Aggarwal’s family members also confirmed that his gold chain was not among the items that the police showed them after the autopsy. Aggarwal’s son, Aayush, as well as his brother-in-law, Mohit Goyal, said the police told them that they did not find the chain on Aggarwal’s body or at the crime scene.“We are investigating the case from all possible angles and it’s too early to reach any conclusion,” said deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani, when asked if Aggarwal’s murder has any connection with his missing gold chain.Aggarwal lived with his wife and two children on the first floor of a four-storey building in Majlis Park. The occupants of all four floors, including Aggarwal, own a property on Mahatma Gandhi Road that is less than a kilometre away from their home. A four-storey building is being constructed there and Aggarwal was murdered at the under-construction site when he had gone there with his wife to meet the labourers on March 16, the police said.A woman labourer working at the site said she was cooking food while Aggarwal and his wife were talking to another labourer, when she heard a gunshot. “By the time I rushed out there, Aggarwal lay bleeding on the floor. An unidentified man had shot him and fled on a scooter,” said the woman, who did not share her name.A case of murder and use of firearm was registered and several teams were formed to identify and nab the suspect. The investigating team scanned CCTV cameras around the crime scene and the routes that the suspect had taken. It helped them identify the scooter and its owner, who told the police that it was stolen some days ago from central Delhi. The owner also said teams from police stations in west Delhi had also contacted him regarding the use of his scooter in snatching incidents, said the officer cited above.After picking up some clues, the police teams of west and north-west districts are conducting searches at various places, including Uttar Pradesh, to nab a snatcher who could be involved in Aggarwal’s murder and the snatching incidents of west Delhi, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-probing-snatching-angle-in-ca-s-murder-after-his-gold-chain-is-found-missing-101616610197548.html

During a visit to Karol Bagh on Wednesday, HT saw civil defence volunteers issuing challans to those who were not wearing a mask and most shopkeepers ensuring that their premises were not crowded. A camp of civil defence volunteers has been set up at the main entry point to the market, near Karol Bagh Metro station, where people can also register for vaccination. Civil defence volunteers were seen cracking down on violators on Ajmal Khan road in the market. “We have issued challans to at least six to seven persons who were not wearing a mask. There are people who do not wear masks properly but we cannot fine everyone, so we educate them about the importance of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” one of the civil defence volunteers deployed in the market said on the condition of anonymity. Barring a few shops, crowding was not observed at most of the establishments. Strict compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour was being observed at most shops. The market association has issued specific instructions to the traders regarding adherence to the Covid-19 guidelines.Ram Lal, general secretary, Karol Bagh Traders Federation, said continuous efforts are being made to ensure that people follow Covid-19 protocols. “We have issued instructions to all shopkeepers in the market to not entertain any shopper without a mask and also ask them to sanitise their hands while entering their establishments. We also make public announcements regarding maintaining social distancing in the market. We are working closely with police and the district administration to maintain discipline in the market,” Lal said.Ajay Bajaj, advisor of the federation, said they hold regular meetings with the authorities for proper implementation of Covid-19 guidelines in the market. He, however, said the footfall has gone down due to the pandemic. However, at Ghaffar Market, a popular hub for electronic items, there was chaos. HT spotted several shoppers either without a mask or many wearing them improperly.There was hardly any social distancing with street vendors occupying road space and shoppers jostling for space.“Fear of coronavirus seems to have ended among the public and hence many visitors come to market just to hang out. People should understand the gravity of the situation and follow Covid-19 protocols. I have come to market today after 3-4 months as it was necessary,” Juhi Katariya, a shopper (32), said.District administration officials said that all necessary measures were being taken to ensure that the area does not turn into a “superspreader”.“Our teams are constantly monitoring the situation and issuing fines against violators. Every day, at least 100 challans are being issued by the district administration teams,” Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (central), said. 100 CHALLANS IN THE DISTRICT OR THE MARKET?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-norms-followed-at-karol-bagh-not-quite-at-ghaffar-101616610137566.html

The court though had set aside Bharti’s conviction under section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence of a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) with a JCB machine.In his plea, Bharti has said that there is no evidence and the judgment of March 23 of the Special Judge has been passed relying upon conjectures and surmises based upon the totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution foisting erroneously the guilt upon the petitioner.“That the prosecution has miserably failed to prove guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt to substantiate the charges…That there is no iota of evidence which can be attributed to the petitioner in the instant case attracting ingredients of offence u/s 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and u/s 147 IPC r/w sec149 IPC,” the plea read.“Further, the case of the prosecution is full of improvements, embellishments, contradictions and is unworthy of reliance and will fall like a pack of cards just by the stroke of the sheer hand of providence by this court,” the plea added.The matter will now be heard on May 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-stays-aap-mla-somanth-bharti-s-conviction-jail-term-grants-him-bail-101616610078731.html

It said that this contribution by the Delhi government to the corporations is used to meet the expenditures towards the salaries and other expenses on a day-to-day basis.“….we direct the Delhi government to release in the financial year the remaining amount due towards BTA to the three corporation on basis of revised estimates presented in budget for year 2021-22,” the court said.The corporations had sought that the amount deducted by the Delhi government in their revised estimates be released to them for release of salaries.The Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel advocate Satyakam, told the court that they have incurred a huge deficit in the revenue generation due to the pandemic and they would release the amount in April.However, the court said that the money should be released by this financial year. A detailed order is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi high court.Reacting to the development, Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, at a press conference, said that the decision of high court ordering immediate release of funds to the three municipal corporations has vindicated his party’s agitation, demanding fund release for MCDs.He said that BJP has all along said that due to its biased political attitude, the Arvind Kejriwal government has not allowed rise in MCDs funds as per 4th Delhi Finance Commission & Municipal Reforms Committees recommendations.“Apart from this, the Arvind Kejriwal government every year cuts the budget allocated funds of the three MCDs. Due to this biased politics of Arvind Kejriwal government, today over ₹13,000 crore of MCDs funds stand accumulated with it.“….the court today delivered a historic decision rejecting all pleas put up by Delhi government and ordered that they should in one week release Rs. 991 crores of pending funds of the three MCDs for this current financial year 2020-21,” he said, adding that the order has established that the Delhi government has with political bias stalled municipal funds and it is responsible for the problems of deficient public services faced by the people apart from the salary problem faced by the employees.The AAP did not respond to requests for a comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcorders-delhi-govt-to-pay-nearly-rs-900-crore-to-mcds-by-end-of-march-101616610079293.html

However, the Centre hinted that it may not be enough to launch the scheme on March 25. The ministry on Wednesday said that prima facie the scheme appears to “dilute” the National Food Security Act (NFSA).In a letter to the Delhi administration on Friday, the Union ministry principally raised two objections to the scheme -- the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA); and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA can only be done through a Parliament amendment. In a statement issued by the government on Wednesday, the chief minister’s office said: “The original name of the scheme, Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana, which was expected to be rolled out on March 25, will not have any name due to the obstruction by the Centre. Under the new scheme, wheat flour atta, rice, and sugar will be delivered to homes in packed bags.”However, DJ Narain, spokesperson for the Union ministry of food and public distribution, said dropping the name has nothing to do with the essential parameters of NFSA.“No reply (on the letter dated March 19) from the Delhi government has been received by the Ministry so far. We are still awaiting clarity from the Delhi government on several grey areas. From their order, prima facie it seems that many aspects of the NFSA act are either being diluted or slipping into uncertain zones,” he said. The spokesperson further asked if the additional price of milling and packaging will be recovered from consumers. “To ensure fair and foolproof transparent delivery, biometrics are needed of the fair price shop owner and the beneficiaries. Delhi remains only one of the four states in India which is still not doing it. The other three states --- Chhattisgarh, Assam and West Bengal had valid infrastructure and Aadhaar seeding issues. But Delhi has no infrastructure problem and was one of the first states/UTs to have 100% Aadhaar seeding, yet biometric system has not been implemented in the national Capital,” said Narain. On Saturday, Kejriwal said the scheme, after its name being removed, will be sent to the Central government for its approval.“This scheme will have no name. The central government sends the ration which gets distributed through the ration shops and now we will send the ration to the homes of the individuals. We do not want any kind of credit for this scheme and that is why the name of the scheme will be removed,” he said at a press conference. The home delivery system of ration will be optional for beneficiaries, government officials sad. “The file is being sent to the Central government now,” the official added. In its letter to the Delhi food commissioner on Friday, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the Delhi government is free to launch the scheme “without mixing the elements of the NFSA foodgrains”.The scheme was to be launched on March 25 from 100 households in Shahdara district’s Seemapuri area. On Saturday, Kejriwal said the scheme was planned with the intention to remove loopholes in the system and address the difficulties faced by people in getting their monthly quota of ration. Delhi has around 7.2 million ration beneficiaries, according to government data.The distribution of ration is currently managed by a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops. “At present, people can get ration only by going to a fair price shop. They have to stand in long queues or wait for shops to open as many open only for 2-3 days a month which is illegal. Then there is the problem of pilferage, adulteration and corruption. So, the doorstep delivery programme was aimed at addressing these systemic problems,” the chief minister said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-drops-name-of-ration-delivery-scheme-centre-says-it-still-dilutes-food-act-101616610078158.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||Lockdown brought to fore the humane face of policing||On the first anniversary of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, the Delhi Police on Wednesday said it has, so far, lost 34 personnel to the viral infection, while 7,733 personnel were infected. Even so, the force did its best to bring relief to people amid the pandemic -- it distributed over 12 million food packets to the needy, while 997 pregnant women were shifted to various hospitals in police vehicles during the lockdown. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the city police mentioned how they helped people by issuing movement passes, delivering food, ration and other essentials, apart from taking care of senior citizens, migrants and stray animals.Terming 2020 a “challenging year”, the Delhi Police said the lockdown brought about a paradigm shift in policing while putting a humane face on the law enforcing mechanism. After the nationwide lockdown was announced beginning March 24, police were among the first responders to the Covid-19 pandemic and were called the “Corona Warriors,” along with health care personnel and sanitation workers, the statement read.“So far, Delhi Police has lost 34 of its own -- they died while discharging their duties during the pandemic. A total of 7,733 personnel were infected, while 7,688 personnel have recovered, so far,” said city police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.While enforcing the lockdown in Delhi, Biswal said the focus of the force was to ensure that there was no panic among the people. The force also ensured that migrants had a regular supply of food, medicines, and other essentials during the months of restriction. All 15 police districts organised food networks through community kitchens.Apart from the food distribution, the police also started a helpline to address grievances of the public and to tackle emergency situations such as providing relief measures to the hungry, shelter to the stranded and aid to the helpless. The patrolling vans doubled up as ambulances for ailing and serious patients, thousands of whom were safely transported to and from hospitals.“A total of 997 women in labour were transferred to hospitals in PCR vans while nine babies were delivered in vans with the help of our personnel. In one such case, constable Dayaveer of Ashok Vihar police helped a pregnant woman shift to a hospital where he helped her deliver the child. The family named the child Dayaveer, after the policeman,” said Biswal, adding that several recovered personnel became plasma donors for those who were seriously infected. The city police said they issued movement passes to many whose family members were stranded at different locations outside the city and also to those who wanted to attend funerals of their loved ones in other states. “We were also monitoring emergencies flagged on social media and addressing them as quickly as possible. Medicines were made available to patients at their doorstep while issues of senior citizens were also taken care of,” said Biswal.According to Biswal, as a mass movement of migrant labourers towards their home towns in other states was one of the biggest challenges before the force -- these workers were persuaded by the police to stay at their homes or in shelters homes.“As migrants were already in distress, the police were briefed to be extra polite with them. Supplies of food, water and other essentials were distributed to them with the help of the civil administration, NGOs and civil society. When the lockdown was gradually eased, proper arrangements were made for them to reach their home towns,” added Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-brought-to-fore-the-humane-face-of-policing-101616610077492.html
24-03-2021||Other||Delhi govt proposes annual licence for party venues to serve liquor||New DelhiThe Delhi government has proposed introducing a new annual licence system allowing banquet halls, farmhouses, motels and other such party venues to serve liquor at events, like it is done in hotels.The government report on the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, has also recommended doubling the one-time P10 licence to ₹10,000 for hosting in-house parties — a permit which is extensively applied for by the general public to serve alcohol in private parties hosted at home or any other non-licenced premise. The report, seen by HT, talks about starting a new liquor licence specifically for banquet halls, farmhouses, party lawns and other such venues, the fee for which will depend on the carpet area of the premise. For venues having a carpet area of up to 5,000 square feet, the annual liquor license fee will be ₹5 lakh, ₹10 lakh for those above 5,000 sqft and up to 15,000 sqft and ₹15 lakh for places having more than 15,000 sqft area.“No separate P10 license will be required at any event being conducted at these venues once the yearly licence is acquired. The area will be calculated basis the entire usable carpet area, which is leased out for events and gatherings. In case of venues with multiple floors, the carpet area of each floor will be calculated,” read the report, prepared by a group of ministers, headed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.It further stated that venues that conduct multiple events will have to take this mandatory licence in order to serve liquor on their premises. Delhi has around 300 banquet halls, and most of them have multiple halls within their premises taking the total number of halls to over 1,000.But the government has also not completely done away with P10 licence as people who are organising a relatively smaller party of, say, about 50-100 people, may not want to book a banquet hall or such formal set up.“For an in-house party or any function in any community centre, the P-10 fee will be applicable at Rs.10,000/- irrespective of the number of guests. To serve liquor in banquet halls, party places, farmhouses, wedding/ party/event venues, the one-time P-10E licence fee will be ₹50,000/- per event, if the said venue does not hold a regular annual licence,” the report said.At present, P10 licence can be obtained on payment of Rs. 5,000/- to serve liquor in any party, function, marriage and so on at non-licenced premises, anywhere in Delhi, excluding public parks. The existing P10 licence fee for motels, banquet halls and farmhouses is ₹15,000 per event. Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association of Delhi said the move is in favour of owners of such venues. But he said it could turn out to be an expensive proposition for the general public or the hosts of the parties. “Even though they have increased the P10 license fee by at least 233%, the move is still favourable for us. This is because all banquet halls, farmhouses and other such party venue owners will shift to the annual licence system as it is a cheaper and more hassle-free option. It will allow us to charge for alcohol and the service provided to serve it — which means the cost of alcohol will be relatively more expensive at our venues, just like it is charged in hotels. The cost will be higher than the MRP of the bottles at our venues not only because of the service provided, but also because we will have to recover the annual licence fee paid to the government,” he said. Mandeep Singh, the owner of Bel-La Monde hotels private limited, which also owns several farmhouses and banquet halls, said the process will now be tension free for party hosts. “Many banquet halls or venue owners at present ask the hosts to themselves arrange the P10 licence and get their liquor bottles from retail stores at MRP. This licence is available online or can also be taken from an authorised liquor store from where the bottles are being procured. Most people are unaware of the procedure and used to feel hassled by the unnecessary paperwork. So, now those who are willing to pay slightly more, can just pay us and get the entire liquor part of the party or event taken care of by us,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-proposes-annual-licence-for-party-venues-to-serve-liquor-101616610019639.html

The district administration has formed two teams to take samples from people at random at 14 identified border points for a period of seven days, said district magistrate Suhas LY.Health department officials have been asked to intensify random sampling and testing at all places and “critical” pockets located near the district’s borders with the national Capital. “A few months ago, we found that the rate of the spread of the virus in critical pockets – mostly villages adjoining the Noida-Delhi border – was four times higher than in general areas. Health officials have been asked to increase testing in these areas to assess the nature of the spread of Covid-19 there,” he said.Police nod for public eventsGoing by guidelines issued by the central and state governments, prior permission from the local police is mandatory for any public event, the DM added. “The process has been made transparent and hassle-free. Before organising any public gathering, the organisers will have to apply for a permit online. If it is deemed fair by the authorities, permission will be granted instantly. For any private gathering, however, no permission is required,” he said.There is no limit, however, on the size of the crowd that can attend a public event. “However, maintaining social distancing and following all Covid-19 standard operating protocols (SOPs), are mandatory,” he said.The DM added that all industrial, commercial and educational establishments, including private and government offices, have been asked to establish and activate help desks for Covid-19, to be tasked with sanitising all persons entering the premises and to take their body temperature, in their premises to keep a close tab on the workers there. “Noida, being an industrial hub, caters to thousands of migrant workers. With these help desks, we will be able to identify persons with influenza-like illness (fever, cough) symptoms,” he said.37 new cases in GB Nagar districtGB Nagar on Wednesday recorded 37 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the district’s total positive tally to 25,836, according to the state health department’s 24-hr daily bulletin.

A video of the incident, which allegedly happened on Tuesday, was widely circulated on social media after which police registered a case and arrested the attacker on Wednesday. Police identified the attacker, purportedly caught on camera, as Ajay Goswami, a resident of Old Garhi village and a dairy trader, said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east).The officer said Goswami is an accused in the 2020 north-east Delhi riots, but clarified that his alleged involvement in the riots has no connection to the latest alleged assault. Police did not immediately share details on Goswami’s nature of involvement in the riots or the current status of that case.Unwilling to identify the victim, Sain said victim too has a criminal record and was allegedly involved in a murder and robbery case. Another police officer, who asked not to be identified, said the victim is a Muslim man. “On Tuesday, the man was allegedly trying to enter Goswami’s dairy, purportedly with the an intention to steal, when he was caught,” said the officer.Police, however, have not registered any case of theft or attempted theft against the victim. In any case, the DCP said Goswami beat up the victim while another accused, Deepak, recorded the video on his mobile phone. The video, which was widely shared on social media, showed Goswami allegedly punching the victim in the abdomen, kicking him in the face and other parts of the body, and throwing him around.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. As he beat the victim, he also kept asking him to chant ”Hindustan Zinadabad” and ”Pakistan Murdabad” slogans, which the victim repeatedly did while pleading for an end to the assault, the video purportedly showed. Once the video landed on the internet and was brought to the police’s notice, the police took cognizance of it and began probing its origin. The victim and assailants were eventually identified by Wednesday after which Goswami was arrested. Deepak is yet to be arrested.A case of voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint has been registered at Khajuri Khas police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/caught-on-camera-man-assaulted-forced-to-chant-slogans-in-khajuri-khas-one-of-the-attackers-held-101616610017542.html

While Kumar’s tenure was set to end on January 26, the education ministry on January 22 directed that Kumar be allowed to continue in his position “until further orders”.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the JNUTA alleged that contrary to the university’s claim the appointment was not approved by the competent authority. “On 17 March 2021, through an office order issued by deputy registrar...the university was informed about the appointment of a new registrar. Like in all other matters the letter stated that the decision made had the ‘approval of the Competent Authority’. The question that comes up therefore is precisely this --- who is the Competent Authority in the matter of appointment of the Registrar. Statute 8 (1) of University rules categorically states that the ‘Registrar shall be appointed by the Executive Council’ and ‘shall be a full-time salaried officer of the University’. It may be noted that there has been no Executive Council meeting where the EC has deliberated on the matter or approval for this decision has been specifically sought.”The teachers body said the appointment of the new Registrar as a “backdoor entry”. Despite several requests, the university administration did not comment on the allegations. Earlier on Tuesday, the university issued a statement condemning a section of faculty members for spreading “falsehood & malicious propaganda”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnutaalleges-appointment-of-new-registrar-backdoor-entry-101616610018171.html

The HC, however, allowed the trial court to hear any application being filed in the case.On March 23, Justice Suresh Kait vacated the stay on the trial after the police, represented by Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad told the court that complete hard copy of the charge sheet is ready and the accused may collect it from the Karkardooma court on March 25, when the case is next listed for hearing.The court said, “In view of above, no further order is required to be passed and the same is, accordingly, disposed of with pending application…. Accordingly, interim order is vacated”.Delhi police’s special cell had challenged the legality and validity of September 21 and October 21 orders by additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat, directing the police to supply physical copy of the charge sheet.On October 9, the trial court judge directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet after being told that the police “have inadvertently” put a document in it which contained the details of some of the protected witnesses and its copies were supplied to the accused booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The judge directed the police to file fresh copies of the charge sheet, redacting the details of the protected witnesses and supply it to the persons charge-sheeted in the case and their counsel.On October 21, the investigating officer told the court that he has submitted 16 new pen drives containing the redacted version of the charge sheet and accompanying documents in terms of the earlier order.However, the court directed the accused and their counsel to be provided with both the hard and soft copies of the fresh charge sheet.The judge also said that the court was not impressed with the submission of the investigating officer who had sought 15 days time for the sanction for funds from the Delhi government for taking out the hard copies for every accused. The judge directed the police to supply the documents at the earliest.Challenging these orders in the high court, the city police contended that the mandate of law under section 207 of CrPC is to provide “copy” of each of the report/ statements/ document subject to reasonable exception. It said that law does not specify supply of “hard copy” or “soft copy” nor does it draw any distinction between “hard copy” or “soft copy”.Till date, the city police has filed three charge sheets, including two supplementary charge sheets, against several accused —former JNU student Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, Gulfisha Khatoon, former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider, Shafa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan.-- for allegedly being part of a larger conspiracy in the riots that broke out in February 2020 in various localities of north-east Delhi.Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Wednesday directed the police to ensure safety and security of Umar Khalid while bringing him for the proceedings in a case related to the riots.Chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar directed the Tihar Jail superintendent, DCP (Deputy commissioner of police) and DAP (Delhi Armed Police) to ensure safety and security of Khalid while bringing him to the court and taking him back to the prison.Khalid had moved an application seeking directions for his security during his physical production in the court for the remand proceedings.He was arrested in October last year in the case of violence in Khajuri Khas area. Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain is also an accused in the case. He was also arrested in September, 2020, under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in another case related to a conspiracy in the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-riots-hc-vacates-stay-trial-court-to-hear-arguments-in-conspiracy-case-101616609958337.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||15-second snatching: Two boys strangle pedestrian before making off with his phone; both held||Less than 15 seconds is how long it took for two minor boys to allegedly strangle and choke an 18-year-old pedestrian in north-west Delhi’s Ashok Vihar and snatch his mobile phone on Tuesday, showed the footage from a CCTV camera near the scene of crime. The victim is later seen lying on the road, in pain, shouting for help. The footage of the incident was widely shared on social media, after which the police quickly apprehended the suspects, who turned out to be juveniles. Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), on Wednesday said the police used their local sources to identify and apprehend the two suspects, after a case of robbery and voluntarily causing hurt during robbery was registered at the Ashok Vihar police station.Last year, as many as 7,965 snatching cases were registered in Delhi, a 27.11% rise from the 6,266 cases reported in 2019, according to police data. Robberies, last year, on the other hand, increased from 1,956 to 1,963 cases. These were two street crimes that increased in 2020, while the other crimes decreased. Police had claimed that PCR calls related to snatching and robberies were substantially fewer last year, compared to 2019. They said such distress calls (made to the 112 number) are the best way to measure crime in an area. The snatching happened on Tuesday while Pintu Kumar, a resident of Jahangirpuri, was visiting Wazirpur Industrial Area in search of work. As he was walking on the road, the CCTV footage showed one of the snatchers approaching him from behind and strangling him.As Kumar struggles to free himself, the other snatcher also arrives from the rear to snatch Kumar’s mobile phone from his loose grip. Less than 15 seconds later, the two suspects flee the scene even as Kumar collapses on the road. As he lies there, trying to get someone to help him, the CCTV footage shows several people walking past him without stopping. Kumar then gets back on his feet and is seen looking around for help.“Kumar visited the police station on Wednesday after which we registered a case and formed multiple teams to nab the culprits. The teams acted swiftly and carried out searches before the two minors were apprehended,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/15second-snatching-two-boys-strangle-pedestrian-before-making-off-with-his-phone-both-held-101616609957526.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||Teachers back on Covid duty as cases spike||With Covid-19 cases spiking once again in the national capital, teachers of government and municipal schools are back on pandemic-related duty, causing several schools to raise concerns over the deployment of teachers for non-teaching work at a time when practical exams of board classes have begun and the evaluation process of the other classes is underway.On Wednesday, Delhi reported 1,254 cases of Covid-19 — the highest single-day spike since December 18 last year.In January, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had directed chief secretary Vijay Dev to issue an order to reduce the number of government schoolteachers deployed on Covid-19 duty to ensure that teachers are re-engaged in academic work, following which a large number of teachers was released from pandemic related work. With cases increasing again, teachers, as well as other government employees, have been asked to undertake a door-to-door mobilisation for the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive. For instance, in Shahdara district, around 124 teachers have been asked to join the survey work on Sunday. Similarly, teachers from different districts have been assigned duties at the airport in the past few days. For instance, as many as 100 teachers of the east municipal body-run schools were deployed at the Delhi airport on Covid duty last week.The deployment has not gone down well with schools, however. A principal of a government school in old Delhi said their only physical education teacher has been called back on Covid-19 work on Tuesday. “We have our class 12 physical education practical exam on Friday. How will we do that without our internal examiner? Besides, at least seven teachers who were busy uploading internal marks of students on to the directorate of education (DoE)’s portal have been assigned survey work and duty at the airport,” the principal said, without wishing to be named.Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of government schoolteachers’ association, said, “The government should not allow the district administrations to deploy teachers on Covid-19 duty at such a crucial time -- the academic session is ending and students need teachers the most right now.”The principal of another government school in Jhilmil Colony said their only IT professional had been deployed at the airport last week. “Our staff are completely dependent on the IT person for uploading student marks and preparing results. The government has already asked schools to declare results up to class 8 by March 31. How will we finish the work in such a situation?” the principal said, also on condition of anonymity.Similar concerns were raised by heads of municipal schools. A principal of the East Delhi municipal body in Gandhi Nagar said, “The result of the classes where teachers are on duty is not prepared yet. Another teacher will have to finish the work of his/her class first and then complete the work of others. So, half the students will be getting their results soon while the other half will have to wait a while.”A senior official at the Delhi government’s education department, requesting anonymity, said, “The government will ensure that teachers of important subjects and those teaching board classes are not deployed on Covid-19 duty.” Similarly, officials of the east municipal corporation’s education department said that they will look into problems caused by the deployment in their schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-back-on-covid-duty-as-cases-spike-101616609898235.html
24-03-2021||Other||50 cleared by SHO may be allowed to pray in Nizamuddin Markaz on Shab-e-Barat: Centre to HC||New Delhi: The Centre on Wednesday told the Delhi high court that 50 people chosen by the state wakf board can be permitted to offer prayers at the mosque in the Nizamuddin Markaz on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat once the names of those individuals are provided to the station house officer of the local police station. The submission was made during the hearing on a plea by the Delhi Wakf Board through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where a Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It was locked down by the authorities on March 31 last year, after removing members of the Jamaat who were staying there in violation of the curbs imposed to stop the spread of the infectious disease. An FIR was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the Markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the Covid-19 lockdown. Representing the Centre, advocate Rajat Nair told Justice Mukta Gupta that if the Delhi Wakf Board seeks permission from the SHO for 50 people, they may be allowed to enter the Masjid Bangle Wali to offer prayers on the occasion of Shab-e- Barat, which will be observed on March 28-29.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, who was representing the petitioner, urged the court to permit some individuals to pray at the mosque and assured that the adjacent madrasa will not be accessed. Gupta also urged the court to decide on the opening of the mosque before the month of Ramzan commences from April 13 “as more people would want to offer prayers at the mosque during that time”. The court listed the matter for further hearing on April 12.The wakf board, in its plea, has contended that even after Unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the Markaz -- comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and a hostel -- continues to be locked up.It has further argued that even if the premises were a part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-cleared-by-sho-may-be-allowed-to-pray-in-nizamuddin-markaz-on-shab-e-barat-centre-to-hc-101616609897540.html

Once the Central Vista project is ready, the national centre for art will move into a new campus near Jamnagar House. Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art is one of the many government buildings which will be demolished to make way for 10 new, state-of-the-art office complexes proposed as part of the Centre’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment project. The approximately ₹15,000 crore project includes construction of a new Parliament building, common central secretariat, and new residences for the vice President and the Prime Minister. While the Parliament building will be completed next year, the entire project is looking at 2024 completion.Sachidanand Joshi, member secretary of IGNCA, said, “We have started shifting out of IGNCA. Some of our divisions have already moved to our new office. We estimate that the entire shifting process will take at least two months. By the third week of April, we will physically shift everything to Janpath Hotel and by mid-May we plan to wind-up everything here.”On Wednesday, HT noted that at the arts and culture centre, work was progressing at a rapid pace to shift artefacts, paintings, collection of rare manuscripts, microfilms, the library of rare books and reference material, archives to the new five-storeyed building at Janpath hotel. The corridors of the spacious centre were spotted stacked with cardboard, wooden and aluminium boxes, that had historical material neatly packed in them.Joshi said that they have been planning for the shifting process for the past six-eight months. “We have planned the process in two steps: long and short term. There is stuff which we don’t need on a day-to-day basis. We are packing all the archival material in boxes that will be stored safely in the new building. The rest is our daily routine stuff. Some divisions have already shifted and are in the process of settling down. We have planned the shifting process keeping in mind that we will be shifting again to our new centre (Jamnagar house) in a few years.”Set up in 1985, the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Art is spread over 25 acre along the Central Vista. The centre has been developed on a design provided by American architect late Ralph Lerner, who was a professor at Princeton University. His design was selected in an international competition in which the government received 194 entries from architects from 37 countries, as per information available on IGNCA’s website. The centre has been actively involved in organising exhibitions, performances, conferences, lectures. It also offers short-term and other courses in art and culture, which currently are being held online. Joshi said that they will resume regular activities from the new centre in June.Joshi said that the space at Janpath hotel is more or less same as on the current campus. “There is an amphitheatre with a seating capacity of 400 and an auditorium with space for 160 people. There is space for galleries. There are more organised spaces there which we can convert into galleries. CPWD has refurbished the place as per our requirements,” said Joshi.IGNCA officials said that the entire campus will be handed over to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) by June this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ndira-gandhi-national-centre-for-art-starts-shifting-to-make-way-for-central-vista-revamp-101616609837546.html
24-03-2021||Lucknow||Now, UP gearing up to make budgetary sanctions paperless||The Uttar Pradesh government is gearing up to make all budgetary allocations/sanctions for 2021-2022 paperless. With this, it aims to bring about more efficiency and transparency in its functioning from the new financial year -- April 1, 2021. “All the budgetary sanctions will be paperless. We will ensure that financial sanctions at every level are paperless,” said S Radha Chauhan, additional chief secretary, finance, who issued two government orders this month to streamline the process of financial sanctions to different departments. The current financial year (2020-2021) comes to close on March 31, 2021 and any government expenditure on or after April 1, 2021 will be made as per allocations in the ‘paperless’ state budget that the state assembly passed on March 4, 2021. “As per the provisions of Article 204 of the Constitution of India, the state assembly, through the Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Act, 2021, has authorised the budgetary grants and necessary expenditure (for 2021-2022) from the consolidated fund. So, the approved grants and charged expenditure should be taken as the final budget for 2021-2022,” said Chauhan in a government order on March 22, 2021. “All the financial sanctions for new items of expenditure (as provided in the state budget), disbursement of loans etc will be issued only with approval of state finance department,” she said in the GO. The state government, along with the GO, has circulated a format on which departments are expected to provide necessary information. Besides providing details about how the financial sanctions will be issued by departments in 2021-2022, the GO asks the departments to make allotment of old age, widow and farmers’ pension etc directly to the accounts of beneficiaries. On March 10, 2021, the state government had issued another order giving details about the use of Budget Allotment System to make paperless budgetary allocations. “The state government has presented its budget for 2021-2022 as e-budget. The state finance department will perform all its functions on e-office system……Under the present system, financial sanctions are issued manually and the financial controller or respective officer makes the entry about this on the online budget allotment system. The implementation of the budget for 2021-2022 w e f April 1, 2021 will be done digitally,” the GO said. The state government also pointed out towards the problems being faced in issuing sanctions up to now and says under the present system it can’t be ensured that sanctions are being issued in accordance with budgetary provisions. It further pointed out that sanctions thus issued by administrative departments are not available to heads of department (HoDs) in real time or respective HoDs do not feed the details on the system well in time. Yashvir Tyagi, former professor department of economics, Lucknow University, said: “The UP government’s decision is a welcome step. All departments will have to be up to date in maintaining accounts now. Under the new system the state government will have greater control over monitoring of expenditure. It will enable the government to immediately know how the departments are spending budgetary allocations. This will ensure efficiency and transparency in government’s functioning and help in boosting UP’s economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-up-gearing-up-to-make-budgetary-sanctions-paperless-101616609477508.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Salon chain restricted from using name over trademark infringement||A salon chain was restricted by a local court from using the name “Apple Unisex Salon” pending a trademark infringement suit filed against them. The order was passed by judge Ashwini Lokhande on March 10 and a copy of the order was made available on Monday. However, the court has granted a four-week stay on the order in order for the defendant to approach the Bombay High Court. “Defendants, their men, agents, servants, dealers, distributors, assigns or any of them are hereby restrained from making unlawful use of the trade-mark of the plaintiff Apple Unisex Salon and/or making any or adopting or rearranging or re-alerting the words thereof in any manner for their profit and gain till disposal of the suit,” read the order. The two salon owners have been involved in a tiff about the name since the inception of the defendant’s chain, according to the complainant. The complainants claim to have registered a police complaint, sent a legal notice and then filed a civil suit in the court. “We started our salons in 2006, we applied for registration and got it in 2008. The defendant started using our mark in 2016. First, we filed a police complaint, and sent them a legal notice, they did not respond. So, we filed a civil suit in January 2019. On March 10, the court ordered them to not use the name. They applied for a stay on it and the court has granted them a stay of four weeks. We got the certified copy of the order day before yesterday (Monday),” said Akshay Borude of Apple unisex Salon. The Apple Unisex Salon business has two outlets in Pune and is registered in the name of Kavita Borude, mother of Akshay Borude. When asked for a statement from the defendant salon chain, their representative cited “ethical issues.” Advocate Sagar Bhirange refused to comment on the issue. “It will be unethical of me to comment without my client,” he said. While he was not asked to make a personal comment, he refused to forward a request for a comment to the defendant while repeatedly citing “ethical issues”. The salon chain that was started later on has a bigger operation in the city, according to the applicant. “We have no relation with them. We do not know them. They tried to get registered, but the government has not processed their application as we had already registered it. They have sold the franchise to almost 45 people. They have earned almost ₹9-10 crore using our name,” said Borude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/salon-chain-restricted-from-using-name-over-trademark-infringement-101616609181432.html

Many commuters were spotted taking an immediate U-turn at the end of the flyover from the Deccan College road towards the cemetery through the new Holkar bridge increased the frequency of accidents in the last one week. Ganesh More, a frequent commuter on the road said that in the last three days alone he has seen four minor mishaps on the road. “In all these events, two-wheeler drivers slipped and fell off their vehicle as they applied the emergency brake. They did not anticipate a four-wheeler taking a U-turn. These two-wheeler drivers were at considerable speed. If the traffic diversion is not done, someone will lose their life,” said More. He also added that the traffic in the last one week has increased exponentially. “Due to this sudden U-turn, traffic congestion has also increased on the road. There is no free flow of traffic as everyone wants to go ahead. More traffic police officials have been deployed in the area, but the regulation is less as there is too much traffic. Many commuters take the wrong side which adds to the traffic congestion,” added More. Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic for Pune city said that the traffic has increased in the area due to diversion of traffic from the Pune-Mumbai highway. “The diversion was made for the ongoing metro work. We have done the diversion at a trial level. If things go smoothly, we will continue this route for the next three months,” said Shrirame. He also added that after various complaints a ‘No U-turn’ signage was put at the end of the flyover on Monday. “To avoid any accidents, we have deployed traffic cops at the site as well to regulate the traffic,” added Shrirame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/traffic-police-shut-u-turn-from-new-holkar-bridge-due-to-frequent-mishaps-101616609178778.html

In some of the cases even colleges avoid giving it back citing various reasons, we got several complaints about the same from students,” said Amar Ekad, president of the association. “So we decided to take an overall data of this refundable amount pending with the technical education colleges and institutes in the Pune division and gave an application for the same.

24-03-2021||Pune||Two senior citizens robbed in separate incidents by men who posed as cops||Two separate incidents were recorded in Pune on Tuesday of senior citizens robbed by people posing as police officials. While one case was registered at the Alankar police station with a 65-year-old victim, the other was registered at the Wakad police station with a 73-year-old victim. In one incident, a 73-year-old woman who was walking along the Prasondham road in Thergaon area after buying milk was approached by a man around 10 am who claimed to be an official of the local police force. The man took the old woman to another person who claimed to be his superior and an officer of the crime branch, according to her complaint. “They told her that a woman her age should not be roaming with gold ornaments for her security and then a third man arrived there with a gold chain in his neck. The first person who had approached the woman pretended to go to the third man and tell him that he should not be wearing the gold either and pretended to pack up his chain in a paper for him. While the complainant was distracted by this third person’s entry, her necklace got stuck in her hair in the process of removing it. They pretended to help her and all three of them fled from there,” said assistant police inspector Tanaji Bhogam of Wakad police station who is investigating the case. The necklace weighed 40 gram and costed ₹1,60,000, according to the complainant. A case under Sections 170, 406, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Wakad police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police jurisdiction. Two hours after the incident in Wakad, a 65-year-old who was walking along the street near Karve road area of Kothrud was stopped by three unidentified people who said that a police check-post was on the route on which the woman was walking. They allegedly pretended to advise her to remove her jewellery and keep it in her bag. As she was doing so, one of them went close to her and took it before she could land it in her bag. The incident happened around 12 noon on Tuesday. The woman was also distracted using a method similar to the case in Wakad as the gold chain worth ₹60,000 was stolen. A case under Section 170 (personating a public servant), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Alankar police station against the three. Police sub-inspector S Sakhare of Alankar police station is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-senior-citizens-robbed-in-separate-incidents-by-men-who-posed-as-cops-101616609117945.html

Spread across the 600-metres stretch, the weekly market comes up on Wednesdays.Shoppers seemed least bothered about wearing masks or maintaining physical distancing, revealed a spot check by HT to assess the anti-Covid measures and the awareness level among people in the market. The market has more than 1,600 shops and witnesses an average footfall of around 28,000 people (as per records of Saptahik Bazaar Dukandaar Kalyan Samiti). Locals said cops were deployed in the market, but they remained mute spectators to the violation of Covid norms. The Saptahik Bazaar Dukandaar Kalyan Samiti — the body that works for the welfare of street vendors though made arrangements for announcements of anti-Covid measures, but these fell on deaf ears. Besides shoppers, who largely behaved irresponsibly, traders were found to be a bit more aware as most of them were wearing masks. “We are making masses aware of anti-Covid measures and have also issued strict directives for traders to wear masks and to use sanitisers,” said Mohammed Nadeem Siddiqui, president, Saptahik Bazaar Dukandaar Kalyan Samiti. In March 2020, the district administration had ordered closure of the Buddh Bazar in order to contain the virus. “In December 2020, the market was reopened after eight months,” said Siddiqui. He, however, said that further closure of the market would leave traders hand to mouth. The traders were taking all precautionary measures and spreading awareness among people,” he added. Officials of the LMC — the body that regulates the weekly markets – said things were under control. Dr SK Rawat, nagar swasthya adhikari, said: “Traders are taking all precautionary measures to keep the infection at bay. We are continuously sanitising the Buddh Bazar, before and after the market is set up. We are also running awareness drives to make shopkeepers aware of Covid protocols,” he said. Apart from Buddh Bazar, the city has four prime weekly markets. Of these, Bara Birwa area of Alambagh sees the weekly market on Tuesdays, Aminabad on Thursday, Sarojini Naidu Marg in Sadar on Saturday and Nakkhas on Sundays. As per records with the Saptahik Bazaar Dukandaar Kalyan Samiti, more than 1,800 traders were associated with weekly markets in the city. Locals said that the LMC and the district administration were yet to give a thought that such gatherings could further trigger the virus outbreak. IN NUMBERS •Buddh Bazar, spread across the 600 m stretch, was found chock-a-block with the shoppers in Covid times. ••On an average, the market witnesses a footfall of around 28,000 people (as per the records of Saptahik Bazaar Dukandaar Kalyan Samiti). •The market has more than 1600 shops. ••The city has four more prime weekly markets.

24-03-2021||Gurugram||Gang held for fraudulent insurance claims of terminally ill patients||The special task force (STF) of Gurugram busted a gang that was allegedly involved in fraudulent life insurance claims of terminally ill patients and projecting their deaths as road accidents, the police said on Wednesday. The gang used to target cancer patients and involved their family members to get their insurance policies done. Virender Vij, the superintendent of police, STF headquarters, Gururgam, said that the gang members, in connivance with family members of the patients, got the insurance policies done from various companies and after their death, claimed the insurance, estimated to be more than ₹60 lakh so far. “They used to show the deaths as accidental road deaths. They conspired with other accused and committed at least 281 offences by portraying natural deaths as accidental deaths,” he said. The police on Tuesday arrested the kingpin of the gang, identified as Salim, of Narwana in Jind, from Karnal. His close associates, Sunil, of Hisar living in Hansi, and Manoj of Kaithal, living in Janakpuri of Delhi, are yet to be arrested. Vij said they have recovered ₹66.87 lakh, 53 ATM cards, 41 cheque books, 38 OPD cards, 40 policy papers, 14 passbooks, four mobile phones and 66 new kits of different banks from Salim’s possession. They used to select cancer patients undergoing treatment at Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) in Rohtak and convinced their family members to make a quick buck. The gang would buy term insurance policies from eight companies by paying a premium on their behalf, the police said. “After the death of policyholders, the suspects used to portray it as accidental deaths to claim insurance amounts,” Vij said. The police discovered the modus operandi after an official at an insurance company in Delhi had found foul play in a policy. A deputy manager of a general insurance company in Delhi last November, during an internal investigation, found that a man, identified as Satyanarayan of Khanda Kheri in Hisar, died due to cancer but his family had stated that he died after falling from a bullock cart and suffering severe head injuries on December 10, 2017. He further alleged that the family had taken an insurance policy in October 2017 for ₹20 lakh and claimed the money after his death. He pointed out in the complaint that it was a nexus.When the police took up the investigation, they ascertained from medical reports and post-mortem examination reports that the cause of death was due to cancer. Three family members of the policyholder who died were arrested last December. “They revealed during questioning that suspects had contacted them and offered them money to get the insurance done,” said Vij. The police said they are also probing the role of others, including insurance company inquiry officers, doctors, advocates, police officials, agents and bank officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gang-held-for-fraudulent-insurance-claims-of-terminally-ill-patients-101616607919917.html
24-03-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination pace at private facilities falls||Private hospitals in the city are witnessing a gradual slowdown in the number of Covid-19 vaccinations since March 17, with nearly 14,006 inoculations done in the last eight days, comparatively fewer than 26,551 inoculations at government set-ups during the same period, according to the district health department data. Although the number of private set-ups is lower than the government centres, private hospitals had reported 25% higher coverage than government facilities between March 1 and 16.“The district health department has set up more vaccination centres compared to private hospitals. There are more than 100 government-run vaccination centres in the district and only 56 at private hospitals. The outreach of government-run vaccination centres is higher in rural and urban areas compared to private set-ups. Second, people are aware that the government has been supplying the vaccine to private hospitals, so they prefer to go to nearby health centres to take the vaccine shot,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The data provided by the district health department shows that from March 1 to 16, vaccination centres at private hospitals inoculated at least 40,809 people in the prioritised population group, which was almost 25% higher than the number at government facilities. In the last 24 days, over 56,881 inoculations of the prioritised population group have taken place at government-run vaccination centres and 54, 815 at private hospitals. Private vaccination centres account for 49% of the total inoculations since March 1. At the state level too, vaccinations at private facilities are much lower when compared to neighbouring Delhi. According to the data shared by the union minister of health and family welfare on Wednesday, only 21.4% of 1,200,479 vaccine doses have been administered by private facilities across Haryana, whereas in New Delhi, the share was 46.34%. Officials said that Delhi has set up more vaccination centres at private hospitals.Private hospital chains in the city, despite setting up multiple vaccination centres and camps in various condominiums for inoculation, agree that there has been a slight fall in vaccination. “Private hospitals cater to different strata of society, where people are aware of different vaccines available across the globe. Many people do not want to be inoculated as they have been waiting for the single-dose vaccine shot. Second, people have developed faith in the government system knowing that private hospitals procure vaccines from the government. Third, many senior citizens fear contracting infection while visiting hospitals,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, director and head, internal medicine, Medanta Hospital. According to Kataria, the response has been equally low at camps set up in condominiums. “As RWAs (residents’ welfare associations) have been catering to people within their society and not allowing people from outside, it also restricts the turnout.” Acknowledging a slowdown in vaccinations, Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, “A large number of people did get vaccinated in the first few weeks. It has declined a little bit. But with the steps taken by the district health department to outreach RWAs by setting up vaccination camps, overall coverage will be increased. Also, the widening of eligibility criteria allowing people above 45 years of age to get vaccinated, irrespective of the health issues, will increase the footfall once again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-pace-at-private-facilities-falls-101616607918664.html
24-03-2021||Gurugram||Toll plazas on expressways to be removed in pilot project||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on a pilot project to do away with toll plazas on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and Dwarka Expressway, as part of a nationwide exercise, officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.NHAI officials cited an announcement made by union transport minister Nitin Gadkari in Parliament a few days ago, in which he said that toll plazas across the country would be removed by next year.Officials, however, clarified that the removal of toll plazas would not signal the end of toll collection. “The toll plazas would be removed but a new gantry-based model is likely to be introduced, which will make it easier for toll collection through FASTags. Toll plazas, no doubt, lead to some congestion and a pilot project on closed-loop tolling on these roads is underway,” said Shashi Bhushan, project director, NHAI. Sharing details of other projects in the meeting, NHAI officials said that the U-turn at Sirhaul border will be opened on May 1, while land for shifting toll plaza is under consideration. With the opening of the U-turn at Sirhaul toll plaza, commuters from Gurugram need not travel to Rajokri in Delhi for reaching Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3 from Udyog Vihar. A statement issued by the district administration on Wednesday said that highway officials also posited that a toll plaza might not be needed at Panchgaon if the pilot project on expressways is successful.NHAI officials said they are also setting up various public amenities, including the construction of toilets near pedestrian bridges along the NH-48 from Daula Kuan in Delhi to Hero Honda Chowk, lifts for easy movement and commercial constructions to encourage people to use pedestrian bridges.The road safety meeting was held under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who asked the NHAI and all stakeholders to work in tandem and ensure better facilities for road users, particularly pedestrians.The removal of the Kherki Daula toll plaza has been a longstanding demand of city residents and industry owners in Manesar, as heavy congestion leads to long delays for commuters and also causes pollution due to increased emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/toll-plazas-on-expressways-to-be-removed-in-pilot-project-101616607919343.html

A location is designated as a black spot if more than five fatalities were reported on a 500-metre stretch within three years. The decision was taken during a road safety committee meeting held at the Mini Secretariat.Deputy commissioner Yash Garg, who heads the district road safety committee, said, “Drivers can be alerted if they spot road signage 500 metres before black spots, informing them of accident-prone spots ahead. Hence, directions have been issued to departments concerned to install them on priority. Further, directions have also been issued to officials concerned to share the latest data of black spots in the city so that remedial measures can be executed immediately.”Six spots on NH-48 have repeatedly come under the scanner due to accidents. As per the data of the now-defunct Haryana Vision Zero, between 2016 and 2019, 22, 17, 17, 16, 12 and seven road fatalities were reported at Khandsa, Bilaspur Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk, Shankar Chowk and Sidhrawali exit, respectively.Garg also said that ambulances should be parked near black spots to ferry accident victims to the nearest hospital at the earliest.Officials discussed the issue of CCTV cameras blocking commuters’ view of signals. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials, responsible for the same, said they have identified 25 such spots and have taken corrective steps at 12 locations.GMDA officials said that the seven-kilometre stretch between Atul Kataria Chowk and Rezangla Chowk via Sheetla Mata Road is in the process of being redeveloped and a detailed project report (DPR) on the matter will be prepared in two months.Discussions were also held on the possibility of closing the exits at Givo and Siddharawali on NH-48 to reduce congestion. Garg directed officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), district administration and Gurugram police to jointly inspect both the spots and take a decision on this matter.Garg also directed them to simultaneously explore the possibility of setting up pedestrian-friendly amenities at both points, so that pedestrians don’t have to navigate their way through fast-moving traffic on NH-48.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/signage-to-be-placed-500-metres-ahead-of-black-spots-101616607918019.html
24-03-2021||Gurugram||MCG opens second steel bank in Sector 48||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) opened the city’s second steel utensil bank in Sector 48, next to Sohna Road, for residents to avail of steel utensils for free from the MCG. The rationale behind opening such banks is to reduce the need for single-use plastic, said MCG officials.The Sector 48 steel utensil bank operates out of the office of Ward 29 councillor, Kuldeep Yadav. The MCG has more than 2,000 steel utensils, including plates, glasses, and spoons, at the bank, officials familiar with the matter said.MCG officials appealed to nearby RWAs and residential areas to donate to the bank and also avail of their services for public events to reduce the usage of single-use plastic. “We are unknowingly polluting the environment, which is a matter of concern. It is not only affecting humans but also animals and birds,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.Singh cited a 2018 incident, wherein a migrated bird at the Basai Wetland suffered an injury due to plastic.“One of the birds had a plastic ring-like object stuck to its beak. After two to three days of effort, the bird was caught, and we were successful in rescuing it. The benefit of this incident was that rag pickers near the wetlands were identified and subsequently, regulated. Such incidents remind us that it is our moral responsibility to stop using single-use plastic and polythene,” said Singh.Kuldeep Singh, MCG brand ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission, said that the civic body is in the process of opening its third steel utensil bank in Ward 15 by mid-April and is aiming to open a facility in each of its 35 wards by the end of the year. The first steel bank was opened in Sector 10 on March 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-opens-second-steel-bank-in-sector-48-101616607917355.html

Singh also shared a video clip of the illegal structures being demolished to free land from grabbers.The state government spokesperson said after the formation of the government in 2017, an anti-land mafia task force was constituted to free public and private land grabbed illegally by mafia under the patronage of those in power or by using various tricks. The task force had so far freed up over 67,000 acres of land and priority had been given to make sports grounds on them, whether under the sports department, youth welfare department or under MGNREGA.The state government also came up with an online portal for anti-land mafia task force set up in various districts to put up daily updates regarding action taken against those involved in illegal land deals and encroachment. The portal, which was launched by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was meant to ensure better coordination between the state government agencies working against land mafia, he said. CM Yogi Adityanath has issued orders to take action against those who were found guilty of encroaching land of the irrigation department of UP in Okhla, Jasola, Madanpur Khadar, Aali, Saidabad, Jaitpur, Molarwand and Khureji Khas, etc. Earlier, despite repeated complaints, no government dared to take action against those involved in illegal land occupation, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/6-acres-of-irrigation-dept-s-land-freed-from-grabbers-101616607737381.html
24-03-2021||Lucknow||Minister objects to ‘azaan’ on loudspeakers, mosque caretaker says will sort out||Hours after Uttar Pradesh minister Anand Swaroop Shukla wrote a letter to the Ballia district magistrate Aditi Singh, seeking regulating the volume of loudspeakers from mosques, the official said there were court orders in this regard which would be followed. “The Supreme Court, High Court and the state government have from time to time issued directives regarding use and norms of loudspeakers at all public places and instructions have been regularly issued in that regard to police and officials of administration,” the Ballia DM said. Asked if she proposed to take any action on the basis of the minister’s letter, Singh said, “All complaints that are received are looked into.” In its May 2020 order the Allahabad High Court had said the azaan or the call for prayer may be an integral part of Islam but its amplification cannot be said to be integral to the religion, warranting protection of the fundamental right enshrined under Article 25 of the Constitution.It was not immediately clear about how Ballia DM proposed to move ahead on the issue, but the minister was categorical that the high decibel levels during azaan (call for prayers) from loudspeakers put up in mosques affected his concentration while he performed his religious rituals in the morning and also in discharge of his official duties. Shukla, a junior minister in Yogi Adityanath government looking after parliamentary affairs, rural development and integrated rural development ministries, confirmed having written to the DM on the issue. “There are directions that the court has issued from time to time and those should be followed,” he said while flagging how high decibel levels were causing health concerns to the elderly, affecting studies in schools besides affecting his concentration during his morning prayers.He singled out Madina mosque at Kajipura whose loudspeakers he said caused lot of disturbance.Mohd Ayub Qureshi, the caretaker of Madina mosque said, they would remove the four loudspeakers if they were causing problems to people or the minister. “Ours is an old mosque and loudspeakers are used during azaan. So far there was no issue but if someone has any issue, we will sort it out and if need be, remove the loudspeaker,” he said.An employee of the district magistrate’s office said though no action has so far been taken, the matter flagged by the minister was being evaluated.The minister’s view on loudspeakers from mosque, came days after Allahabad University (AU) vice chancellor Sangita Srivastava too flagged similar concerns about loudspeaker from Lal Masjid, a mosque near AU, disturbing her sleep. Kaleem-ur-Rehman, the caretaker of the mosque said they had lowered the volume of the loudspeaker and direction of one of them had been changed. Khalid Rasheed Firangi mahal, the naib imam of Lucknow Eidgah and a senior functionary of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), said everyone should respect court orders. “As far as court orders are concerned, they apply to all, there is no scope for being selective and all must respect it. As far as azaan is concerned, it’s hardly two to three minutes affair and if somewhere the decibels levels were higher, the matter can be sorted locally without making it sound political,” he said. The AIMPLB functionary, however, said use of loudspeakers from mosque should be limited to ‘azaan’ and Friday prayers. “Any other use of loudspeakers should be discouraged and there was no need for several loudspeakers in a mosque,” the senior cleric added.The minister had in his complaint also mentioned that the loudspeakers were being used for making various announcements from mosque like seeking donations, other religious activities. “In fact, during Ramzan too, we will issue appeals against using loudspeakers for making announcement about timing of fasting,” the senior cleric said. Only recently, the Karnataka State Board of Wakf restricted the management of mosques and dargahs (mausoleums) from using loudspeakers between 10 pm and 6 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/minister-objects-to-azaan-on-loudspeakers-mosque-caretaker-says-will-sort-out-101616607677419.html

All eligible should immediately get registered and get vaccinated from April 1,” he said.“Everyone should stringently adhere to the COVID-19 protocol.

They will give you a befitting reply".Waving an angry finger at Congress MLCs, Kumar said they seemed to have lost their sense of propriety following their long association with Lalu Prasads party which has often been accused of rowdyism.He also said "do not forget that we are greater in number than you are. Yesterday, people of this side sat quietly, maintaining decorum, while you were engaging in mischief. Be mindful of the consequences".In the 243-member assembly, the ruling NDA has 126 MLAs besides it enjoys support of an Independent.The opposition has 110 legislators while AIMIM has 5 and one MLA is from LJP.In the 75-member legislative council, the ruling coalition has overwhelming numbers.Later, talking to reporters, Kumar expressed displeasure over the opposition accusing him directly of having called the police, on Tuesday, inside to help marshals physically evict the most unruly of the opposition MLAs."It is the Speakers prerogative to requisition whatever resources he deems necessary to maintain order inside the premises."Whatever happened yesterday was unusual but has there been any other instance, in any state legislature, of the Speaker having been held hostage", Kumar asked.He also deplored the opposition indulging in acts like tearing up documents and throwing shreds of paper towards the Chair besides clambering atop the speakers dais to physically prevent him from running the House.Asked about the intention expressed by speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha that action might be taken against those MLAs whose behaviour was found most objectionable, the chief minister replied "the government has nothing to do with that."If the speaker deems it fit, he will take action in accordance with rules. We will neither egg him on nor try to restrain him".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/we-are-greater-in-number-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-warns-opposition-parties-101616603729488.html

Jain operated the shop named Jain Plastics from the ground floor while two other floors were used as godown in the same building. Plastic products worth over one crore rupees stored as preparations for Holi sale were gutted.Chief fire officer (CFO) Vijay Kumar Singh said people spotted smoke emanating from the shop-cum-godown and informed the fire service control room at around 6 am. He said highly inflammable plastic products led to fast spreading of flames which also engulfed three near-by establishments, including two jewellery and one papad and pickle shops.He said the fire was so massive that 15 fire tenders took around five hours to douse the flames. Local police personnel said since the fire broke out in the morning hours so there was no crowd in the market otherwise it would have been very difficult to contain the situation. He said thick smoke engulfed the entire area following which residents of some near-by houses had to be evacuated as a precautionary measure. Meanwhile, another fire broke out in the slum alongside railway line near Naveen Gallamandi in Aliganj in which as many as 25 huts were gutted.The CFO said the incident took place when a slum dweller Bheem alias Raju was cooking his food in an open space at around 8.30 am. “The fire from the makeshift oven soon spread due to heavy winds and engulfed 25 huts in no time. At least 10 fire tenders were deployed to douse the flames,” he said adding that the slum dwellers have been provided immediate relief with the help of local police and district administration. In another incident, a garbage dump and dry leaves caught fire on Lucknow University premises at around 12 pm but the flames were doused soon with the help of two fire tenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/fire-breaks-out-at-three-places-in-lucknow-properties-worth-crores-gutted-101616604617127.html

The Shiv Sena and the Congress are the other two members of the alliance.“Shukla had a 'bad habit' of tapping phones illegally and had intercepted phones of political leaders during the formation of the three-party state government as well,” Awhad remarked, echoing fellow NCP leader Nawab Malik’s claims from the day before. The MVA was formed after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections which saw the Sena break its victorious alliance with the BJP and join hands with the NCP and the Congress.Earlier, in a press conference in Mumbai on Tuesday, Fadnavis, who is from the BJP, had said that Shukla had “sought proper permission” from then-ACS, home, Sitaram Kunte, and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politicians.

24-03-2021||Ranchi||WB Assembly elections: Hemant campaigns for TMC, appeals voters to defeat ‘divisive’ BJP||Chief minister and working president of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Wednesday campaigned for Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidates across three assembly segments in Purulia and Bankura districts in West Bengal and appealed the voters to defeat the “divisive” Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) as voters did in Jharkhand in the 2019 Assembly polls. “They (BJP) won 12 out of 14 the Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand. Months later, we defeated them badly. They boast to be the largest political party in the world, but we forced them to bite dust in Assembly elections...Now it’s your turn to defeat them in Bengal,” said Soren. Purulia and Bankura districts in West Bengal are neighbouring districts of Jharkhand and have a sizeable population of tribals, who form the core voter base of the JMM. The Shibu Soren-led party was planning to field its own candidates in over a dozen seats, especially those dominated by tribals, before it decided to support Mamata Banerjee’s TMC that approached the former for support. In the 2019 general elections, the BJP won Lok Sabha seats in the area and was currently locked in a direct battle with the TMC in the upcoming Assembly elections. However, canvassing for TMC candidate in Bandwan assembly segment in Purulia, CM Soren reminded the voters that success in Lok Sabha polls was not a guarantee for victory in Assembly polls. Soren in 2019 led a three-party pre-poll alliance of the JMM-Congress and RJD to wrest power from the BJP in the last state Assembly elections with a comfortable majority in the House. He underlined that though many parties were contesting the election in Bengal, there was a direct fight between the TMC and the BJP and it was important to defeat the “communal and divisive” forces, as the world was watching. “All they do is divide people, be it in the name of religion or caste, for votes. They pitted Hindus against Hindus, Hindus against Muslims, tribals against tribals. They just want to form the government, either by hook or crook. First, they try to buy voters. If they fail in that, they buy MLAs to form the government,” said Soren. Terming the BJP as a “junior East India Company” that was out on a selling spree (disinvestment of public sector companies), the Jharkhand chief minister said that the BJP was “anti-tribal and anti-dalit”. “You need to understand why tribals, dalits and minorities are still under developed despite special provisions in the Constitution. It’s because of parties like BJP and their corporate friends. They are now selling everything and as a result, there will be no meaning left for reservation in government jobs,” Soren said.Citing example of privatisation of public banks, the CM also advised people that it was better to keep their hard earned money at home than depositing them in banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/wb-assembly-elections-hemant-campaigns-for-tmc-appeals-voters-to-defeat-divisive-bjp-101616604317196.html

Besides, the court had directed that the schools where small children go should not be asked to start physical classes. If, however, for any reason schools are going ahead with physical classes then all guidelines issued by the state government should be followed in letter and spirit. Institutions where students above the Class 10 have to compulsorily attend classes should observe social distancing and wear masks, the court added.“Eateries should see that no food is served in the open, that is to say, people should take covered food in packets and should eat them at their home. Within the restaurants, tables should be laid in such a manner that social distancing is properly observed”, the court had directed.During the course of hearing on March 22, the police department informed that so far as masking was concerned, in between March 1 and 21, 2021, it had challaned 1192 persons in Prayagraj. Court appointed advocate commissioner Chandan Sharma also informed that almost nobody was wearing masks. Taking a serious note of these submissions, the division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar observed, “This small number of penalisation shows that the police have also become complacent.”So far as observance of the Covid guidelines in the high court is concerned, the court directed the counsel appearing for the high court to inform as to how guidelines would be followed.The court has fixed March 26, 2021 as the next date hearing of this PIL.

The state Assembly on Tuesday passed a Bill amending the Jharkhand Regional Development Authority Act, 1981, to introduce the concept, amid apprehensions by legislators about its implementation and violation of the state-specific tenancy Acts. “Land pooling is a tool which will promote planned urbanisation and would help in key aspects of urbanisation such as roads, parks, landfill sites and other infrastructure projects without going through the complex process of land acquisition while simultaneously making land owners a partner in the process,” the Bill that was passed on Tuesday says.However, during discussion on the Bill, legislators from both treasury and Opposition benches raised apprehensions about effectiveness of the instrument, besides lack of clear mechanism in the Bill to prevent violation of tenancy Acts such as CNT and SPT. Congress legislator Pradeep Yadav said while the new law was welcome, it lacks teeth in absence of a separate Act. “This is a borrowed concept from other states. We need to have a separate Land Polling Act to implement it here,” said Yadav. BJP legislator and former land and revenue minister Amar Bauri said the Bill did not clarify how would the land owners would benefit. “It has not been clarified what would be the share of the land owners in the entire project. Also, this state has special tenancy Acts and this Bill does not have any mention how would the rights of tribals would be protected if their land is taken for pooling,” he said.Chief minister Hemant Soren, who was present in the House when the Bill was being passed, said rules would be framed in a such a way that all these apprehensions are taken care of.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jkhand-brings-in-land-pooling-for-planned-urban-growth-101616604257130.html

According to the FIR, Bhulan had gone to his sister’s house at Khadwal village in Gazipur and abducted the minor and brought her to his native village Englishpur in Buxar. The SDPO said when a six-member team of Gazipur police, with help of local police, came to the village, Bhulan managed to escape, while shouting that robbers had entered his house. His family members and accomplices obstructed the police team and also tried to snatch their firearms. Some of them also pelted stones at the team. The injured police personnel are undergoing treatment and their condition is out of danger. “They attacked the police team and created a ruckus. Bhulan’s father and some female relatives confined the local chowkidar Harendra, besides mother and brother of the abducted girl in their house. They also thrashed them. Soon, the additional force reached there and rescued them,” the SDPO said. The police have arrested Bhulan’s father Shivpujan Rajbhar and kin Tetri Devi, Guriya Devi and Sarita Rajbhar,” said the SDPO, adding that a case has been lodged against 15 identified and several unidentified accused for the incident. A senior official of state police headquarters said Englishpur village in Buxar district has been notorious for attacks on police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/up-cops-assaulted-during-raid-in-buxar-village-101616604137878.html
24-03-2021||Patna||Bihar: Covid hits tuberculosis case notifications||The tuberculosis (TB) elimination programme has been hit like most other national health mission programmes during the coronavirus pandemic. Bihar could notify only 98,913 cases of TB in 2020 as against 1.22 lakh notified in 2019. As per the Centre’s estimation, 153 per 1 lakh population are infected by TB. That would leave Bihar with a TB burden of 1.83 lakh given the fact that its population is estimated to be 12 crore. However, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, said Bihar had done well than the rest of the country in terms of notifying TB cases. “Bihar’s shortfall in notification was 18% against the average national shortfall of 25% in 2020-21. This was because our focus never went off TB even during the pandemic,” he added. Kumar, however, stressed on expeditious detection of missing TB cases. The state’s annualised TB case notification rate, which had gone up to 100 per lakh population in 2019, had also slipped to 80 in 2020 that was at par with the notification rate in 2016. The primary reason for low notification was shortage of resources. Even the existing resources, both in terms of manpower and machinery, were redeployed to contain the pandemic. “We are, however, trying to get it (the programme) back on track, with healthcare workers reaching out to the homes of TB patients during the pandemic,” said Dr BK Mishra, state programme officer for tuberculosis. Most of the existing 70 CBNAAT machines, used for testing TB samples, were redeployed for Covid-19 testing. Health minister Mangal Pandey, who dedicated 37 TrueNAT machines, a diagnostic tool for TB, expressed unhappiness over the low testing rate. He called upon his officials to increase testing and participation in the TB control programme. He accepted that notification was an issue and the state was unable to identify the actual number of TB patients. Speaking at a function to mark the world TB day on Wednesday, he said the social stigma associated with the disease was also responsible for the low notification, as patients feared being ostracised.He, however, said that all vacant positions in the TB unit would be filled up in next two months. The minister also inaugurated the interactive voice recording system (IVRS) for sensitising patients whose bank accounts were not linked, for transfer of nutrition allowance of ₹500 per patient per month during the treatment period. Dr Ashutosh Sharan from East Champaran, Dr Rajesh Kumar Ranjan, Dr Anil Kumar and Dr Subodh Kumar (all from Siwan), Dr SS Nandi (Samastipur), Dr Ashok Kumar Singh (Kaimur), Dr Prakash Chandra Verma (Lakhisarai) were among some doctors felicitated for their contribution in elimination of TB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid-hits-tuberculosis-case-notifications-101616604137239.html

Those stripping democracy have no right to call themselves a government,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala urged people to raise their voice against the alleged police high-handedness in Bihar.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, “A murderous attack on democracy has taken place. The attack on MLAs by armed forces is a criminal act,” said Yadav in a tweet in Hindi.RJD legislator Awadh Bihari Chaudhury said, “I have never seen police entering the House and forcibly evicting and beating legislators.”Congress legislature party leader in the Assembly, Ajeet Sharma, too questioned how the police were allowed to enter House and beat legislators.Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) general secretary Deepankar Bhattacharya said, “This is what happened in Uttar Pradesh also. It is all a blueprint of the RSS to make an autocratic state. But Bihar will never accept it.” Political analyst NK Choudhary said the visuals from the House clearly showed a collapse of the democracy, but the initiation certainly was from the Opposition as they held Sinha captive and did not allow him to conduct House proceedings. “But there was an overreaction to it. There should have an attempt to find a political solution to the impasse. The Opposition also needed to behave responsibly...”Vinod Kanth, senior lawyer at the Patna High Court, said one could not straightaway condemn any legislation. “A lot will depend on how it evolves. If there is any arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, the court is always there. If there is any sinister design behind it or it is stretched beyond the purpose for which it is made, people can approach court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rahul-slams-nitish-over-assembly-incident-says-under-rsshold-101616604077661.html
24-03-2021||Other||After flare-up, new low averted in Upper House||PATNABihar’s Legislative Council witnessed a peculiar scene on Wednesday, the concluding day of the budget session, when a group of infuriated treasury members advanced menacingly towards the Opposition benches in a bid to silence them even as chief minister Nitish Kumar was chastising and asking them to behave.Provoked by the Opposition’s offer for bangles to the CM over Tuesday’s incident in the Assembly, Kumar stood up and advised them to behave in a dignified way. “Recall what happened with those in the Assembly who resorted to hooliganism. People would give you a befitting reply. You don’t know what are you doing,” the CM told the Opposition, which was seeking a debate on the scuffle in the Assembly through an adjournment motion moved by RJD member Subodh Kumar. Apparently annoyed by Subodh Kumar’s act of displaying bangles, JD(U) member Neeraj Kumar asked the Opposition to maintain dignity and urged the chair to discipline RJD members. As the agitating RJD members refused to pay heed to repeated requests from the chair, a group of JD(U) members, led by Sanjay Singh, stormed the well and advanced towards the RJD leader arguing at top of his voice. Another JD(U) member Sanjeev Singh, however, intervened and prevented a likely altercation. Tanveer Akhtar, Bhishm Sahni and Ram Ishwar Mahato were accompanying Sanjay Singh who had reached near the Opposition benches. Sensing trouble, working chairman of the Council, Awadhesh Narayan Singh, stood on his chair and asked the members to maintain cool and listen to the leader of the house, the chief minister. “Don’t force me to do something that never happened here,” said Singh, as the CM kept on speaking, oblivious of heated exchanges between the members of both sides. The CM advised the Opposition to stay quite, while reminding them of the strength of treasury in the Council. “Do you know what is the number of this side (treasury),” asked Kumar, while advising Congress members to distance themselves from the RJD. Congress members, led by Prem Chandra Mishra, whose demand to discuss the police assault on MLAs through an adjournment motion led to an uproar and suspension of question hour in the first half, were also supporting the RJD in its protest. Later, the Council passed the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021, and other legislations in the absence of the Opposition, which staged a walkout. In-charge home minister Bijendra Yadav later clarified in the House that the Opposition’s dears about the new legislation were totally unfounded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-flare-up-new-low-averted-in-upper-house-101616604017094.html

24-03-2021||Pune||Even as cases surge, testing brought down by Pune dist admin||Pune: Even as Pune reports the most number of cases in the state and currently has the most active cases in Maharashtra, the district administration has brought down the number of tests. While Sunday is an exception as most labs are shut or working with limited capacity, the fall in the number of tests continued on Tuesday when most people would step out to test. As the number of tests is brought down, the positivity rate has gone higher. On Tuesday, the positivity rate was at 28.90% which is higher than what the district reported in September last year at around 23% during the peak of the first wave, according to the data provided by the district health office. On Tuesday, the number of tests conducted in the district was less than 20,000 even as more than 5,700 new cases were reported which took the positivity rate to approximately 29% for the day. Civic and district officials said that this is because of the weekend impact. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant health officer said, “We sometimes get the results of Saturday and Sunday in two days and so the number reflected in the daily test report is that of the pending reports which have been released on Tuesday.” District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said that the number of tests reflected in the daily reports include the samples collected and test reports for the samples collected on Sunday. The increasing positivity rate has been a matter of concern for the administration as more cases means more load on the health infrastructure. However, officials claim that despite the increasing positivity rate, Pune is testing highest number of samples per million. As per the district health office, Pune tests 1.43 lakh tests per million which in Maharashtra is about 71,971 and 88,936 tests per million in India. As per a latest report from Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), grouping on ten national laboratories, it was found that a double mutation found in the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Maharashtra is of concern as these mutations have not been yet catalogued, announced the health ministry on Wednesday. The report stated, “The analysis of samples from Maharashtra has revealed that compared to December 2020, there has been an increase in the fraction of samples with the E484Q and L452R mutations. Such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity. These mutations have been found in about 15%-20% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued variants of concern (VOCs), These have been categorised as VOCs but require the same epidemiological and public health response of ‘increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases and contacts as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol’ by the states and Union territories.” Drop in test count Date Cases Tests Positivity rate March 19 5,065 200,56 25.25% March 20 5,473 234,83 23.30% March 21 5,408 21,112 25.61% March 22 4,321 21,616 19.98% March 23 5,722 19,796 28.90% *Data provided by district health office||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/even-as-cases-surge-testing-brought-down-by-pune-dist-admin-101616600476816.html

There were no new deaths on Wednesday and the toll stands at 1,706. The active cases, on the other hand, have climbed to 1,115, the bulletin added.The Union health ministry on Sunday warned that a huge gathering of devotees during the Kumbh mela could lead to a spike in the number of people testing positive for Covid-19. A central government team led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) paid a visit to Uttarakhand from last week to review the medical and health measures undertaken by the Uttarakhand government for the festival.Following this, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote a letter to state chief secretary Prakash where he said that more than 12 states were seeing a surge in their cases recently and the devotees expected to attend the Kumbh Mela could be from these states. Citing the report prepared by the NCDC, Bhushan noted that 10-20 pilgrims and 10-20 locals were testing positive on a daily basis and urged for the need to impose stringent measures to control the spread of the disease during the festival.However, days before the ministry’s letter was sent to the state government, the newly appointed chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Tirath Singh Rawat had eased Covid-related restrictions for all devotees gathering in Haridwar for the mela by saying that the event is held once every 12 years and devotees could not be stopped from coming, according to a report by Hindustan Times on March 22. This comment of Rawat led to criticism from experts and former Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat who said that lifting of curbs will be very risky due to the surge in cases all across India, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/will-review-covid-situation-in-haridwar-uttarakhand-govt-ahead-of-kumbh-mela-101616595540079.html

While inquiries for new membership are falling, old clients are demanding assurance of money refund before renewing membership. “Since the night curfew was imposed from February 22, people have been apprehensive of a lockdown. The rise in Covid cases has left many on wait-and-watch mode to extend membership. The common queries are whether membership will be transferred or extended after Diwali if lockdown is announced,” said Nilesh Kale, president, Pune Fitness Club Association. Gyms were allowed to reopen from October 2020 after seven months of closure. There are around 3,000 gyms in the city. “The number of those in 15-22 year age group seeking membership has dropped. Those in the IT sector who used to workout at the gym have also become less as many are working from home. Only the fitness freaks are regular and our business has hit by 50 per cent,” said Kale. According to estimates, the lockdown has left the industry face losses running over ₹500 crore. The annual turnover of the industry is ₹800-1000 crore. “People are avoiding yearly and six-month packages and it affects the gym maintenance expense,” said Ayesha Nagargoje, RC Fitness Club, Wagholi. “As the summer season is approaching, we are looking forward to good business as it is a peak period for us. The lockdown talks has left many customers in two minds about investing in gyming,” said Manish Patwardhan, Fitranger Gym, Kothrud. Saurabh Gandhe, a regular at a gym at Sadashiv peth, said, “Last time, my six-month membership got wasted because of the lockdown. Hence, I have opted for one-month subscription which though is on the higher side than the bulk package but is economical given the lockdown probability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-rumours-wear-heavy-on-gym-business-in-pune-101616593396307.html

So, it is a family gathering. I am saying that our governor was an RSS worker, a BJP union minister and a BJP chief minister. So, is it an insult to call him a karyakarta?” he said. He also raised the issue of Raj Bhavan not clearing the names of 12 nominees, who are recommended by the state cabinet, as governor-nominated members of the legislative council (MLC). “Raj Bhavan has become a political adda, and there will be criticism till the time it remains so. We will continue to say so till the Governor clears the 12 nominated MLCs. He is not clearing these names due to pressure from the BJP.” Also Read | Send report on Maharashtra’s ‘political situation’ to Prez: BJP leaders to GuvLeader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said he doesn’t consider Raut a leader to respond to his statements. “Sanjay Raut has a lot of time on his hands. When you (the media) don’t have any news, you go to him. He is not such a big leader for me to respond to what he says. The Governor is the constitutional head...If we go to him [Koshyari], he becomes a BJP leader. When Raut goes and bows before him out of respect, whose leader does he [Koshyari] become then?” he said.The Sena-led government is in the eye of the storm following Param Bir Singh’s allegation against Deshmukh. The state government is expected to announce a probe in the matter. Raut said the probe could be headed by a retired high court judge. “The CM wants a probe, the home minister too wants it...A retired high court judge or somebody else [can probe it]. The probe will not be hampered till Uddhav Thackeray is the chief minister,” Raut said.Also Read | Mansukh Hiran murder: ATS calls Sachin Vaze ‘mastermind’, to seek custodyMeanwhile, he added, that the report of IPS officer Rashmi Shulka, which alleged corruption in police transfers, does not contain anything “serious”. On Tuesday, Fadnavis submitted the report to Union home secretary and sought a probe by the CBI. “The documents are not serious at all. ..The report doesn’t have anything in it, it should be released and everybody should read it carefully. It does not have even a line against the way the government acted,” Raut said. The Sena leader also added that the government has full knowledge of the “leaks” in the state administration and chief minister is taking steps to plug them. Raut said that they have names of the officers who are “loyal” to the previous government. “There can be some officers in the administration who are loyal to the previous government, and may have prepared a report...But it is not some ‘bomb’… In the last 1.5 years, some leaks have been found, a serious thought must be given to that. We have information about these officers,” he said. Summing up the ongoing political drama in Maharashtra, Raut invoked a popular slogan of West Bengal assembly elections and said, “Khela Hobe” or game on. “Currently. Maharashtra and Delhi are doing ‘Khela Hobe’. It is entertaining for the people of Maharashtra, and it is tax-free entertainment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-a-bjp-karyakarta-alleges-raut-101616585104980.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Fuel prices drop in Pune for the first time in 5 months||Pune: The prices of fuel have dropped in the city for the first time since October 2, 2020. On Wednesday (March 24), petrol was sold at ₹97.02 per litre, a drop by ₹0.17. The price of diesel per litre was ₹86.70, a decrease by ₹0.18. The last hike in fuel prices was recorded on February 27, 2021 — petrol ( ₹97.19/litre) and diesel ( ₹86.88/ litre) —and it remained unchanged till Wednesday. In Pune, the last date on which the petrol price dropped was September 22, 2020 when it touched ₹87.51 per litre and diesel price was ₹76.34/litre. In the upcoming days till October 2, 2020, diesel prices slipped down a couple of times. After October 2, fuel prices had remained steady for almost 47 days and prices increased on November 20, 2020. The price of petrol was ₹87.67 per litre and diesel ₹75.71 per litre. “It is good news for common people. Citizens can expect a further reduction in fuel prices as the rate has come down by almost 10 dollars per barrel in the international market,” said Ali Daruwala, spokesperson, All India Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA). According to experts, residents will only be able to get relief if the excessive taxation is suspended. “Now they claim that the prices have dropped because of the crude oil prices falling in the international market. These prices have gone down before, but citizens didn’t get any substantial benefit because the taxation on petrol and diesel had been increased since last May. Now there is a slight drop in prices because no additional cess has been imposed. As the elections in five states were announced prices remain constant. It is up to the government to give relief to citizens,” said Vivek Velankar, president, Sajag Nagrik Manch. “The petrol and diesel prices should drop by at least ₹15- ₹20 to give us real benefit. If after some time the prices start increasing again, then this price range will become the standard and we will not see previous rates again,” said Rutika Deshmukh, a resident of Kharadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fuel-prices-drop-in-pune-for-the-first-time-in-5-months-101616584442714.html

24-03-2021||Mumbai||TRP scam: Maharashtra to complete probe against Republic TV in 12 weeks||On Wednesday, after the Maharashtra government assured the Bombay high court that it will complete its investigation into the role of Republic TV in the TRP manipulation case within 12 weeks, the court directed Mumbai Police to give an advance notice of three days to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, if he had to be arrested in the case.A division bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd and Goswami seeking quashing of the FIR and charge sheet filed by Mumbai Police in the alleged TRP manipulation case, was informed by senior counsel Ashok Mundargi that the cases were solely intended to target his clients for adverse reportage against the police and state government.Also Read | TRP Case: Probe agencies should act reasonably, says Bombay HCMundargi argued that while other channels were also named in the case, employees of only his clients’ channel were being interrogated. He added that though it had been four months since investigations started the police had been unable to get any evidence against the channel or Goswami. In light of this, Mundargi submitted that his clients are required protection from coercive action pending hearing.The bench then sought to know as to when the police would complete the probe.Responding to the court query on Wednesday, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare submitted that the investigation against Republic TV and its employees would be completed within 12 weeks. Thereafter, the court directed the state to give a three-day notice to Goswami in case he was to be arrested.The court noted that investigation could not be stayed as there was no clarity on who is and who is not an accused. While posting further hearing on the plea to June 28, the court directed Goswami to co-operate with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-scam-maharashtra-to-complete-probe-against-republic-tv-in-12-weeks-101616577663236.html

These hills provide a definitive character to the Pune and a much-needed break from the bustling city. It is, thus, a common sight to see Punekars flocking to the picturesque hills early in the mornings, and in the evenings, to breathe the much-needed fresh air. These sites of urban natural heritage are also home to some of the oldest cultural heritage sites in the city. In the last column, we visited the popular rock-cut temple in the form of the Pataleshwar caves. But, the rock cutting tradition of Pune stretches far and wide, in time and space. As the city engulfed villages such as Baner, Yerwada, Bhamburda, and Hinjewadi, these cultural sites are lost in the urban makeover, making it difficult to recognise their original character. Some historical context, patience and curiosity-fuelled enthusiasm will help you locate and explore these rock-cut marvels. These rock cutting signatures in Pune are seen mostly on elevations or foothills of various tekdis encompassing the main Mula Mutha basin. The Buddhist route entering the city from Tamhini via the Maan-Hinjewadi route is marked by single Buddhist cell vihara at Maan village. The Fergusson college hill is home to probably the oldest cave in Pune. The top of the hill marks the memorial of an important historical event - establishment of the Servants’ of India society to strengthen educational and social reforms in India (June 12, 1905), by noted reformist Dr Gopal Krishna Gokhale. As we move down towards the Wadarwadi slums, a set of rock-cut steps takes you to the courtyard of the rock-cut Pandav caves, recently named the Vruddheshwar cave temple.The main cave has a wide verandah and a 20-foot wide square cell carved with a rectangular doorway. No older sculptures or symbols can be observed apart from the modern installations of Shivlinga, Lord Vitthal-Rakhumai, and Hanuman.Another unfinished cell is carved as part of this complex. A few metres to the right, at some altitude, one can locate two more unfinished rock-cut cells. The highlight of the site is the quintessential Buddhist rock- cut cistern, which closely resembles the second-third century CE water cisterns found at other Buddhist sites in the Sahyadris. The original Baner village is situated next to the Tukai hill, which offers us another rock-cut endeavour belonging a few centuries later to the Pataleshwar caves. Flights of newly built steps towards Tukai hill take us to the complex of Baneshwar caves. A platform next to it houses a medieval memorial pillar symbolising a hero’s death, a deepmal and a balipeetha. Balipeetha has a depiction of the guru’s feet and ram heads on a square platform. Blood sacrifices or prasada were offered in the past on such platforms. The narrow rock-cut path takes us to the pillared cave excavated under the surface. A narrow, pillared verandah, pillared hall and three cells in the back, is how the cave plan is laid. The stocky square pillars have rectangular capitals devoid of any ornamentation; they are but a poor cousin of the finely polished pillars of Pataleshwar caves. The central square cell houses a modern Baneshwar shivalinga and has rough niches in the back wall. The left cell actually is a water cistern with a perennial water source which causes flooding in the cave. Overall the cave looks severely unfinished with rough chiselled surfaces and might be dated to between the ninth to and 11th centuries CE. One of the niches in the hall houses handsome herostones which probably belong to heroes of Baner who laid down their lives in a bygone era. Parvati hill in the heart of city marks the sacred temple complex developed during the Peshwa period, but to the southeast of the hill is located another rock-cut heritage. The rock-cut cave named “Parvati cave”, is another unfinished cave with a small courtyard and robust rock-cut façade. The cave is essentially a pillar hall with four roughly carved square pillars. On most occasions, it is filled with knee-deep water making access difficult. Based on the plan and style of the pillars, the cave might be dated to the 12th to 14th century CE, the Yadava period. The Chaturshrungi temple section of the Vetal hill complex, is also a rock-cut cave. The rock-cut nature of the cave separated from the bedrock can be surmised when one circum-ambulates the main cave using the rock-cut steps. In the 18th century, a wealthy banker, Durlabh Sheth established the goddess Chaturshrungi, as a satellite site of the goddess Saptshringi in Nashik, and was named after the four peaks of Vetal hill. The eastern-most cave in the city is situated on the Yerwada hill and is presently known as Tarakeshwar temple. The modern renovations in the sanctum have totally hidden the original rock-cut nature of the cave shrine. Dating of the cave at Chaturshrungi and Tarkareshwar caves in Yerwada is not possible due to absence of any datable signs. Today, most of these caves survive as places of worship. Though they have been renovated beyond recognition, it is the village association and reverence from families in the respective gaothan areas that have ensured the old memory of a bygone antiquity and sacred space even in 21st century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sutradharas-tales-rock-cut-in-pune-an-ode-to-the-ages-101616577422331.html

The district magistrate said that as per the guidelines issued by the Central and state governments, for any public functions, prior permission from the local police is mandatory. “The process has been made transparent and hassle-free. Before organising any public gathering, the organisers will have to apply online to obtain permission. If it is be deemed fair by the authorities, permission will be granted instantly. For any private gathering, no permission is required,” he said.Also Read | Farmers’ protest: Delhi’s key border routes remain affectedThe DM added that no cap has been put on the number of people attending a public gathering. “But, maintaining social distancing and following all Covid-19 standard operating protocols, are mandatory,” he said.Suhas added that all the industrial, commercial and educational establishments, besides private and government offices, have been asked to establish and activate Covid-19 desks in their premises, to keep a close tab on the workers there. “Noida, being an industrial hub, caters to thousands of migrant workers. With these help desks, we will be able to identify persons with influenza-like illness symptoms,” he said.Health department officials have been asked to intensify random sampling and testing at all places and critical pockets. “A few months ago, we found that rate of spread in the critical pockets, mostly the villages adjoining Noida-Delhi border, was four times higher than the general areas. Health officials have been asked to increase testing in these areas, to access the nature of spread there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-noida-to-conduct-random-testing-at-delhi-border-from-tomorrow-101616576162887.html

This comes after a protest led by opposition legislators against the police bill, passed by the state Assembly, led to unruly scenes yesterday.The Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, which seeks to give more teeth to the state police, was passed on Tuesday. This led to the House witnessing unprecedented turmoil — order was thrown into disarray and multiple adjournments declared as opposition RJD leaders raised slogans demanding that the Nitish Kumar-led government withdraw the bill.In the meanwhile, protesting legislators laid siege to the Speaker's chamber, news agencies reported, and the police had to be called in to physically evict them. RJD MLA Satish Kumar was seen being carried outside from the Assembly on a stretcher; the leader claimed that he was "manhandled by police and local goons" inside the premises during the protest. Women MLAs of the Opposition were carried out of the assembly building by women security personnel.In a tweet early this morning, Yadav slammed the alleged police action against the legislators, and claimed that the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill is a "draconian act" that will give "absolute powers" to the police to act as a "veritable arm" of chief minister Nitish Kumar's "dictatorial politics".He also shared a clip which, according to him, showed the "shameless" police blocking RJD MLAs inside the House.Draconian Act which will give absolute powers to Police,so that it can act as veritable arm of Nitish's dictatorial politics, has been passed in police protection by throwing out battered MLAs using Police itself.See how Police is blocking our MLAs inside the house.

The BJP leaders cited about 100 cases to highlight the “administrative failure” of the state government and requested him to seek a report from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.After meeting Koshyari on Wednesday morning, BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said that the delegation cited about 100 cases to portray the failure of the government, from corruption and misuse of the police force for extortion to failure to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that the delegation requested the governor to seek a report from chief minister or chief secretary on the current situation in the state and forward it to the President of India.

We have requested him for such intervention to do justice with the people of Maharashtra,” Mungantiwar said. Fadnavis said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s silence was surprising and they have requested the governor to make him speak, and, as head of the state, seek a report from him. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has maintained silence as he knows that he will have to take action against the people involved in corruption. The government has lost moral ground with its failure on all fronts. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar addressed two press conferences but opted to shield wrongdoers,” he said .Fadnavis questioned why the state government sat on the report submitted by then director general of police highlighting the corruption in the transfer of police officers for last seven months. “If they think there was nothing objectionable in the report, why was no action was taken in seven months after its submission on March 25? Whom are they saving from exposure?

24-03-2021||Patna||Blame game begins after ruckus in Bihar assembly over Special Armed Police Bill||Opposition lawmakers allegedly held state assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha hostage in his chamber for three hours amid sloganeering and a siege of the House on the penultimate day of the budget session in protest against the Bihar Special Armed Police Bill on Tuesday. They were upset over a lack of debate. Anti-riot police were rushed into the House to clear it for the proceedings to resume.As minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav began his speech, the opposition walked out, and the bill was passed.Sinha said it seemed everything was targeted at him. “I was confined to my chamber with all gates closed... I have taken a serious view of it. The entire House was turned into a battlefield, something that never happened in the past,” he said.Parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the dignity of the chair and the House was undermined. “The entire exercise seemed pre-planned, and it was unfortunate.”Also Read | Bihar Special Armed Police Bill to allow ‘searches without warrant’: TejashwiRashtriya Janata Dal lawmaker Awadh Bihari Chaudhury hit back at the government for getting the bill passed for special powers to the police under protection. “I have never witnessed police entering the House and forcibly evicting and beating legislators to clear the House for one-sided passage of a bill. There cannot be anything more heinous in parliamentary democracy. All the rules of legislative business were put on the backburner.”Choudhary said the government should have been sent the bill to the select committee for its scrutiny. “The government wants to forcibly get things done, which is not acceptable in a democracy. Unbridled powers to an already maligned police are a design to silence all those who speak against the government.”Congress leader Ajeet Sharma questioned how the police were allowed to enter House and beat legislators. “The police had powers earlier also and there was no need for a new bill... The police have powers to act against anti-social elements, but they cannot be allowed to enter anyone’s house.”Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) general secretary Deepankar Bhattacharya called the developments in the assembly “complete murder of democracy and Constitution”. “This is what has happened in Uttar Pradesh also. It is all a blueprint of the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] to make an autocratic state. But Bihar will never accept it.” Bhattacharya added what the police could be used for was demonstrated both inside the House as well as outside.Political analyst NK Choudhary said the visuals from the House clearly showed a collapse of the democracy, but the initiation certainly was from the Opposition as they held Sinha captive and did not allow him to conduct House proceedings. “But there was an overreaction to it.

24-03-2021||Pune||Bank a/c theft case: Accused planned to use “sim swap” and stolen info||After gaining access to the information of five corporate bank accounts from two major banks, the alleged scammers were planning to use the sim swap method to misuse the information, according to the police. “There are five screenshots of five different accounts. Now, we cannot be sure where they came from. If the phone number attached with the bank account is accessed, rest of the account-related information was in those pictures already,” said Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), cyber-crime cell and economic offence wing (EOW), Pune. Five pictures, which are suspected by the police to be screenshots of a banking system, were recovered by the police from the arrested people. Each screenshot pertained to one account and contained 17-18 data points of a particular bank account. All the bank accounts were corporate accounts with one of them being dormant while the others had recent activity on it, according to the police. Collectively, the balance in the bank accounts made up for ₹216 crore. Whether the arrested people were planning two siphon the entire amount or kept all the accounts as an option is yet to be known, according to the police. While the information about four of the five accounts came from Hyderabad, one came from Gujarat. Anagha Modak (40), a stockbroker by profession and the one who is currently considered to be one of the main conspirators in the case, was trying to make use of a hacker to gain access to the accounts while she had allegedly demanded ₹2.5 crore in cash from the three alleged benefactors - Rohan Mankani, AM news channel owners - Sharma and Sandhbu. Mankani was found along with a man named Sudhir Shantilal Bhatevara alias Jain (54) who claimed to only be helping his friend Mankani with the money and claimed that he was not involved in anything else in the plan. Jain, a resident of Sun Empire Society in Sinhagad road area of Pune, was the one person who was not arrested by the police during the initial raid. He was found with cash worth ₹25 lakh which was seized by the police. “He was nowhere to be found for two days after he was served with a notice (which required him to be available at home for investigation). He was then arrested from Pune itself,” said DCP Navatake. While the police are still investigating where the detailed information about the bank accounts came from, they are speaking to the officials of the two major banks whose accounts’ information has been compromised. At least one other person who is suspected to have helped with the information to Modak is on the run from the police since the news of the arrests was published. The people arrested so far include Anagha Modak (40) a resident of Vadgaon; Ravindra Mahadev Mashalkar (34), a resident of Ambejogai road in Latur; Mukesh Harishchandra More (37), a resident of Yerawada in Pune; Rajshekhar Yadaiha Mamidi (34), a resident of Hyderabad; Rohan Ravindra Mankani (37), a resident of Sahakarnagar in Pune; Vishal Dhananjay Bendre (45), a resident of Aurangabad; Atmaram Harishchandra Kadam (34), a resident of Mulund in Mumbai; Varun Shrikadam Verma (37), a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Vikaschand Mahendrakumar Yadav (25), a resident of Surat in Gujarat; Rajesh Munnalal Sharma (42), a resident of Aurangabad and Paramjitsingh Sindhu (42), a resident of Aurangabad; Lakshminarayan Gattu alias Sonya (32), a resident of Baudhanagar in Varasigude in Hyderabad, and Vyankatesh Subramanium Uppala (40), a resident of Bhandalaguda in Nagol region of Hyderabad; and Sudhir Shantilal Bhatevara alias Jain (54).

Recently, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar conducted a meeting on a 24x7 water supply project. In the meeting, the civic body chief expressed dissatisfaction with the progress of the project. The civic body has also imposed a fine of more than one lakh per day on contractors for slow work. The project’s deadline is March 2023, and the work began in 2018. With only two years remaining for the completion date, the project’s pace must be increased. After the review meeting, the commissioner has issued an order to depute a team of nine engineers who had been involved in the completion of the ambitious project of Bhama-Askhed. Suresh Jagtap, PMC additional municipal commissioner said, “A team will help the contractors and resolve ground issues such as getting permission from different agencies for digging and laying pipelines, creating awareness, and coordinating with different departments.” The team consists of executive engineer Sandesh Kadu, deputy engineer Manoj Gathe, Vijay Havaldar, Nivruti Utale, Rajesh Bhutkar, Uday Kodhe, Rajesh Khade, Deepak Sonawane and Suhas Mahendrekar. At present, these engineers are working in the water, road, and drainage departments. Now onwards, they will keep a tab on the 24x7 water project work and provide information to additional municipal commissioner Suresh Jagtap, the chief superintendent engineer of the water department. A meeting will be held every fortnight. On the irregular, uneven, and insufficient water supply problem in the city, the PMC initiated the project of 24x7 water supply project in the city. The project was approved in February 2018. The total cost of the project is ₹2,550 crore. Of that, the PMC raised ₹200 crore through bonds. The PMC also levied water charges for the 24x7 project, and they have been charging since 2018. However, the actual project work started last December 2018 in the city. Under this project, the contractors should have to lay down 1,600 water pipelines and install 3.5 lakh water metres. L&T company will construct 80 overhead water tanks, on both fronts, L&T is behind schedule. Therefore, the PMC has imposed a fine of more than one lakh per day for water metre work and ₹35,000 per day for water tank work. Before that, PMC slapped more than 30 notices to companies for delay in work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-forms-team-to-speed-up-24x7-water-supply-project-101616559242032.html
24-03-2021||Pune||PMC intensifies encroachment and demolition drives in BDP areas||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has intensified encroachment drives in Bio-diversity Plan (BDP) areas across the city. The civic body has also filed police complaints against encroachers along with notices. During the Covid pandemic, the PMC found an increased number of encroachments in the BDP area. PMC has issued 121 notices for illegal constructions and cleared 1, 34171 square feet of areas which included sheds as well as RCC structures. The process of issuing another 57 notices is underway. The action and notices issued are in the areas of Katraj (new limit), Ambegaon budruk and Khurd, Yewalewadi, Dhayri, Hingne Khurd, Vadgaon Budruk and Khurd, Baner, Balewadi, Bavdhan, Kothrud, Warje Dhanakwadi, (old limit), Katraj (old limit), Bibvewadi, Kondhwa, Khurd (old limit), Hadapsar, (old limit), Wanowrie, and Parvati. The city is surrounded by a range of hills like Dive Katraj ghat, Panchgaon, Fergusson hill, Parvati hill, Chaturshringi hill, and Vetal hill. The areas were already covered with slums and unauthorized constructions and it has spread over seven hills in the 12 merged villages of 23 merged villages. This includes 124.45 hectares of government land and 853.09 hectares of privately owned land. The purpose of reservation BDP is to save hill slopes and hilltops and maintain greenery in the city. The state government merged 23 new villages in 1997 in old Pune city limit. After that, the civic body prepared a development plan for 23 merged villages in 2005. After that, the state government gave approval to 23 merged villages DP in parts. In 2015, the Maharashtra government took a decision to give 8 per cent green Transfer Development Rights (TDR) to the landowner as compensation and acquire the BDP land. However, owners are not happy with the compensation and they want cash compensation instead of TDR as rates of TDR are very low. At present, due to the less compensation amount, most of the BDP land has encroached. Some of the landowners are selling land in small pieces in the market. Last year, during the Covid pandemic period, the PMC found an increase in encroachments in BDP areas. Therefore, after the unlock process started, the PMC building permission department kickstarted a drive and cleared more than 1 lakh square feet of encroachments from the BDP area. Besides that, the PMC issued more than 15 notices and filed four police complaints in Hingne and Kondhwa area. After December 2020, the PMC started an encroachment drive in the BDP areas. Vandana Chavan, Member of Parliament (MP) of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) recently met PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar and demanded action on encroachments. Yuvraj Deshmukh, superintendent engineer of the building permission and control department said, “We have intensified the encroachment drives in the BDP areas. Now, our engineers are continuously checking encroachments. PMC commissioner has also instructed to take strict action against any encroachment in the BDP area.” Namdev Gambhire, executive engineer of building permission and control department said, “We have taken action in Katraj (new limit), Ambegaon budruk and Khurd, Yewalewadi, Dhayri, Hingne Khurd, Vadgaon Budruk and Khurd areas. We collected a fine for digging in the BDP area of Kondhwa and Katraj. We also wrote a letter to the tahashildar about illegal mining in the BDP area. We filed four police complaints on encroachers in Kondhwa and Hingne area.” Pune’s BDP areas Baner-Balewadi (89.07 hectare) Bavdhan-Kothrud (279.82) Warje-Shivane (166.18) Hingne-Wadgaon-Dhayari (118.42) Dhankwadi-Ambegaon (20.05) Katraj (216.30) Kondwa-Undri (45.73) Mohamadwadi-Hadapsar (42.94)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-intensifies-encroachment-and-demolition-drives-in-bdp-areas-101616557741938.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Delay in diagnosis of spinal TB lands many in paraplegia: Experts||On World Tuberculosis (TB) Day, city doctors have said that spinal TB could often be confused with arthritis and delay in diagnosis or treatment could lead to severe problems including paraplegia. Experts mentioned that it is important to understand that back pain cannot be only related to arthritis. Also, any form of severe back pain should be immediately consulted with a doctor. A 55-year-old woman who was affected by spinal tuberculosis that eventually led to a total loss of nerve sensations in her lower body was happy that she could walk again. Requesting anonymity, she said, “Being able to walk again has been a moment of great joy. A delay in diagnosis landed me in total paraplegia, it has been three months since I was unable to walk. I was suffering from back pain for more than six months. Initially, I neglected it but after consulting many doctors and after a battery of tests I was diagnosed with spinal TB. Now, post-surgery, I can walk and free of back pain.” Dr Shailesh Hadgaonkar, orthopaedic spine surgeon from Sancheti hospital who treated the woman said, “We get to see around twenty cases every month at our hospital. We get early, mid, and late-stage cases but not all cases require surgery. Surgery is only for those who cannot walk. In around 10 to 20 per cent of the newly diagnosed spinal TB cases paraplegia is seen. Even if a patient has developed paraplegia, there is always a good chance of recovery if treated early.”Spinal TB is often misdiagnosed as arthritis, experts point out the need to spot correct symptoms. Spinal TB patients often lose weight and appetite, and they get excruciating pain even in deep sleep.Dr. Hrushikesh Mehata, consultant orthopaedic spine surgeon from Noble Hospital said, “The most common form of TB affects lungs and is called ‘pulmonary TB’ but it may spread to other areas like spine which is then called as ‘extra-pulmonary TB’. TB infection can travel through blood from the lungs to reach the spinal column. This is more commonly seen in people wherein immunity is compromised due to any reason. Diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis is often delayed due to lack of specific symptoms. One must have a high index of suspicion and good clinical acumen to diagnose it early, any severe and prolonged back pain should be investigated and treated early.” Dr Ajit Kulkarni, consultant pulmonologist at Sahyadri Hospitals said that delayed diagnosis of TB can affect lungs and other organs also. Spinal tuberculosis comes under the category of extra pulmonary TB. In India, the percentage of having extra pulmonary TB is the same as having pulmonary TB that is lung TB. Spinal TB is second in extra pulmonary TB as far as its prevalence is concerned. Many times, the diagnosis gets delayed because the symptom can be a simple backache which is neglected. It must be investigated properly with consultation of the doctor and early diagnosis is based CT and MRI of spine. While pulmonary TB may require six months of treatment, however, for spinal TB it requires 18 to 24 months of treatment.” Dr. Reema Kashiva, another senior physician from the city said, “The functioning of all the vital organs in our body are interconnected. If any organ gets damaged the health of the entire body is affected. Just like Covid-19 which usually causes respiratory symptoms. However, it may cause fatal illness affecting many other body’s systems. In many cases it is seen that patients suffering from Covid-19 have died of cardiac injury. In some Covid-19 patients, nervous system damage has led to seizures and hallucination. Kidney damage was commonly seen in many Covid-19 patients. Like Covid-19, TB commonly affects the respiratory system. But TB also affects, abdomen, kidney, bone, and joint, and central nervous system. In all the life-threatening respiratory diseases, like tuberculosis, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, and Covid-19, it is seen that if it is not treated early, it can damage other vital organs of the human body. Hence, early diagnosis and timely treatment is important to save other body organs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/delay-in-diagnosis-of-spinal-tb-lands-many-in-paraplegia-experts-101616557563504.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Grand holi celebration unlikely this year due to Covid||The festival of Holi will be celebrated on March 28, but this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a grand celebration is more than unlikely. In Maharashtra, on the eve of Holi, typically after sunset, a pyre is lit, signifying “Holika Dahan”. There are public celebrations and social events usually planned around this event in housing societies. This year, residents are confused and unaware about how to celebrate the festival, as there are no guidelines yet from the state government or the civic bodies. Due to the increasing number of Covid cases, restrictions have been imposed in the district, under which not more than 50 persons are allowed to attend any gathering or function. Deepti Singh, a member of the Kingsbury building of the Pride World City housing society in Lohegaon, said, “The state government has not yet issued any specific guidelines for Holi celebrations. they should have published specific norms and set an advisory prior to the festival. It is one of the biggest festivals in the country and people do a lot of planning and preparation.” Singh added, “Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have already given guidelines and accordingly, people have planned the Holi events. At our housing society we are still in a dilemma as to how to celebrate Holi on our society premises. We want to take safety precautions and then celebrate the festival.” Pritesh Kamathe, secretary of Swapnshil Residency in Kondhwa, said, “Holi is one of the major festivals which we celebrate in our society and there are traditional rituals. Due to the increase in Covid numbers, we have decided to call residents in time slots so that there won’t be any crowding at the society’s Holika Dahan programme. Also, social distancing will be maintained.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/grand-holi-celebration-unlikely-this-year-due-to-covid-101616557561830.html
24-03-2021||Pune||PCMC to reopen jumbo Covid care unit||Given the surge in Covid cases, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will re-open the Jumbo Covid care unit at the Annasaheb Magar stadium, from Sunday. As of Monday, PCMC has 11,225 active cases. Currently, Covid patients are admitted to the Covid care centre at the auto cluster at Balnagri; to the Yashwantro Chavan Memorial hospital; the Jijamata hospital, Pimpri; and the Bhosari Hospital. “Looking at the surge, we have decided to restart the 816-bed Jumbo Covid facility. It will start in four days’ time,” said Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner. The jumbo facility at the Magar stadium began on September 1, 2020, and closed on January 1, 2021. In its first phase it was operated by Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). “PCMC will now rent this facility to a private firm which will be decided in due course. All the facilities at the Jumbo hospital are in working condition,” added Patil. Weekend curfew in PCMC? PCMC mayor Usha Dhore had suggested a weekend curfew to curb the rising Covid cases, but it has not been approved by the administration. “People should not take the current surge lightly. If negligence continues then we have to take strict action,” said Dhore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmc-to-reopen-jumbo-covid-care-unit-101616557261740.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Collector: Pune will not face oxygen shortage||Following a meeting with oxygen manufacturing units, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh claimed that the district would not face any shortage or disruption of oxygen supply. With a new plant in place, the district currently has an oxygen requirement of 135 metric tonnes, daily, and the new plant has a production capacity of 370 metric tonnes. In view of rising cases of Covid-19, which primarily affects the lungs, a patient’s oxygen requirement increases as the condition worsens. Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune division, who was also part of the meeting, said, “During the meeting we assessed if they have any problems to continue with production and to ensure the smooth supply of oxygen. Air Liquide, a private firm in Chakan, is one of the largest oxygen manufacturers in Pune. We authorised the plant in October 2020 which was after the September peak had receded. During the peak the maximum requirement of the district had gone up to 370 metric tonnes, so hopefully there should be no shortage of oxygen. The 70:30 medical-industrial oxygen supply proportion is still imposed on manufacturers.” Deshmkh said, “As of now, the district has a requirement of 135 metric tonnes of oxygen daily and manufacturers currently have 790 metric tonnes in stock. In the near future, it appears that there might be no shortage of oxygen.”The manufacturers also demanded that the employees and truck drivers working at the oxygen manufacturing units must be vaccinated as they are frontline workers to which Deshmukh agreed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/collectorpune-will-not-face-oxygen-shortage-101616556661767.html

This law means that search will be conducted without a warrant and 'any policemen can arrest if they believe something is wrong'. There is no use of courts and magistrates," he said.Responding to the ruckus, the Speaker while speaking to ANI said, "Today's incident is condemnable.

24-03-2021||Gurugram||Most meat shops shut, violators let off with warning||Officials said that 120 of the 129 meat shops remained closed during checks on Tuesday, as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) started to enforce the House decision to shut meat shops on Tuesdays.“Almost all the licensed meat shops operating in the city were found to be closed during our inspections. There were nine such shops which were found to be open, all in areas located in the vicinity of Sadar Bazar. Owners of such shops were let off with a warning this time and their shops were closed immediately. From next week, any violator will be immediately penalised,” said Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, the official responsible for issuing licences and penalties to meat shops in the city and ensuring norms compliance.Around 70 teams of the MCG and around 300 Gurugram police personnel scanned the city for open meat shops, officials said, and upon finding open ones near Sadar Bazar, alerted senior officials.According to MCG officials, the owners of all nine open meat shops were aware of the MCG’s direction. However, they had opened their shops hoping there would be no spot check or penalties.During an MCG House meeting on March 18, the civic body decided to close meat shops on Tuesdays after two councillors had floated the proposal citing religious sentiments. Despite the MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh stating that eating meat is a “personal choice” and the House should consider this before coming to a decision, the MCG approved the proposal as per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation by-laws, 2008, which permits the shutdown of meat shops on one day of the week.During last week’s House meeting, MCG officials also approved a proposal for increasing the fines for meat shop violations by 10 times, from ₹500 to ₹5,000 and permanently sealing a meat shop, if the owner commits three violations. MCG officials said that before next Tuesday, they will be issuing a notification regarding the change in the fine amount and then start sealing meat shops.Usha Kundu, the assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), Gurugram, said that around 300 personnel were deputed for the task, but did not find any open meat shop.“Our teams carried out inspections till the afternoon, especially in areas such as Jacobpura, Khandsa, Chakkarpur, and Badshahpur that have a sizeable number of meat shops. However, no meat shop was found to be operational. We also did not receive any receive report of any ruckus or complaints on the matter,” said Kundu.The MCG and Gurugram police were operating independently on the matter.“Across the city, almost all the meat shop owners complied with the MCG’s direction. The MCG needs to realise that more than 80% of the city’s meat shops are owned by local businessmen who operate their shops on a low scale. Their income and survival depend on the daily sale of meat. On Tuesdays, they had a sizeable amount of business and the MCG’s direction has put them under immense financial duress,” said Pritam Bhagat, president, Jacobpura meat shops’ association, adding that such small-scale owners do not have the wealth or the expertise to pursue the matter legally against the MCG.“I complied with the direction of the MCG, as I did not want me or my employees to face any trouble. Our business has been hit by the coronavirus and more recently, by bird flu. The MCG’s direction has only made things worse for us,” said Aftab Khan, a meat shop owner in Sector 12.MCG officials also clarified that only physical shops will remain closed while online meat delivery portals can continue to operate. On Tuesdays, such portals were found to be operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/most-meat-shops-shut-violators-let-off-with-warning-101616539379748.html
24-03-2021||Bangalore||Lockdown, rain revive groundwater level||Covid-19 brought with it endless suffering to people world over but for Bengaluru, it also brought in some relief in the form of increased groundwater levels, according to government data.Copious rainfall in Bengaluru last year coupled with the lockdown-induced decline in demand by commercial establishments helped reverse a downward trend of dipping water levels.The four talukas of Bengaluru—North, South, East and Anekal—have seen a marginal average rise in static water levels ranging from 0.30 metre to as high as 8.75 metres between 2016 and 2020, government data shows.“Good rains last year have helped reverse the trend of declining water levels. But there is over exploitation in all four talukas of Bengaluru,” said a Karnataka government official aware of the developments.Bengaluru received 1,082 mm of rainfall in 2020, 28% more than its normal, according to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre.But the rise in water levels cannot be mistaken for a reversal of the downward trend in the long term as excessive commercial activities, high-rise residential buildings and lack of reusing water have weighed in on India’s IT capital, experts and officials said.The crisis in Bengaluru comes on account of over exploitation of groundwater and the lack of resources to reuse water or feed it back into the earth to help recharge water levels below the surface, experts and scientists said.The United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, themed “Valuing Water” and released on Monday, stated that there will be a global water deficit of 40% by 2030.“Humans certainly use water as if it was limitless: an estimated 80% of all industrial and municipal wastewater, for example, is released into the environment without prior treatment,” the UN report stated.The report added that over 2 billion people worldwide already live-in areas subject to water stress and around 45% of the global population (3.5 billion) lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities.Several urban centres in India face a similar crisis, but few witness problems that Bengaluru endures on account of its water shortages. The city, despite all the money it spends on lake rejuvenation and other exercises, remains firmly in the grip of water tankers that deliver the precious resource as a business model to apartments and other households in Bengaluru.“The water mafia has sucked water dry and there is no groundwater because there is no recharge. People are paying a heavy price and the water scarcity in the region is really worrying,” said T.V Ramachandra from Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science.He added that over concretisation has led to the crisis, which the decision makers are yet to acknowledge.Having lost the river Vrishabhavathi to over exploitation and several lakes to encroachments, sewage inlets and bad maintenance, Bengaluru is heavily dependent on the inflow of Cauvery water from about a 100 km away to quench its thirst, experts said.Being Karnataka’s biggest revenue generator, successive governments have followed a predictable path of diverting Cauvery water into the city even if it deprives surrounding districts of their requirements.With no river water in close proximity, people in hundreds of villages in erstwhile Bengaluru built lakes and tanks as a resource for irrigation and drinking. Out of the remaining 210 lakes, around 19 are encroached and most others are in a pitiable state that neither quench the city’s thirst nor improve the groundwater table due to over three to four decades of accumulated silt, experts said.Bengaluru also receives copious rainfall but barely a fraction of it is harvested, leaving most of this water to flood streets and then flow into drains and eventually find its way into lakes, experts said.Several other parts of Karnataka face a similar problem with water, according to the groundwater directorate in Bengaluru.“There are about 14 districts, 41 talukas and 1,199 villages in Karnataka that are over exploited,” M Raveendrappa, the project director of the groundwater directorate, said. The directorate on Monday launched a campaign in 1,199 water-stressed villages of the state as part of a nation-wide campaign.Even where groundwater level is available, almost at nearly 2,000 ft, it is of poor quality like in Peenya industrial area, a locality where several micro and small industries operate.Priyanka Jamwal of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) said that in Peenya, the borewell water has heavy metals, trace metals and other toxic contaminants largely since most of the used water is let out without being treated.“If you go to parts of the city where there is Cauvery water supply, groundwater is not that contaminated because there is proper recharge happening,” she said. But in the outskirts of the city, which largely depend on borewells, there are high levels of nitrate and fecal coliforms because of the soak-away pits present there with no lining and contaminating the groundwater, Jamwal added.“Where there is no sewerage system or pipe water supply, there is groundwater contamination,” Jamwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lockdown-rain-revive-groundwater-level-101616531250170.html
24-03-2021||Chandigarh||Only 58% health workers vaccinated in Mohali||The vaccination drive against Covid-19 in Mohali district continues to witness a poor response as only 58% health workers have received the jab. Even the response from senior citizens has not been very encouraging.In Mohali, vaccines are being administered at 40 private hospitals and 31 government hospitals.As many as 13,979 health-care workers got themselves registered for the first dose, but only 8,127 received the jab. Even for the second dose, out of total 8,127 health workers, only 3,825 beneficiaries came forward.As many as 8,910 front-line workers registered themselves, but only 6,912 got the first dose, which is around 75%; for the second dose, out of a total 6,912, only 1,706 got the second dose, which is 25%.The vaccination drive for health-care workers began on January 15; for senior citizens, it began from March 1.On the other hand, as many as 16,594 senior citizens got their first dose, while 2,861 persons aged between 45 and 59 with co-morbidities were administered the vaccine in the last three weeks.‘There is some mistrust among beneficiaries’Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur said, “We are repeatedly requesting them to come and get the vaccine, but I think there is some mistrust among beneficiaries and now we are preparing them mentally to get the jab.”She further said that there is no target for senior citizens, but the response was not encouraging despite the city having a good literacy rate.Dr Rajendra Bhooshan, in-charge for Covid-19 vaccine in Mohali, said, “Though the drive is picking up, it is still not to the expectation and potential of the district. People are taking it casually and with the rising cases of Covid-19, I urge the residents to come forward as the vaccine is safe and without any side-effects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-58-health-workers-vaccinated-in-mohali-101616532359406.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze the mastermind, will seek his custody, says Maha ATS chief||Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad chief Jaijeet Singh on Tuesday said that suspended police officer Sachin Vaze was a “prime accused” in the Mansukh Hiran murder case, adding that the investigating agency has procured a transfer warrant from a Thane court with which it will approach the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court seeking his custody.Vaze is in custody of NIA till March 25 for allegedly planting an SUV filled with explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence last month. Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts dealer who was linked to the car, was found dead at the Reti Bunder Creek on March 5.Speaking to reporters at a press conference outside the agency’s office in south Mumbai, Singh said that more arrests were likely in the case.“Accused in the said crime, Sachin Vaze is in the custody of the National Investigation Agency till March 25. Since, it is necessary to thoroughly interrogate him in connection with the crime, a transfer warrant has been obtained from the Chief Judicial Magistrate at Thane and a comprehensive application has been filed before the Special NIA court at Mumbai. We are sure that after thoroughly interrogating him, the ATS team will get to the bottom of the crime and unearth the conspiracy,” Singh said.ATS on March 21 arrested two men, Vinayak Shinde, a convicted constable on parole in an encounter case, and bookie Naresh Gor in the murder of the 48-year-old spare parts dealer, who was in possession of the SUV, and which he reported stolen before it was found parked outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Antilia residence last month containing 20 loose sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter addressed to the businessman and his wife.“It has come to light in the investigation that some of the 14 SIM cards obtained through accused Naresh Gor were activated and given to Vinayak Shinde, and Shinde in turn transferred the activated SIM cards to others involved in the crime and the SIM cards were used in commission of the said crime. Preliminary investigation has revealed that some of the SIM cards used in commission of the crime and some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used, were destroyed by the accused,” Singh said.The probe agency also claimed to have detained a person from Ahmedabad who allegedly provided SIM cards to the accused.ATS interrogated Vaze on March 8, following a statement by Vimla, Hiran’s wife, accusing the suspended cop of having a hand in her husband’s death.Her statement also revealed that Vaze and Hiran knew each other well and that Vaze had borrowed the Scorpio that was later found outside Antilia, for four months between November 2020 and February 2021. He returned it to Hiran in early February.Hiran reported the car stolen on February 18.Following Vimla’s statement, ATS registered a case of murder against unknown persons.“In interrogation, Vaze refuted all the allegations leveled against him. He claimed that the vehicle in question (Mahindra Scorpio) had never been in his possession and also maintained that he had nothing to do with the deceased. He denied having any involvement in the said crime and that he had no knowledge about the said crime. But ATS officials have collected evidence showing that the claims made by Vaze are false and further probe is on to find out his exact involvement in the said crime,” Singh said.The ATS chief said that it was Vaze who contacted Shinde when the latter walked out of jail on parole last year and took his help, he said.According to ATS, Shinde contacted Hiran, posing as “Tawde saab from Mumbai crime branch”on the evening of March 4, the day before Hiran’s body was found in a Thane creek.“Preliminary investigation suggests that Shinde along with others was involved. A Volvo car seized from Daman is suspected to have been used in the crime,” the ATS chief said.The Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina in Mumbai examined the car on Tuesday, he added.A team of five forensic officers from Pune also visited Thane on Tuesday afternoon along with ATS officials. The forensic team examined the blue coloured Volvo seized by ATS. The officials refused to talk but collected several samples from the car for over two hours.“The team did not find any documents or equipments in the car. They were collecting fingerprints, footprints and any other forensic evidence which will help in the investigation,” an official said.ATS has also obtained CCTV footage from various spots even though the accused destroyed some CCTV footage in a bid to destroy evidence of their movement, officials said.“To understand how exactly the crime was committed, a demonstration was conducted by taking the arrested accused at the crime scene. Analysis of the information collected by raiding the residences, offices and godowns of the arrested accused is going on,” Singh said.Meanwhile, NIA is also conducting a parallel probe in the Hiran murder case as well as the explosives case. A team searched the premises of a room in Trident hotel, where Vaze reportedly stayed between February 16 and 20. According to a senior NIA officer, CCTV footage from the hotel shows Vaze entering with five bags. The bags are yet to be recovered, this officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaze-the-mastermind-will-seek-his-custody-says-maha-ats-chief-101616531205302.html
24-03-2021||Chandigarh||Limited capacity in govt institutes, Chandigarh ropes in pvt labs to expand RT-PCR tests||Failing to expand the RT-PCR testing facilities in government institutions, the UT administration has roped in private testing laboratories to meet the target set by the Union health ministry amid the rising Covid-19 infection trajectory in the city.The UT administration, on Tuesday, held a meeting with representatives of eight private laboratories, asking them to process the samples collected by the UT health department at a fixed rate.Earlier, the UT administration had asked Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, to expand testing, but the capacity could not be stretched beyond 950 samples a day.The requirement is to expand the weekly RT-PCR testing to 70% from the current level of 50%.UT officials said the PGIMER, after the request of the administration, had obliged to process 600 samples of UT, and GMCH-32 was directed to expand the capacity from current 200 to 400. With more samples being collected for the RT-PCR testing, the turnaround period for the reports of the samples has also increased to 48 hours. The official said that though all private laboratories have accepted the proposal, a few labs require more than 24 hours to process the tests, however, the administration has put a strict condition to process the tests within 24 hours. UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said due to the issue of less capacity within the government sector, the private players have been involved to increase the pace of testing the city and meet the target of RT-PCR testing.“There have been some issues with increasing the testing in the government sector. On the pattern of Haryana, we have roped in private players to help us increase the ratio of the RT-PCR testing ratio as per the instructions of the central government. We have started with 200 samples today and based on our requirement, private facilities will be used. The expenditure for the same will be borne from the Covid fund by UT Administration,” he said.However, the decision has not gone well with residents who suggest that the government facilities should be increased for better quality and management of resource. “We have institutes like PGIMER and GMCH-32 which can easily process the samples. Resources should be utilised for increasing the capacity in the government sector,” said RK Garg, president of Second Innings Association.Responding to the criticism, UT Adviser Manoj Parida said, “PGIMER only receives 600 samples and the facility at GMCH-32 is also limited. It is the need of the hour to expand the facility and every available resource is being utilised.” Officials said orders for more machines for RT-PCR testing at GMCH-32 have been placed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/limited-capacity-in-govt-institutes-chandigarh-ropes-in-pvt-labs-to-expand-rt-pcr-tests-101616531818743.html

These include health workers, frontline workers, senior citizens and comorbid groups aged between 45 to 59.So far, 67,782 doses have been administered, including 26,354 residents above the age of 60. Among the health workers, 50% of the 28,759 targeted beneficiaries have been inoculated. Similarly among the front-line workers, 57% of the 14,173 targeted have received the jab. Only 3,330 persons from the comorbid group have been inoculated.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director of the UT health department, said that the health workers were being motivated to take the jab and a special camp would be organised for them.“By the end of this month, we target to cover more than 20% workers through special drives. We will organise doubt-clearing as well as vaccination drive this month for the same,” Dr Nagpal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/two-months-on-only-50-health-workers-receive-jab-in-chandigarh-101616531400332.html
24-03-2021||Chandigarh||High court allows plea seeking Panjab University senate polls||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday allowed a petition, seeking polls to Panjab University’s (PU) apex governing body-- the senate. The bench of Justice Fateh Deep Singh allowed the plea filed by seven ex-senators, who had moved high court in December, seeking senate elections and had accused the varsity of delaying the polls at the behest of ruling dispensation at the Centre. A detailed order from the court is awaited. However, the plea seeking polls has been allowed by the high court. The petitioners had challenged orders of August 15, 2020 and October 17, 2020 in which the senate elections were deferred in view of the prevailing conditions due to the Covid-19 outbreak. PU, in response to the plea, had argued that it has initiated a process to hold senate elections. However, it added that the varsity has also constituted a high-level committee of experts to examine the varsity’s present governing structure in view of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, according to which the senate is to be replaced with the board of governors (BoG). PU is governed by a 91-member senate, the elections of which are pending since August last year. The varsity is currently functioning without a governing body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-court-allows-plea-seeking-panjab-university-senate-polls-101616531338594.html

The Hurriyat said it welcomes the shift towards good neighbourly relations between the two countries, which was the first step in the direction of a meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir conflict.“But we also believes that unless an atmosphere free of fear, repression and human rights violations is not permitted on the ground in Kashmir, efforts at good neighbourly relations will not bear fruit,” the Hurriyat statement said.The turn in India-Pakistan relations comes around one-and-a-half years after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was revoked by the central government and the region split into two Union territories. It asked the government to stop using government agencies to intimidate the youth. “The random arrests and slapping of PSA on the youth and policy of intimidation and harassment through agencies should be ended. Deaths and destruction during encounters which are deeply disturbing, should be immediately stopped,” it said.On March 9, Union minister of state for home affairs G Kishan Reddy had told the parliament that 173 people, including separatists, overground workers and stone pelters continue to be under custody after they were detained after the scrapping of Article 370. The separatist amalgam said it is ready to extend full support to all initiatives between the two countries that aim at bringing peace in the subcontinent and seek a fair and peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute.Last month, Indian and Pakistan’s militaries agreed to strictly observe a ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC).

The government should keep such essentials,” he said, citing the example of potatoes.Mann said the AAP was opposing these “black laws” from day one, from the streets to Parliament. He asked that Harsimrat should also make public the proceedings of the meeting of June 5, 2020, when these bills came to the Union cabinet meeting and she supported them.Harsimrat hits back at Sangrur MPMeanwhile, Harsimrat Badal on Tuesday said the AAP MP’s statement on the parliamentary standing committee was “a resounding self-goal and an unequivocal admission” that he and his party did not oppose the controversial anti-farmer bills in the meeting or in the Parliament.The Akali leader said the masters of doublespeak have been caught in the act and themselves provided the most irrefutable proof of how meekly Bhagwant Mann and AAP surrendered to the BJP on the three Acts while publicly pretending to oppose the same. “They (AAP) have obviously over-reached their own cunning limits and unwittingly clinched the case against themselves,” she said in a press release here.The SAD leader said that in the entire audio and minutes released by Mann, there is not a single word of protest or opposition or rejection of the said Acts nor can he be heard voicing his own or his party’s protest against the damage the said laws would inflict on the farmers. “The only thing you can hear is Mann meekly and most obsequiously seeking mere clarifications on the implications of the Essential Commodities Act. He is virtually cringing before the chairman while he pretends to roar in public to befool the masses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-mp-bhagwant-mann-asks-punjab-cm-harsimrat-to-come-clean-on-farm-laws-101616530621233.html

24-03-2021||Chandigarh||J&K to take stock of its critically endangered Hangul population||Wildlife authorities will carry out a population census of the unique Kashmiri royal stag, vernacularly known as the Hangul, which once ruled the Valley but has become a critically endangered species with sightings mostly reported in Srinagar’s Dachigam National Park.The four-day counting exercise will start on April 3 and will around 220 wildlife experts, field staff, academics and scholars, some of them from the higher educational institutes of Kashmir. A population census is conducted every two years.“The census was scheduled to start from March 23 but has been postponed to April 3. It will be a four-day activity that will be held on alternate days,” said wildlife warden, Central Kashmir, Altaf Hussain.The last viable population of Hangul (Cervus hanglu hanglu) in the Indian sub-continent exists only in the protected Dachigam National Park, a vast mountainous 141 sq km sanctuary on the outskirts of Srinagar, where Hangul grazed in hordes before the start of militancy in 1989. Lately, there have been a few sightings in connected areas outside the park in south Kashmir but their number is believed to be negligible.The specie has been placed in ‘critically endangered’ category by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is the only survivor of the red deer group in the Indian sub-continent. In 2019, the population of the animal had slightly improved to 237 from 214 in 2017.“There will be an orientation programme for experts and scholars before starting the census. Later, three field counts will be held on alternate days,” said Hussain, adding that the teams will disperse around 40-45 identified tracks of the Hangul. “Each track will be assigned to one group of four to five people with equipment such as GPS, binoculars, range finder and date sheets. They will be recording every physical sighting, sighting of pelt or other impressions on the basis of which we will be able to assess the number,” Hussain said. Population dropped to 200 from 3-5K during insurgency Poached for its meat, antlers and skin, the deer’s population dropped below 200 in the early 1990s from 800-900 in 1988 after insurgency paralysed the state administration. It had a thriving population of 3,000-5,000 in the 1900s.However, the number of Hangul stabilised after poachers were forced out when militancy reached its peak in mid-1990s and militants and the army battled each other deep in the forests, the natural abode of the shy animal.“Around three-four decades ago, Hangul thrived on a massive landscape from Bandipora (north) to Tulail Shopian (south) through Dachigam (centre),” Hussain said.The deer’s population has stabilised owing to conservation efforts of the wildlife department to protect the park and minimise disturbances. “Its population is not declining at an alarming rate anymore. We have been able to stabilise the numbers of the animal,” he said.However, wildlife experts are concerned as to why their numbers are not increasing despite three decades of conservation efforts.In 2016, a report compiled by a team of environmentalists and wildlife experts, named armed conflict, large-scale interferences to its habitats in the form of excessive grazing by livestock of nomads in the Hangul’s erstwhile summer habitats, grass cutting, fuel and firewood collection, human trampling owing to vehicles of hundreds of paramilitary forces camped inside the park and employees of more than seven government departments, as some of the reasons. “We have been able to control some of the factors to a large extent, though there is pressure in upper Dachigam,” Hussain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jkto-take-stock-of-its-critically-endangered-hangul-population-101616530378887.html

24-03-2021||Chandigarh||Supplementary chargesheet against Parra an afterthought: PDP||The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday refuted allegations levelled in National Investigation Agency’s supplementary chargesheet against the party’s youth wing president Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra.The party’s additional spokesperson Najmu Saqib said Parra was being victimised for standing by and fiercely advocating the PDP’s political agenda and that the charges were a ‘pernicious attempt to muzzle voices of Kashmir’.“A through-and-through democrat who dedicated his life to strengthening the cause of the mainstream in Jammu and Kashmir, Parra is being punished for some thing he should be appreciated for,” Saqib said.“We strongly believe that none of these frivolous charges will stand judicial scrutiny and Parra will eventually get justice,” Saqib said. The NIA filed had a supplementary chargesheet against Parra and two others for their alleged links to terror cases involving Hizbul Mujahideen Commander Naveed Babu. In 2020, suspended Jammu and Kashmir deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh was arrested in connection with the same case.In its charge sheet, filed in the Jammu special court, the agency has alleged that Parra, a close aide of J&K former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, was a crucial player in sustaining the ‘political-separatist-terrorist’ nexus in the Union territory, apart from financing the activities of the Hizbul Mujahideen.Meanwhile, the party’s Jammu spokesperson Firdous Tak said party leaders were being targeted by different agencies and were being forced to join BJP’s shadow organisation, Apni Party. Taking a swipe at the BJP, Tak said the PDP was continuing to resist the undemocratic and unconstitutional onslaught on Jammu and Kashmir. He urged the different political parties to unite against the unconstitutional onslaught. “PDP is ready to get consumed in its struggle to represent aspirations of people of erstwhile state instead of succumbing to the designs of the ruling BJP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/supplementary-chargesheet-against-parra-an-afterthought-pdp-101616530081190.html

They had gathered to mark the 90th death anniversary of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, who were martyred during the freedom struggle against the British on March 23, 1931.Several Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) also attended the event organised by Bhartiya Kisan Union (Doaba).The leaders paid tributes to the martyrs in their speeches and also urged the people to keep faith in the “Sanyukt Kisan Morcha” leadership as it would not let them down. The event saw majority of youths in attendance, adding more energy to the unity call.Differences and ideological issues had erupted between the morcha leadership and a section of the youth after the Red Fort violence on January 26 during the tractor parade organised by the farmer leaders.While addressing the gathering, Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), said that following in the footsteps Shaheed Bhagat Singh, they were fighting against the Centre’s three farm laws. He alleged that the central agencies were busy running defamation campaigns against the morcha leadership. “I want to make it clear that the government has already lost the debate over the farm bills, which is why there are no more table talks. We were asked by a senior BJP leader, who admitted the new laws were anti-farmer, to reach a midway solution so that the government could also save face,” said Rajewal adding that it has become an international protest.He said the BJP also feared loss of votes as farmers opposed the party in the electoral states.Reaching out to the young faces of the agitation, Rajewal said, “Youngsters are the core and power of the protests while we (leaders) have to keep calm to carry forward the cause. We are fighting it on your (youths) support. I reiterate that the morcha leadership will not lose the fight.”Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, president BKU (Siddhupur), also invoked Bhagat Singh’s sacrifice and told the youth activists that it was their fight too and they were going succeed.Dr Darshan Pal, senior leader of the morcha, said that the country-wide farmer protests were haunting the central government. He also snubbed those calling the stir politically-driven. “We will not return till the farm laws are repealed,” he said.Noted Punjabi singer Babbu Maan said that be it youths, adults or elders, unity was vital to win the fight for betterment of Punjab. He called for strengthening the ongoing protests if it needed to be extended.Baba Nihal Singh, president of Tarna Dal, Hariwela, gave a clear message that of shunning differences and joining the banner of kisan unions to win the fight. Similarly, president of Budha Dal, Nihang Balbir Singh vowed to back the farmer organisations and their protests. “We will continue our support despite there being efforts to create rift among the sections,” he said.Hardeep Singh Dibdibba, grandfather of Navreet Singh who died during the tractor parade, said that they have been organising a march to Singhu border from Moga to connect the youth with farmer unions. Padma Shri awardee and environmentalist Baba Sewa Singh from Khadoor Sahib, Sant Kulwant Ram from Guru Ravidas society and others also addressed the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhagat-singh-death-anniversary-farmers-sikh-leaders-call-for-united-fight-against-centre-s-agri-laws-101616530080260.html

While pronouncing the quantum of punishment in 2014 case, the court of special CBI judge Sushil Kumar Garg compared corrupt officials to “termites” while imposing a fine of ₹50,000 on Sarwan Kumar, the then head warder of Burail model jail. “The persons of the ilk of the convict are termites responsible for eating up the roots of the societal and fiscal tree of the nation and thereby depriving the entire nation of the fruits of that tree.” the court held. Seeking exemplary punishment for the corrupt official, CBI public prosecutor KP Singh had submitted, “It is the need of the hour to give exemplary punishment to the public servant. Taking a lenient view sends a very wrong message.” Terming conduct of Sarwan as “deplorable”, the court turned down his request for leniency. Court cites example of a termite-infested tree Drawing parallels between corrupt officials and termites, the court cited the example of a fruit-bearing tree. “In a locality, a mango tree was planted by a resident. It was nursed and cared for immensely. It bore honey sweet mangoes. The entire populace of the locality enjoyed the fruit. However, with the passage of time, termites ate the roots of the tree. As a consequence, the tree dried up and stopped bearing fruit. Not just the man who planted the tree but the entire populace of the locality was deprived of the fruit. Termites, who ate the tree up, had not contributed towards its growth and nursing,” read the court order. Inmate had sought change in duty from the warder Sarwan Kumar was arrested in July 2014 on charges of demanding money from Sandeep Kumar, who was serving a life term since December 2008 in a kidnapping case. After returning from parole, he had requested the head warden to change his duty from the visitors’ room, in the presence of his cell mate Prem Singh Bisht. After Sarwan sought bribe from Sandeep, Prem provided him with his brother, Pratap Singh Bisht’s phone number and asked him to get in touch with him with the demand. According to Pratap, who works with the Chandigarh administration and was the complainant in the case, Sarwan first asked him to buy a water purifier for him but later asked for ₹5,000 cash instead. Pratap alerted the CBI and a trap was laid to catch the accused red-handed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exburail-head-warder-gets-four-year-jail-in-graft-case-101616530078362.html

24-03-2021||Delhi||Somnath Bharti sent to Tihar after court upholds conviction in AIIMS case||A Delhi court on Tuesday upheld an order sentencing AAP MLA Somnath Bharti to two years in jail for assaulting the AIIMS security staff. After the court order, Bharti was taken into custody and sent to Tihar jail, his lawyer said.In January, a magistrate court sentenced Bharti, MLA from Malviya Nagar assembly constituency, to two years in prison.Special judge Vikas Dhull partly dismissed Bharti’s appeal and convicted him for the offences under sections 147 (rioting) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC and under section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The court, however, set aside his conviction under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with section 149 of IPC.After the court upheld his conviction, Bharti tweeted: “It was March 23 when people in power duly aided by Indian politicians hanged Shahid-e-azam Bhagat Singh Ji, Rajguru Ji n Sukhdev Ji n today again I failed to get justice 4m sessions court n being sent to Jail for my struggle for rights of people in a false case.Inquilab zindabad!”The Aam Aadmi Party refused to comment on the matter.A senior officer at Tihar, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that the AAP leader has been brought to the prison and lodged in jail number 2. “He was brought after a detailed medical examination. His health is stable. He has not made any demands or asked for any facilities. He has been lodged in a regular cell with other prisoners.”Prison officers said they will keep an eye on Somnath Bharti’s safety owing to his political background.Welcoming the court’s order, Delhi BJP Adesh Gupta said, “Now the Speaker of Delhi Assembly should immediately terminate Somnath Bharti’s membership, failing which Delhi BJP will approach the Election Commission of India seeking his disqualification.”According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence on a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) with a JCB operator.According to Bharti, AIIMS had no authorisation to cover the ‘nallah’ (drain) between Gautam Nagar and Ring Road as it was a public property and had to be opened for general use. During the course of investigation, it came on record that the drain was given on lease to the AIIMS for covering and maintenance.The sessions court said in its order that the evidence of eye witnesses to the incident was consistent to the effect that a gathering of around 200-300 people along with Bharti were present near the boundary wall of AIIMS and they were trying to break the wall and the fence by the use of JCB machine.It added that when some of the eye witnesses resisted the bringing down of the fence, they were abused and injured due to stone pelting by the mob.“The evidence which has come on record of the eye witnesses shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons of which appellant (Bharti) was the member.“It is true that only five accused persons were charged for the offence under Section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and out of which four accused persons have been acquitted but still I do not find any illegality in the conviction of appellant for the offence under section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC as the evidence which has come on record shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons and the remaining persons could not be identified or apprehended,” the judge said in his order.The judge said however that the magistrate court had committed “grave illegality” in convicting the AAP leader for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt as the evidence of the injured persons were not reliable and trustworthy.It said no explanation has been given by the prosecution as to why the injured persons were not medically examined on the date of the offence and on what basis, opinion was sought, when no injuries were observed by the doctor or reported by injured.“The opinion regarding injuries has been taken by the IO (investigating officer) on May 5, 2018, i.e. almost after two years of the incident,” it said.It further said the manner in which the persons had suffered injuries was not corroborative and was contradictory to each other which made their testimony doubtful and unreliable.The court said the prosecution has not brought any such medical record which made this court raise an adverse inference against prosecution that no such injuries were suffered by the injured.“In the light of the evidence which has come on record, the evidence of injured persons namely...was not at all reliable and trustworthy and the MLCs could not have been relied upon. “Therefore, the trial court had committed a grave illegality in convicting the appellant for the offence under section 323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC when the evidence which has come on record, was not reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly, the appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC,” it said.In his appeal filed through advocate Mohd Irshad, Bharti had claimed the magistrate court’s order was based upon a totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution which failed miserably to provide even an iota of evidence to prove his guilt.The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, said there was no illegality or infirmity in the judgment for conviction and sentencing order of the magistrate court and the judgment has been delivered based upon the reliable evidence which has come on record.In January, Bharti was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against his conviction in the case and jail term.The magistrate court had acquitted Bharti’s associates and co-accused -- Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey -- citing a lack of evidence against them.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from R S Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.Bharti had told the court that police officials and other witnesses had deposed against him in order to falsely implicate him in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/somnath-bharti-sent-to-tihar-after-court-upholds-conviction-in-aiimscase-101616525291155.html

The court had also issued directions to the officers to take necessary action against the owners of Royal Enfield (Bullet) motorcycles if they are found running their vehicle with an illegal exhaust.“It was the duty of the respondents to ensure that the Bullet motorcycles are running in Ludhiana without any modification made in their silencers. But the respondents have failed to act against the violators and a large number of Bullet motorcycles fitted with illegal exhaust or without silences are running in the city,” mentioned Sabharwal while adding that this is not only leading to extreme level of noise pollution, but also causes nuisance to the people standing nearby or crossing these bikes. It also causes shock to the people when they suddenly hear such an extreme loud noise coming out of these illegal installed exhausts, he added. Sabharwal said despite several representations, the respondents failed to curb this menace.Meanwhile, Agrawal said that the Ludhiana police on February 22 had initiated action against such violators and announced registration of FIRs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/notice-to-ludhiana-police-chief-for-inaction-against-modified-silencers-of-bikes-101616529358195.html

For, the village panchayat has set an example for others by creating an income pool from a host of amenities like a mini-marriage palace, a booth market comprising 14 shops and a modern gym that it built largely from its own resources. A large under-construction marriage palace will fetch the panchayat an additional annual income of ₹8-10 lakh, locals said. Besides, the village with a population of 7,000 is completely covered with HD CCTV (high-definition closed-circuit television) cameras, solar street lights and interlocked tiles. Village sarpanch Kuldeep Kaur said, “Four years ago, the village streets remained waterlogged for months in the absence of a drainage system. We dug up its 5 ponds for accumulating the sewage and then discharge it into the nearby drain.”Panchayat secretary Sukhbir Singh, who is a resident of the village, said, “Currently, we are generating ₹3 lakh annually from the mini-marriage palace, the market and the gym. The second marriage palace will be completed by the end of the year.”Even the Union ministry of panchayati raj recognized development in the village and awarded it with the ‘Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar’ in April 2018. The ministry had teams visited the village twice in 2017. Also, the then Punjab rural development and panchayati raj minister Sikander Singh Maluka had also given the best panchayat to the village in 2016. Sukhbir Singh said, “Nearly 85% of the total expenditure for development works was incurred by the panchayat from its own resources. Residents of cities have to pay multiple charges to have facilities. But our objective is to provide these facilities to the villagers at low charges or fees.”Low chargesKaur Singh, a village panch, said, “We are charging only ₹5,100 per marriage for the banquet hall.

Officials said most of these GPIs are textile units, distilleries, and food and beverages units.As per the letter issued by the chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board to the chairman of HSPCB, the local board has been directed to ensure that all GPIs in Haryana have online continuous effluent monitoring systems (OCEMS) installed and they should submit an action-taken report within a month.This was after data revealed that only 285 of the 1,631 GPIs identified in the Yamuna river basin (in Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) have installed OCEMS and provided its connectivity to the CPCB.Of the 1,346 GPIs identified without OCEMS, 661 are operating in Haryana and are immediately required to install the system and give its connectivity to the HSPCB and CPCB for real-time monitoring of pollution being caused by the effluents discharged from these units.In the letter, HSPCB has been asked to issue directions to owners of the 661 GPIs to install OCEMS within three months. The system has to be set up at the outlet of the effluent treatment plants for measurement parameters set up to monitor pollution.The GPIs will also need to connect and upload online continuous effluent monitoring data at HSPCB and CPCB in a time-bound manner to ensure regular maintenance, calibration and operation of OCEMS for round-the-clock monitoring.Haryana has also been asked to submit action-taken report within a month. S Narayanan, member secretary of the HSPCB, said, “Soon after getting directions from the CPCB, we have issued directions to all regional officers to ensure compliance of orders and have sought detailed reports on action taken in this regard.”On whether this online monitoring system will help the pollution control board to take immediate action against the erring industries, he said, “Since the units will be connected with the servers of HSPCB and CPCB we will be able to monitor the real-time values. We have established a special cell at our headquarters for the same.”Untreated effluents from industrial units are a major cause of pollution in Yamuna and have affected the groundwater in multiple districts.As per the recent monthly progress report by the Ghaggar and Yamuna Action Plan of the Haryana government, water quality of groundwater is being monitored at 78 locations in the catchment area of Ghaggar by the HSPCB.Of total 78 locations, groundwater was found unfit at 38 locations.

The state government and the Centre are in a deadlock over the mandatory requirement of land records with the sale of farmers’ produce. Despite repeated requests by the state government for a change or postponement of the condition, the Centre has not yielded.Last week, in a meeting with the Food Corporation of India (FCI), state government officials were categorically told that farmers’ producing land records was a must for this year’s wheat procurement. “We will not be able to implement the Centre’s pre-condition from this rabi procurement season, which is set to begin in a few days,” said Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. The Punjab government expects arrival of 132 lakh tonne of wheat for procurement and the operation winds up in 40-45 days, as the entire state machinery gets involved. Ashu added that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has sent a written communication to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an audience. “The CM will apprise the PM of difficulties in implementing the decision taken by the Centre’s food and public distribution minister that the FCI is set to implement,” said Ashu, adding that the CMO was expecting an appointment from the PM’s office soon. On the challenges in implementing the land record rule for the first time in the history of open ended assured procurement at a minimum support price (MSP) in the state, Ashu said to get farad from the revenue department by 10-12 lakh farmers was a big exercise. He add that there was huge cost involved that individual farmers will bear in getting their land record. “There are other technicalities that will mar the process. Land division has not taken place in a large number of cases, original owners are not alive and land transfer has not been done in the name of legal heirs. At least 25% agriculture land in the state is also on theka (contract),” added Ashu. 3,500 procurement centres plannedDue to surge in covid-19 cases, the food department plans to set up 3,500 procurement centres for wheat. There are 1,850 regular mandis in the state and this is for the second time when additional centres has been created since the pandemic broke out in 2020. “We target that we can ensure a procurement centre for every 3-4 villages, so that farmers do not gather in large numbers at one place, leading to spread of the coronavirus infection,” Ashu added. On its part, the state government is yet to arrange gunny bags and cash credit limit (CCL) for procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wheat-procurement-next-week-punjab-centre-in-deadlock-over-land-record-101616528878274.html

24-03-2021||Chandigarh||Alarm bells ring as 81% of samples Punjab sent to Pune lab for genome sequencing show UK virus strain||Eight one per cent of the 401 positive Covid-19 samples the Punjab health department had sent for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, showed the presence of the new UK (B.1.1.7) strain, a more infectious variant of the virus. These samples were taken randomly from containment zones in all districts of the state between March 1 and 10. The UK strain has been found in 12 Punjab districts, including Mohali, Jalandhar, Patiala, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Bathinda and Taran Taran. In January, the state health department had sent 478 positive samples to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB), Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for genome sequencing, of which the results of 90 samples were received. Only two of these 90 samples had the N440K variant, also known as ‘Kerala’ strain, which according to health experts was the mutated version of the coronavirus in India. A Union ministry of health team had visited Punjab to review the increase in positivity rate. Thereafter, 401 more samples, collected between January 1 and March 10, were sent to the NCDC for genome sequencing, and worryingly, 326 showed the presence of the B.1.1.7 variant. Former PGIMER, Chandigarh, director and head of the state government’s Covid-19 management group Dr KK Talwar said, “This is worrying as the samples were taken from all districts. The new strain is 70% more infectious that the older one and that is why the rate of the spread is more during the second wave.” “Since the new strain spreads faster, more youngsters and those going out for work are getting infected now. Only ramping up of vaccination and less movement of people can help control the spread,” he added. Nearly two-thirds of Covid-19 patients in Punjab, which is witnessing a second virus wave, are aged between 20 and 60 (working-age population). The trend suggests that people in the age bracket have a high rate of mobility as they have to venture out of their homes for work or other purposes. The figures also show that those aged between 31 and 40 are the most vulnerable to contracting the virus, with 17.2% of the total cases falling in the category. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for widening the ambit of Covid-19 vaccination. All aged above 45 will now be vaccinated. Earlier in the day, he appealed to the Centre to do the needful, expressing concern over the emerging situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/alarm-bells-ring-as-81-of-samples-punjab-sent-to-pune-lab-for-genome-sequencing-show-uk-virus-strain-101616528760399.html

Crops under irrigation were more affected.”However, officials of the district agriculture department in Karnal said that as of now there are no reports of crop loss as light rain was reported in parts of the district.With the department of agricultural meteorology, Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, predicted more rains in next 24 hours.Agriculture experts have advised farmers to avoid irrigation till the weather returns to normal.Meanwhile, wheat crop in few pockets of Rohtak, Bhiwani, Dadri and Hisar got flattened due to rain and high-velocity winds.Dayanand Punia, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Matani village, said that flattening of crop has taken place in few pockets in district.“Gusty winds and rain are not good at this stage. It could lead to crop loss. As per farmers’ assessment, around 30% wheat crop has been damaged due to gusty winds and more damage occurred in Loharu area where hailstorm also lashed. Government should initiate crop loss assessment survey at the earliest,” Punia added.Sanjay Dangi, a resident of Madina village in Rohtak, said that wheat crop on three acre of his land suffered 25% loss due to rainfall and gusty winds.“Flattening will certainly lead to loss of yield,” he added.Agriculture experts said that if rainfall continues for more days, it can cause delay in wheat crop harvesting.“Rain is not good for the mustard crop as well because harvesting is underway and rain at this stage could delay thrashing due to moisture,” experts added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rain-flattens-crop-in-parts-of-haryana-no-major-impact-experts-101616528699987.html

Baisakhi is also celebrated as the Khalsa foundation day. “Four jathas visit the holy shrines in Pakistan every year,. The government’s decision of giving permission to the jatha raises question on its earlier move when a special jatha was denied nod citing the pandemic and security reasons. It is clear that the government deliberately banned the jatha. The pandemic situation at that time was much better as compared to the present,” Jagir Kaur said.The Sikh community, she added, can never forget the jatha getting stopped by the government on the occasion of 100th anniversary of Saka Nankana Sahib.Questioning the closure of the Kartarpur corridor, she said, “The corridor was also closed citing Covid-19 even as the sangat visiting the holy place will return in the evening. If there is no prohibition for coronavirus elsewhere, why the corridor should remain closed. The government should seriously consider this matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/if-pak-bound-sikh-jatha-given-nod-now-why-not-for-nankana-massacre-centenary-sgpc-101616528698127.html

24-03-2021||Delhi||AAP says BJP criticism of liquor policy ‘hypocrisy’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to increase the legal drinking age to 25 years in all party-ruled states, saying the Arvind Kejriwal government will increase it to 30 years if the BJP accepts the challenge.The AAP was reacting to the BJP’s criticism of the Delhi government’s move to decrease the legal drinking age in Delhi from the current 25 years to 21 years. Delhi was one of only six states or Union territories that pegged the benchmark at 25.AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj rejected BJP’s criticism as “hypocrisy”. He said the legal drinking age in BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh was 21 years. “In BJP-ruled Goa, it is 18 years,” he said.Bhardwaj further said that the BJP should ask the central government to bring a law to fix the legal drinking age at 25 years. “I am surprised to see the hypocrisy of the BJP. In the BJP-ruled states, the legal age for consuming liquor is 21 years for the last so many years. I challenge Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and leader of opposition Ramvir Bidhuri to change it to 25 years in the BJP-ruled states, then we will make it 30 years in Delhi,” he said.Bhardwaj said the Delhi government’s move was aimed at putting an end to harassment of restaurant owners by the police. “When youths under 21 years go to restaurants and pubs, police extorts money from restaurant owners which then makes its way to the top. Once the police is in place, this malpractice will stop and that is why the BJP is upset,” he said.The Delhi BJP said the Delhi government move will proliferate spurious liquor, promote crime and “spoil” youngsters.“The right thing to do will be tightening the liquor policy to make Delhi safe for women and keep youngsters away from the liquor. It seems the Kejriwal government values revenue more than the safety of women or saving the youngsters from falling into this habit,” Gupta said.Gupta along with other senior leaders also staged a protest on Tuesday against the new proposed excise policy.Gupta said, “The Kejriwal government is unmindful of the fact that more liquor shops will lead to the increased crime rate in Delhi. The government instead of providing clean drinking water is focusing on equitable distribution of liquor vends.”Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of opposition in the Delhi assembly, said, “It is unfortunate that the Kejriwal government is putting revenue and money ahead of the lives and safety of the citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-bjp-criticism-of-liquor-policy-hypocrisy-101616525266022.html

24-03-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police steps up enforcement, 730 fined in a day for not wearing masks||With Delhi’s Covid-19 graph inching upwards, even as the entire country is experiencing a new wave of the viral infection, Delhi Police has stepped up the enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour across the city to ensure that the spread is contained.From about 130 to 160 fines a day for not wearing masks, police on Tuesday caught 730 such violators and fined them ₹2,000 each. Another 11 were fined for not adhering to social distancing measures.The penalty for violating guidelines related to Covid-19 is a fine of ₹2,000, which can be levied by a police officer or officials from the district magistrate’s office.Delhi Police officers said in the backdrop of rising cases, police teams across the city are focusing on areas that have a high footfall, especially market places. On March 18, HT had reported how prosecutions by police and the district administration for not wearing face masks across the national capital had decreased even as the city was witnessing a surge in the Covid-19 positivity rate.Until last month, Delhi was recording a very low positivity rate -- on February 16, it was just 0.17%. Since then, it has increased to 1.32%, as on Monday (March 22). For the first time in the past three months, the daily positive cases also crossed the 1,000-mark on Tuesday, with Delhi reporting 1,101 cases. On December, 20, there were 1,139 viral infections. To be sure, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the positivity rate, for a region with a comprehensive testing programme, should be at or below 5% in order to consider that the outbreak under control in that area. The Delhi government has said that the cases are under control as it is just a little over 1%.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “The decision to increase enforcement was discussed on Saturday, during the law-and-order meeting, which our chief (police commissioner SN Shrivastava) held with all district deputy commissioners of police. After the third wave in October-November, during the festive season, Covid cases had started reducing and police were also busy with law-and-order tasks. Enforcement had taken a back seat but not anymore. As the Covid-19 data shows, the cases are increasing once again, and so we are stepping up enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour.”In the past seven days, police issued 5,344 such fines, an average of 763 persons a day. Before that, between March 1 and 15, police had only fined 2,227 persons.For violation of social distancing norms, police issued 51 fines over the past seven days, while in the fortnight before that, police had only fined 13 persons.During the third wave of the disease in the national capital, at least 4,000-6,000 were fined daily with police ensuring that people complied with the rules in public spaces.The officer further said across many markets, police are making announcements about the mask rule. “The idea is not to collect fines but to ensure that people follow the rule for the safety of everyone. The penalty for the violation has increased from ₹500 to ₹2,000. We understand it is a big amount, so we are making announcements to ensure that people do not have to be fined.”Since last year, police have issued 426,568 masks to the underprivileged.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said, “We thought people have gotten into the habit of wearing masks after having to use it for so many months now. People are being callous when it comes to ensuring their own safety. I want to compare this to motorists not wearing a helmet or speeding. We know that head injuries during an accident can be fatal, as studies show, yet, people continue to ride without a helmet. We cannot be lax about Covid appropriate behaviour. Not even 60% of the population has been vaccinated yet. Until we develop herd immunity, we have to wear masks and ensure social distancing. People must realise that we have to continue wearing the mask and not be part of a gathering for at least three or four months or even more. We have to follow rules until the virus is completely gone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-steps-up-enforcement-730-fined-in-a-day-for-not-wearing-masks-101616525261069.html

While one petition has sought handing over the investigation to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) or any other independent agency, the second has sought a court-monitored probe by Maharashtra Police or any other independent agency against suspended assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze, Singh, Deshmukh and chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. The first petition filed by Mumbai-based advocate Jayshri Patil has referred to the March 20 letter written by Singh to CM, in which the former top cop had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month, including ₹40-50 crore from around 1,750 bars and restaurants. Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the case of explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home last month. The petition also seeks directions to the police to take cognisance of a written complaint lodged by her before Malabar Hill Police station, seeking the registration of a first information report (FIR) against the alleged criminal conspiracy which Singh pointed out in his March 20 letter. It also sought directions to the investigating officers to secure CCTV footage of the places where the incidents mentioned in the letter took place. The petition claimed that Deshmukh is allegedly “abusing his powers by instructing police officers to extort money from the businessmen/ citizens, therefore, he is not trustworthy, as he is the person holding the position of the home minister of the state.” While referring to Singh’s letter, the plea stated, “The home minister has, as a regular practice, been repeatedly calling officers and giving them instructions in respect of the course to be followed by them in performance of their official duties.” The petition further elaborates Singh’s letter to highlight Deshmukh’s alleged corrupt practices and stated, “He [Deshmukh] has been instructing them [officers] to carry out official assignments and collection schemes, including financial transactions, as per instructions based on his expectations and targets to collect money. These corrupt malpractices have been brought to notice by the respondent Singh.” The petition has also targeted Singh for not bringing such heinous crime in the clutches of law while he was the police chief. “He was just sitting on it and it doesn’t show good intention. It shows that he was the superior police officer and had powers to take steps in accordance with law under section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code, but failed to do so, for what reasons is the matter of investigation, after registration of FIR,” stated the petition. In the wake of Malabar Hill police station refusing to register an FIR based on her complaint, the petitioner has expressed apprehensions of important evidence being destroyed by Deshmukh and others, and hence she had to approach HC. The petition also sought directions to CBI, ED or any other independent agency to conduct “unbiased, uninfluenced, impartial and fair investigation in the alleged malpractices by Deshmukh, Singh and others”. The HC will hear the plea in due course. The second petition, filed by Pune-based activist Hemant Patil, has sought directions to Maharashtra Police or any other independent agency under the supervision ofHC against Vaze and his associates for offences including extortion. Patil has stated that after the director general of police and Mumbai Police commissioner said that they could not conduct any inquiry against Deshmukh and Singh under section 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person) of the Indian Penal Code, he had approached the HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/petitions-in-hc-seek-independent-probe-against-ex-mumbai-top-cop-maha-home-min-101616527558054.html

India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said the weather is expected to remain pleasant for the next two days but the mercury will start rising again from Friday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the city received trace rainfall and the day was largely cloudy with gusty winds.“The wind speed was high today (Tuesday); it touched 60kmph. The temperature is expected to remain comparatively lower, around 30-31 degrees Celsius over the next two days,” said Srivastava.He further said from Friday, the temperature is likely to rise again. The forecast says around Holi, which is on Monday, the maximum temperature is likely to touch 37-38 degrees Celsius.On Tuesday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 29.6 degrees Celsius—a notch below the season’s normal.The minimum temperature, however, was the highest so far this season at 21.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year.IMD recordings show that this month, barring Tuesday’s temperature drop, the maximum temperature has been two to three degrees higher than normal. Scientists said they are expecting the recordings to be a few degrees warmer than usual.“We are expecting this month’s mean maximum temperature recordings to be a few degrees above normal,” said Srivastava.Despite the gusty winds during the day, the air quality on Tuesday deteriorated to the ”poor” category. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 244 on Tuesday. On Monday, the AQI was 196, in the ”moderate” zone of the AQI scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/trace-rainfall-gusty-winds-bring-some-respite-from-heat-101616525255090.html

This is attributed to the lockdown, due to which the diagnosis of hundreds of suspected TB patients was delayed. Today is World TB day.On average, over 50,000 individuals get diagnosed with TB in Mumbai annually. When the Covid-19 pandemic started in March 2020, the city came to a standstill and as a result, TB diagnosis fell by 28.7% compared to 2019. Some could not opt for early treatment due to lack of public transport while others avoided visiting hospitals for fear of contracting Covid-19.Data shows in 2019, there were 60,597 people diagnosed with TB in the city, including 5,673 who had multiple-drug resistant (MDR) TB and 794 with extreme drug-resistant (XDR) TB. In 2020, of the 43,464 diagnosed with TB, 4,367 had MDR-TB (a drop of 23%) and the detection of XDR-TB fell by 74% with 200 patients diagnosed in 2020. However, with the lockdown being relaxed, the number of diagnosed patients has been going up. “Every month, we generally record 5,000 new TB diagnoses which got badly affected in the initial months of the lockdown. In April, we registered around 1,000 cases. But since December last year, the turnout has increased. In January, we got over 5,500 TB patients,” said Dr Pranita Tipre, in-charge of TB in BMC.Doctors said delayed diagnoses has resulted in group infections. “We are witnessing a large amount of TB infection among paediatric patients. As many patients live in overcrowded rooms, the delay in diagnosis ended up infecting those around them. Also, due to Covid-19, people avoided going out which further contributed to spreading the infection in-doors,” said Dr Bela Verma, head of paediatric medicine at Sir JJ Hospital.In 2020, a total of 2,068 MDR-TB patients were treated with the newest anti-TB drug —Bedaquiline. The number was far lesser in 2019 when the drug was only given to only 1,089 patients with MDR-TB.The BMC has taken up several initiatives to curb TB cases in the city. This year, BMC will start culture-based phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) laboratories for drug resistance detection in Kasturba and King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospitals.“For faster detection of TB, we have started using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. We have partnered with NGO, STOP TB and an AI company, Qure.ai, for the diagnosis of TB patients within 3 minutes. This will help in reducing initial dropouts and delay in start of the treatment. In addition, another AI company, Wadhwani.AI, would help us to predict patients who have a high probability of default,” said Dr Tipre.The BMC has initiated two drug trials - the first one in collaboration with the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis and Indian Council of Medical Research, and the second one on XDR-TB medicines with the NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières, which is also known as Doctors Without Borders.3 TB-Covid co-infection deathsAs reported earlier by HT, a total of 241 TB patients were diagnosed with Covid-19 co-infection last year. There were, however, no fatalities. According to data provided by BMC, three of the 42 people diagnosed to be suffering from TB-Covid co-infection have died this year.Data indicate that the infection rate of TB patients tested for Covid-19 has risen this year, from 1.8% last year to 2.1%.“As Mumbai is witnessing a second wave and the number of daily Covid-19 infection rate has already surpassed last year’s figure, we expect a rise in co-infection among TB patients also,” said an officer from BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/world-tb-day-cases-dip-lockdown-and-covid-fear-to-blame-101616527198155.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees over 3K Covid cases for third day in a row||With 3,514 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, the city reported more than 3,000 new cases for the third consecutive day, taking the number of active cases to 26,599. Addressing this spike, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has prohibited Holi celebrations on March 28 and 29 at public places. A circular to this effect was issued by the civic body on Tuesday evening. On Tuesday, Mumbai’s Covid tally stood at 3,69,451. Eight deaths from Covid-19 were reported, taking the death toll to 11,604. The city’s case fatality rate is 3.1%. There were 3,779 and 3,262 new cases of Covid-19 reported on Sunday and Monday respectively. Sunday’s caseload is the highest single day total since March last year. While Holi celebrations have been prohibited this year, municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday that there were no plans to impose a lockdown in Mumbai at present. BMC has increased the number of tests conducted daily from 25,000 to 50,000 tests. It has also decided to accelerate vaccination in the city. The number of hospital beds reserved for Covid-19 patients has been increased. To reach its target of vaccinating 1,00,000 people every day, BMC has directed all private hospitals to aim towards vaccinating 1,000 beneficiaries per day and take measures like operating vaccination centres from 9am to 9pm to meet the target. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the state Covid-19 task force, said, “Considering office hours, we can extend the timings beyond 5pm, as the timing of 9am to 5pm is not practical. It is possible to change the slot altogether from 9am to 5pm to, say, 2pm to 9pm, so that people can visit vaccination centres with their parents after working hours.” BMC is awaiting the Centre’s approval to start 20 more vaccination centres at private hospitals. At present, the maximum number being vaccinated daily in the city is between 42,000 and 45,000. On Tuesday, 37,120 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 103 vaccination centres in Mumbai, of which 32,122 received the first dose and 4,998 received the second dose. Of those vaccinated on Tuesday, 20,550 were senior citizens and 4,535 were citizens above the age of 45 years who have co-morbidities. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, “There is a need to educate people that the vaccine is a good weapon which can control the disease. It will prevent complications arising from the disease. And vaccination will definitely decrease mortality due to Covid-19. People still have misconceptions about the vaccine.” So far, BMC has vaccinated a total of 9,39,188 beneficiaries, of which 8,09,276 have got their first dose, and 1,29,912 have been given their second dose. Of these, 4,40,844 are senior citizens and 70,793 are citizens above the age of 45 years with co-morbidities. From Monday, BMC has started conducting random rapid antigen tests at public places such as malls, supermarkets and markets. Each of the 24 wards have been given a target number of tests that should raise the city’s daily test count to 47,800. On Monday, 15,771 tests were conducted at public places. The highest were at K/East ward, which has jurisdiction over Andheri, where 1,600 tests were conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-over-3k-covid-cases-for-third-day-in-a-row-101616527078025.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Use of Covaxin up by 258%: Mumbai civic body||In the last four days, the usage of Covaxin has increased by 258% in the city and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also started suppling vials of Covaxin to private hospitals.Covaxin is India’s first indigenous vaccine for Covid-19 and was developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. The vaccine uses an inactivated virus paired with an adjuvant – a chemical that boosts immune response. Once Covaxin is administered, immune cells in the body recognise the dead virus and make antibodies. Till March 18, BMC’s data shows 16,106 doses of Covaxin had been used in the city for first and second-time beneficiaries. The number of Covaxin doses increased to 57,679 on March 22. On Monday, 18,041 beneficiaries were given Covaxin while Covishield shots were administered to 17,191 individuals. This was the first time since January 16, when the mass immunization programme started, that the daily count of Covaxin doses was higher than that of Covishield in Mumbai. Last week, Pune reported a shortage of Covishied following which beneficiaries were given Covaxin. “We have set a target to vaccinate 45 lakh people in 45 days. So, to avoid any major shortages which can cause a hurdle in attaining the daily target, we have decided to focus on Covaxin. We have already sought 10 lakh doses of Covaxin. We are expecting the next consignment of 3 lakh doses this week,” said a senior BMC officer. Under BMC’s vaccination extension plan, several private hospitals including Lilavati, Nanavati and Bombay Hospitals have also been provided Covaxin vials. “At present, we have Covaxin more than Covishield so we have been asked to prioritise the first. We would use the latter to inoculate beneficiaries in their second dose who have already got its first dose,” said a doctor from a private hospital requesting anonymity. Jayantilal Mehta, 69, went to the Dahisar jumbo centre on Monday expecting to be given a shot of Covishield, but was given Covaxin. “When I asked for Covishield, they said it is up to the centre and vaccinators to decide. I was quite concerned but thankfully, I didn’t develop any side effects,” said Mehta. For almost two months, the government-run Sir JJ Hospital was the only vaccination centre in Mumbai authorised to deliver Covaxin shots. Beneficiaries had to sign a consent letter as the vaccine was the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had declared the vaccine to be in “clinical trial mode”. A subject expert committee (SEC) approved the vaccine in March after Bharat Biotech submitted data from phase 3 of its clinical trial to the drug regulator. Its data showed an interim clinical efficacy of 81% and following the approval, beneficiaries no longer have to sign a consent form. Following this, the Centre instructed BMC to allow five vaccination centres — Seven Hills Hospital and the jumbo centres at Bandra Kurla Complex, NESCO in Goregaon, Dahisar and Mulund to administer Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/use-of-covaxin-up-by-258-mumbai-civic-body-101616526898006.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Covid surge in Mumbai: Don’t step out if not necessary, say experts||Even though the number of Covid-19 cases in the city and state continues to rise, lockdown is not being recommended as a feasible option by experts since the economy is limping back to normal. Instead, experts say Maharashtra should open up vaccinations to everyone above 18 years of age and the public must follow Covid protocol to contain the spread of the infection. Among the measures recommended by experts is curbing non-essential events with crowds, like weddings and parties, and non-essential activities such as morning and evening walks. Introducing staggered timings for offices may also help by reducing peak-hour traffic congestion on roads and public transport. Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the state government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “No one wants the economy to be hampered again due to a lockdown. But curbs can be put on non-essential activities, such as on morning and evening walks, and on those who leave homes just for an outing, such as in parks or beaches. This will not affect any businesses or those dependent on such business for their day-to-day income.” He also stressed that weddings and other social gatherings should be avoided because they pose the risk of spreading infection. Dr Pandit further said, “If office timings can be staggered for even those 50% employees who are not working from home right now, it will reduce load on local public transport. So some employees can start work at 8am, others at 10am. They can work two hours more at the end of the day. Presently, local public transport gets very crowded during office hours, around 9am and between 5pm to 7pm.” ​ Experts also said the strictest vigil must be maintained at containment zones. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid taskforce, said, “Micro-containment zones have to be created and the strictest vigil must be maintained to not allow anyone to venture out, except health workers.” Brinelle D’souza, co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, said, “A lockdown need not happen until we reach an extremely critical stage. However, some restrictive measures are required in a pandemic. Non-essential things can shut down. BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] can also strictly implement current restrictions and precautions on restaurants and in malls. BMC also needs to start with positive reinforcement, along the lines of awareness drives it had started like the My Family, My Responsibility campaign. This will engage local societies and local communities to take charge of this narrative to protect the health of their family, neighbourhood and community.” D’souza questioned the civic body’s decision to conduct rapid antigen tests on randomly-selected visitors at malls as citizens have no option of refusing the test, for which they must pay. She said, “We do not have compulsory testing for all. BMC cannot take action against people who refuse an antigen test, as the civic body is charging them for it.” Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the state-appointed death audit committee, stressed the need to ramp up vaccination in the state, while Dr Pandit said the state must now start vaccinating all above the age of 18. Rashmi Thackeray tests positive for coronavirusRashmi Thackeray, wife of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, tested positive for corornavirus on Tuesday. Rashmi, who is also the editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, will be under home quarantine at the chief minister’s official residence Varsha. She along with Thackeray had taken the first dose of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine on March 11 in Mumbai. Their elder son and Maharashtra environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray had tested positive for coronavirus on March 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-surge-in-mumbai-don-t-step-out-if-not-necessary-say-experts-101616526778277.html
24-03-2021||Other||NYAY will be tested in Kerala if Cong returns to power: Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on a two-day visit to the poll-bound Kerala, on Tuesday said his favourite “Nyuntam Aay Yojana” (NYAY) , a proposed scheme to ensure minimum income guarantee, will be showcased in the state if the party-led United Democratic Front returns to power.He said he was confident of the success of the NYAY scheme and wanted to test it in Kerala for the first time. “I have a selfish reason to test it in Kerala,” he said while addressing an election meeting in Puthuppally (Kottayam) constituency being represented by former chief minister Oommen Chandy for the past 52 years.“In NYAY, a sum of ₹72,000 a year will go straight into beneficiaries’ bank accounts. We know what is going to happen next. We are testing the new idea in Kerala,” said Gandhi, who took out a rally in an open vehicle before the meeting. He came up with “NYAY” during the 2019 Lok Sabha poll but the party failed to win the election and he later stepped down from the party president post.Gandhi said he wanted to “test” the scheme because if it worked in Kerala, he wanted to replicate it in all the Congress-ruled states in the country. “Kerala is going to show the rest of India how to fight poverty and end it once and for all,” he said.“Look, this is not charity. We are returning your money through NYAY. We are putting money in your pockets. So that you can spend,” he said, adding this was the only way to uplift the economy which “collapsed” due to the demonetisation brought in Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his flawed GST implementation and Covid-19 pandemic.In its manifesto for the assembly polls, the Congress has promised ₹2,000 “pension” for homemakers, ₹72,000 annual dole to the poor under NYAY and five lakh homes for the underprivileged.Later in a tweet on the occasion of ‘Shaheed Diwas’, he hailed the sacrifices of soldiers at borders and farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders, and said the Centre must answer for the “insult” of their “martyrdom”.March 23 is observed as ‘Shaheed Diwas’ to pay tribute to three great sons of the country - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru - who were executed by the British for killing a British police officer. They wanted to avenge the death of freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai.In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said, “Sacrifice -- of the soldiers at the country’s borders and farmers sitting at the borders of Delhi. The central government must answer for the insult of their martyrdom.” Thousands of farmers are camping at Delh’s borders points at Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri since November last year demanding that the Centre repeal the three contentious farm laws.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nyay-will-be-tested-in-kerala-if-cong-returns-to-power-gandhi-101616526657390.html
24-03-2021||Bangalore||Mob attacks 3 traffic cops over ‘death of 32-yr-old biker’||A video of a mob raining blows on three traffic police officers alleging that the cops tried to stop a motocycle that resulted in the death of a 32-year-old man on Monday night, was widely shared on social media. The attack took place after Devaraj and pillion rider Suresh fell near a traffic police checkpost on Mysuru’s Ring Road. Devaraj died on the spot.Mysuru police claimed that Devaraj died after hitting a lorry and not because of the enforcement drive. “The three police personnel who were attacked by the mob are two assistant sub-inspectors and one government driver. Three of them have filed three separate FIRs on the case,” said officials of Mysore city police station. The entire incident has triggered a conversation over police’s enforcement tactics and attacks from the public. Rohan Menezes, a graphics designer with a multinational firm said that he suffered injuries after he fell off the motorcycle near Ulsoor Lake, in January during a traffic police check. “They were on the other side of a right turn, and as soon as I took a right turn, a trafficpoliceman jumped in front of me. I lost control and fell off the bike. I got scratches on my hand. The policemen helped me, but when I asked why they had to resort to such guerrilla methods, they didn’t respond,” he said. While contactless traffic enforcement has been pitched as a solution to avoid such conflicts, cops say it came with its own problems. Bengaluru police have been using cameras to capture traffic management for a while now and issue challans.“People were ignoring the challans issued to them. So, last year we began a drive to collect these fines by going to the violator’s home. The drive didn’t give the desired results. With more than ₹390 crore worth of fines, we have no options but conduct random vehicle checking across the city,” said Ravikante Gowda, joint commissioner of police (traffic) said.A retired Director General of Police (DGP), who didn’t want to be named said that problem was not just with the traffic police. “Even though the department denies it, there are targets given for fine collections, which often results in conflicts with the public. The manpower and effort deployed for fine collection in Bengaluru, especially when traffic gridlocks are common, sends a wrong message. While three to four policemen are deployed for fine collections, some of the busiest get just lone policemen,” he said. He, however, added that problem was not limited to the police. “If you look at the road you will see so many people riding without helmets, jumping the signal etc. So, there is a need for enforcement, but it doesn’t require traffic policemen standing at vantage points and jumping in front of vehicles,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/mob-attacks-3-traffic-cops-over-death-of-32-yr-old-biker-101616526657976.html

On Sunday, more than 200 residents of the area formed a human chain around the junction to prevent the felling of trees.The BBMP has marked 25 trees near the junction for felling. So far, eight trees, which residents claim are 60-80 years old, have been cut. “Once we learnt about the cutting of the trees, we decided to protest. We held a human chain around the tree, but as soon as we left, they started cutting the trees again. Because we reached on time, they couldn’t cut them completely,” said Swathi Damodaran, a resident of the area.She added that the residents were able to halt the work temporally after approaching the authorities. “There was no consent sought from residents and the move was not consulted with us either,” she said. Residents added that they keep a vigil to ensure that the tree-cutting does not continue.Ranganatha Swamy, Deputy Conservator of Forests, BBMP, said the authorities have received the required permissions to cut the trees. “We have official orders, unless we are told otherwise, we can’t stop the project. But for now, the project has been halted,” he said.The reason for authorities not consulting residents in the case of the Suranjan Das Road or other cases in the past is an amendment made to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act, 1976. As per the 2014 amendment, the BBMP need not call for public consultation if the number of trees to be felled is less than 50.The amendment has been challenged in the high court through a public interest litigation filed in 2018. “As per Section 6 of the Amendment Act, Section 8(3)(viii) has been amended to provide for a minimum number of trees to be felled in order for there to be a requirement for the issuance of a public notice, at an arbitrary figure of 50 trees. This arbitrary provision without any legislative safeguards has allowed the provisions of the Tree Act to be completely side-lined and abused by various stakeholders to chop huge numbers of trees with no public notice,” read the petition.Suranjan Das Road is one of the many infrastructure projects that have been opposed by activists. Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL), which cut down more than 2,300 trees for road-widening projects on the outskirts of Bengaluru, was asked to stop work by the Karnataka high court on March 7. The HC direction came as the KRDCL was planning to cut nearly 7,500 more trees for infrastructure development.The HC intervention came after a committee of experts from the University of Agricultural Sciences, Gandhi Krishi Vigyana Kendra (GKVK) — formed following the high court’s order to look into the KRDCL projects — submitted a report highlighting the number of trees lost on the outskirts of Bengaluru.The committee also reduced the permission to KRDCL for cutting trees after studying the tress in the locations where infrastructure projects were underway. While the Forest department had allowed the felling of 5,297 trees, the expert committee brought the number down to 1,721.The HC halted the project to look into the claim by KRDCL that the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act will not apply to the road-widening projects on the outskirts of Bengaluru.While the residents of Suranjan Das junction are approaching the court, the hearing in the PIL is expected to come up for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-plan-to-move-court-as-bbmp-decides-to-continue-tree-cutting-for-underpass-project-101616526597998.html

The state reported 2010 new cases on Monday, breaching the 2,000-mark for the first time since the turn of the year.On Monday, the total active Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru stood at 10,766, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Bengaluru has been recording a sharp increase in cases since the beginning of March with most industries and sectors operating in full capacity. The city has also witnessed a rise in protests, rallies and other events with large gatherings without proper adherence to safety guidelines.Karnataka is looking to leverage on the new guidelines for vaccination and its own ambition of doubling inoculation for over 3 lakh persons per day as a measure to contain the crisis.The Union government on Tuesday modified its guidelines, making all persons above 45 eligible to get vaccine shot. Karnataka, however, will commence vaccinating people above 45 from April 1.Allaying fears of any shortage, Karnataka’s health minister K Sudhakar on Tuesday said the state was shortly expected to receive more vaccines.“There is no shortage of vaccines in the state. We have discussed this with the Centre and they have assured that there will be no shortage of supply of vaccine,” Sudhakar said in a statement.He said the state was expected to receive 12.5 lakh doses of the vaccine in the next one week. “Before that, additional 4 lakh doses will be dispatched through flight,” he said.The state government has ruled out imposing any restrictions or relapse into a lockdown exactly a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government ordered the “Janata Curfew” on March 22 last year. While Bengaluru accounted for the bulk of active cases in the state, Kalaburagi district — about 570 km from the India’s IT capital —reported 129 new cases taking its active case count to 545.Mysuru reported 100 new cases while Dakshina Kannada, Tumakuru, Ballari, Bidar and Udupi reported 74, 40, 39, 76 and 28 new cases, respectively.With the government finally acknowledging that the second wave of infections has begun in the state, it is now looking to increase vaccination and other measures to help it contain the spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-2-010-new-cases-k-taka-records-highest-spike-of-year-101616526597450.html

Ramesh Jarkiholi has taken moral responsibility and resigned. We are getting it investigated. The woman is not coming forward nor saying anything clearly. Despite all this, how is it right to hold a dharna? They have no other issues to have a debate and are wasting time,” Yediyurappa told reporters outside the legislature on Tuesday.The Congress has remained steadfast about its demand for a court-monitored probe into the alleged sex-for-work scandal involving former water resources minister Ramesh Jarkiholi.Congress legislators chanted slogans against the state government while holding Compact Discs (CD).Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s home, law and parliamentary affairs minister, tried to calm the opposition benches by stating that the government has given its response to the concerns raised by the Congress.Speaking to reporters outside the assembly, Bommai said the Congress has no moral right to question the government since it had resorted to brushing away similar allegations against then excise minister H.Y Meti in 2016.Bommai said that in the Meti case, despite the woman in question coming forward and complaining against sexual harassment against the minister, no action was taken.He said the case was handed to the Central Investigation Department (CID) without even filing an FIR and a clean chit was given months before the case was even closed a year later.“When the Meti incident happened, why was there no court-monitored probe?” Bommai questioned the Congress. Meanwhile, the investigation into the sex scandal appears to have made little progress since the victim nor her family were yet to be located by the special investigation team (SIT) set up to probe the incident.Several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators and ministers have stated that the woman who claims to be the victim has ‘been on the run’.During the commotion, the government tabled three bills including the supplementary budget estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-using-lame-excuses-to-stall-proceedings-of-house-k-taka-cm-101616526539150.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Metro lines 2A, 7 have potential to create 1.1 million jobs: Study||At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in job losses for many, an analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India, showed that the upcoming metro lines — 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and 7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) — has the potential to create an additional 1.1 million jobs in the city, if the station areas and surroundings are planned accordingly. The analysis is based on the 2014 economic census of the Central government, which maps establishments across the country. The study states that 1.4 million jobs are located within a one-km buffer of lines 1 (Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar), 2A and 7. While Metro-1 and western suburban network has a job density of around 26,000 jobs per sqkm, it is relatively lower for 2A (10,500) and 7 (20,700).“If we consider the average number of jobs per kilometre, located along the western suburban railway line, and assume a similar number of jobs could be accommodated along Metro lines 2A and 7, then an additional 1.1 million more jobs can be attracted in these areas alone,” the analysis conducted by WRI India stated.While the 11.5km line-1 is already operational, line 2A and 7 is expected to be operational this year.Madhav Pai, director, WRI India Ross Centre said, “The analysis clearly indicates the massive potential to create more jobs in the city around the upcoming infrastructure by applying the principles of transit-oriented development. This needs good long-term co-ordinated planning and implementation. For instance, with three lines intersecting at Dahisar, the suburb can be developed as a jobs hub in the future.” To maximise this potential, the analysis also states that the areas around the metro stations must be developed with “a robust street network, transit-supportive land uses and housing, amenities and facilities, and cultural institutions.” The government must look at strengthening last-mile connectivity, integrated ticketing and creating vibrant public spaces near the stations, it adds further.“We are looking at transit-oriented development around metro stations. We also have a multi-modal integration plan for each of the upcoming metro stations,” a senior official from MMRDA said.Pankaj Joshi, principal director, urban centre, Mumbai, said, “While it is true that mobility is one of the most important enablers in job creation, there are several other factors that also need to work along with this enabler.

But there is over exploitation in all four talukas of Bengaluru,” said a Karnataka government official aware of the developments.Bengaluru received 1,082 mm of rainfall in 2020, 28% more than its normal, according to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre.But the rise in water levels cannot be mistaken for a reversal of the downward trend in the long term as excessive commercial activities, high-rise residential buildings and lack of reusing water have weighed in on India’s IT capital, experts and officials said.The crisis in Bengaluru comes on account of over exploitation of groundwater and the lack of resources to reuse water or feed it back into the earth to help recharge water levels below the surface, experts and scientists said.The United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, themed “Valuing Water” and released on Monday, stated that there will be a global water deficit of 40% by 2030.“Humans certainly use water as if it was limitless: an estimated 80% of all industrial and municipal wastewater, for example, is released into the environment without prior treatment,” the UN report stated.The report added that over 2 billion people worldwide already live-in areas subject to water stress and around 45% of the global population (3.5 billion) lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities.Several urban centres in India face a similar crisis, but few witness problems that Bengaluru endures on account of its water shortages. The city, despite all the money it spends on lake rejuvenation and other exercises, remains firmly in the grip of water tankers that deliver the precious resource as a business model to apartments and other households in Bengaluru.“The water mafia has sucked water dry and there is no groundwater because there is no recharge. People are paying a heavy price and the water scarcity in the region is really worrying,” said T.V Ramachandra from Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science.He added that over concretisation has led to the crisis, which the decision makers are yet to acknowledge.Having lost the river Vrishabhavathi to over exploitation and several lakes to encroachments, sewage inlets and bad maintenance, Bengaluru is heavily dependent on the inflow of Cauvery water from about a 100 km away to quench its thirst, experts said.Being Karnataka’s biggest revenue generator, successive governments have followed a predictable path of diverting Cauvery water into the city even if it deprives surrounding districts of their requirements.With no river water in close proximity, people in hundreds of villages in erstwhile Bengaluru built lakes and tanks as a resource for irrigation and drinking. Out of the remaining 210 lakes, around 19 are encroached and most others are in a pitiable state that neither quench the city’s thirst nor improve the groundwater table due to over three to four decades of accumulated silt, experts said.Bengaluru also receives copious rainfall but barely a fraction of it is harvested, leaving most of this water to flood streets and then flow into drains and eventually find its way into lakes, experts said.Several other parts of Karnataka face a similar problem with water, according to the groundwater directorate in Bengaluru.“There are about 14 districts, 41 talukas and 1,199 villages in Karnataka that are over exploited,” M Raveendrappa, the project director of the groundwater directorate, said. The directorate on Monday launched a campaign in 1,199 water-stressed villages of the state as part of a nation-wide campaign.Even where groundwater level is available, almost at nearly 2,000 ft, it is of poor quality like in Peenya industrial area, a locality where several micro and small industries operate.Priyanka Jamwal of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) said that in Peenya, the borewell water has heavy metals, trace metals and other toxic contaminants largely since most of the used water is let out without being treated.“If you go to parts of the city where there is Cauvery water supply, groundwater is not that contaminated because there is proper recharge happening,” she said. But in the outskirts of the city, which largely depend on borewells, there are high levels of nitrate and fecal coliforms because of the soak-away pits present there with no lining and contaminating the groundwater, Jamwal added.“Where there is no sewerage system or pipe water supply, there is groundwater contamination,” Jamwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockdown-rain-revive-groundwater-level-101616526537380.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||Ex-army jawan shot dead in south-west Delhi, police launch hunt for suspects||A 43-year-old retired Indian Army jawan was shot dead by two unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants in south-west Delhi’s Ujwaa village near Jarafpur Kalan on Monday evening, police said.The retired army man, identified as Mukesh, was with his friends, when the men arrived, asked them information about a person, and then opened fire at him. At least five bullets were fired, of which three hit Mukesh, killing him on the spot, the police said.Police suspect the murder to be a case of mistaken identity and the real target may have been Mukesh’s brother Rakesh, who has a criminal past. “There is a possibility that the assailants had come looking for Mukesh’s brother but ended up killing him instead,” said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.The police said they were also probing the gang rivalry angle as Rakesh has some links with gangster, Manjeet Mahal, who is currently in jail. Mahal has been indulged in a turf war with the Kapil Sangwan gang and their enmity has claimed nearly half a dozen lives in the past four-five years.DCP Meena said that Monday’s incident took place around 5.30pm. Two unidentified men arrived on a motorcycle and asked the men about the whereabouts of Rakesh.“Mukesh and his friends told the duo that Rakesh was not with them. After this, one of the men suddenly whipped out a countrymade pistol, opened fire at Mukesh and fled,” said the DCP.Mukesh’s friends immediately raised the alarm, after which his nephew rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. A case of murder was registered on the complaint of Mukesh’s uncle Ishwar Singh,60, who was also present near the crime scene. A crime spot investigations team visited the area and collected evidence later in the day.“The statements of eyewitnesses have been recorded. Our teams are making efforts to identify and nab the suspects,” added DCP Meena.The police are also scanning the CCTV cameras installed near the crime scene and the routes that the suspects took while fleeing.No arrests have been made so far in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exarmy-jawan-shot-dead-in-south-west-delhi-police-launch-hunt-for-suspects-101616525219169.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Vaze-Deshmukh row: MVA may announce probe today||The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to announce on Wednesday a probe into the allegations of a bribery ring levelled by IPS officer Param Bir Singh against home minister Anil Deshmukh. Mired in controversy over the arrest of police officer Sachin Vaze in Antilia bomb scare case and allegations of corruption racket in transfer of police personnel, the MVA, mainly the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena, has been planning a two-point strategy to come out of the situation – announcing a probe into the allegations and easing Deshmukh out of the home department. The probe is likely to be announced under the Commission of Inquiry Act which gives certain powers to panel and has legal weightage. “The nature of the probe is being worked out. It could be headed by a retired high court judge,” said a senior NCP functionary. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had earlier suggested a probe by a retired senior police officer and recommended the name of former Mumbai Police chief Julio Ribeiro, who denied saying he did not want to get involved in a probe at his age (91) and in such a “murky situation”. The NCP leadership, however, is yet undecided whether to shunt out Deshmukh immediately or in a minor reshuffle of the cabinet in the next few weeks. MVA leaders said all decisions related to damage control exercise are being taken at the level of NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The three parties are likely to formally have a discussion on the ongoing crisis on Wednesday or Thursday. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has approached Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Central government, demanding dismissal of the MVA government and a Central Bureau of Investigation probe in the allegations. On Wednesday, a delegation led by the opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis will meet the Governor to press the demand. From the time the controversy broke out, the NCP leadership has been backing Deshmukh, but at the same time, it was also of the view that he needed to be replaced at an appropriate time. “The party is still deliberating the pros and cons if Deshmukh is removed from the home department immediately. Pawar saheb also discussed with a senior leaders a few probable candidates who can lead the crucial department. They were deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, state NCP chief Jayant Patil, labour minister Dilip Walse Patil and health minister Rajesh Tope,” said an NCP minister, requesting anonymity. A section of NCP leaders also believes if Deshmukh was removed then the BJP’s next target would be Thackeray as they want to pull down the MVA government. The state may also announce a probe into the illegal phone tapping case as alleged by NCP minister Nawab Malik. Hinting at it, water resources minister Jayant Patil said in Sangli: “Phone tapping is a serious crime. On what grounds were phones of people tapped; on whose order was it done? All those involved will have to give an explanation. There has to be some investigation.” On Tuesday, Fadnavis alleged he has data of suspicious call records intercepted by then intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla after she received information about a racket of brokers existing in the IPS transfers and tapping was done with prior permission from the additional chief secretary of home department. Malik claimed the phones were illegally tapped as it was done without taking any permission. “It is not right as she (Rashmi Shukla) didn’t obtain permission and tapped phone records illegally, which is a crime,” he said.65 crime branch cops transferred In a major reshuffle, 86 police personnel were transferred to police stations, social branches and local arms (LA) unit on Tuesday, following the massive controversy that erupted after the role of suspended cop Sachin Vaze came to light in the Antilia explosives scare case. Of the 86, 65 are crime branch officers, including assistant police inspectors Riyazuddin Qazi and Prakash Howal. While Qazi was transferred to LA unit, Howal will be posted at Malabar Hill police station. The duo was recently questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for their alleged close association with Vaze. Among the 65 crime branch officers, 28 are inspectors, 17 are assistant inspectors, while 20 are sub-inspectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vazedeshmukh-row-mva-may-announce-probe-today-101616526298141.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||‘Have left decision to CM; need to keep BJP sympathisers at bay’||Clarifying its stand of not buckling under pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Maharashtra Congress has decided to leave the decision over action related to the allegations against home minister Anil Deshmukh to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. While demanding regular meetings of the coordination committee of leaders from three parties, the Congress pressed the need to keep the BJP sympathisers in bureaucracy at “safe distance”. The Congress ministers and senior leaders met on Tuesday evening to deliberate on the ongoing row after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh levelled allegations that the police were to collect ₹100 crore in bribe from bars and restaurants. Senior leaders met after the party’s central leadership intervened and asked for a report from the state unit. Senior leaders, including Balasaheb Thorat, Prithviraj Chavan, Vijay Wadettiwar, Nitin Raut, Mumbai Congress leader Bhai Jagtap, Charan Singh Sapra and general secretary Sachin Sawant, met at Thorat’s official residence on Tuesday evening “The state unit leaders were of the opinion that there was no need for immediate resignation of the home minister until the authenticity in the allegations was scrutinised. Taking action against the minister will mean buckling under the pressure of the BJP’s ‘smear campaign’ against the government. However, the probe panel needs to be constituted at the earliest as part of the damage control. Congress leaders Ashok Chavan and Thorat have pressed for it during their meeting with the CM on Monday,” said a senior Congress leader. The leaders also expressed dismay over the secondary treatment meted out to them by other two partners in the government. One of the leaders in the meeting said the image of the coalition is damaged because of the wrongdoings of NCP leaders and it has been experienced even in the past when their governments were in power in the state. The leader said that the state leaders will send a report to the central leadership based on the deliberation. The leaders also expressed their concerns over the damaged posed by BJP sympathisers in the state government. One of the leaders said these officers need to be identified and kept distanced from. Another leader said the damage caused to the government was also because of the war between lobbies in IPS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-left-decision-to-cm-need-to-keep-bjp-sympathisers-at-bay-101616526177915.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||ATS gets Vaze’s transfer warrant||Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) chief Jaijeet Singh on Tuesday said that suspended police officer Sachin Vaze was a “prime accused” in the Mansukh Hiran murder case and the agency has procured a transfer warrant from a Thane court with which it will approach the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to get his custody.Vaze is in NIA custody till Friday for allegedly planting an SUV with 20 loose sticks of gelatin and a threatening letter outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home last month. Hiran, a Thane-based auto spare parts dealer who was linked to the car, was found dead at the Reti Bunder Creek on March 5.Speaking to reporters at a press conference outside the agency’s office in south Mumbai, Singh said that more arrests were likely in the case.“Vaze is in NIA’s custody till March 25. As it is necessary to thoroughly interrogate him in connection with the crime, a transfer warrant has been obtained from the chief judicial magistrate at Thane and a comprehensive application has been filed before the special NIA court at Mumbai. We are sure that after thoroughly interrogating him, the ATS will reach to the bottom of the crime and unearth the conspiracy,” Singh said.The ATS on March 21 arrested two men, Vinayak Shinde, a convicted constable on parole in an encounter case, and bookie Naresh Gor in the murder of the 48-year-old spare parts dealer. “It has come to light in the investigation that some of the 14 SIM cards obtained through accused Naresh Gor were activated and given to Shinde, who in turn had transferred the activated SIM cards to others involved in the crime and the SIM cards were used in commission of the said crime. Preliminary investigation has revealed that some of the SIM cards used in commission of the crime and some of the mobile handsets in which those SIM cards were used, were destroyed by the accused,” Singh said.ATS had also claimed to have detained a person from Ahmedabad who had allegedly provided SIM cards to the accused.ATS had interrogated Vaze on March 8, following a statement by Vimla, Hiran’s wife, accusing the suspended cop of having a hand in her husband’s death. Her statement also revealed that Vaze and Hiran knew each other well and that Vaze had borrowed the Scorpio that was later found outside Antilia, for four months between November 2020 and February 2021. Hiran had reported the car stolen on February 18. Following Vimla’s statement, ATS registered a murder case against unknown persons.“In interrogation, Vaze refuted all the allegations levelled against him. He claimed that the SUV had never been in his possession and also maintained that he had nothing to do with the victim. He denied having any involvement in the said crime and that he had no knowledge about the said crime. But ATS officials have collected evidence showing that the claims made by Vaze are false and further probe is on to find out his exact involvement in the said crime,” Singh said.The ATS chief said it was Vaze who had contacted Shinde when the latter was out on parole last year and took his help.According to ATS, Shinde contacted Hiran, posing as “Tawde sahab from Mumbai crime branch” on the evening of March 4, the day before Hiran’s body was found in a Thane creek. “Preliminary investigation suggests that Shinde along with others was involved. A Volvo car seized from Daman is suspected to have been used in the crime,” the ATS chief said. The Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina examined the car on Tuesday.A team of forensic officers from Pune also visited Thane on Tuesday along with ATS officials. The forensic team examined the blue-coloured Volvo seized by ATS. The officials refused to talk but collected several samples from the car for over two hours. “The team did not find any documents or equipment in the car. They were collecting fingerprints, footprints and any other evidence which will help in the probe,” an official said. ATS has also obtained CCTV footage from various spots even though the accused destroyed some CCTV footage in a bid to destroy evidence of their movement, officials said. “To understand how exactly the crime was committed, a demonstration was conducted by taking the accused at the crime scene. Analysis of the information collected by raiding the residences, offices and godowns of the arrested accused is going on,” Singh said.Meanwhile, NIA is also conducting a parallel probe in the Hiran murder case as well as the explosives case. A team searched the premises of a room in Trident hotel, where Vaze reportedly stayed between February 16 and 20. According to a senior NIA officer, Vaze was captured in CCTV footage entering in the hotel carrying five bags. The bags have not been recovered as yet, the officer said. inputs from Anamika Gharat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ats-gets-vaze-s-transfer-warrant-101616526057344.html
24-03-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis on bribery ring: Maha didn’t act on evidence of corruption’||Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday accused the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of not acting on “incriminating evidence” supplied as a report by former Commissioner of State Intelligence Rashmi Shukla on a “money for transfer” scam in the state police department. HT has seen a copy of the report, dated August 25, 2020, which names senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking.The report, which is based on intercepted phone calls of six people -- it was not immediately clear if this was done through proper channels -- states that they were middlemen who helped police officials seek postings of their choice, and brought up names of politicians such as NCP chief Sharad Pawar, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and home minister Anil Deshmukh, in their alleged conversations. The report does not state that the middlemen spoke to these leaders directly. It contends states that one middlemen is an assistant in the home minister’s office. The report does not talk about any direct transfer of money to these politicians. It does, however, refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.There was no reaction from chief minister’s office to the report. Deshmukh was not available for comments.In a press conference held in Mumbai on Tuesday, Fadnavis said Shukla submitted the report to the then Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal on August 25, 2020, who in turn forwarded the report to Sitaram Kunte, the then additional chief secretary, home, the following day. Fadnavis met the Union home secretary in Delhi and demanded a CBI probe. “The Union home secretary clearly told me that they will verify the documents and evidence and a report will be submitted to the central government. The government will take appropriate action accordingly,” he told reporters in the national capital.Fadnavis said that he had 6.3GB of data from the intercepted calls, which contained the voices of police officers and politicians closely related to the home minister and home department.While Fadnavis said Shukla had “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary-home and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politician”, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik said on Tuesday that Shukla had intercepted calls illegally.“She prepared the call records illegally hence she was transferred as a punishment,” Malik said. He added that “80% of the transfers mentioned in the report did not take place.”The State Intelligence Department (SID) is a sensitive wing of the police and it is a serious issue if communication between its chief and a DGP came out in the open, Maharashtra NCP chief and minister Jayant Patil said on Tuesday.A question also arises about how the previous BJP-led government used the SID, Patil said. “On whose directions was the phone tapping done? Who had given the right to (then Commissioner of Intelligence) Rashmi Shukla to tap the phones? Was permission to tap phones taken? All this needs to be investigated,” he said.The report names police officers who were in touch with six middlemen for transfers to desired posts.“It is a serious matter and necessitates urgent action by the state government. It is recommended that this be brought to the notice of Hon. Chief Minister at the earliest and an immediate and comprehensive enquiry by State CID (Crime), Pune be ordered to identify concerned individuals and take necessary legal action. It is also advised that the secrecy of this report be ensured, in order to prevent unnecessary scrutiny, which may bring disrepute to the government,” Jaiswal wrote in the covering letter when he submitted the report to ACS, Home.The report cited an instance of an IPS officer who wanted to be posted in Nashik. The report said that the officer met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, home minister Anil Deshmukh. He also met NCP chief Sharad Pawar along with a few local MLAs belonging to the Congress and the NCP.“Since Nashik has a sitting Shiv Sena MLA, Ajit Pawar suggested the transfer will need the approval from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. As suggested by Ajit Pawar, the DCP met Sharad Pawar at his Nariman Point office. In turn, Pawar sent a message to Thackeray on WhatsApp. The DCP will get his desired posting done for sure,” the report stated, quoting the conversation from the intercepted calls of the middleman.There was no mention in the report of any money changing hands, or an any explicit impropriety in the transfer.In the summary to the report, Shukla wrote: “The aforesaid brokers were in close contacts and embroiled in these negotiations with several influential and the police officers ranging from inspectors to several high-ranking officers are in contact with such undesirable individuals. The information obtained and evidence collected is highly incriminating and gravely implicates a number of individuals engaged in this activity.”Malik, however, said on Tuesday that the transfer of policemen was a procedural affair and did not occur as mentioned in the report.Shukla, who is on central deputation, did not respond to the phone calls or text messages.A delegation of BJP leaders including Fadnavis, state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, Sudhir Mungantiwar and Ashish Shelar will meet Maharashtra governor BS Koshyari on Wednesday. “We want governor Koshyari to seek a detailed status report from the chief secretary of Maharashtra,” said a senior BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-on-bribery-ring-maha-didn-t-act-on-evidence-of-corruption-101616525998409.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||Parking spaces to be determined by distance from Metro stations: DDA||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has proposed that all new buildings, except residential projects, coming up near Metro stations and multi-level car parking lots have 10%-30% less parking space, a move that is aimed at ending congestion by preventing parking on roads and encouraging the use of public transport.According the dynamic parking rules, approved by the DDA in a meeting last Thursday, parking space for new buildings will be defined by not only the use of the premises but also access to public transport and parking lots.“Currently, parking norms are based on the designated use of the premises. It has been observed that the surplus parking from buildings spills over to roads and results in congestion in public spaces. The new parking norms have been worked out based on the availability of the Metro network, other modes of public transport (including cab aggregators) and multi-level car parking facilities,” a senior DDA official said, requesting anonymity.The new rules, drafted by the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), rationalises parking space for 35 categories of buildings such as commercial centres, colleges, community halls, hospitals, etc, the official said.A second DDA official said the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had asked the DUAC last year to examine the existing parking norms and suggest suitable measures. The new norms will now be put in the public domain for comments before being notified by the ministry.Once notified, the new rules will apply to all properties where construction has not begun, even if the plans have been approved by the local civic agency concerned, said a third DDA official. “In all such cases where the plans have already been approved, the properties may be developed as per the revised norms and the concerned local body may be informed in writing. No separate permission will be needed,” the official said.Proximity to Metro, parking lotsAs per the new norms, for a property (except residential) located within 500 metres of a Metro station, there will be a 30% deduction in the permissible parking space. For properties located more than 500 metres and less than 800 metres from a Metro station, there will be a 15% reduction. For properties coming up within one kilometre radius of a multi-level parking lot, 10% of the permissible parking space will be deducted.Currently, a new commercial complex within 500 metres of a Metro station has to provide three equivalent car parking spaces (ECS) for every 100 sqm of built-up area.An ECS is the parking space which has to be provided in a building, based on its built-up space (floor area), for parking vehicles, including car, scooter, light vehicles, etc.Transport experts welcomed the move, saying it is the “way forward” for planned development. They also wanted a a cap on maximum parking that can be provided for a premises. Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, said, “It is a good move that they have reduced parking in areas where Metro or multi-level parking lots are located nearby. A lot of cities world over are moving towards parking maximum. This means that they are capping the maximum parking space. This should be done in Delhi too.”Banquet halls, commercial centresThe new norms have also reworked the existing parking norms for various ‘use categories’ such as commercial complexes, hospitals (mainly government hospitals), coaching and educational centres, community halls, social and cultural centres, district courts, government offices, etc.For banquet halls, the permissible parking limit has been doubled from three ECS per 100 sqm to 6 ECS, without any deduction for proximity to a Metro station. Officials said it has been done to cut congestion on roads around banquet halls in city, where parking on roads is a major problem, particularly during wedding season. For hotels, however, the limit has been reduced from 3 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area to 2 ECS, plus applicable deduction for proximity to a Metro station.For commercial centres such as Connaught Place, the current limit of 3 ECS has been kept unchanged. But, deductions for proximity to Metro and parking lots will apply. (For more categories, see box)Residential projectsPermissible parking limits have only partially changed for residential areas. While norms for plotted residential areas remains the same, rules for group housing societies have been altered. However, deductions for Metro and parking lots will not apply to residential buildings or areas.For residential areas, the DDA has proposed to take the number of dwelling units as the baseline instead of the current built-up area.Currently, 2 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area is the norm for group housing. It will now be changed to 0.5 ECS per dwelling unit for societies where each house/flat has an area of less than 40 sqm. If the dwelling units are between 40sqm and 100 sqm, 1 ECS of parking space per house/flat will have to be provided.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The parking provision in housing projects should also have the deductions proposed in other categories if they fall in the influence area of Metro stations or transit-oriented development. After the entire Metro network is built in Delhi, nearly 70% of the city will be in transit-oriented development zones (near Metro stations). Therefore, if we don’t apply the Metro and multi-level parking lot deduction in residential colonies, then it will mean negating the advantage of this policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parking-spaces-to-be-determined-by-distance-from-metro-stations-101616525215023.html
24-03-2021||Other||Bharti sent to Tihar after court upholds conviction in AIIMS case||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Tuesday upheld an order sentencing AAP MLA Somnath Bharti to two years in jail for assaulting the AIIMS security staff. After the court order, Bharti was taken into custody and sent to Tihar jail, his lawyer said.In January, a magistrate court sentenced Bharti, MLA from Malviya Nagar assembly constituency, to two years in prison.Special judge Vikas Dhull partly dismissed Bharti’s appeal and convicted him for the offences under sections 147 (rioting) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC and under section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The court, however, set aside his conviction under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with section 149 of IPC.After the court upheld his conviction, Bharti tweeted: “It was March 23 when people in power duly aided by Indian politicians hanged Shahid-e-azam Bhagat Singh Ji, Rajguru Ji n Sukhdev Ji n today again I failed to get justice 4m sessions court n being sent to Jail for my struggle for rights of people in a false case.Inquilab zindabad!”The Aam Aadmi Party refused to comment on the matter.A senior officer at Tihar, who did not wish to be named, confirmed that the AAP leader has been brought to the prison and lodged in jail number 2. “He was brought after a detailed medical examination. His health is stable. He has not made any demands or asked for any facilities. He has been lodged in a regular cell with other prisoners.” Prison officers said they will keep an eye on Somnath Bharti’s safety owing to his political background.Welcoming the court’s order, Delhi BJP Adesh Gupta said, “Now the Speaker of Delhi Assembly should immediately terminate Somnath Bharti’s membership, failing which Delhi BJP will approach the Election Commission of India seeking his disqualification.”According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence on a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) with a JCB operator.According to Bharti, AIIMS had no authorisation to cover the ‘nallah’ (drain) between Gautam Nagar and Ring Road as it was a public property and had to be opened for general use. During the course of investigation, it came on record that the drain was given on lease to the AIIMS for covering and maintenance.The sessions court said in its order that the evidence of eye witnesses to the incident was consistent to the effect that a gathering of around 200-300 people along with Bharti were present near the boundary wall of AIIMS and they were trying to break the wall and the fence by the use of JCB machine.It added that when some of the eye witnesses resisted the bringing down of the fence, they were abused and injured due to stone pelting by the mob.“The evidence which has come on record of the eye witnesses shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons of which appellant (Bharti) was the member.“It is true that only five accused persons were charged for the offence under Section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC and out of which four accused persons have been acquitted but still I do not find any illegality in the conviction of appellant for the offence under section 147 IPC read with Section 149 IPC as the evidence which has come on record shows that unlawful assembly was comprising of 200-300 persons and the remaining persons could not be identified or apprehended,” the judge said in his order.The judge said however that the magistrate court had committed “grave illegality” in convicting the AAP leader for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt as the evidence of the injured persons were not reliable and trustworthy.It said no explanation has been given by the prosecution as to why the injured persons were not medically examined on the date of the offence and on what basis, opinion was sought, when no injuries were observed by the doctor or reported by injured.“The opinion regarding injuries has been taken by the IO (investigating officer) on May 5, 2018, i.e. almost after two years of the incident,” it said.It further said the manner in which the persons had suffered injuries was not corroborative and was contradictory to each other which made their testimony doubtful and unreliable.The court said the prosecution has not brought any such medical record which made this court raise an adverse inference against prosecution that no such injuries were suffered by the injured.“In the light of the evidence which has come on record, the evidence of injured persons namely...was not at all reliable and trustworthy and the MLCs could not have been relied upon. “Therefore, the trial court had committed a grave illegality in convicting the appellant for the offence under section 323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC when the evidence which has come on record, was not reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly, the appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section323 IPC read with Section 149 IPC,” it said.In his appeal filed through advocate Mohd Irshad, Bharti had claimed the magistrate court’s order was based upon a totally false and fabricated story of the prosecution which failed miserably to provide even an iota of evidence to prove his guilt.The public prosecutor, appearing for the police, said there was no illegality or infirmity in the judgment for conviction and sentencing order of the magistrate court and the judgment has been delivered based upon the reliable evidence which has come on record.In January, Bharti was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against his conviction in the case and jail term.The magistrate court had acquitted Bharti’s associates and co-accused -- Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey -- citing a lack of evidence against them.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from R S Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.Bharti had told the court that police officials and other witnesses had deposed against him in order to falsely implicate him in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bharti-sent-to-tihar-after-court-upholds-conviction-in-aiimscase-101616525218020.html
24-03-2021||Delhi||City holds events in memory of Bhagat Singh on Martyr’s Day||While the Delhi government organised cultural programmes on revolutionary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh on Tuesday, to mark his death anniversary (also observed as Martyr’s Day in the country), the farmers at Delhi borders drew parallels between the current agitation and the freedom struggle, and a Delhi college invited people to attend an Urdu storytelling (dastangoi) session on the revolutionary leader, to pay homage to the iconic leader.On March 23, 1931, three freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev Thapar, and Shivaram Rajguru were executed by the British for “conspiring against the Crown”..The Delhi government also organised a Shaheed Diwas function in Connaught Place on Tuesday to commemorate the contributions of Singh to the freedom struggle. HT had earlier reported how the Delhi Archives was putting up photo galleries and a light and sound show at Central Park to mark the day.“Through this light and sound show, I want all of you to become familiar with patriots such as Shaheed Bhagat Singh. During India’s freedom movement, there were two schools of thought. One, which used to appease the British rulers for their own benefits and was against the growth of India and, two, which wanted equal rights and freedom for all,” said Delhi minister Gopal Rai.“Today, the British are gone, but there is another type of autocratic power in India. Today, we have a government that puts nails in front of farmers and is scared of students, farmers, labourers and others. We need to learn from Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and others on how we can fight against an arrogant and autocratic power,” he said.The farmers at Delhi borders marked the day at the protest sites in Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur. “Women leaders from Haryana reminded us of how Singh had warned us that the country would not get freedom only by the British leaving the country; that this country would be truly independent only when the exploitation of farmers and labourers ends,” said Harmeet Singh Kadiyan, a member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha.Soil was collected from historical places associated with martyrs -- Sunam, Khatkadkalan, Shri Anandpur Sahib, Shri Fatehgarh Sahib, Sarabha, Jallianwala Bagh, Hussainiwala, Shri Chamkaur Sahib -- and brought to Singhu and Tikri borders.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ also paid homage to freedom fighters at an event organised by Delhi University. Singh was imprisoned for a day in the basement of DU’s Vice Regal Lodge.“The University of Delhi opened a library and a research centre in the same room where the writings of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and works of scholars on him are displayed,” Pokhriyal said, stressing on the need of more events that instil pride among youngsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/city-holds-events-in-memory-of-bhagat-singh-on-martyr-s-day-101616525217311.html
24-03-2021||Other||Daily cases surge past 1,000 as experts call for stricter enforcement of Covid norms||New Delhi The number of new Covid-19 cases in Delhi surged past the 1,000-mark on Tuesday, with the city reporting 1,101 viral infections. This is also the first time that the city has recorded a four digit tally of daily cases, since December 20 last year — when 1,091 new cases had been reported. Tuesday’s daily tally was also the highest single day surge in number of cases that the city has seen since December 19 last year, when 1,139 new infections had been detected, according to daily data released by the Delhi government. The uptick in number of cases comes even as the Delhi government is looking to expand its ongoing vaccination drive in order to prevent a new wave of the disease surging through the city. The Delhi government has increased the number of vaccination sites and directed its centres to remain open for 12 hours from March 22 (Monday) onwards. On Tuesday, the Union government also announced that the vaccination drive will now be open for anyone over the age of 45 years even without comorbidities, even as the Delhi government asked the Centre to do away with the age cut-off altogether for people getting the jabs. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet said, “The central government has allowed vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years. The Delhi government has gone a step further and asked the Central government to allow everyone over the age of 18 years to get the vaccine. This will be an example not only for the country but for the entire world in beating Covid-19.” On Tuesday, Delhi’s positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested — dipped slightly to 1.31% as compared to 1.32% recorded a day earlier. This was largely owing to 84,237 samples being tested on Monday — reported a day later in the health bulletin — as compared to 67,418 tests conducted on Sunday. “There was euphoria among people when the number of infections in the city went down. With over 50% of the population exposed to the infection, the transmission had slowed down. But, people gathering for events, such as weddings, has again led to an increase. This is exactly what happened after Dussehra and Diwali,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences and chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical care. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, “I am expecting the number of cases to increase two or three times, because people are not following Covid appropriate behaviour. People became complacent as the number of cases had come down. They thought that Covid is like any other infection. And then there is the vaccine euphoria.” He added, “However, now to control the number of cases, there is a need for the government to strictly enforce certain restrictions, such as wearing masks in public. A local lockdown does not help much, as the spread inside the area continues and further it disrupts the economy and society within. Instead, there is a need for more communication with the people urging them to follow Covid appropriate measures.” He also suggested vaccinating high risk categories, such as migrant workers, to slow down the transmission of the infection. So far, the city has immunised 324,654 people over the age of 60, 54,672 over the age of 45 with comorbidities, 281336 front line workers, and 185,527 health care workers. The turnout for the vaccination drive remained low on Tuesday — the second day of the expanded vaccination drive in Delhi — with only 33477 shots being administered. District officials say it was mainly due to the rain that kept people at home. Not only the cases, the number of deaths due to the viral infection has also seen an uptick since Monday when seven deaths had been reported. On Tuesday, the city recorded four deaths due to the viral infection. Just over 3 persons died of the infection each day on an average during the last seven days. In comparison, 2.4 people died each day for the two weeks before, and 1.1 on average each day the week before that, according to government data. The increase in the number of deaths is following the trajectory of the increase in the number of infections, experts say. “We have already started seeing an increase in the number of patients being admitted with severe disease over the last one week. The patients do not usually die on the very first day of admission; the severity of the infection peaks between the eight and 12th day. This means, if there is an increase in the number of cases today, the increase in the number of deaths will be seen only after ten days,” Dr Khilnani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/daily-cases-surge-past-1-000-as-experts-call-for-stricter-enforcement-of-covid-norms-101616525158562.html
24-03-2021||Other||Parking spaces to be determined by distance from Metro stations||New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has proposed that all new buildings, except residential projects, coming up near Metro stations and multi-level car parking lots have 10%-30% less parking space, a move that is aimed at ending congestion by preventing parking on roads and encouraging the use of public transport. According the dynamic parking rules, approved by the DDA in a meeting last Thursday, parking space for new buildings will be defined by not only the use of the premises but also access to public transport and parking lots. “Currently, parking norms are based on the designated use of the premises. It has been observed that the surplus parking from buildings spills over to roads and results in congestion in public spaces. The new parking norms have been worked out based on the availability of the Metro network, other modes of public transport (including cab aggregators) and multi-level car parking facilities,” a senior DDA official said, requesting anonymity. The new rules, drafted by the Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC), rationalises parking space for 35 categories of buildings such as commercial centres, colleges, community halls, hospitals, etc, the official said. A second DDA official said the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had asked the DUAC last year to examine the existing parking norms and suggest suitable measures. The new norms will now be put in the public domain for comments before being notified by the ministry.Once notified, the new rules will apply to all properties where construction has not begun, even if the plans have been approved by the local civic agency concerned, said a third DDA official. “In all such cases where the plans have already been approved, the properties may be developed as per the revised norms and the concerned local body may be informed in writing. No separate permission will be needed,” the official said.Proximity to Metro, parking lotsAs per the new norms, for a property (except residential) located within 500 metres of a Metro station, there will be a 30% deduction in the permissible parking space. For properties located more than 500 metres and less than 800 metres from a Metro station, there will be a 15% reduction. For properties coming up within one kilometre radius of a multi-level parking lot, 10% of the permissible parking space will be deducted. Currently, a new commercial complex within 500 metres of a Metro station has to provide three equivalent car parking spaces (ECS) for every 100 sqm of built-up area. An ECS is the parking space which has to be provided in a building, based on its built-up space (floor area), for parking vehicles, including car, scooter, light vehicles, etc.Transport experts welcomed the move, saying it is the “way forward” for planned development. They also wanted a a cap on maximum parking that can be provided for a premises. Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, said, “It is a good move that they have reduced parking in areas where Metro or multi-level parking lots are located nearby. A lot of cities world over are moving towards parking maximum. This means that they are capping the maximum parking space. This should be done in Delhi too.”Banquet halls, commercial centresThe new norms have also reworked the existing parking norms for various ‘use categories’ such as commercial complexes, hospitals (mainly government hospitals), coaching and educational centres, community halls, social and cultural centres, district courts, government offices, etc.For banquet halls, the permissible parking limit has been doubled from three ECS per 100 sqm to 6 ECS, without any deduction for proximity to a Metro station. Officials said it has been done to cut congestion on roads around banquet halls in city, where parking on roads is a major problem, particularly during wedding season. For hotels, however, the limit has been reduced from 3 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area to 2 ECS, plus applicable deduction for proximity to a Metro station. For commercial centres such as Connaught Place, the current limit of 3 ECS has been kept unchanged. But, deductions for proximity to Metro and parking lots will apply. (For more categories, see box)Residental projectsPermissible parking limits have only partially changed for residential areas. While norms for plotted residential areas remains the same, rules for group housing societies have been altered. However, deductions for Metro and parking lots will not apply to residential buildings or areas. For residential areas, the DDA has proposed to take the number of dwelling units as the baseline instead of the current built-up area.Currently, 2 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area is the norm for group housing. It will now be changed to 0.5 ECS per dwelling unit for societies where each house/flat has an area of less than 40 sqm. If the dwelling units are between 40sqm and 100 sqm, 1 ECS of parking space per house/flat will have to be provided. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The parking provision in housing projects should also have the deductions proposed in other categories if they fall in the influence area of Metro stations or transit-oriented development. After the entire Metro network is built in Delhi, nearly 70% of the city will be in transit-oriented development zones (near Metro stations). Therefore, if we don’t apply the Metro and multi-level parking lot deduction in residential colonies, then it will mean negating the advantage of this policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/parking-spaces-to-be-determined-by-distance-from-metro-stations-101616525037255.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Pune civic body gears up to vaccinate all aged above 45 yrs despite many challenges||Even as the central government has declared that all aged above 45, with or without comorbidities, would be able to get the Covid-19 vaccine, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is trying to race against time and cross multiple hurdles to ensure the same. On Tuesday, Prakash Javdekar, minister of Information and Broadcasting, said that from April 1, all above 45 years of age, irrespective of their comorbidities, would be given the vaccine. An exhausted PMC staff, which has been fighting Covid-19 for more than a year now, and with increased vaccination and increased cases, is now under pressure. Civic officials also said that some of the specialty hospitals that have been designated as Covid-19 vaccination centres are now refusing to undertake vaccinations. Despite a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the district administration as of Monday has been able to vaccinate only 3.9% of the district’s population, even as 4.03% of the population has been affected by the infection. The administration is now racing against time and with more people eligible for the vaccine, the civic body could face a shortage of manpower. As of Monday, of the 1.17 crore mid-year population estimate for 2021, a total of 4.60 lakh people have received the first dose. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “On the preparations to vaccinate all above 45, we can ramp up daily inoculations. We had started from 16 centres and yesterday we have the most number of jabs in the entire state. So we are ready to ramp up vaccination numbers, provided that there is a smooth supply of vaccine shots.” Additional municipal Commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We can increase vaccination at five more government centres and we will now collect data on how many people we have in the city aged above 45 years.”Agarwal added: “We cannot control the vaccine stock and we will distribute as per required. We will use the maximum possible hospitals at optimum capacity. We have the same manpower and infrastructure and we will use them to maximum. We are also requesting the government to give us a maximum stock and currently we are running 109 session sites. We are also going to start vaccinations 24x7 at five locations.”Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer who is in charge of vaccination sites said, “We have got proposals from 20 smaller hospitals which we will forward to the central government. However, we are getting requests from some specialty hospitals, who are refusing to vaccinate as they do not want to compromise their patients’ safety. These are the hospitals that are empanelled and were put up on the list by the central ministry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-gears-up-to-vaccinate-all-aged-above-45-yrs-despite-many-challenges-101616513275848.html
24-03-2021||Pune||Pune’s deaf-mute national judo champions seek sponsors for international events||Pune: Pune judo players showed their mettle by winning gold at the 9th National Blind Judo Championship at Lucknow but road for international glory looks difficult as judo players search sponsors for their trips. Renuka Salve (70kg) and Laxmi Jadhav (78kg) who earned top spots in their respective bouts have qualified to represent India at international tournaments — International Para Judo Antalya Cup, Turkey (April 5-10); IBSA Junior Grand Prix, Baku, Azerbaijan (May 20-28) and Judo Grand Prix, Walsall, England (June 16-19). The players may have to miss the events in Turkey and Baku for lack of sponsors. However, coach Rachana Dopeshwar is using her money and seeking sponsors to ensure the girls get a chance to participate in the England contest. The Pune Blind School had sponsored the girls for the England tournament in 2019. “The girls will be unable to take part in the first tournament at Turkey scheduled for the first week of April because of lack of funds and visa issue. I am trying to get sponsors for the Baku tournament (May 20-28) and will do my best to take these girls to Judo Grand Prix, Walsall, England (June 16-19),” said Dopeshwar. Dopeshwar trains judo players for free. While Salve is completely blind, Jadhav is partially blind as she cannot see in the sunlight. In her cause, Dopeshwar is supported by Vijay Barate, founder of Shyadhri National School, Warje and Jayant Pawar, founder of Solaris Club, Kothrud, who both have provided Dopeshwar space for training for free. “I am grateful to them (Vijay Brate and Jayant Pawar) for their support as these judo players are getting a chance to perform and could get a job under the sports quota,” said Dopeshwar. Jadhav and Salve won their gold bout via Ippon move under 10 seconds. Ippon is a move that gives players highest point. “I am happy with my performance, but my aim is to shine at international tournaments as well,” said Jadhav. “I want to perform consistently and win medal at the international level. I have to focus on my fitness as well,” said Salve. Six more medals for Pune players Ashita Dalvi (40kg) clinched gold while Tanishka Maske (49kg), Pallavi Kamble (52 kg), Shubham Nimbalkar (66 kg), Omkar Mokashi (73kg) and Ashutosh Korde (81kg) earned bronze medals respectively. “I am happy with their performance but my mission is to make them win top spots at international tournaments. Only Sonali Wajge did not earn a medal but she had to face a tough round bout against Kokila (Haryana player, probable for 2021 paralympic),” said Dopeshwar.
