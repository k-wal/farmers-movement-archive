He is in trouble in Sena. If he approaches us, we will induct him in our party,” he said.Reacting to Rane on Sunday, senior Shiv Sena leader and urban development department minister Shinde said he has full freedom in his department and their was no interference from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray or any Sena leader.“I am happy in my party. Whatever Rane has said is an attempt to create confusion within MVA government. The BJP leaders have been doing it since beginning of the formation of the MVA government. I have full freedom in the government. As the chief minister Uddhavji Thackeray has final word in any department as it has been in any government,” he said.The MVA government in the state that was formed after the 2019 assembly polls, is led by the Shiv Sena, in which the Nationlist Congress Party and the Congress are its partner.“...my department has been working independently. Rane, who has been CM of Maharashtra, would know the hierarchy in decision making and as a union minister, he too would be answerable to the prime minister while taking any policy decision,” Shinde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/narayan-rane-trying-to-create-confusion-in-mva-eknath-shinde-101629656382998.html

Thakur said an amount of ₹91.20 crore is being spent on the fruit processing plant in Parala under the horticulture development project.Similarly, six CA stores of the HPMC, apple grading and packaging centres are being upgraded under the project by spending ₹16.48 crore.He alleged that the BJP government cancelled three CA stores approved for Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segment under the project over “petty politics”.Thakur said BJP is celebrating the 50th anniversary of formation of the state and despite having two Centre’s big leaders from Himachal, the Modi government is hell-bent on weakening the ₹5,000 crore apple economy of the state.He said during 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had talked about giving special product category status to apples and making a three-fold increase on import duty on them.Contrary to this, the Centre reduced the import duty on apple by 15% which was a severe blow for the apple growers.He expressed concerns over the steep fall in prices of apples in past several days. “Farmers are not even able to recover the input cost on apple due to fall in prices,” he said.Thakur said the BJP government has failed to control the prices of apple packing material.Carton factories have increased the prices of apple-packing material by up to 25% this time as compared to last year.He also sought relief for apple growers whose crop was hit by hailstorm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-ignored-apple-growing-belts-alleges-himachal-cong-leader-101629654559460.html

As per records, the price per LPG cylinder in the city has increased by almost Rs265.50 since September last year and families who depend on the commodity are finding it difficult to make ends’ meet.Sarika Bharati, a resident of the Dhankawadi area and a homemaker who takes care of a family of four, said, “We have a single connection of LPG and need to refill our cylinder after every 40 days almost as apart from cooking, we use LPG for other purposes too such as heating the water. With the persistent price hike, my budget has collapsed completely. My husband is a car driver. We have two sons and have to manage our livelihoods and their education. With the rise in prices of essential items such as edible oil, petrol, diesel and LPG, the overall expenditure has increased while income has reduced due to covid and lockdowns.”Surekha Landge, who works as a domestic help, pointed out that families like hers have no other option but LPG. “Should we go back to using the kerosene stove? Also, everyone cannot afford electrical appliances for cooking as they also raise electricity bills. So, LPG has been an affordable option for many families. But with prices soaring coupled with limited income, things have become difficult to manage.”Some citizens expressed the view that just like record hikes in the prices of petrol and diesel, LPG prices also seemed uncontrollable and that at this rate, the price of a LPG cylinder would soon cross the Rs1,000 mark in the near future. Ramesh Karanjakar, a resident of Kothrud, said, “Nobody had thought that one day petrol would cross Rs100 and diesel would near the same mark. We used to joke about it but now it has become a reality. Given the trend, LPG cylinders too will cross the Rs1,000 mark and we still will not be able to do anything about it. There seems to be no end to the miseries of the common man and no one seems to care.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/moderate-income-families-struggle-as-lpg-cylinder-prices-hiked-again-101629652158124.html

Of this, PMC has raised ₹200 crore through bonds. It has also levied water charges, being charged for the past one year. The project work began last December. The project aims to provide a safe and equitable water supply to all areas for the next 30 years. With this, water will be supplied 24x7, water losses would be reduced, and technological, economic and environmental sustainability of the water supply service will be ensured.The PMC awarded the contract of the project to Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) and Jain Irrigation. These agencies are installing commercial meters and laying down pipelines across the city. Right now, only L&T is working on the project. PMC has stopped Jain Irrigation from working. It was supposed to cover the Hadapsar area.Nand Kumar Jagtap, superintendent engineer of water supply department said, “Earlier, we faced a problem of installation of water meters in the east part of the city, like Lohegaon, Kalas-Dhanori areas, as people were receiving insufficient water supply. However, after the Bhama-Askhed water project. People are happy to install water meters. The work has speeded up in the heart of the city and other areas, excluding Hadapsar.”He further said, “Now we are facing a problem in Katraj and Dhankawadi to install water meters. However, we are trying to convince them the importance of water meter installation for the accountability of water use.”“Due to Covid-19, we had stopped awareness and promotions activities of 24x7 water project. Now, we will restart it,” he added.One of the PMC officials on 24x7 water project team said, “Local representative are not cooperating with us. They are pushing local residents to resist to water meters, especially in areas where illegal water connection are provided by local corporators. Most of the people in Dhankawadi and Katraj have taken illegal connections. During installation of the water meters, we come to know about illegal connections.” As civic polls are scheduled in the next few months, local representatives don’t want to lose votes due to installation of water meters. “So they are supporting the resistance,” he added.At present, L&T has completed work in Viman nagar, Kharadi, Aundh and Baner. Of 141 metering zones, PMC has set targets to complete 50 zones by December 2021. PMC has set a deadline to complete the project by March 2023, as mentioned in contract.Under this project, contractors will have to lay down 1,600 metres of water pipelines and install the 350,000 water meters in the city. At present, the contractor installed 52,000 meters so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/katraj-dhankawadi-residents-oppose-setting-up-of-water-meters-101629651498108.html
22-08-2021||Mumbai||Only 10% engineering institutes opt for new-age courses like AI, data science||Undergraduate engineering courses have for long faced low demand. However, the recently introduced courses in undergraduate education might be the way out.The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) reveals that since 2019-20, nearly 127 diploma institutes and 663 undergraduate colleges across the country have opted for courses including artificial intelligence (AI), data science and analytics, blockchain, machine learning, robotics among others. While this covers less than 10% of the total number of engineering institutes in India, officials feel it’s a positive move in the right direction.This includes 222 institutes for AI and machine learning, 186 institutes for AI and data science, 52, 45 and 29 institutes for computer science and design course, and data science and AI courses respectively.“In 2020-21, electronics and communication sector managed to swoop the best of the minds and many also opted for BTech in AI and data science fields. Since jobs in the electronics as well as AI sectors are gaining more popularity, students too are very clear about their ambition and aiming for seats in specific departments,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.In early 2019, to attract more students to the engineering sector, the AICTE had requested all affiliated engineering colleges to introduce newer courses including data science and analytics, blockchain, machine learning, robotics among others. Since 2020, AICTE also implemented a two-year blanket ban on new engineering institutes across the country and had requested colleges to apply for new-age courses.In some cases, engineering institutes have also chosen not to apply for the new courses due to a lack of support from the state government for the same. “We didn’t apply for any new courses because to date, the state government has not approved faculty for the electronics and communication course that we had started in 2009. This particular course has attracted the brightest of minds over the years and is in popular demand amongst recruiters as well, which is why the institute is funding the course without any government support,” said Dhiren Patel, director, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Matunga.‘Trend for new-age course short-lived’While demand for the new-age courses is growing, more and more institutes are showing interest in wanting to introduce them at their institute. However, the experts have highlighted how this move could be short-lived, especially for courses like AI and data science and analytics due to the evolving technology in these fields.“These sectors evolve, and new trends emerge in them. At present, these courses might be in the position to offer many jobs to graduating students, there’s no guarantee the trend will stay for very long,” said SS Mantha, former chairperson of AICTE.He added that in the last few years, core engineering courses like civil as well as mechanical engineering courses have witnessed a drop in applications due to the lack of job opportunities for students after graduation. However, an undergraduate degree in core engineering, said Mantha, is very important for the students. “The shelf value of new-age courses could be limited whereas basic knowledge in core engineering sectors will take students a long way,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-10-engineering-institutes-opt-for-new-age-courses-like-ai-data-science-101629651438795.html

A museum cum art gallery has been planned by the LKA, Delhi at the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where the portraits of such slain persons, who took part in the wars from 1857 to 1947, would be put on display along with their biography. At present, only names of the freedom fighters deported by the then British rulers are on display at the Cellular Jail. Among these political leaders and freedom fighters who were exiled to the Cellular Jail between 1857 to 1947, there were 27 freedom fighters from Tirhut, according to officials concerned. Their names were recently included in the Dictionary of Martyrs: India’s Freedom Struggle (1857-1947), published by the Indian Council for Historical Research and the ministry of culture. “People have been aware of the contributions of some prominent people, while many others’ sacrifices have remained obscured till date. We want to give them justice and have planned a museum cum art gallery at Cellular Jail. It’s been carrying only the names of the freedom fighters who spent years and died at the jail,” Dr Uttam Pacharne, protem chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi, Delhi, said. Besides this, the LKA has also come up with a plan to help visual artists who have been affected by Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. “We have planned virtual art camps of 100 artists every month. The LKA will pay them some amount while participants will submit one or two of their works to the LKA,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/1857-mutiny-war-heroes-of-tirhut-to-get-place-at-lka-museum-101629647060269.html
22-08-2021||Patna||Dentists ignore proper work-up, rue govt docs; appeal for sensitisation||A government dental doctor has flagged the Indian Dental Association (IDA), saying most dental surgeons, unlike general physicians and surgeons, do not prescribe viral markers and other important blood investigations before doing a procedure, risking the patients and themselves. In an e-mail to the national IDA president and secretary on Sunday, Dr Jyotirmay Singh, associate professor, department of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopaedics, Patna Dental College and Hospital, said an average of two out of 10 dental surgeons were advising blood investigations before a simple tooth extraction or any other dental procedure. “HIV (to check for AIDS), HBsAg (hepatitis B), HCV (hepatitis C), bleeding and clotting time (time taken for blood to clot during surgery), prothrombin time or PT (to detect a bleeding or excessive clotting disorder) are essential investigations a dental surgeon must prescribe before any procedure. Not doing tests for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis may lead to spread of infection arising out of a cut in the gums and put at risk the doctor and other patients through contaminated equipment,” said Dr Singh. Similarly, blood sugar (affects the healing of wounds), thyroid profile and complete blood count (to check haemoglobin, platelets, white blood corpuscle levels, etc. for other chronic diseases or long-term oral infection), are equally important, Dr Singh added. “A simple tooth extraction procedure may require blood transfusion or even be fatal if the blood sugar, blood pressure, PT, bleeding and clotting time parameters are deranged. However, most dental surgeons, at best, prescribe teeth X-ray before doing a procedure like a root canal treatment along with cap and bridge, scaling (teeth cleaning) and deep curettage (cleaning of gums), etc.” added Dr Singh. He urged the IDA to disseminate information about the importance of these tests among its members. By not prescribing such blood investigations, most dental surgeons were risking themselves and their patients of serious complications, said Dr Shivendra Choudhary, professor and head, dentistry department at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH). “At least 60% dentists in the state lack awareness and do not go for proper work-up by prescribing blood tests before a procedure. We do it at PMCH,” he said. “Some doctors, in private setup, do not want to miss patients by prescribing a battery of tests, which pinches a patient’s pocket because the investigations are expensive. I have personal experience of patients not returning to me for a procedure after consulting me when I have prescribed them essential blood tests. From doctors’ ethics, personal and patient safety, dentists need to follow a protocol and prescribe blood investigations before doing any oral intervention. Patients will come to terms with it when all doctors follow the protocol,” said Dr Choudhary. Dr Nimmi Singh, associate professor, oral medicine and radiology department of dentistry at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), also regretted the lack of awareness among dentists. “Many patients referred to our centre from rural areas are not prescribed viral marker or blood tests. However, at IGIMS, we insist on these tests, along with rapid antigen or real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Covid-19, as dental surgeons are most prone to airborne and blood-transmitted diseases,” she said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dentists-ignore-proper-work-up-rue-govt-docs-appeal-for-sensitisation-101629646938442.html

The all-party delegation led by chief minister Nitish Kumar has been emphasising the need of doing caste census once. “It is a crucial issue and we have been seeking this for a long time. It if works out, nothing could be better than that. Moreover, it would be not just for Bihar, people in the whole country will benefit from this. It should be done at least once. We will put forward our views from this angle. We will keep our views before the PM on Monday,” said chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday after tying rakhis to trees in Patna on the occasion of Rakshabandhan to spread awareness on environmental conservation.“Some people have reached Delhi already and some will go with me. Tomorrow we will meet at 11,” he said. Asked if the matter will be resolved tomorrow, he said, “We will see”.CM Kumar left for New Delhi on Sunday evening for the meeting. Earlier on Saturday, Kumar had said, “The people desire that there must be a caste-based census. I hope there will be a positive discussion on this. If the caste census is not conducted by the Centre in the country, then it will be considered by the government in Bihar.” Kumar reiterated that “there is a countrywide sentiment in favour of a caste census to be conducted at least once. There should be no misgivings as such an exercise will be beneficial for all social groups”.Earlier in the day, Kumar tied rakhis to trees in Patna on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. The NDA-led Bihar government has been observing Rakshabandhan as ‘Vriksh Raksha Diwas’ (Tree Protection Day) since 2012 to protect Bihar’s green cover.Kumar urged people to plant saplings and save them to conserve the environment.“We need to plant trees and save them.

Shinde said that he is happy in the Shiv Sena and that Rane’s comments were aimed at creating confusion in the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition.“Maharashtra minister Eknath Shinde is fed up with the Shiv Sena as he has to ask the ‘Matoshree’ (residence of chief minister and Sena president Uddhav Thackeray) before signing any file. If he approaches me, I will surely induct him into the BJP. Shinde is bored there and has no work. He is in trouble there,” Rane was quoted as saying by news agency PTI while the Union minister was conducting a Jan Ashirwad Rally near Vasai in Mumbai. Rane formerly was a lawmaker from the Shiv Sena.Shinde said that he did not understand why Rane made that claim and said that he takes the decisions in the ministry which is functioning smoothly. Shinde said that Rane has been making such statements since the formation of the MVA to create confusion in the minds of the MVA partners. “I am loyal to the Sena and Uddhav Thackeray. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is involved when it comes to taking any policy decision and we make decisions together,” he said. He also said that Rane must be aware of these technicalities since he too was a chief minister earlier.“Rane in his capacity as Union MSME Minister is free to take decisions but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is involved whenever a policy decision has to be taken,” he further added.

22-08-2021||Pune||Your Space: Pune local trains not lifeline of the city||While the Mumbai administration resumed local train services for fully-vaccinated commuters from August 15, the authorities in Pune, which has lesser population density as compared to the state’s capital, restarted the facility two days later. Readers share possible reasons for delay?Many beneficiaries waiting for second vaccination dose The local train is lifeline of Mumbai and without it Mumbaikar cannot imagine completing their day of work unlike Pune where most people depend on their personal vehicle and public transport buses for commuting. The mandatory fully vaccinated criterion for train passengers will not have many takers as I think around 70 per cent beneficiaries are yet to get the second jab, due to shortage of doses and long waiting period between two doses. Amol Patil Local train commuters are few For Pune, local trains is not as important an aspect of everyday life like Mumbai. Even though the locals have started in Pune, it only helps small group of people and half of them still are doing work from home so it’s okay if the government has started locals two days late. Ratnakar Detke Pune admn wants to assess situations Better late than never. I feel at least people will enjoy the train journey to Lonavla, although many tourist spots are closed under Covid lockdown restrictions. Many people prefer local journeys between Pune and Lonavla as it is economical. The two-day’s delay to reopen the local trains in Pune as against Mumbai may be because the administration wants to assess various situations. Sanjay Jadhav Authorities may have been in two mindsThe past experiences of Covid violations during curb relaxations must have left the authorities in two minds. They may want to see how it progresses in Mumbai before restarting at other places. But due to pressure from common people, the government may have resumed the local train facility in Pune in two days after restarting it in Mumbai. Arpita Marne Pune locals not as profitable as Mumbai Local trains in Pune do not generate revenue like Mumbai locals. So, the government was not much concerned about restarting it early. It could have been delayed by more than two days, if people had not requested the administration. Santosh Khivsara Local train fare is economical Two days’ delay could be only because of the extra cautious approach of Pune district administration. They are worried about Covid spread, but are not looking at how people from lower middle class are suffering due to closure of local trains. The Rs20 fare local train journey was costing ₹100/Rs200 daily for regular passengers because of non-service of trains. The district administration should resume local trains with Covid preventive measures in place. Vaibhav Gaikwad Banking on “Mumbai model” I believe the authorities in Pune still feel that they are answerable to the Mumbai administration, it being the capital of the state. God forbid even if a minor calamity befalls in Mumbai, like a slight surge in Covid cases, the local train services will be the first to be blamed. This delay seems to be a poorly thought cover-up so that under similar circumstances in Pune, the local train administration can blame the Mumbai authorities for restarting the train services first. Basically, going by the “We just followed what they are doing” scenario. Shagufta Khan Pune admn just emulated Mumbai Punekars do not usually travel in locals as much as Mumbaikars. Most of the people in the main city either travel via buses, cabs, autos or have their own vehicles. It seems as if the Pune administration was not thinking about restarting the local service yet. However, when they saw the Mumbai administration do it, they may have decided to just emulate the decision without a lot of contemplation. Hence, the two-day delay. Anisha Puranik Passengers should follow Covid precautions Since the population density in Mumbai is more than Pune, it means there are far more people that need to get to work than our city, and maybe that’s why they resumed the services two days before Pune did. We will be getting back to the new normal anyway so ideally a difference of two days doesn’t have the potential to cause a big change in number of cases and the spread of the virus. And since the commuters are vaccinated there’s a very low chance that they’ll be infected. As long as all guidelines are followed by the civilians of both cities it’s all good. Priyanka Fulzele Districts follow instructions of state government Pune had reopened malls and other markets two days earlier than Mumbai. Hence, the district administration can take their own decisions. However, regarding reopening of train and state transport facilities, the okay of the state government may be needed. They are issuing the government resolution (GR) and districts are taking the decisions accordingly. So, it may be the reason for delay of resumption of local train service in Pune. Rahul Upadhye Implementation of Covid checks may have caused delay Pune has less local train travellers as compared to Mumbai. The state government has issued new guidelines for local train transportation. Administration has allowed only people who have been vaccinated with both doses. They have to issue identity cards to passengers who have taken both doses. Also, 14 days should be completed after the second dose only then the railways will issue monthly tickets to such passengers. This all process will take extra manpower, extra budget and more time to implement. May be because of all this they have delayed to start local trains which were stopped since last year.

Assam Police has dubbed the allegations as baseless and accused Mizoram authorities of indulging in construction activities on the Assam side of the interstate border without the necessary authorization. According to Mizoram authorities, policemen from Assam’s Hailakanadi district in Barak Valley entered the Mizoram side of the interstate border on Friday and stole construction material. A case in this regard was lodged on Saturday at Bairabi police station in Kolasib district of Mizoram. In a letter to his Hailakandi counterpart Rohan Kumar Jha on Saturday, Kolasib deputy commissioner Dr H Lalthlangliana alleged that on Friday noon, a team of Assam policemen entered Mizoram’s territory in Zophai where a bridge was under construction to connect the main road to the paddy field of C Chhunga, the first chief minister of Mizoram. “Assam Police created problems for workers on the site and even stole some construction materials including pieces of iron rods etc. A police case against theft of construction materials has been filed against them at Bairabi police station,” the letter mentioned. “I would like to reiterate that this incident may not be considered a boundary issue as it is ongoing construction works for connecting road. Government servant committing an act that can be interpreted as theft towards government property is very disappointing and considered very serious,” it added. Police officials in Hailakandi district of Assam, which borders Kolasib district in Mizoram, refuted the allegations and blamed Mizoram authorities for vitiating the atmosphere with false accusations and indulging in construction activities on the Assam side. “Mizoram authorities were constructing a bridge over a ‘nullah’ at Kachurthal which borders Mizoram on one side and Assam on the other. Since the construction was being done on Assam’s territory, necessary authorization from our side should have been taken. But the Mizoram side didn’t do that,” said Hailakandi superintendent of police Gaurav Upadhyay. “When an Assam police patrolling party saw the construction on reaching the site on Friday, Mizoram authorities didn’t provide satisfactory replies and have now filed a case based on allegations, which are concocted, baseless and malafide,” he added.Refuting the allegations of the Mizoram side, Upadhyay said that persons on the Mizoram side obstructed Assam policemen from carrying out their official duties on Assam’s soil. He said he has already talked to his Kolasib counterpart in this regard, and would file a counter-case if needed. Following the incident, security along the Assam-Mizoram border at Hailakandi has been beefed up and additional police personnel deployed to prevent any untoward incident from happening. Both Assam and Mizoram have a dispute regarding the demarcation of the 164-km long boundary between them. On July 26, six Assam policemen were killed and over 50 policemen and civilians were injured in firing between both sides. The incident led to an unofficial blockade of NH306 for several days by people on the Assam side affecting the movement of goods and people to Mizoram. Following the Centre’s intervention, central security forces were deployed at the border areas and the tensions de-escalated a bit. Ministers from both states held a meeting in Aizawl on August 5 where they agreed to maintain peace on the border areas. But days after the talks, on August 14, a blast damaged a school in Hailakandi district located along the border. Mizoram denied any involvement in the incident. This was followed by a firing incident on the border on August 17. Mizoram claimed Assam police fired at three Mizoram residents who were trying to cross the border and meet an acquaintance on the Assam side. Assam maintains firing started from Mizoram side and they retaliated. While no one sustained bullet injuries in the incident, according to Mizoram authorities, one Mizoram resident was injured while falling down in an attempt to flee the firing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mizoram-files-theft-case-against-assam-cops-allegations-concocted-says-assam-police-101629622458240.html

22-08-2021||Lucknow||Remembering Kalyan Singh: BJP’s first UP chief minister||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, who breathed his last here on Saturday nigh, headed the first-ever Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 1991 and was the chief minister when the Babri mosque was demolished in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.Singh, an OBC leader, was a cadre’s delight, recalled former minister Rajendra Tiwari, who was UP BJP secretary when Kalyan Singh was the state party chief in 1984.Soon after becoming chief minister for the first time in 1991, “babuji”, as Kalyan was referred to, summoned top police and administrative officials in the Tilak Hall of Lucknow’s state secretariat for a purpose.“Our government has been formed with a lot of struggle. The cadres played an important role, taking lathis and bullets .. Just ensure one thing. If our cadres approach you with some work or complaint, be nice to them. Even if you can’t help them for some reason, at least offer them sweets, water ...”Born on January 5, 1932, Singh had a key role in BJP’s rise in Uttar Pradesh.Handpicked by the late Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) leader Bhaurao Deoras to head the UP BJP unit after the sudden demise of the party’s first state chief Madhav Prasad Tripathi, Kalyan soon had a job on his hands – countering the Mandal agitation that the RSS feared would divide Hindus on caste lines.“Deoras told Kalyan to start holding meetings across the state... I remember the late RSS leader telling Kalyan, attache uthao aur sabhayein karon .. (pack your suitcase and start visiting the state to hold meetings),” recalled Tiwari.Kalyan did as told and his speeches would invariably refer to the agitation for the Ayodhya Ram temple. It was the period in UP when the Congress was on the decline and the period would witness the rise of two powerful, but ideologically opposite OBC leaders in UP who dominated politics for a long time — Kalyan Singh and Samajwadi Party’s Mulayam Singh Yadav.As luck would have it, for a brief period of 10 months, Kalyan even did the unthinkable — befriending his ideological rival, getting his son to join the SP, attended the party’s Agra convention and even wore the SP’s ‘red cap’. He would regret the decision later.“That was a big mistake ... I now want to die a BJP man. I have always been a swayamsevak ...,” he had shared with HT soon after rejoining BJP.He left the BJP thrice – twice over differences with party leadership and then in 2014 after being appointed governor of Rajasthan; coming back to the party each time.“The RSS would never leave him. He was their favourite, who combined Hindutva with backward politics and helped in uniting Hindus. Kalyan himself was livid with Mandal politics and actively participated in meetings to counter the reservation politics of Mandal with what was called Kamandal,” a BJP leader requesting anonymity said.Shankar Lal Lodhi, a High Court lawyer whose association with Kalyan dates back to 90s, described why Kalyan was an “all-rounder, a leader for all seasons ...”“He was quick to take decisions, never hesitant to call spade a spade, hated criminals, was a stickler for time, valued words and relationships and above all was a tall, true mass leader,” he said.Shankar said, “One key quality of babuji was his honesty. After the Supreme Court order led to vacation of bungalows by former chief ministers in UP, he never had any house of his own in the state capital.He later shifted in the residence allotted to his grandson, a minister in the UP government but in case that was not there he would well be living in a rented apartment in Lucknow. Such was his honesty.”Shankar was also Kalyan’s lawyer in the Babri mosque demolition case. The mosque was demolished with Kalyan as the chief minister on December 6, 1992 and his government was subsequently dismissed.Among the leaders named in the criminal conspiracy case for the felling of the mosque, Shankar, who was also Kalyan’s lawyer, recalled the former chief minister telling him not to dilute his stance on not firing at the kar sewaks.“Babuji categorically told me that he would stand by the fact that he asked the police officials in writing not to fire at the kar sewaks who had gathered at the Ayodhya site on the demolition day. He said as chief minister he had asked the police to follow the law, but had specifically prohibited them from opening fire,” Shankar said.Years later, Kalyan after being exonerated in the case along with other leaders, would proudly recall, “I never wanted to die with blood of kar sewaks on my hands!”There are innumerable instances of Kalyan not budging once he had taken a decision, no matter how unpleasant.“I remember as the health minister in the Janata Party government in the 70s, he had transferred all doctors who were posted at one place for a long time. This included some doctors who were close to the BJP including late Dr SC Rai, as also the relative of a BJP functionary. But Kalyan said since a decision had been taken, he would review it only later,” a BJP leader recalled.In 1998, as a second-term chief minister Kalyan was addressing a public meeting in Amroha when he was informed that his government had been dismissed and Congress leader Jagdambika Pal had been appointed the chief minister.“Everyone was surprised with the decision of the then governor Romesh Bhandari, who administered the oath of office to Pal at night.The decision was contested in the high court and Atal ji went on a fast unto death. Subsequently, on the court orders Pal was asked to prove his majority in the assembly which he couldn’t and Kalyan returned to head the BJP government,” BJP leader recalled.As chief minister, he would be fully updated on developments and wanted his ministers to attend meetings with full details.“He would do his homework, call up officials at odd hours to know progress ... And he hated criminals. At times he would, on coming to know that someone has been booked on rape charge or any other heinous crime, would tell the cop to pursue the case and ensure conviction,” Tiwari said.“He was a leader who loved a challenge. We don’t know if he was aware that no governor before him had ever completed a full term in office in Rajasthan. Kalyan Singh ji not only completed his term, but did so with great distinction,” Tiwari recalled.“After being sworn in as Rajasthan governor on September 4, 2014, Kalyan, in his first meeting with vice chancellors, had ordered them to adopt villages.On coming to know of reports of mass copying in Barmer, Rajasthan, Kalyan had ordered strict action on the college from where it was reported,” Dr Lokesh Chandra Sharma, the then assistant to the Rajasthan governor, recalled in a book containing speeches made by Kalyan Singh as governor.He also got the Rajasthan government to end the practice of according the guard of honour each time governor visited or left Raj Bhawan for tours.“He had sent a note to the home department, seeking to know if this practice could be done away with and on being informed that it was possible, he ordered it be followed,” Sharma said.Years ago, when UP government had decided to ban pan masala on secretariat campus, Kalyan when asked how he will cope with the ban, had said with a smile: “Haan, problem to hogi ... par agar niyam hai to palan karenge (Yes, there would be some problem but if it is a rule, we will follow it).”Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in a recent tweet acknowledged Kalyan’s vision.“I also have many memories of my interactions with Kalyan Singh Ji. Several of those memories came back to life. Talking to him has always been a learning experience,” the PM had recently tweeted. Neraly all the top BJP leadership had visited Kalyan Singh in hospital.“One saw nearly whole of BJP leadership visiting Kalyan Singh ji in hospital. It was BJP’s top leadership’s gesture for a leader who led the party through difficult times in a state which eventually shaped BJP’s rise nationally,” said Irshad Ilmi, a political observer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/remembering-kalyan-bjp-s-first-up-chief-minister-101629597245002.html

Sitharaman hailed Adityanath for creating an investment-friendly atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh.This expressway will be the longest in north India and the second longest in the country. The project’s estimated cost is ₹36,230 crore.SS Mallikarjuna Rao, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of PNB, handed over the approval letter to the state government at a ceremony at the Indira Gandhi Prathisthan in the state capital. Speaking at the event, Sitharaman said, “I am very proud of chief minister Yogi Adityanath who understands the larger national interest, translates that into the state’s policies and takes it at the execution level to the last mile.” Referring to the infrastructure work going on in the state, she said, “That which had to be done in six decades is being attempted to be completed within four-five years. It requires extraordinary commitment and efforts, and that is what the CM is doing. Pleasantly happy that a public sector bank has gone thinking forward.” Adityanath said the Ganga Expressway would become the backbone of the state’s economy. He also lauded Sitharaman for allocating a budget for infrastructure development.“We are connecting Meerut in west Uttar Pradesh with Prayagraj in the east. The Ganga Expressway will become the backbone of the state’s economy. Travelling time from Lucknow to Meerut will decrease to five hours and 6.5 hours from Prayagraj to Meerut through the Ganga Expressway,” the chief minister said.“The state government had decided to create a 594 km-long expressway between Prayagraj and Meerut…I am grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for allocation of funds in the Union Budget for big infrastructure development,” he added.With the approval letter, the state government has finalised the process of securitisation-based loans from banks as part of mobilisation of financial resources for the Ganga Expressway. The state government will use this amount for the project. During the currency of this loan (loan period), the expressway will be owned and operated by Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority. This is the first innovative attempt to monetize public infrastructure assets not only in the state, but in the whole of northern India, the state government claimed. UPEIDA, a state government body, is the nodal agency for executing all expressway projects in the state. According to UPEIDA CEO Awanish Kumar Awasthi, around 92% land required for the Ganga Expressway project has been acquired.The Ganga Expressway will start from National Highway-334 (NH-334 in Meerut and end at Prayagraj bypass at the National Highway-2 (NH-2). The six-lane expressway will be expandable up to eight lanes. It will pass through Meerut, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj districts of Uttar Pradesh. The Purvanchal Expressway is in the final stages of completion and the Bundelkhand Expressway would also be completed soon, said UPEIDA chief executive officer (CEO) Awanish Kumar Awasthi.

22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab vigilance bureau to file recall petition in HC against ex-DGP’s release order||The Punjab vigilance bureau on Saturday announced to file a recall petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the August 19 release orders of former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in a land fraud case. The bureau will file a similar plea against the court’s August 12 interim bail order in the disproportionate assets case registered against the former top cop.Saini was arrested on August 18 evening in the land fraud case when he went to the vigilance office in connection with the disproportionate assets FIR on the HC orders giving him interim bail on the condition that he join the probe within 7 days.A bureau spokesperson said that Saini failed to follow the HC orders in letter and spirit as he chose to visit the VB office late in the evening on the last day of the 7-day period. “Saini intentionally exhausted the 7-day period during which he had to join the probe in accordance with interim order in the FIR no. 13. Even then, he arrived at the bureau’s Sector 68 office in Mohali without intimating the investigating officer in advance. In fact, he intentionally did not go to the investigating officer’s office,” said the spokesperson.Under these circumstances, the bureau had thus decided to file a petition in the court seeking recall of the interim bail orders in the disproportionate assets case, he added.The case relates to 35 properties and bank accounts of public works department executive engineer Nimratdeep Singh with transactions of ₹100 crore, including some with Saini. The spokesperson said there is sufficient ground to seek recall of the HC orders releasing Saini from detention in the land fraud case. “First, Saini had been taken into custody not under FIR 13 (where he got interim bail) but in the FIR 11, in which he had no protection from arrest. The criminal acts in FIR 11 and FIR 13 are different,” he added. Second, the HC’s earlier protection orders dated October 11, 2018 and September 23, 2020, do not apply to this particular case as those had provided for 7 days’ notice to be given to the officer before arresting him for any offences committed during his service period, the spokesperson claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-vigilance-bureau-to-file-recall-petition-in-hc-against-ex-dgp-s-release-order-101629577515958.html

They are in touch with us”.A Sikh taking shelter in the Kabul gurdwara said they had to wait for more than 12 hours for being allowed to enter the airport. “Later, the Taliban fighters said as we were Afghan nationals, we can’t board the flight that was meant for Indians,” he said. Another Sikh said the roads leading to the airport are badly due to rush of vehicles. Approximately 300 Sikhs and Hindus are taking a refuge at the gurdwara fearing threats from Taliban.

If any complaints are received against him during this period, he will be sent to the observation home in Ambala, the court ruled.As per the FIR, registered on June 1, 2019, the 17-year-old who is a BCA student, had molested two girls –aged 16 and 18 – when they were playing badminton in the neighbourhood. He was booked under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.The juvenile’s counsel said that his client has been implicated and stated that there were contradictions in the statements of victims.After hearing the arguments, the board held the juvenile guilty, however, took a lenient view due to his age and medical condition.Pronouncing the punishment, the juvenile justice board stated, “The board cannot ignore the guilt of the juvenile. However, keeping in view the career of the juvenile-in-conflict with law as well as the tender age at which he has committed this offence, it would be in the interest of justice if the juvenile is ordered to do some community service.” The juvenile-in-conflict with law was ordered to report to the in-charge, Old Age Home, Sector-15, Panchkula, on August 23 for the community service. The in-charge of the old-age home has also been directed to submit a report about his work and conduct.The girls’ counsel, Udit Mendiratta, said this is a big win for them, however, another case against the boy’s father is pending in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guilty-of-molesting-2-girls-juvenile-told-to-serve-at-home-for-elderly-in-panchkula-101629577452231.html
22-08-2021||Lucknow||Mission Shakti 3.0 launched in UP, ₹ 30.12 crore transferred to 155,000 girls’ accounts||The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday launched the third phase of Mission Shakti as Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath transferred ₹ 30.12 crore Kanya Sumangla Yojana money into the accounts of 1.55 lakh (155,000) girls, the new beneficiaries of the scheme, here.Mission Shakti is the UP government’s flagship programme aimed at promoting the security, dignity and empowerment of women. The first phase was launched in October last year.Talking about women empowerment by the Yogi government in UP, Sitharaman said: “I can say that if you have a chief minister like him, then I can foresee the bright and prosperous future of the state and women in it. For the financial empowerment of people in the rural areas, he (Yogi) has appointed women banking correspondents, Banking Sakhis, all over the state.”Sitharaman further said: “CM Yogi’s energy, hard work and dedication are exemplary. I understand that he has travelled to each of the 75 districts of UP ten times over in the last five years. If you have a chief minister like this, then the state is set to progress fast. He is a very popular chief minister.”After chief minister Yogi Adityanath credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the all-round progress of the country since he became PM in 2014, Sitharaman lauded the PM’s efforts for launching several women-centric schemes and giving women priority in several other schemes. “In the latest cabinet reshuffle, PM Modi gave prominence to women. At present, there are 11 women ministers in the Union cabinet,” she said.“When a woman gets encouragement and opportunity, she does not feel shy and hesitant, and once she becomes a part of a task, she gives her best,” said Sitharaman“And, this is the speciality of women,” she said at the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow after the launch of the campaign.Sitharaman also said: “Before coming to Delhi as the Prime Minister in 2014, Modiji auctioned all the gifts he had received as Gujarat CM and donated the proceeds for the education of girl children. During his chief ministership of Gujarat, he took several steps for empowering women in the state, including measures for increasing the number of women in panchayats.” “Whether it is the Ujjwala scheme, the Jan Dhan scheme or the MUDRA scheme, women are given priority in several schemes launched by the Centre,” the finance minister said. Speaking on the Covid vaccination drive, she said: “Even some developed countries do not have vaccines. But due to PM Modi’s efforts, we are producing six vaccines in India. We want to provide vaccines quickly to the country, especially the vulnerable population. And there will be vaccines for children over 12 years of age soon.” Sitharaman ended her speech by saying: “Jai Uttar Pradesh, Jai Bharat.”Sitharaman, Patel, and Yogi also felicitated 75 women from government and non-governmental sectors for their contribution to the first and the second phases of Mission Shakti and then laid the foundation stone (remotely) for the Veerangana Avantibai Battalion of PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) campus, Badaun.The third phase of the programme will end on December 31. The main schemes that are scheduled to be implemented in this phases are the launch of Mission Shakti Kaksha (classrooms) at all the 59,000 gram panchayat bhawans (village panchayat buildings), formation of one lakh women self-help groups, linking of 1.73 lakh (173,000) new beneficiaries to the destitute women pension scheme, safe city project at the divisional headquarters and Gautam Buddh Nagar, posting of women police personnel as beat police officers, construction of pink toilets (for women) in 1,286 police stations, special recruitment for women battalions of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) to 2,982 posts, deployment of women sub-inspectors in urban areas, setting up of creches in all police lines and construction of health clubs in women’s colleges.The governor said it was time that women started looking for empowerment within. She praised both Modi and Yogi for their government’s women empowerment initiatives.Yogi said that after the transfer of ₹ 30.12 crore into the accounts of 1.55 lakh new beneficiaries, the total number of Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana beneficiaries has reached 9.36 lakh.He said that 54% seats were won by women in the panchayat polls in UP this time.“Imagine, before this, women police personnel never used to be deputed on beat posting (field duty). Women used to wonder, why so? But now, they are getting and will be getting beat police officers’ postings.”UP minister of state (independent charge) for women welfare, child development and nutrition Swati Singh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, UP finance minister Suresh Khanna, state women commission chairperson Vimla Batham and Apollo group of hospitals’ joint managing director Dr Sangita Reddy were also present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mission-shakti-3-0-launched-in-up-30-12-crore-transferred-to-155-000-girls-accounts-101629577392215.html

Commander Rohit Kaushik , a submariner, explains why the men in olive green were given preferential treatment. “There is an inherent culture of cleanliness, orderliness, preservation and development of natural habitat that exists in the fraternity, which they lent to the city.”Lt Gen Harwant recounts an observation made by his father, a civil surgeon, who was working with the Punjab government at the time of Chandigarh’s inception, “People were apprehensive about moving here. The wide unchartered expanse beyond Kharar extending to and covering erstwhile villages that now are a part of Chandigarh had a high leprosy rate! Surprisingly, none of it manifested later. I suppose, adoption of soldiers as privileged residents did make it God’s country.”So true, sir!For those without defined roots, a posting to Chandigarh more often than not culminates in permanent residency. Lt Gen Gippy Dhillon says he had firmly locked Chandigarh as his post-retirement abode during his first posting. “During training at the academy, I visited Chandigarh as a course mate. The result is that I belong to Chandigarh.” To top it, he bought a piece of land close to his residence and has developed it into a multi-facility farm.”Nilofer, an alumni of Carmel Convent married Capt Vimal , another Chandigarh resident. Frequent postings forced her to shift to Chandigarh. “It was the second-best decision of my life. The best, of course, was marrying Vimal”, she says, gleefully.“Chandigarh is one of the safest places to settle in and work. I got a job with my alma mater, built a house, educated and settled my children, while my husband served the nation,” she says.Lt Gen Praveen Bakshi and his wife Neerupma are both from the defence background and as such had no fixed roots. Neerupama chose to stay at her parent’s house at Chandigarh when Praveen was posted in the field. Her safe, comfortable and hassle-free stay cemented Chandigarh as their post-retirement abode.Military wit, humour The story doesn’t quite end here. Faujis are loved for their discipline, subtle sense of humour and ‘never say die’ spirit, which is the city’s legacy. This is apparent from an anecdote narrated to me by a doctor friend.Speaking to a veteran who needed a major surgery, my friend said, “General saab, the surgery though necessary, is dangerous ”.Pat came the response. “Doc, tell me is the surgery more dangerous than crossing a busy Chandigarh road? If not, go ahead right away!’’Another friend says we all have a colonel to thank for turning him into a punctual person.My friend was hosting a party to celebrate the birth of his grandchild at an upscale hotel in the city. His colonel friend arrived dot on time. However, nobody, including the hosts, turned up till about 8.30pm.When the hosts arrived, the colonel and wife were helping themselves to a self-paid drink at the regular bar. My friend sheepishly asked him why he was not at the bar of the party venue, to which the wily colonel replied, “ Buddy, since we did not find anyone around, we reasoned that we were either at a different venue or the party had been called off, so we decided to celebrate the birth of your grandchild privately.

Met officials said moderate rain can be expected on Sunday as well, while from Monday, scattered showers are likely. The city has so far recorded 386.8mm rain this monsoon, which is 40% deficient. The maximum temperature of 26.2°C on Saturday, which was seven degrees below normal, was also the lowest the city has seen since February 21 this year, which the mercury was at 25.8°C. There was a difference of only a degree between the maximum and minimum temperature on Saturday.Speaking about the fall in temperature, IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said, “While it didn’t rain much, the sky remained cloudy due to which the maximum temperature couldn’t go up.”Singh added that moderate showers up to 30 mm can be expected on Sunday. In the next three days, the maximum temperature will hover between 30°C and 32°C while the minimum temperature is likely to be around 26°C and 27°C.Water-level at Sukhna Lake close to danger markAfter Saturday’s showers, the water-level of Sukhna Lake climbed up to 1,162.65 feet, which was just 5.5 inches below the danger mark. Earlier this month, one of the three floodgates of Sukhna Lake had to be opened to keep the water-level in check. Officials added that if rains continue in the catchment areas of the Lake, the same procedure will have to be repeated in the coming days too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-26-2-c-chandigarh-records-coldest-august-day-in-3-years-101629577152882.html
22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | Amendments to JJ Act are against children’s interests||Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have approved the 2021 amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), which allows district magistrates to issue adoption orders instead of civil courts. Amending provisions of the JJ Act to recognise executive magistrates as a competent authority authorised to issue adoption orders will allow speedier adoption of children. Beneficial, benevolent and progressive as the proposals may be, they are myopic and do not seem to be in tandem with parallel family law legislations. The cited reasonings — delay in civil courts and adoption processes being non-contested litigations — ignore the “interest and welfare of child” principle. The purpose defeats the ends. Further, it may create statutory conflicts with contradictory and inconsistent interpretations in issues relating to marriage, adoption and guardianship. The wholesome solution then may be to not amend the act or incorporate similar amendments in other existing laws. Adoption of children under the JJ Act, which is outside the scope of the provisions of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA), is guided by Sections 56 and 57 of the JJ Act, wherein irrespective of religion, orphan, abandoned and surrendered children can be made wards of single or divorced persons as per procedure laid down under the Adoption Regulations, 2017. The process entails a robust and protective mechanism routed through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara). Ultimately, under the JJ Act, all Cara approved adoptions require an adoption order from a court, which under the JJ Act “means a civil court, which has jurisdiction in matters of adoption and guardianship, and may include the district court, family court and city civil courts.” Section 61 of the JJ Act mandates that before issuing an adoption order approved by Cara, the court shall satisfy that the adoption is for the welfare of the child, as per the wishes of the child and without consideration, payment or reward for the adoption.Interpretation of “court” The definition of “court” in the JJ Act is shared by a similar interpretation of “district court” under the Guardians and Wards Act (GWA) and the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (HMGA), wherein “court” means the city civil court, a district court or a judicial court notified by the high court under Section 4 of the GWA. Clearly, the functions, authority and powers to oversee and lend finality in matters of adoption and guardianship have jurisprudentially rested with judicial courts and not executive courts. This is because judicial and not executive minds, are trained to exercise legal powers, which require adjudicatory acumen to adjudge welfare of children, a prime duty vested by law. Subrogation of judicial functions to executive authorities in routine, for stamping judicial finality will offend the fundamental division of powers of judicial and executive courts, besides encroaching on powers of judicial courts under the GWA and the HMGA. The pivotal role of a judicial court under Section 61 of the JJ Act to x-ray an adoption, before passing an adoption order cannot be delegated to executive courts, the fundamental concept of determining the best interest and the welfare of the vulnerable child by making it an administrative exercise with no introspection. Children, an asset of the nation, deserve a cautious adoption process.Adoption order is not an administrative routine The 2021 amendment of the JJ Act empowers the district magistrates to issue valid adoption orders for inter and intra-country adoptions. Adoptions under the JJ Act are now in the realm of executive magistrates in place of judicial courts. Lawmakers failed to appreciate that an adoption order is not a license, permit or sanction, which is dealt administratively in routine. Legislators failed to appreciate that the entire adoption process was streamlined on intervention of the supreme court to prevent malpractices of inter-country adoptions. Three decades overhaul led to a rigorous, robust and full proof mechanism under the microscopic eye examination of judicial courts to certify adoptions. With one stroke, this has been undone without realising the consequences. Children are not commodities or merchandise and adoption is not a business. Adoption needs a parens patriae intervention of a judicial court to ensure welfare of the child. This cannot be an endorsement left to bureaucracy being handled by administrative staff who have no judicial training or expertise to adjudge the well-being of children. An anomalous predicament looms large as neither the GWA nor HMGA have been amended to vest district magistrates with such powers of approving adoptions. Split laws for adoptions cannot prevail. Children cannot be left to administrative exercises as trade. The unjust amendments fail the child. anilmalhotra1960@gmail.com(The writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer and author.

The president of Ayyappa Society in Mohali, Unnikrishnan, added that due to the pandemic, everyone was in a sombre mood and no celebrations were held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/malayali-community-tone-down-onam-celebrations-in-chandigarh-and-around-101629575835655.html
22-08-2021||Chandigarh||HC upholds PSPCL’s decision to close down school in Ropar||The Punjab and Haryana high court has upheld the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited’s (PSPCL) decision to close down a school which it was running at the Power Colony area of Roopnagar. Students from the colony had challenged the PSPCL’s decision taken in July 2020, arguing that it was in violation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. As per the Act, all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years are entitled to free and compulsory primary education in neighbourhood schools. Rules entitled the Punjab Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011, have been framed by Punjab under the central law. According to this, students from Classes 1 to 5 must have access to a school within a distance of 1 kilometre from their house, and those from Classes 6 to 8 within three kilometres, the court was told.It was also informed that Nuhon Colony is at a distance of 15 kilometres from Power Colony. Thus, the decision is in violation of central law and rules framed under it. It was also argued that PSPCL is a “local authority” mentioned under RTE Act and is duty bound to establish schools. As per PSPCL, all employees will be allotted houses in Nuhon Colony, where a school is already established. Further, the step was taken to reduce costs at Roopnagar, as power generation is reducing. The PSPCL is not a “local authority” as defined in RTE Act, and it has no duty to establish a neighbourhood school and some government schools are already functioning in the area, it had submitted. The bench of justice Sudhir Mittal took note of submissions that only bodies like municipal corporation, municipal council, zila parishad, nagar panchayat and panchayat come under the definition of “local authority’. “Thus, only municipal corporations etc. and such other bodies are covered by the definition of “local authority”. PSPCL does not exercise any kind of control, nor does it have any function in relation to the administration of a city, town or village and thus, it is not covered under the definition,” the bench said, while holding that no fundamental or statutory right of the children is violated by closing down the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-upholds-pspcl-s-decision-to-close-down-school-in-ropar-101629575834328.html
22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali man denied bail in drug seizure case||The high court has denied bail to a Mohali resident who claimed to be a passenger while sitting in the front seat of an auto-rickshaw with the driver in a case of drug seizure.“The auto-rickshaw was being driven by Harjit Singh Baidwan and by his side was sitting one Gurlal, who cannot be said to be a passenger. In case he was one, he would have been sitting in the rear seat. The fact that he was sitting in the front shows that he was a close acquaintance or a friend of Baidwan,” the bench of justice Gurvinder Singh Gill said, adding that in these circumstances, both the accused could safely be attributed conscious possession of the recovered contraband.The FIR was registered on January 17 under Section 22 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. As per the police, when they were patrolling in Sector 66 of Mohali, an auto-rickshaw being driven by Baidwan was signalled to stop; Gurlal was sitting in the front with him. The driver tried to speed away but the police were able to stop them.Upon checking, a black bag was found to be hanging from the driver seat in which 14 injections of Buprenorphine (2ml each) and 14 Avil vials (10ml each) along with seven needles were recovered. The duo could not produce any document to justify the possession of the injections.The petitioners’ counsel had told court that they had falsely been implicated and that they could not be attributed conscious possession of the contraband allegedly recovered. In any case, as per Rule 66 of the NDPS Act, an individual may possess up to 100 dosage units at a time for personal medical use, and that the recovered quantity was much less than that. It was further argued that Gurlal was a passenger in the auto-rickshaw.The court while dismissing the plea observed that the court was unable to accept the contention as the petitioners could not show anything to the effect that the same was for their personal medical use. The recovered quantity of contraband fell in the category of “commercial” and would attract fetters imposed by Section 37 of the NDPS Act in the matter of grant of bail, the court said, adding that the apex court had already held that a liberal approach in matters of bail in drug seizure cases was uncalled for.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-man-denied-bail-in-drug-seizure-case-101629575833485.html

I do not have enough money to immediately choose an alternative mode of travel,’ he rued.Notably, till the filing of this report, the railway had issued a refund amounting to ₹2 lakh to passengers, which will take around 72 hours to be processed. Meanwhile, Tarvinder Singh of Vadodra, Gujrat, said that he had come to Ludhiana for a meeting and had to return on Friday but had to prolong his stay.

The contraband, which was packed in 39 plastic packets, was pushed into Indian territory through a PVC pipe inserted through the barbed wire fence in the Panjgraian border outpost (BOP) area. Police said the operation was launched around 2.30am when some movement was noticed along the border. The BSF opened fire on noticing suspects across the barbed wire fence and ahead of the zero line, but they managed to retreat.Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said following a tip-off that Nirmal Singh, alias Sonu Mayer, a notorious smuggler of the Gharinda area, was trying to smuggle heroin through the border, senior superintendent of police (SSP-Amritsar rural) Gulneet Singh Khurana shared the information with BSF officials. A police team comprising deputy superintendent of police (DSP-investigation) Gurinderpal Singh and DSP, Ajnala, Vipan Kumar also reached the spot, said the DGP. Besides recovering 40kg of heroin, the police and BSF also seized 180 grams of opium and two plastic pipes, said the DGP, adding a motorcycle and a scooter belonging to Indian smugglers have been impounded.“The police have launched a hunt to arrest Sonu, who is also wanted by the Tarn Taran police in a heroin recovery case of 2020,” said SSP Khurana. The smugglers used a Pakistan-made plastic pipe to push the heroin, tied neatly in packets, across the fence.

Taking note of an investigation by the additional deputy commissioner Satbir Kundu, deputy commissioner Pradeep Dahiya made the recommendations in a communication to the HSRLM chief executive officer (CEO). The inquiry was conducted by Kundu about five months ago and the DC has taken note following protest by the members of some self-help groups on August 16. The inquiry report has indicted district project manager Rajat Bhaskar, Siwan block project manager Ramphal Sharma, president of women self-help group Renu, treasurer Sunia, data entry operators Neera (Dhand block), Sunaina (Pundri block) and Rakesh Sharma (Rajaund block) of financial irregularities. The matter came to light when some members of the women self-help groups raised the issue on the ‘CM Window’ and an inquiry was ordered. During the investigation, irregularities were found in sanctioning of loans and procurement of materials of different nature. In one instance, a self-help group claimed ₹40,813 for their spending on tea and snacks, but the bills submitted totalled only ₹20,141. The report found seven people guilty of financial irregularities, and violating the bylaws by not replacing members every two years. Also, they did not get any audit done from a chartered accountant, the report pointed out. Deputy commissioner Dahiya confirmed that he has written to the department concerned for further action as per the findings of the inquiry report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/financial-bungling-in-livelihood-mission-kaithal-dc-recommends-fir-against-5-officials-101629575292878.html

22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Tests rule out deficiency in food quality behind blackbuck deaths||BATHINDATests of feed and fodder samples by the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NRDDL) has ruled out any quality deficiency in the food quality behind deaths of three blackbucks, a protected wildlife species, at a mini zoo in Bathinda’s Bir Talab.The post-examination report of antelopes, including two females, is expected next week. It will throw light on the reasons behind sudden deaths at zoo’s deer safari, state wildlife officials said on Saturday. The affected wildlife was below one year.Blackbuck is Punjab’s state animal and it is covered under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.Sudden deaths in captivity on Wednesday triggered health concerns of the wildlife as the zoo houses about 200 antelopes in the open deer safari, including 112 blackbucks, sambar and hog deer. The mini-zoo that also has three leopards, and several herbivorous species, including emu and birds, has no full-time veterinarian.Following blackbuck mortality, forest range officer Pawan Sridhar was removed as in-charge of the zoo. Services of the lone veterinarian, who was hired on ad hoc, were also discontinued with immediate effect.Punjab’s chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Charchil Kumar said viscera samples are being analysed by experts at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana.“Deaths of blackbucks are being watched closely. It is premature to attribute reason to the wildlife mortality,” he added.Amarinder Singh, who took charge of the mini zoon on Saturday, said the university scientists may take another 10 days to submit a report as the body tissues are being cultured at the laboratory for in-depth study of deaths.Bathinda divisional forest officer (DFO) Swaran Singh said a team of veterinarians from Chhatbir Zoo on Friday audited wildlife health and safety at Bir Talab facility.“Other wildlife in the safari did not show any symptom of illness. But behaviour of the animals is being monitored,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tests-rule-out-deficiency-in-food-quality-behind-blackbuck-deaths-101629575231956.html

22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal detention: HC directs Moga SSP to register case against SHO, 3 other cops||The Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) to register a case against former station house officer (SHO) of Badhni Kalan, an assistant sub-inspector and two other cops for illegally detaining an elderly couple. The cops had detained them for four days and later registered a case of abetment of suicide against them.The high court’s directions came after the Moga district and sessions judge conducted an inquiry and found the cops guilty of illegal detention of Shinda Singh and his wife Paramjit Kaur of Rania village.Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi also directed the Moga police to constitute a special investigation team to look into the case of abetment of suicide registered against them at the Badhni Kalan police station on March 4.Victims’ counsel Arshdeep Brar said the couple was illegally detained and FIR was registered in the first week of March.“SI Karamjeet Singh, then SHO of Badhni Kalan police station, had illegally detained Shinda and his wife Paramjit on March 1. The very next day, acquaintances of the victims and local activists approached the high court. On March 3, the court had appointed a warrant officer to look into the matter,” Brar said.“The warrant officer visited the Badhni Kalan police station on some day and did not find the victims there. The police somehow got information about the warrant officer’s visit and shifted victims to some unknown place. On March 4, the then SHO registered a case of abetment of suicide against the couple, their son and two activists, who approached the court. The incident of suicide, in which they were made accused, took place on February 25,” he added.Later, the high court directed district and sessions judge, Moga, to conduct an inquiry. The report has been submitted in the high court.“In his report, the district and sessions judge said that SI Karamjit Singh, SHO, Badhni Kalan, ASI Jaswant Rai, Gunman Pawan Kumar and a lady police official are guilty of illegal detention of Shinda and Paramjit.

22-08-2021||Mumbai||Raj Kundra case: All that has happened||When policemen arrived at Green Park bungalow in Madh village on February 4, the languid noontime air of the partly-rural Mumbai suburb belied the frenetic activity taking place inside. A team of police officers from Mumbai Crime Branch (CB)’s Property Cell found light diffusers, LED halogen lights, illuminators, a tripod camera stand, a laptop, and a high definition video camera pointed towards a bed. On it laid a young couple in their mid-20s in a state of partial undress. They were enacting an intimate scene. It appeared to be a shoot till the 25-year-old woman spoke up. Her revelation blew the lid off what the police claimed is a pornography racket. On February 5, the Malwani police station lodged a First Information Report against five persons present at the shoot: producer Yasmin Khan aka Rowa (40), actors Bhanu Thakur (26) and Mohamamad Saifi (24), light man Monu Joshi (28), and graphic designer Pratibha Nalawade (33). They were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 420 (cheating), 292 and 293 (related to obscene and indecent advertisements and displays), as well as the Information Technology Act, including 67 (publishing/transmitting obscene material in electronic form), 67A (publication/ transmission of sexually explicit act in electronic form) and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act. Over the following weeks, the CB, which took over the probe, would arrest more people: actor Vandana Tiwari (aka Gehana Vasisth), director Tanvir Hashmi, and Umesh Kamat, a representative with UK-based production company Kenrin Limited, which owns HotShots app. And then, on July 19, businessman Ripu Sudan Kundra, better known as Raj Kundra, actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband was arrested. A five-month long investigation leading up to his arrest revealed that alleged pornographic content — such as that being shot in the Madh village bungalow — was distributed over subscription-based mobile apps like HotHit Movies and Hotshots, as well as websites like Hothitmovies, Nuefliks, and Escapenow. Accounts of witnesses and complainants revealed that the accused threatened actors, who hoped for a big break in films or web series, to get them to comply. “There was a case registered with the Crime Branch Mumbai in February 2021 about the creation of pornographic films and publishing them through some apps. We’ve arrested Mr Raj Kundra in this case on July 19 as he appears to be the key conspirator. We have sufficient evidence,” the Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale said in a statement after Kundra’s arrest. According to the police, the Hotshots app was developed by Armsprime Media Private Limited, a firm founded by Kundra in 2019. Armsprime later sold Hotshots to Kenrin Limited, a UK-based firm, owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi. “Though the company [Kenrin] was registered in London, content creation, operation of the app and accounting was done through Kundra’s Viaan Industries,” Joint Commissioner of Mumbai Police (Crime Branch) Milind Bharambe said. Kundra and Shetty are promoters of Viaan Industries. While Kundra is no longer associated with Armsprime, the police did find email messages between Kundra and Bakshi allegedly about the Hotshots. The making of obscene content and its distribution are both punishable under various sections of the Indian law, including the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO). Its illegality hinges on the creation and distribution of that which is considered lascivious and prurient. Section 292 of the IPC states: “Whoever takes part in or receives profits from any business in the course of which he knows or has reason to believe that any such obscene objects are for any of the purposes aforesaid, made, produced, purchased, kept, imported, exported, conveyed, publicly exhibited or in any manner put into circulation shall be punished.” Section 293 makes it illegal to distribute obscene content to anyone below 20 years of age in particular. And, in pre-internet era, the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act sought to prohibit indecent representation of women through advertisements or in publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other manner. Thus, while shooting for adult content and viewing porn is illegal – several websites are periodically blocked by the government -- watching adult content is not an illegal act. [It is however, illegal to watch pornography involving children as per the IT Act.] The actor who was present at Green Park bungalow on February 4 turned case witness and told the cops that Yasmin (the producer) and other associates allegedly promised her a break in a web-series, but it was only when she arrived at the shoot that she realised she was to perform “obscene scenes”. “The woman protested that there was no information given in advance about the need to shoot scenes that were allegedly shot in the nude and were pornographic,” an investigator with the Crime Branch (property cell), who is part of the team investigating the case, said. “The accused persons present at the spot allegedly threatened and pressured the woman to perform the scenes,” the officer, who did not wish to be named, said. The young woman’s statement prompted others to come out. Three more women came forward with similar complaints against some of the accused. The Malwani police registered two complaints, the Lonavala police registered one. In all, 12 persons have been arrested in the cases so far and it is likely that the Crime Branch will take over all pornography-related cases. In February, the police verified that payments for HotHit used the gateway paykun.com. They have frozen a bank account, with a balance of ₹36.5 lakh, purportedly amassed from subscriptions to mobile apps and websites where adult films made by the accused arrested in February were uploaded. On August 13, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was set up. “The SIT will conduct further investigation into the case that was being handled by the Property Cell and two other cases that the Malwani police had registered based on complaints,” Assistant Commissioner of Police Shashank Sandbhor, who leads the SIT, said. The police have reportedly found evidence linking Kenrin with Viaan Industries including Whatsapp messages, email exchanges, and accounting details after a search of Kundra’s office. “As incriminating evidence was gathered in this case, the CB arrested Raj Kundra and his IT head Ryan Thorpe while further probe continues,” a CB official familiar with the probe said. “The content creation and operations of Hotshots app was carried out through a company named Viaan. While raiding the premises of the company we found evidence, on the basis of which we arrested Raj Kundra,” Bharambe said. The police said that Kundra was allegedly administrator of two mobile apps that disseminated obscene videos — Hotshots and Bollyfame — that are currently under the scanner of investigators. In the course of its probe, the police made incriminating seizures including a memory card containing video clips and script. According to CB officials, 68 pornographic films were allegedly found on a hard disk of a laptop seized during a search of Kundra’s premises. The police found a PowerPoint Presentation allegedly with details related to the Hotshots app including financial projections and market strategies. They claim to have made allegedly incriminating recoveries from Kundra’s personal laptop and said that have seized 51 allegedly obscene films with Hotshots and Bollyfame logos. The police suspect that some content in Kundra’s private cloud was also deleted. Among evidence seized – this from accused Gehena Vasisth -- was a script outline of a film titled Virginity on Auction, which ran to 147 pages. Investigators who went through seized short movies said they depicted actors portraying roles of “teachers, housemaids and nurses” in erotic sketches. Scripts titled “Bartanwali”, “Treatment” and “Chahat”. A short movie, whose trailer was available on a social media platform before it was removed this week Monday, showed a woman in undergarments lying on a bed with her hands and feet tied, as a man stands a few feet away. “Do you remember now?” the man asks the woman. The teaser ends by informing the viewers that they can access the “fully uncensored” content of the movie if they visit the website or download the app. The short movies were advertised on key social media platforms while the mobile app was available for download on Google Play. According to the police, the videos, usually 20 to 30 minutes long, were sexually explicit and the storyline was weak. This here was content that was obscene, produced and disseminated online, and was in clear violation of laws, according to the police. Police inspector Kedari Pawar, who headed CB’s Property Cell when it blew the lid off the racket in February, said: “The racket targeted female actors from poor, vulnerable families by promising them a role in a web series, movie or a television serial. The shooting would begin with a skeletal dialogue script and 10 minutes later, suddenly, the story would give way to obscene, pornographic content much to the shock and revulsion of the female actor. They would then be pressured into finishing the shoot and the content would be uploaded on illegal mobile apps and websites to earn lucrative revenue from subscriptions.” According to the police, the actors got a pittance. Pawar who was transferred out of Mumbai in May is no longer associated with the investigation. “Yes, the videos were pornographic and there is evidence to show that. The courts have turned down bail applications of the key accused, Raj Kundra. Why? Because there is evidence,” Pawar said. Both Kundra and Thorpe filed petitions in the Bombay high court (HC) challenging their arrests. Their pleas claimed that the mandatory provision of issuing a notice under section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was not followed, but the police had claimed that a notice under the section had been served, which Kundra refused to accept. A member of Kundra’s legal team, Subhash Jadhav, said, “The argument that the petitioner was arrested because after the petitioner was served with a Section 41A CrPC notice, he refused to accept, and it was found that the petitioner was deleting data in the office after the search, is completely false.” Senior advocate Aabad Ponda appearing for Kundra argued that even if Kundra had refused to accept the 41A notice as alleged by the police, the prosecution was expected to seek the court’s permission before arresting him. Ponda said that while Kundra’s arrest and seizure of his phone and other electronic devices took place on July 19, the police belatedly added a charge that pertained to destruction of evidence. However, taking note of the allegation regarding destruction of evidence, Justice AS Gadkari who heard the matter on August 7 said the petitioners did not deserve relief at this point and upheld their remand. Last week, the sessions court deferred the hearing on Kundra’s bail plea to August 20. Kundra’s lawyers challenged his arrest stating that the videos might be described as “lascivious” but do not show “explicit sexual acts”. However, the police opposed bail stating that the offence is of a “serious nature” and that Kundra might help his relative, Bakshi, an absconding accused, to evade the probe. Kundra’s lawyers however said that there is no material showing his involvement in the alleged offences. Other accused have also denied all wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raj-kundra-case-all-that-has-happened-101629574814148.html

In 2019, a similar attack was mounted on Jafri when two masked men fired at him. However, no one has been arrested in that case so far. According to police, Jafri was heading towards the jail for the morning inspection at 3.30 am. Just about 100 metres away from the jail gate he noticed three to four men walking towards the prison.“When he asked them about their purpose on the jail premises they started firing at him. He somehow saved himself and rushed back to his house and bolted it from inside. The gunmen even tried to forcefully enter the house but when they failed they fired several shots at the door,” SSP Etawah Dr Brajesh Kumar Singh said.He said though the exact cause of the attack was unclear yet but police suspect the role of some criminal who may have been lodged in the jail earlier.When contacted, jail superintendent Raj Kishore Singh said senior police officers have been informed about the attack and they have started a probe.The SSP said four teams led by CO City Rajesh Vashistha have been formed to crack the case at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deputy-jailor-attacked-inside-etawah-jail-compound-escapes-unhurt-101629574513420.html

This amounts to betraying both the sugarcane growers as well as the cause of diversification,” said Sukhbir.Asserting that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was impervious to the suffering of the sugarcane growers, Sukhbir demanded that all dues should be cleared along with the interest quotient. He said as per the Sugarcane Control Order and Clause 3 (3) of the Sugarcane Purchase and Regulation Act, sugar mills must make payments within 14 days of the purchase or else pay interest on the pending amount. “This Act should be implemented in letter and spirit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/increase-sugarcane-sap-to-rs-380-per-quintal-sukhbir-101629574451775.html
22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Women rapidly gaining ground in criminal activity in Ludhiana||Women are rapidly storming every last male bastion in society. Sadly, they are also giving their male counterparts a run for their money in the unsavoury sphere of crime. In the first 20 days of August alone, nine cases were reported where women were directly involved in cases of murder, abetment to suicide and drug peddling apart from active participation in dowry demands and deaths. A woman, no less, the mother of the nine-year-old victim, had been involved in a cold-blooded murder that had sent shock waves through the city on June 21. It had emerged that the women and her husband had murdered the minor girl so that they could claim ₹2.5 lakh as insurance money. To top it all, cops are losing a lot of sleep due to a women’s gang of snatchers. The gang of three scouts the city in a car and offers lifts to unsuspecting elderly persons and then rob them. Six such cases have been reported in the last six months. Shockingly, women have also been found guilty of helping those accused of rape. In a recent case, lodged at the Daba police station on Thursday, a woman had helped a 21-year-old culprit escape after raping a minor.A woman wanted for cheating, and forging documents in a 2007 case had kept giving cops the slip for four years. The woman, Kulwant Kaur of Mohalla Gurbakhsh Colony of Patiala, was declared a proclaimed offender in 2017 by the court. She was arrested by the PO staff of Ludhiana police on Friday.Consultant psychologist Dr Rajiv Sharma said materialism has affected everyone and women are no exception. “Such incidents happen for a reason. Money is a strong incitement for most crime. It has often been seen that illicit relations and personal grudges have also led women down the path of crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/women-rapidly-gaining-ground-in-criminal-activity-in-ludhiana-101629574031672.html

Pending a doctor’s report, the police are verifying whether she was killed or died by suicide.The doctors at Sassoon General Hospital have preserved the viscera of the woman as the initial postmortem was inconclusive for identification of cause of death. “They had been married only four months ago and lived with his parents. They are low-income group people, and everyone was at work when it happened. “So, there are no witnesses so far. The husband is on the run and so we suspect him,” said senior police inspector Devidas Gheware of Sinhgad road police station. However, the police have suspicion as the husband was nowhere to be found since the woman’s death. The families of both of them have lived in Janata Vasahat for a long time. However, the man’s family had moved to Sinhgad road area after their wedding as the space in their earlier house was not enough for four people, according to the police authorities. There were marks on the woman’s neck that have raised suspicion of the police. However, the doctors have not been able to tell whether they were caused by suicide or murder. Therefore, they informed the police and lodged a medico legal case.

22-08-2021||Lucknow||Kalyan Singh, BJP’s first chief minister in UP, dies||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, who formed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s first government in the state in 1991, died of sepsis and multi-organ failure at Lucknow’s Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences on Saturday, the hospital said in a statement late at night. He was 89.“Former Chief Minister of UP and Ex-Governor of Rajasthan Kalyan Singh Ji breathed his last today. He died due to sepsis and multi-organ failure,” said a statement by the hospital. The BJP stalwart was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit on July 4 due to an infection and reduced consciousness level.Singh, who was accused of criminal conspiracy in the Babri Masjid demolition case for it was during his tenure as chief minister that the 16th century mosque was demolished, also served as the Rajasthan governor between 2014 and 2015.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that coming generations will remain forever grateful to Singh for his contributions towards India’s “cultural regeneration”.“Kalyan Singh Ji gave voice to crores of people belonging to the marginalised sections of society. He made numerous efforts towards the empowerment of farmers, youngsters and women,” he said in a tweet.Singh was firmly rooted in Indian values and took pride in its centuries-old traditions, the PM said and lauded him as a “statesman, veteran administrator, grassroots level leader and great human”.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who rushed to SGPGI soon after Singh’s death, announced a three-day mourning in the state.“It is an irreparable loss for all of us. We have lost a great leader,” the chief minister said. “The body of the great leader would be taken from the hospital to his Mall Avenue residence and from where on Sunday his body would be kept at the Vidhan Bhawan as well as the UP BJP office,” the CM said.Appointed the BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit chief after the demise of the party’s first state chief Madhav Prasad Tripathi in 1984, Singh was tasked with countering the Mandal agitation that the BJP’s ideological fount Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh feared would divide the Hindus on the basis of caste.Recalling Singh’s appointment by the late RSS leader Bhaurao Deoras, former state minister Rajendra Tiwari said, “Deoras told Kalyan to start holding meetings across the state... I remember the late RSS leader telling Kalyan, ataichi uthao aur sabhayein karon .. (pack your suitcase and start visiting the state to hold meetings).”During his tenure as the party chief, the state witnessed the rise of two powerful but ideologically opposite OBC leaders – Singh and Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.Hailed by many for his administrative acumen, the influential OBC leader from western UP parted ways twice with the BJP and briefly floated his own outfits.While he returned to the BJP ahead of the 2004 general elections after leaving it for the first time in 1999, his second parting was in 2009, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, when he said he felt “humiliated” by the party. Singh said it was a “political blunder” to have rejoined the BJP.Born on January 5, 1932, Kalyan Singh first became an MLA in 1967. Since then, he won the assembly polls several times, held important posts in the BJP and was appointed Rajasthan governor in the last phase of his public life.But it was the fall of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, after the Sangh Parivar campaign to build a Ram temple at the spot gained momentum, that became the defining moment of Singh’s two stints as the UP chief minister.Admitting his failure to protect the mosque, he resigned the same evening. The state assembly was dissolved as riots erupted at several places in the country.In the November 1993 assembly election, Singh contested from two seats — Atrauli and Kasganj — and won both. But he got his second shot at the top post in September 1997, becoming CM again under a six-month rotation formula with the Bahujan Samaj Party.Even as the Babri Masjid demolition case trial dragged on, with several senior BJP leaders named as accused, Singh enjoyed immunity from trial as he held a gubernatorial post.After demitting office as Rajasthan governor, he appeared before the CBI court which pronounced its order in September 2020, acquitting him and 31 others accused of conspiracy to demolish the mosque.The judge concluded that there was no evidence to show that the demolition was pre-planned.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/kalyan-singh-bjp-s-first-chief-minister-in-up-dies-101629572532574.html

Saints of Ayodhya firmly believe that Ram temple could not have come up had Kalyan Singh not been chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the disputed structure was razed by karsevaks on December 6, 1992. Expressing grief over the demise of Kalyan Singh, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust said: “The doyen of Ram temple movement has passed away.” “It is an extremely sad day for us. Before Ram temple could come up at Ram Janmabhoomi, Kalyan Singh went for his heavenly abode,” added Nritya Gopal Das. Champat Rai, general secretary of the Trust, said: “Kalyan Singh took complete responsibility for whatever happened in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. He had the courage to own up for all events that occurred in Ayodhya on December 6.” Mahant Dhinendra Das, head of the Nirmohi Akhara, said: “With the death of Kalyan Singh, an important chapter of the Ram temple movement has come to an end.” “Kalyan Singh had preferred to resign from the chief ministership instead of using force to stop karsevaks (on December 6),” added Dhinendra Das. He was talking about the December 6, 1992, events in Ayodhya when the disputed Babri Masjid structure was demolished by karsevaks. Mahant Kamal Nayan Das, successor designate to Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, said: “Kalyan Singh was the one who had paved the way for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. Had Kalyan Singh not been the CM of Uttar Pradesh (on December 6, 1992), Ram temple would been a distant dream even today.” Kalyan Singh had close association with the Mani Ram Das Chhavi Peeth, the math in Ayodhya from where all important decisions related with Ram temple are taken. Mahant Nritya Gopal Das is head of this math. Karsevakpuram in Ayodhya, the epicentre of Ram Mandir movement, paid tributes to the former Uttar Pradesh CM as news of his demise reached there. “It is a sad day for us. I wish Kalyan Singh had lived longer to see Ram temple come up in Ayodhya for which he had preferred to resign from the CM’s post instead of stopping karsevaks (on December 6, 1992), said Sharad Sharma, regional spokesperson, VHP, who operates from Karsevakpuram, Ayodhya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ram-temple-possible-today-only-due-to-kalyan-singh-ayodhya-saints-101629572711825.html

22-08-2021||Delhi||Central agencies told to file false cases against 15 politicians: Manish Sisodia||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia alleged on Saturday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to “conduct raids and file fake FIRs” against 15 political leaders, including those from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), ahead of the next year’s state elections.Sisodia alleged that Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana was engaged to conduct probes and raids, and file cases against the 15 politicians. He, however, did not name the leaders.“We have learnt through reliable sources that PM Narendra Modi has handed over a list of 15 persons to the CBI, ED and Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana, for them to be raided, and false cases filed against them, especially in the light of upcoming assembly elections,” Sisodia said in a digital news briefing.“These agencies have been directed to destroy the 15 individuals, which include several leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party, who are seen as a threat by the BJP because of their excellent work and popularity among masses,” the deputy chief minister added.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made similar allegations and said nothing had come out of the previous raids or “fake cases”.In a tweet in Hindi on Saturday, Kejriwal said: “Do politics of votes and win the trust of people. There were so many fake cases filed against us and raids conducted but you got nothing. You want to file more fake cases and carry out raids? You are welcome.”During the briefing, Sisodia said: “Mr Asthana is Modi ji’s brahmastra (biggest weapon). He has been asked to destroy those people named in the list. We have learnt all that from reliable sources. The AAP believes in the politics of honesty. You send police, income tax officers, ED, or CBI, we welcome all of them. Do as many probes and raids as you want. We won’t step back.”BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said: “The Aam Aadmi Party has become Bahut Corrupt Party. AAP was founded on the plank of eradicating corruption but today it is facing serious corruption charges. Rather than throwing muck at the central government and the investigating agencies, AAP should come clean for the sake of probity and propriety.”The Union home ministry and Delhi Police commissioner Asthana’s office did not respond to requests for comment over Sisodia’s remarks.“But we ask you one thing: what happened to the past raids – what has been their outcome? My house was raided twice. Satyendar Jain has 12 false cases registered against him. As many as 21 AAP leaders were arrested and jailed and, later, in several cases, Delhi Police was reprimanded by courts for pressing frivolous charges,” said Sisodia.He added: “Delhi chief minister’s office and residence were raided. AAP is gaining popularity in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa and Uttarakhand. Some of these states are BJP strongholds. It has apparently shaken BJP leaders. I want to tell the Prime Minister to engage in a fair competition. How long will he keep taking help of CBI, ED, Rakesh Asthana, and others to intimidate others?”Hitting out at Sisodia’s remarks, Bhatia said: “CBI was a caged parrot under the Congress, under the NDA government all investigating agencies have complete autonomy, they act as per law and independently. Let all matters be thoroughly investigated.”Meanwhile, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta asked deputy chief minister Sisodia to “identify the sources” in his allegations or “offer apology to the central government” and be prepared to face a people’s protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/central-agencies-told-to-file-false-cases-against-15-politicians-manish-sisodia-101629572145011.html
22-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s oxygen stock has not improved significantly: Uddhav||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday cautioned that the state’s medical oxygen stock has not significantly improved and added that if the state’s daily demand touches 700 metric tonnes (MT) then the government will look at a complete lockdown. Meanwhile, the state added 4,575 fresh infections on Saturday, taking the total to 6,420,510. The state also added 145 fatalities, pushing the toll to 135,817. The active cases in the state stood at 53,967. Mumbai, meanwhile, added 262 new cases and five fatalities.Mumbai’s tally rose to 740,870, while its active cases went under 3,000, at 2,988. Mumbai’s death toll rose to 15,946.Thackeray, who inaugurating a paediatric Covid-19 care centre in suburban Santacruz, appealed to people to not let their guard down and reminded that that the Covid-19 pandemic is still not over and that “people should behave responsibly”. He also said that political parties should not carry out programmes that would endanger the lives of citizens.Senior government officials said that the state’s current demand for medical oxygen is about 450MT daily for Covid and non-Covid patients. “The daily demand for Covid patients is 200MT and for non-Covid patients it is 250MT today. We have been able to increase our daily production from 1,700MT to about 2,100MT,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity. As per estimates, if the third wave hits the state with more intensity than the previous one, then about 4,000MT of medical grade oxygen will be required daily. Thackeray expressed his concern in this context. “The threat of Covid hasn’t passed so far. If we do not follow Covid protocols and create crowding then it will possibly expedite the onset of the third wave [of covid infection]. I will again say this that our oxygen stock has not improved significantly. [So,] when we touch [the daily demand of] 700MT for Covid patients, we will probably have to introduce a complete lockdown,” Thackeray said, while speaking to reporters on Saturday.With increasing instances of crowding, traffic congestion, and political programmes, chief minister said that the relaxations were given to keep the economic cycle moving. “Don’t forget that Covid-19 restrictions have been eased to keep the economic cycle moving. People should not fall prey to any kind of provocation, which may endanger their lives and those of others,” he said.He added, “I appeal to all the people in the state that they shouldn’t act in manner that would affect their health or others. I appeal to political parties, social and religious organisations that they shouldn’t do things that would endanger the lives of the citizens.” The daily rise in infections and the deaths due to Covid-19 need to be brought down, he said. Experts had voiced concern that a third wave could affect children the most, therefore the government set up a paediatric Covid-19 task force, Thackeray said. Thackeray inaugurated a 30-bed dedicated paediatric Covid care centre at the IT Park on Mumbai University’s Kalina Campus on Saturday. Doctors from the paediatric unit of VN Desai Municipal Hospital and a private one will provide treatment to children at the centre.The centre is spread over 5,000 sq ft and will treat children below 12 years. Facilities for parent or guardians to accompany the child have also been made at the facility. It houses isolation areas, treatment sections, a breastfeeding room, play and an entertainment area for children.The dedicated centre has been launched as a preparedness measure as it is anticipated that the possible third wave of Covid-19 may hit children in large numbers. The civic body will assess each Covid positive case, assign beds through 24 war wardrooms--as done in the case of adults.A dedicated paediatric Covid-19 ward for children below 12 years has also been planned at the NESCO jumbo Covid centre in Goregaon East. The facility will be equipped with nearly 700 beds, including 300 for paediatric care. It will also include a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with 25 beds each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-oxygen-stock-has-not-improved-significantly-uddhav-101629572291921.html

I am confident that within the next one-and-a-half month, the classroom work will be complete,” Mohol said.The PMC is trying its best to start the medical college from this academic year itself. After the B J Medical College, this will be the second government medical college in the city.

22-08-2021||Pune||Third gender left out of vaccination drive; superstitions, misbeliefs keep their numbers low||Pune: Only a nominal number of 570 people who identify themselves as the third gender has received the Covid vaccine out of close to 1,000 such beneficiaries in the district. A major reason as to why people from the third gender, which includes transgenders, hijras and other communities, is superstition and mis-beliefs which also stems from lack of education within the community. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) along with a private hospital has organised a three-day special drive for people from the transgender community on July 14 this year. The Serum Institute of India’s (SII) CEO, Adar Poonawalla too had appealed to ensure vaccination for the community. Still, despite such efforts, the vaccine hesitancy within the third gender community still needs to be addressed. As per the district health office, only 570 third gender beneficiaries have got Covid-19 vaccine of which 290 are from Pune city, 145 from PCMC and 135 from Pune rural. Under the special provisions and guidelines introduced by the central government and implemented by the district administration, people who identify themselves as the third gender can get anti-Covid vaccine. Dr Suryakant Devkar, PMC immunisation officer said, “To ensure smooth and easy access of Covid vaccine to the third gender, the civic body had collaborated with a private hospital and vaccinated more than 169 people on the first day. We expect to get more beneficiaries and we will take up more such drives, it is an ongoing process and we have also made sure that no person is denied of vaccination because of lack of documents.” On July 14, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had expressed his support to the cause by initiating a three-day drive at Sancheti Hospital. Bindumadhav Khire, founder of Samapathik Trust, said, “There is a lot of misconception and misbeliefs among the third gender community, especially the transgenders, regarding the vaccine. The transgenders believe that they might fall ill after the vaccine and as most of them are dependent on the daily wages, they do not want to lose their day’s wages. They have also got this perception that due to the breakthrough cases among those vaccinated there is no benefit in getting the vaccine and the hesitancy is also because of mis-conceptions that one might lose their life due to the vaccine. Even if they hear about one case where a person lost his or her life post vaccination, they become reluctant to get the jab. 290 might still seem like a large number especially considering the number of transgenders alone, however this includes both first and second dose and the term third gender is a very broad term and includes many sub categories, including hijras, transgender men and transgender women and the count of third genders people will cross a thousand in the district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/third-gender-left-out-of-vaccination-drive-superstitions-misbeliefs-keep-their-numbers-low-101629571810457.html
22-08-2021||Pune||Jewellers call for strike on Aug 23; government urges them to reconsider||PUNE: Jewellers in Maharashtra have called for a one-day statewide strike on August 23 to protest what they term as “penal provisions and arbitrary implementation of the hallmarking process with unique id (HUID) on jewellery by changing the Bureau of Indian Standards’ (BIS’) old yet simple system”. However the government on Saturday urged the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) to reconsider its decision to go on strike, asserting that the mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery in 50 days of its first phase of implementation has been a “grand success”. The Pune Saraf Association (PSA) claimed that the HUID is not concerned with the purity of jewellery and is against customers’ interests and the concept of ease-of-doing-business. The PSA stated that the process adopted for HUID is impractical and that it interferes with citizens’ data privacy and business secrecy.Fatechand Ranka, president of the PSA, said, “HUID is a destructive process and does not guarantee jewellers’ safety. Apart from HUID, elements such as cancellation of registration, penal provisions, and search and seizure will ultimately institute ‘inspector raj’ in the country. This is nothing but harassment of customers and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) jewellers.”Only 256 out of the 741 districts in India have been brought under the mandatory hallmarking system from June 16, 2021 and according to the PSA, the BIS does not have the infrastructure or control over hallmarking centres given that over 480 centres have been cancelled, suspended or de-recognised for fake/wrong hallmarking or sample failing between 2016 and 2020.Ranka said, “On failure of samples, jewellers face criminal liability or prosecution which is unconstitutional as the purity has been tested and stamped by third parties that are hallmarking centres.”While the system of marking on ornaments traditionally involves four stages namely, BIS logo, purity mark, house mark of hallmarking centre, and jeweller’s mark, the new mandate does not include the last two stages which according to jewellers will lead to future disputes at the time of remaking or selling the ornaments. According to the PSA, as the HUID system is very slow and takes five to 10 days to hallmark, industry production will come to a standstill and while it will be impossible to hallmark ornaments in just three to four years, the longer turnaround time of the manufacturer will result in loss of employment and increase in jewellery costs. Ranka said that due to the new draconian provision, the livelihoods of the gems and jewellery industry’s nearly five crore dependents will be at stake, and penal and criminal charges on jewellers who have not manufactured or hallmarked the jewellery and sold it like traders will eventually result in the winding up of business.Ranka said, “The industry’s demand that the Niti Aayog report on hallmarking be considered as a benchmark while framing the BIS Act has not been taken into consideration. Hallmarking should be based on point-of-sale as proposed by the jewellers while all other applications of storage, display, transit, and exhibit-to-sale etc. should be removed from the BIS Act and regulations. The industry has recommended that the standard for 22carat be increased from 916 to 918 as part of its commitment to offer quality jewellery to consumers.”Meanwhile, Pramod Kumar Tiwari, director general of the BIS, while addressing a press conference in Delhi on the progress made in hallmarking in India, said, “The hallmarking scheme is turning out to be a grand success, with more than 1 crore pieces of jewellery hallmarked in a short period of time.”Tiwari stressed that the scheme has been a grand success thanks to the jewellers’ support and cooperation which is demonstrated by the fact that the number of registered jewellers has increased to 91,603; the number of jewellery pieces received for hallmarking has increased to one crore and seventeen lakh; and the number of jewellery pieces hallmarked has increased to one crore and two lakh from July 1 to August 20, 2021.“The number of jewellers who sent their jewellery for hallmarking has increased from 5,145 (July 1 to July 15) to 14,349 (August 1 to 15) this year; and 861 AHCs have started hallmarking as per the HUID system,” Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jewellers-call-for-strike-on-aug-23-government-urges-them-to-reconsider-101629571630393.html

Among the said five ward offices, Hadapsar-Mundhwa and Aundh-Baner have the most number of active cases.As on August 18, the Pune Municipal Corporation registered 2,056 active Covid cases out of which 1,134 were from five ward offices namely Hadapsar- Mundhwa (273); Aundh-Baner (244); Kothrud-Bavdhan (218); Sinhagad road (213); and Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar (186). In the week ended August 11 as well, the Hadapsar-Mundhwa and Aundh-Baner ward offices had the most number of active cases.Pune Municipal Corporation officials said that all efforts are being taken to control the caseload in these areas. “We all know the effective steps to be taken to control the spread of the virus. We have increased testing in these wards where the number of active cases is high. We are emphasising on contact-tracing and timely treatment,” said Dr Sanjeev Vavre, assistant health officer, Pune Municipal Corporation.“In ward offices such as Hadapsar and Aundh, priority is being given to the vaccination of super-spreaders. We have also strengthened health facilities in these areas. Thorough contact-tracing is being done in these areas,” said Dr Ashish Bharati, head of the health department, Pune Municipal Corporation.Speaking on Friday, Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar had said that the number of tests should not drop under any condition. “Since the past four weeks, the positivity rate in Pune is declining. But under any condition, the number of tests should not decrease. If necessary, the administration should increase the number of tests,” Pawar had said.The ward office which had become a hotbed of covid during the first wave – Bhawani peth – is now recording the least number of cases daily. During the week from August 12 to August 18, ward offices including Bhawani peth, Kasaba-Vishrambaugh, Kondhwa-Yewalewadi and Dhole Patil recorded the least number of covid cases daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/five-pmc-ward-offices-account-for55-of-active-coronavirus-cases-in-city-101629571450340.html
22-08-2021||Pune||Close to 3.83 million eligible beneficiaries in Pune district yet to get first dose||Pune: Though Pune has been receiving a much higher vaccine dose than the rest of the smaller districts in the division and the rest of the state, almost 44% of the eligible beneficiaries are yet to get the first shot. The shortage of vaccine and the vaccine hesitancy in a significant number of people has resulted in a much larger portion of people yet to get the vaccine. Close to 3.83 million people are yet to get the first dose, according to the health officials. About 1.1 million eligible beneficiaries in Pune city, 0.9 million in PCMC and 1.8 million in rural Pune are yet to get their first shot which is about 40% of the eligible population from the district. This despite the fact that Pune gets a major chunk of the available vaccines. Most of the beneficiaries who are yet to get the vaccine belong to the 18-45% who are also the least fully vaccinated age group as only 4% of the 18-45 age group people are fully vaccinated. The estimated eligible population is based on the 2011 census which estimates that 3.33 million people are eligible to get the vaccine in the city, 1.83 million in PCMC and 3.60 million in PCMC. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, district immunisation officer said, “Our potential is to vaccinate many more people than the stock that we are getting now. We can vaccinate 1.5 people in a day if we get enough doses. Our demand is much more than the supply. We are supplying vaccines as much as possible as per the government guidelines to the age groups and the gap criteria between two doses.” Since the beginning of August this year, the Pune civic body had to shut down its vaccination centres on multiple days due to shortage of vaccines. Even as the economy opens up, many in the workforce belonging to the age group between 18-45, are yet to get even their first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/close-to-3-83-million-eligible-beneficiaries-in-pune-district-yet-to-get-first-dose-101629571210244.html

22-08-2021||Delhi||27-year-old man who set himself afire near Supreme Court dies||A man who set himself on fire, along with a 24-year-old woman, outside the Supreme Court last week, succumbed to his injuries at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital on Saturday morning. The two were admitted to the burns ward of the central Delhi hospital after trying to self-immolate outside gate D of the apex court on August 16. The woman is currently being treated at the facility and doctors said she has sustained 80% burn injuries.The woman on May 1, 2019, filed a rape case against Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) parliamentarian Atul Rai at a Varanasi police station, for which he was imprisoned, and is still behind bars.The 27-year-old-man who died on Saturday and the woman were college mates.The police said that a preliminary investigation revealed that he was a witness in the case against Rai. His family did not wish to comment on his death.Doctors told police the man had critical burn injuries and was on ventilator support.On the afternoon of August 16, the two relayed a live video from outside the Supreme Court, before pouring kerosene on themselves and setting themselves on fire.In the video, the woman accused at least five senior Uttar Pradesh police officers of harassing her to save the parliamentarian. The woman also alleged that she was framed in a fake incident for filing a case against the BSP politician.The woman alleged that Rai raped her in his house on March 5, when he invited her on the pretext of meeting his wife.The woman in her complaint also alleged that Rai made a video of the act and threatened to make it public it if she approached the police.The UP Police have said that Rai was arrested after the woman’s complaint and a charge sheet filed against him.In the Facebook video, the woman said she was harassed for filing the complaint.The Delhi Police have not filed any case in the matter.A senior Delhi Police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “The two were not fit for statement. The Uttar Pradesh Police also came to the hospital to take their statements but could not. The UP Police are investigating the cases she had filed. Meanwhile, we are waiting to take the woman’s statement. If she is not able to give her statement, we can also use the video she relayed to start the investigation.”Initial investigations showed that Rai’s brother, Pawan Kumar, filed a case against her in November 2020 at a Varanasi police station, accusing her of forging her birth record. Earlier this month, a local court in Varanasi issued a non-bailable warrant against her.Kumar refused to comment on the matter, saying the case was sub-judice.Earlier this year, the woman also approached the Supreme Court seeking a transfer of the case against Rai from Uttar Pradesh to a Delhi court. The Supreme Court on March 9 stayed the trial and issued a notice to the jailed MP.On August 17, the Uttar Pradesh government formed a two-member team headed by an officer of director-general rank to probe all the FIRs pertaining to the rape survivor and her associate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/27yearold-man-who-set-himself-afire-near-supreme-court-dies-101629570310094.html
22-08-2021||Delhi||Authorities’ tall claims go under water again as rain brings Delhi to its knees||The city was brought to its knees on Saturday by six hours of rainfall between 2.30am and 8.30am that threw traffic into disarray and inundated several key stretches and underpasses, exposing how badly the national capital needs a comprehensive drainage plan as well a meticulous plan to ensure that local drains are cleaned properly ahead of monsoon that are managed by a multitude of agencies across the city.Saturday’s scenes --- people stuck in long traffic jams on roads that were turned into ponds -- were nothing new for its over 20 million residents.The Minto Bridge, which is an annual pain point for the Capital, was finally flooded on Saturday despite the authorities putting in place a new drainage mechanism there which had kept it dry during the rains over the past couple of months. Authorities barricaded the road below the bridge, where a man drowned last year.Nobody drowned anywhere on Saturday but a 60-year-old man in east Delhi died of electrocution.Despite the state Public Works Departments (PWD) and Delhi’s three municipal agencies claiming they completed this season’s desilting process, commuters shared on social media photographs of water-logged roads and traffic.Despite several roads and localities going under rainwater in south Delhi, SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan compared scenes of water-logging in the city to Venice and blamed the Delhi government for the day’s events. The Delhi government did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In the last 24 hours, Delhi received 138mm rainfall – the highest 24-hour record for the month in the last 14 years.BS Vohra, president, Federation of East Delhi RWAs, said that streets in parts of east Delhi were filled with at least two-feet-deep rainwater. “Every year whenever there is heavy rain, residents waded through the streets. There has been no solution for decades to this mess,” said Vohra.Places such as Laxmi Nagar and Krishna Nagar in East Delhi were waterlogged almost throughout the day.East Delhi mayor Shyam Sundar Agrawal said, “This is mainly because of the bigger drains under the Delhi government that have been choked for years. The stormwater drains are all choked, which even with the slightest rainfall overflow into the small drains inundating roads in residential colonies,” said Agrawal.In many trans-Yamuna areas, water even reached the ground floor of houses.Besides major roads, streets in residential areas too had knee-deep water making it difficult for residents to wade through the accumulated rainwater. This includes areas such as Munirka, Alaknanda, CR Park, Panchsheel Enclave, Saket, Jangpura, Kalkaji, Sukhdev Vihar, Lajpat Nagar, Govindpuri, Nizamuddin, Punjabi Bagh, Karol Bagh, Krishna Nagar, Patparganj, Laxmi Nagar, Preet Vihar, Sadar Bazar, Rohini Kamla Nagar,Vikapuri and Najafgarh, among others.The massive waterlogging across the city also led to blame game over desilting of drains with the municipal corporations alleging that roads under the Delhi government’s PWD were affected.“All the arterial roads and underpasses are with the PWD, which has completely failed to curb the problem. The waterlogging in residential areas too is a result of overflowing storm water drains under the PWD, which flood the smaller drain that fall under the corporations thus inundating colony roads,” said Suryan.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.Delhi’s three civic agencies are run by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while PWD comes under the Delhi government run by the Aam Aadmi Party.Last month, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government will redesign the city’s drainage system to provide a lasting solution to the annual problem of flooding on roads.By 7.30am the Delhi traffic police had placed barricades on the road below the Minto bridge. It was the first time this season that the road was blocked.The traffic police set in place diversions which confused most commuters. The barricades were removed only after 10am. The Delhi Traffic Police tweeted an alert at around 7:30 am that read, “Traffic movement on Minto Bridge (both carriageway) has been closed due to water logging. Please avoid stretch.”Explaining why the Minto underpass was waterlogged again, a senior PWD official said even though it rained through the night, the situation at Minto bridge underpass was normal until 7am when the water level suddenly started to rise and eventually there was slight waterlogging in the underpass area. This happened when the water from the Delhi Jal Board line started overflowing and the excess water started accumulating on the road.“The line carries both rainwater and sewerage and the sewerage increases in the morning as people start using the water in their homes. This is an automatic process and happens every day just that it rained heavily today and could not be averted. This choked the line and led to an overflow. However, PWD had stationed three suction pumps in the area, which helped us to immediately clear the stretch for traffic,” said a PWD official.The official said that the depth of water under the Minto Bridge, went up to around 350mm but subsiding eventually. Earlier this year, the PWD laid a new pipeline for pressurised flow. Last year, a 56-year-old man died at Minto bridge underpass after his mini-truck submerged there while he was trying to cross it. Not just this, there have been several such incidents at this place in the past few years as well.A PWD official, who asked not to be named, said, “We have set up multiple suction pumps at various places but due to excessive rain, there’s water-logging on certain points. We have been working throughout the night and through the day to ensure the roads aren’t clogged and to clear out waterlogged roads, wherever there are any,” said an official.A PWD official said that they cancelled all leave for people from the entire department.It took west Delhi resident Gaurav Patel three hours to take his mother to a hospital in Gurugram, a trip that takes less than an hour.“Since there was a dry spell for almost two weeks, I decided to take my mother to the hospital in Gurugram. I stay in Hari Nagar. It would have otherwise been a one-hour drive from here, but it took us over three hours to get there. Starting from Pankha Road to Dhaula Kuan to the Ring road, every place was blocked. Traffic came to a standstill. I feel some things never change and water-logging on Delhi roads is one such thing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/authorities-tall-claims-go-under-water-again-as-rain-brings-delhi-to-its-knees-101629570190716.html
22-08-2021||Gurugram||Moderate rainfall leaves roads bursting at the seams||Around 39mm of continuous rainfall for five hours on Saturday morning left several parts of the city waterlogged, with traffic police issuing social media updates for commuters to avoid waterlogged stretches.Despite the moderate rainfall, several stretches and key junctions of Iffco Chowk, Sheetla Mata Road, MDI Chowk, AIT Chowk on Golf Course Road, Hamilton Court Road, Jwala Mill Road, Basai Road, Pasco traffic signal and Bristol Chowk were severely inundated. Commuters faced problems in reaching their destinations, even as the traffic police said that there were no traffic jams due to a lower volume of vehicles on roads during the weekend.According to a weather bulletin issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) of Chandigarh, Gurugram received 34mm of rainfall over the past 24 hours till 8.30am on Saturday and 5mm of rainfall later in the day.The rainfall started around 4am and continued till 9am, following which another heavy spell was recorded between 6pm and 6.30pm on Saturday. The rainfall continued to keep the maximum and minimum temperatures two degrees below the normal, at 31.4°C and 23.8°C, respectively.According to the IMD’s forecast, Gurugram will have a “generally cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers” on Sunday and Monday. From Tuesday, the skies are expected to clear up.On Saturday, the Gurugram traffic police cautioned commuters to avoid the waterlogged stretches and plan their travel accordingly. Besides the key stretches, heavy waterlogging was also reported on the dividing road of sectors 3 and 5, Sushant Lok-1, Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, and Rezangla Chowk-Sector 5 stretch.Although susceptible to waterlogging, the Iffco Chowk junction had far higher rainwater accumulation than usual despite moderate rainfall and was the worst-affected area on Saturday.Passengers boarding interstate buses from the junction carried their luggage on their heads while navigating their way to the bus stop amid knee-deep rainwater. Such was the extent of waterlogging at certain points that vehicular movement on the carriageway was restricted to just one lane.“I cross Iffco Chowk almost on a daily basis. However, today’s waterlogging was the worst this season. It was almost inexplicable as the city has received much higher rainfall this monsoon, but the waterlogging situation was far better. Due to the waterlogging, I opted to drive through Cyber City to reach the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway,” said Manish Sinha, a resident of Sector 28.Officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that rainwater was cleared from all major stretches by noon. “By noon, most roads across the city were completely clear of rainwater, barring one carriageway of the sector 3/5 diving road, and the Rezangla Chowk-Sector 5 stretch,” said Pardeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.Kumar said that a 100-metre section of the sector 3/5 dividing road is located on a depression, due to which the carriageway towards the railway road was filled with rainwater till 3pm. A similar situation was observed at the Rezangla Chowk-Sector 5 stretch in patches.“Using motor pumps and suction tankers, we were able to drain out rainwater by 3pm at both these points. Regarding waterlogging at Iffco Chowk, I have asked officials concerned for an explanation,” said Kumar.According to a senior GMDA official privy to the matter, the motor pumps near Iffco Chowk may have been turned on after heavy rainwater accumulation or that the passage to the master drain near the junction may have been hampered by a rock or silt deposition.Traffic police officials could be seen diverting vehicles at the junction through the limited road space available.Ravinder Singh Tomar, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that around 1,100 traffic police officials were deployed across the city roads. “Due to the weekend, traffic volume across the city was far lower than usual and as such, we did not report any difficulty or congestion from any of the stretches. We are closely monitoring the rain situation, until the next dry spell,” said Tomar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/moderate-rainfall-leaves-roads-bursting-at-the-seams-101629568690662.html
22-08-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: When we had to “kiss” bye to a “bold” scene...||This will be the last in the series of articles on “Amar Photo Studio”. It has been an excellent experience for me to document it and I have realised that every play needs to go through this process. Whether the play does well or not is an unrelated topic. I used to have a habit of maintaining a diary for documenting the process of every play. It seems that over a period of time, I have forgotten that. I need to recommence this habit. As those of you who have been following this article series would know, that the play “Amar Photo Studio” opened in 2016 and is still running in theatres (by that I mean that whenever theatres will reopen, we will start performing it again). “Amar Photo Studio” was met with tremendous love in its opening run. The real time reactions were as good as they can get. And reading the reviews had become a complete confidence booster. Many audience members used to leave reviews and ratings on our social media page too. While many makers abstain from reading reviews (I do that too usually), I made an exception this time around because of the overwhelming response. But we all noticed one thing, especially during our initial performances. The word “bold” was used frequently in the reviews. Also, whenever friends, family and other audience members used to come to visit us post the show, we used to notice the use of word “bold” in almost every conversation. While we understood that “bold” could mean many things, the connotation in the context of Indian films or theatre usually means one thing – close to vulgarity. Had we done this intentionally, we wouldn’t have thought much about it. But since we hadn’t, this word started troubling us. When we asked a few audience members what part of the play they felt was “bold”, they couldn’t pinpoint it. We could have just ignored it, but word of mouth is extremely important for the commercial success of a play. And I am sure that we all are aware that many people form conclusions about a movie or a play even before watching it! I find it surprising that so many films are mired in controversies even before they release! Anyway, I digress. The team put their heads together to figure this out as it could be a potential commercial hazard. We combed through every scene and came up with a few instances which might be the reason for this – there were three cuss words used during the entire play and one short kiss at the end of it. But instead of taking them out altogether, we conducted a short informal survey. Whenever we had a personal discussion with anyone we knew who called it “bold”, we used to ask them pointed questions about the words and the kiss. And finally, when we had the results of the survey, we had our “culprit” – it was the kiss. All of us were very surprised with this! The act of the protagonists kissing each other at the end of the play seemed natural. They were apart throughout the entirety of the play and had travelled to different time eras to realise their love for each other. Now that they were meeting each other after travelling through time, it felt that it was the right way to express their feelings for each other, instead of using words. I also felt that as an audience, we must have gotten used to watching a kiss without getting uncomfortable. I listed all these points to my producers but they were of the opinion of performing a few shows without the kiss and noting the audience reactions. I relented, and sure enough, the word “bold” started fading away! This was a learning experience for me. Audience members come with certain expectations when they come to watch a play.The same audience wouldn’t mind this while watching an English or a Hindi film (or even a Marathi film nowadays). But for a play, it is still a no. I sometimes wonder what would have happened had we still kept it. Would this play not have done as well as it did? I guess I will never know... ... Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-when-we-had-to-kiss-bye-to-a-bold-scene-101629551888176.html
22-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column | The good old days of ‘pay parades’||Rummaging through old papers, I was taken back to the days when as a barsaati Captain and I was always detailed to distribute pay to the men in my unit. Each time I use soft options for money transactions, nostalgia for the simple days of 1964 envelopes me. Every unit had the pay-distribution standard operating procedure prominently displayed in the adjutant’s office. Men and officers waited for the all-important pay-day — the men for the small amounts they would money-order to their homes and officers for the fun and useful reality check the exercise provided.Pay and accounts of soldiers were managed by the controller of defence accounts (CDA), Allahabad, that had its offices in the regimental centres, record offices and other major establishments for ease of functioning. Entitlement of the men according to their ranks, trade, qualifications etc was worked out and the approximate amount sent to the units well in time before the end of the month. The subedar major (SM) or some other senior JCO was the custodian of the money that was kept in the treasury in unit quarter guard (QG). The officer detailed for the pay distribution duty would carry the requisition to the QG and draw the amount worked out earlier for his unit or sub-unit from the SM or other JCO performing the duty of the treasurer. Acquittance-rolls showing details of credits and debits of each soldier were prepared and reconciled by CDA once in a quarter with the statement of accounts they sent to the units. The officer would reach the fixed venue where men would have already been lined up under the supervision of the company havildar major (CHM). The soldier had the liberty to draw whatever amount he wanted out of the total amount in his credit after deduction of provident fund and the balance, if any, was carried forward. Each printed or cyclostyled acquittance roll had six to 10 names and every recipient signed in front of his name for the amount received. At the end of each roll was an undertaking which the officer signed certifying that he had paid the above amount to the men as per their entitlement. The officer again signed the summary prepared at the end.Depending on the strength of the unit, the entire exercise for a company-size unit took just about three hours as the total amount to be distributed was never more than ₹20,000, even when the currency notes were largely in denomination of 100s and 10s. Once in a while, some company commander or commanding officer insisted on making the payments himself to remain connected with the men and junior officers like me assisted him. Sometimes, silly mistakes in counting and distribution resulted in hilarious situations and a little light laughter is always good for bonding.Physical distribution of pay was, perhaps, one of the best methods of one-to-one interaction of men with their officers and JCOs. The officer invariably talked to the soldier in a cordial and friendly manner about his leave and promotion and enquired about the well-being of his family before handing over the currency notes and coins. Everyone seemed to be in a joyous and happy mood and the officers could feel the pulse of their troops and knew exactly the state of their morale; and if there was any discontent brewing it was nipped in the bud.Soldiers’ broad smiles of gratitude and smart salutes would give the instant feedback that all was well in the unit. In fact, it was far better a method of man-management than the sainik sammelan or durbar which was formal in nature and more of a monthly ritual. Admittedly, the procedure of calculating dues of every soldier was cumbersome and tedious but it had its own benefits. Today’s faceless, emotionless and cashless transactions of transferring pay in the bank accounts of the men may be convenient but it has deprived the officer community of the ‘back-to-basics’ approach of time-tested management, giving rise to many problems. Alas, today’s officers don’t have the luxury of such a personal contact with their men. colcheema1942@gmail.com(The writer is a Panchkula-based retired army officer)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-good-old-days-of-pay-parades-101629545467853.html
