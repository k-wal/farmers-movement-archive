31-08-2021||Mumbai||OBC reservation row in Maharashtra: Defer local body polls, says NCP||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) wants the elections to the local bodies to be deferred until the issue of Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation is resolved. The issue was discussed in a meeting of party ministers led by NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday. Pawar also asked the ministers to be careful and legally deal with the action by the central investigation agencies. The NCP is part of a three-party coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, along with the Shiv Sena and Congress. The elections are due early next year. “The NCP chief advised the party ministers to see how elections to the local bodies can be deferred until the OBC reservation issue is resolved,” said a senior minister. “The NCP is of the view that the elections should not be held until the OBC reservation is sorted. It was also discussed in today’s meeting,” said Nawab Malik, national spokesperson, NCP. On March 4, the Supreme Court ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not exceed the 50% quota cap mandated by it. It has directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission to collect empirical data, based on which the reservation for the community can be fixed. It also allowed the state election commission to hold local body polls without reservation for OBCs. The state cabinet, in its discussion last week, decided that the state election commission will be requested to defer the upcoming local body elections for a few months considering the threat of a third Covid wave. The state is also mulling amendments to laws related to the local bodies for OBC reservation. “A few ministers also raised the issue of action against MVA ministers by the central agencies. Pawar saheb advised us to be careful and legally deal with any action as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants to defame and create trouble for the MVA government,” said a senior minister. Many leaders and ministers from the MVA government are facing action by the central investigation agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED). After former home Anil Deshmukh and Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, the ED has issued summons to the state transport minister Anil Parab. The BJP has also sought a CBI probe against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar into the allegations made by controversial police officer Sachin Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obcreservation-row-in-maharashtra-defer-local-body-polls-says-ncp-101630434112893.html
31-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi University executive council gives final seal of approval for return of FYUP||New Delhi: Delhi University’s executive council (EC), the varsity’s highest decision-making body, on Tuesday passed a slew of academic reforms ratified by the academic council last week, including reintroducing the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP), which was scrapped in 2014 amid protests by teachers and students, and move to implement the 2020 National Education Policy (NEP) in the varsity from next year. Further, the university will also scrap MPhil from next year -- as per the NEP 2020 provisions -- and offer one- and two-year PG programmes from next year. “The one-year PG programme will be for students who have opted for four-year UG course. Students with three-year UG programme can opt for a two-year postgraduate programme from next academic session,” said EC member VS Negi.Three of the 20-member EC disagreed with the proposals on implementing NEP-based reforms. “NEP is blueprint for privatisation and commercialisation of education, its implementation in DU will lead to destruction of leading public funded universities of India… It willl adversely affect the workload of teachers leading to further contractualisation and retrenchment of teaching faculties,” said the dissent note issued by the three members.One of the EC members who submitted his dissent, advocate Ashok Agarwal, said it was “unfortunate” that a major restructuring was passed without responding to important issues raised by the members. “The merits of FYUP are not clear. Why should students pay for an additional year if the in-depth study of a discipline in a four-year UG course remains what it is today in a three-year undergraduate honours course,” he said.Two EC members also dissented on the tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between DU, Ministry of Education and University Grants Commission which was renewed this year. “Under this MoU, the university administration is committing to revise the fees of students, which will lead to fee hike in the situation of declining budgetary support in real terms. This will have far-reaching consequences in the public-funded universities like DU,” the note read.However, Negi, who is a member of the right-wing teachers’ group National Teachers’ Democratic Front, said pointed out that the NEP was “passed by the AC and accepted by the EC”. “It is an avenue for expansion of higher education, aiming at an increase in gross enrolment ratio by introducing flexibility in the curriculum. The University has enough time for preparation and implementation of the NEP-based provisions. Workload, funding and expansion issues are there and the university should be vigilant in implementing the NEP in such a way that the number of teaching positions and funding is safeguarded,” he said.In 2013, the university had introduced FYUP amid much fanfare as a pet project of the then vice-chancellor (V-C) Dinesh Singh. Following stiff opposition and protest from students and teachers, the programme was eventually rolled back in 2014.On August 24, the university’s academic council passed -- amid dissent from 16 elected representatives -- the agenda to start FYUP along with multiple entry-exit scheme (MEES) and academic bank of credits (ABC) from the next academic session.Under the FYUP programme, interested applicants will be allowed to choose from three UG options next year: a three-year honours programme, a four-year honours in a discipline or a four-year honours in a discipline with research.The MEES-ABC combination will allow students to exit the course at the end of any academic year with credits in their “academic bank account” and later redeem those credits to pursue the course at any other university which comes under the ambit of the ABC system.According to the policy document placed in the statutory bodies in DU, an entrance test will be conducted for lateral entry of students from other universities registered under the ABC system, whereas re-entry will be allowed for students of DU and its own colleges. The entry will be subject to the availability of infrastructural capacity in the institute.Calling for a wider consultation process with stakeholders, DUTA president Rajib Ray also said, “The FYUP structure with MEES will increase expenditure towards the undergraduate programme. Students leaving the system without finishing the programme will always be treated as dropouts by the job markets. MEES will only increase attrition rate giving a false sense of a degree.”During the Zero hour on Tuesday, the EC members held discussion on various matters including the delay in the release of grants in 12 Delhi government-funded colleges and the subsequent problems in disbursal of salaries, absorption of ad-hoc and temporary teachers, and demand for health card for all the teachers.EC members also discussed about providing financial assistance to students who lost their parents to Covid-19 and allowing appointments for foreign adjunct faculty to increase international collaborations in the university.Meanwhile, DU teachers’ association (DUTA) held an online demonstration to protest against the e-learning promoted through these reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-university-executive-council-gives-final-seal-of-approval-for-return-of-fyup-101630433813445.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED notice to CM Uddhav Thackeray’s aide; Shiv Sena unperturbed||After a brief lull, the tussle between former allies Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has re-commenced, with the central agencies “targeting” a minister of the Uddhav Thackeray-led government. This time, the situation is trickier as the minister in question is Anil Parab, who is in Thackeray’s inner circle and among his few close confidants within the Sena. However, Sena leadership is unperturbed by the development, party insiders claimed. Since last year, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sent notices to Sena leaders, including legislator Pratap Sarnaik, MP Sanjay Raut’s wife and MP Bhawana Gawali. Also, the BJP leaders have been targeting people close to Thackeray, including Milind Narvekar. Parab, who was served a notice by the ED on Sunday, did not appear before the officials on Tuesday citing prior engagements. Party insiders said the minister has responded to the ED notice through his lawyers and sought more time as the notice was served less than 48 hours before the time he was asked to remain present. A Sena leader said the action against him was expected after the Maharashtra government took action against union minister Narayan Rane last week. He said the new session of ED notices started after Rane’s arrest. When asked if Sena leaders are on the radar of investigation agencies, Raut said, “Let it be so. We know that defence ministry has radars to spot enemies. If the ED or BJP think that we are enemies of this country, they can continue to keep us as targets.” Parab is privy to financial and legal issues of the party and so has been targeted to get to Thackeray, Sena insiders said. Before the ED notice, Parab faced allegations from dismissed police inspector Sachin Vaze, who alleged the minister had instructed him to collect ₹50 crore from a trust facing an inquiry to close the probe. Allegations were also levelled against the transport minister by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya over a land deal for a resort in Ratnagiri district. Parab has already refuted the allegations. “Over the years, Parab has become one of the key persons in the party whom Uddhav ji has entrusted him with many responsibilities, including the by-poll where Sena candidate trounced Narayan Rane and 2017 BMC elections. Being a lawyer, he also looks at the key legal issues for the party and was also involved in the election affidavits for Aaditya and Uddhav ji,” a senior Sena leader said requesting anonymity. Narvekar also faced allegations of environmental violations to construct a sea-side bungalow in Ratnagiri’s Murud area. He demolished the sea-side bungalow on August 22. The charge against Narvekar was levelled by BJP’s Kirit Somaiya, who filed RTI queries related to it. Raut on Tuesday said, “This has a political colour and there is political pressure [behind such actions]. BJP leaders have put out a list of 10 leaders from Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress who will be summoned by the ED next. So, it this summons from BJP or ED?” He was referring to Somaiya’s tweet on August 30, where he listed the “Great 11 of Thackeray government”, including Sarnaik, Narvekar, Parab, Gawali, Kishori Pednekar, Ravindra Waikar, Yashwant Jadhav, Yamini Jadhav. Somaiya has also listed Anil Deshmukh, Chhagan Bhujbal and Jitendra Awhad on his tweet. With around five months to go for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections, the Sena is expecting such moves by the Centre. “Over the last year, there is a definite pattern to defame Shiv Sena and its leaders,” the Sena functionary added. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said, “The BJP wants to break Thackeray’s strength. It is a harsh reality that BJP grew because of Sena and with these three parties together, power could remain elusive for BJP.” Raut added that allegations by BJP or notices by central agencies will not have any adverse impact on the party’s chance in the local body polls. Though the Sena leadership is unperturbed by the recent action by the Central agency, it does not have a definite plan to counter the BJP. In the past, Sena has handled the Antilia-Sachin Vaze issue and allegations against former minister Sanjay Rathod poorly. Another party functionary said, “At times, the wait-and-watch approach does not always help in the day and age of social media.” Raut has reiterated that they too have list of BJP leaders involved in alleged wrongdoings, but have not acted or put out any documents in the public domain so far. State BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “The BJP has been taking up issues that directly affect people. We are not interested in targeting political leaders personally. Besides, the central agencies function independently. If they are not involved in any wrongdoings, then they should not be afraid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ed-notice-to-cm-uddhav-thackeray-s-aide-shiv-sena-unperturbed-101630433753076.html

31-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks details from Karnataka on plan to raise height of Almatti dam||After the announcement of raising the height of Almatti dam on Krishna river by the Karnataka government, the Maharashtra government has communicated with Karnataka for more details. The state government has apprehension that the rise in the water level in the dam could cause damage to the few villages in Sangli and Kolhapur that get affected by the backwater. Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai recently said that he was committed to raising the height of the dam by 5 ft and the notification will soon be issued. He said that he will soon visit Delhi for necessary legal formalities and he has held talks with leaders in the stakeholder states. This triggered the reaction in other stakeholder states including Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The swelling in the water stock in Almatti may cause a rise in the backwater in Krishna, Panchganga river in Sangli and Kolhapur causing losses to lives and properties.“We have got in touch with the additional chief secretary, water resources department of Karnataka, seeking details of the plan. No concrete decision has been taken by them and it’s just an announcement. Before any intervention related to inter-state rivers by any of the stakeholders the permission from the technical approval committee, Central Water Commission is mandatory,” said Vijay Kumar Gautam, officer on special duty, water resources department, Maharashtra.“The Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal award in 2013 has decided on the share of water between four states, now our worry is over the rise in water level in Krishna and potential threat to areas in a few districts here,” he added.“There is no need to react in a haste. After all, it is important to see, how much water is discharged from Almatti. We got very good cooperation this year during monsoon. We will decide our stand after due discussion with Karnataka,” said water resources minister Jayant Patil.According to the officers in the WRD, there is no concrete conclusion if the rise in height will cause damage in Maharashtra. “The Karnataka government has been very cooperative with us during flooding in Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur in 2019 and this year. The water was discharged from Almatti despite the level being below the parameter fixed under Reservoir Operation System. It helped us in reducing the water level in Krishan and Panchganga. Secondly, it has not been concluded scientifically if the raising of the height of Almatti could cause damages in Sangli, Kolhapur. As a stakeholder, we will anyway have the right to move court being a stakeholder, if the damage is expected to cause,” said another official on condition of anonymity.Built in 2005, the Almatti dam has a current height of 519 ft, which is proposed to be increased to 524 ft. This would help Karnataka increase its capacity to 160 TM from the current 135 TMC of water, resulting in bringing 6.22 lakh hectares under irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-details-from-karnataka-on-plan-to-raise-height-of-almatti-dam-101630433574668.html

The Akhara Parishad appeals to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah that the country should have such a law which helps in maintaining the crucial balance between communities,” said Giri in a recorded video communiqué issued on Tuesday. On the issue of some Muslim leaders supporting Taliban, Giri once again reiterated that government should take action against such Muslim religious leaders who are supporting Taliban. “The city of Kandahar in Afghanistan was once ruled by a Hindu king as is mentioned in our epic Mahabharata. However, today people of Hindu and Sikh communities have left Afghanistan which is a blatant example of what can happen in India too if the population balance of communities is not maintained,” he added. Giri also appealed to Muslim religious leaders to take action against those people, of their own community, who supported Taliban. “Those who support the terrorist organisation like Taliban should be treated as traitors and arrested. How can one speak in favour of an organisation which gets an open support of our enemy Pakistan?” questioned Giri. Welcoming CM Yogi Adityanath’s statement regarding implementing a ban on sale of liquor and meat in Mathura, ABAP president termed this a landmark move. While speaking at Krishnotsava-2021 programme at Mathura on Monday, CM Yogi Adityanath had announced a complete ban on the sale of liquor and meat in Mathura. He also suggested that those engaged in liquor and meat trade may take up selling milk in order to revive the glory of Mathura that was once known for producing huge quantity of milk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bring-up-like-population-control-bill-akhara-parishad-urges-centre-101630433092950.html

31-08-2021||Noida||Covid vaccination: GB Nagar achieves over 98% first dose coverage||More than 98% of those eligible to get the Covid-19 vaccine in Gautam Budh Nagar have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine so far, according to the data released by the district health department.Officials said while all eligible people in the district would get at least one dose by September, they would receive both doses by the end of November. Currently, Covid-19 vaccinations are open to everyone aged 18 years or more.The district administered 12,125 doses on Tuesday, taking the tally of those who have received at least one dose vaccine to 1,558,532, the data showed. A total of 1,589,615 people are eligible for vaccination in the district, the officials said.Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Sunil Sharma said now only about 31,000 eligible people are left to get their first shot, after which the district will achieve 100% first dose coverage. “If the vaccination drive continues at the same pace (about 12,000 doses a day), everyone in the district will get at least one dose vaccine by the end of September. But as we are regularly holding mega vaccination drives – usually once a week – this target is likely to be achieved much before that,” he said.The CMO also said now the district health department is focusing on administering second doses. “So far, we’ve administered as many as 495,785 second doses to beneficiaries, which is about 31% of those eligible. But we aim to administer both doses to 100% eligible population by November,” he said.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said the age group of 18-45 years is leading in terms of number of jabs. “Of the 2.05 million doses administered in the district so far, nearly 1.4 million have been administered to this age group.

Eight people were admitted to Jalpaiguri district hospital and Birpara state general hospital. The rest were released after treatment. Nobody suffered any critical injury, said police officers who visited the spot. The local administration announced two days ago that vaccines would be administered at Duramari Chandrakant High School in the Banarhat community block. A few hundred people gathered outside the school on Tuesday but the gates were not opened till around 10 am. “More than 300 people were waiting outside the school. When police and local panchayat members opened the gate these people rushed in. It led to a stampede,” said Bhabani Roy, an eyewitness. Deborshi Dutta, Jalpaiguri superintendent of police, said “The school authorities did not know about the camp. Possibly there was a communication gap. Police took the injured people to the hospital.” Moumita Godara Basu, the district magistrate, said “The block development officer of Banarhat has been asked to probe the incident and submit a report by Wednesday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/24-hurt-in-stampede-at-vaccination-camp-in-north-bengal-101630432674233.html

The district on Tuesday also completed administration of 21440 doses with the help of 74 government CVCs.Officials familiar with the development said that they have almost doubled the number of vaccination camps in Ghaziabad ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19.“We are taking help from eminent people, NGOs, and associations to hold more camps in rural and urban areas. We have increased the vaccination coverage with ‘near to home’ CVCs, and once we get the increased vaccine stock, more such camps will be set up,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for the Covid vaccination in the district.Out of the total 20,11,618 vaccine doses being administered so far, Ghaziabad has administered 4,24,707 second doses of vaccines (21.11%) of the overall vaccination.

He used to drive the car with an app-based cab aggregator in the National Capital Region (NCR). At 5pm on Monday, he got a booking from Tigri roundabout to Greater Noida’s Tilapta. “I was in Greater Noida West at that time.

When we reached the destination -- Tilapta -- the three persons again asked me to drive to Dadri’s Rupwas village. On reaching Rupwas village, the suspects suddenly tried to choke me with a rope around my neck. I raised an alarm... I managed to open the car’s door and come out,” Khan said.

31-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai set to complete giving 10 million doses||Nine months after Covid vaccination kicked off in the city on January 16, Mumbai will have administered 10 million doses next week. At the current pace, the target population in the 18-45 age group in Mumbai may get fully vaccinated by December or January. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said there cannot be any set date, as it depends on the supply. The vaccination started with health care workers, followed by frontline workers and senior citizens. Those above the age of 45 were vaccinated from March, while the drive for everyone above the age of 18 was rolled out in May. Mumbai witnessed a lot of ups and downs, with the vaccination drive getting suspended at public centres for over two dozen times due to unavailability of stock. According to the data, the BMC received 5,837,330 vaccine doses of both Covishield and Covaxin since January. A total of 9,305,662 vaccine doses – 8,535,275 doses of Covishield, 740,621 of Covaxin and 29,766 of Russia’s Sputnik – have been administered. A total of 2,489,854 citizens are fully vaccinated as of August 30. Of the total 9,305,662 doses, 4,082,682 have been administered at private hospitals, 496,793 state centres and the remaining 4,726,187 at civic-run vaccination centres. The BMC got the highest (996,860) vaccine doses in August, 983,390 doses in July and 739,190 in June. In May, the BMC got 523,440 vaccine doses, 947,500 in April, 810,950 in March, 571,000 in February and 265,000 in January 2021. In its budget for the ongoing fiscal, the BMC had said that eventually it will ultimately vaccinate 10 million citizens. This would mean that the BMC will have to administer 20 million doses to fully vaccinate 10 million citizens. As per Census 2021, the city’s population is 12.1 million. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “There is no fixed date as to when our vaccination drive will be completed. It all depends on the supply. However, currently over nine million vaccine doses are administered. Of this, we are assuming that around 20% are outsiders and the remaining 80% reside in Mumbai. The 20% also matter because if a person working in Mumbai but staying in nearby cities gets vaccinated in Mumbai, that makes the environment of our city safe. So, it is also important that the floating population of the city has access to the vaccine.” Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Be it Mumbai, Maharashtra or India, we are one of the fastest and rapidly vaccinating countries. I feel in the next two months, the situation will change and it will be better in terms of vaccination.” September is expected to have the highest supply, considering the maximum number of citizens in the 18-45 age group, who took the first dose in June, will now be eligible for their second dose. Of the total, first dose has been given to 4,027,701 in the 18-45 age group, 2,701,471 in the 45-59 age group, 1,799,061 aged 60 years and above and 735,463 health care and front-line workers. In the past one month, 3,146 bedridden citizens also have been administered vaccine doses. The BMC has also created separate categories for lactating mothers, physically and mentally challenged, pregnant women and those going abroad for work or study for vaccination. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-set-to-complete-giving-10-million-doses-101630432132782.html

31-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hingoli gets lowest doses; district’s vax coverage below state average||Hingoli in Marathawada region stands at the bottom of Maharashtra’s vaccination supply with merely 0.79% of the 47 million vaccine doses given to the district. The low supply of doses reflects in the district’s low vaccination coverage in the vulnerable 45 plus population- its coverage is around 32.73%, much lower than the state’s average of 51.26%. The district’s vaccination coverage in the 18-44 age category is 17.23% while the state’s average is 29.8%. According to the state estimates, Hingoli’s adult population is around 10.28 lakh. As of Tuesday, the district had received only 3.74 lakh doses. With limited supply, the district has managed to fully vaccinate only 54978 people in the 45 plus population and 9684 people in the 18-44 category. “The vaccination coverage is definitely at the lower end, but we have been receiving limited supply since the very beginning,” said Dr Shivaji Pawar, the district health officer of Hingoli. “We have been requesting the state authorities to increase our allotment for the past several months. Our supply had ranged between 3,000 to 4,000 doses every four days. Only on two days over the past week, we have received 32,000 and 30,000 doses at once,” he said. According to Pawar, the highest daily vaccination in Hingoli has been 13,000 doses. “We have a capacity of nearly 15,000 doses per day in the 113 vaccination centres. We need a weekly quota of at least 60,000 doses,” he said. The district has recorded over 18,400 Covid-19 cases and over 500 deaths to date. Over the past fortnight, Hingoli has been recording new cases in single digit including zero cases on a few days. “Since the number of cases is so low, we can use this time to increase the pace of vaccination and protect those who have not been infected,” said Pawar adding that he is hopeful that the vaccine supply to the district will increase in the coming days. A state health official said districts have been allotted vaccine doses in proportion to the population. “Occasionally, some districts have been allotted higher doses when they were seeing a surge in cases,” the official said. But health activists said that vaccine disparity is a major issue not just across states in India but also within the districts in the states. “The vaccine distribution is not always guided by epidemiological reasoning,” said Dr Abhijit More of Jan Arogya Abhiyan. “Often, socio-political factors play a major role,” he said. According to More, while big cities like Mumbai are rightly allotted a higher number of doses because of the population as well as the spread of the infection, the state must thrive to have a fair distribution model across districts. “Nearly 20% to 30% of the vaccine doses are being supplied through the private sector. The state must also work out distribution strategies and CSR models to route some vaccines to the districts with low coverage,” said More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrahingoli-gets-lowest-doses-district-s-vax-coverage-below-state-average-101630431893770.html

At least 150 citizens attended the meeting to interact with officials of the district administration, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), HSPCB and Ecogreen Energy, the MCG’s concessionaire for waste management.Among the key points raised by environmentalists and villagers was that the refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from the Bandhwari waste plant can be transported to the recently opened WTE in Sonepat for processing. Doctors opposed the project, citing health hazards, while residents also cited the example of three WTEs in Delhi being fined ₹5 lakh each for violating air pollution norms earlier this month.In addition, environmentalists also wanted a change in MCG’s localised composting strategy, from focussing on RWAs to setting up large-scale units in each ward. Around 1,800 tonnes of waste is transported from Gurugram and Faridabad to the Bandhwari landfill daily.“The main contention for building the WTE is for clearing legacy waste. The MCG should, instead, focus on strengthening its localised composting and recycling units. If both of these work at their optimum capacity, only 7-8% of the city’s waste would need to be dumped at the Bandhwari landfill,” said Vaishali Rana, a city-based environmentalist.Rana further brought up the point that the MCG should transport RDF to Sonepat, where a WTE project has been commissioned, and that the Haryana government should focus on increasing its capacity to process additional waste from Gurugram and Faridabad.“In terms of logistics, Sonepat is less than 100 kilometres away. The MCG and the Haryana government can transfer Bandhwari’s RDF to the existing Sonepat plant, which can be upgraded to process further waste instead of spending money on building a new one,” said Rana.The public hearing on Tuesday was the second one held regarding the project, after the first hearing was held in March 2018. Public hearings are a prerequisite for getting environmental clearance from the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEF&CC) for setting up a WTE project.With regard to the Bandhwari landfill, environmental clearance for setting up a 15 megawatt (MW) capacity WTE was granted in November 2019. The public hearing on Tuesday was held to discuss the proposed expansion of its capacity to 25 MW, besides general issues concerning a WTE plant.Ruchika Sethi, an environmentalist and representative of Citizens for Clean Air, a Gurugram-based citizens’ group to fight air pollution, said that the MCG needs to change its strategy of recycling, segregation, and processing of waste on a localised level.“Currently, all compost plants in the city are managed by RWAs within their townships, societies, and condominiums. The problem with such a strategy is that it does not take into account the waste generated by villages and small pockets of independent houses. Only 30% of the city’s total waste is generated in the RWA area. The MCG, instead, needs to set up large-scale composting and recycling units on a ward-wise basis,” said Sethi.Members of the Aravalli Bachao Group called for the public hearing to be declared “null and void” and instead, asked authorities to hold meetings with active citizens of Gurugram and Faridabad, along with solid waste management experts.“Cities such as Indore, Ambikapur in Chattisgarh, and towns in Kerala are managing their waste without creating toxic WTE plants. We want the authorities to call for a roundtable of active citizens of Gurugram and Faridabad and solid waste management experts from around the country to discuss sustainable models for the two cities,” said Neelam Ahluwalia, a member of the Aravalli Bachao Group.Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of Gurugram (North), HSPCB, who was one of the officials chairing the public hearing, said, “All opinions, suggestions, and concerns raised in today’s public hearing will be documented and sent to HSPCB headquarters in Panchkula for perusal. Subsequently, the application process for environmental clearance for the WTE project would be sent to MoEF along with the points raised in the public hearing. The entire process will take its due course of time.”A senior MCG official who attended the meeting, on the condition of anonymity, said, “There is around 2.5 million tonnes of legacy waste at the Bandhwari landfill. The WTE is needed for expediting its clearance. Suggestions, questions, claims, and objections received in today’s public hearing will be uploaded on the website of MCG and HSPCB. We have also agreed to organise a roundtable meeting with waste management experts, environmentalists in the near future for further discussion on the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bandhwari-landfill-citizens-voice-opposition-to-wte-plant-at-hearing-101630431354448.html

The prime suspect was produced in court on Tuesday and taken on five-day remand, the police said.The complainant, an 86-year-old woman, said that the main suspect was an acquaintance. The police said a case under sections 120 (B), 420, 467, 468, 471 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the prime suspect, Atul Goyal, and four others at Sadar police station on July 28. In her complaint to the police, 86-year-old Sushila Devi alleged that the suspect, a resident of Sector 92, conspired with four others to dupe her and forged her signature, to sell the plot and also manage the transfer of this property with the authorities. “I am a senior citizen and I can’t visit the plot often. He abused my confidence and prepared fake documents to sell my plot in Sector 52 without my knowledge,” the woman said in her complaint. She went to inspect her property four months ago and was shocked to find that a large house was being constructed on the plot. Upon making enquiries, she came to know that the plot had been purchased by two persons. When she approached the authorities over the sale, she found that her signature had been forged to sell the plot. “I have not sold this plot nor signed any documents to transfer the property and false signatures have been used,” she stated in her complaint. A senior police official said that a case was registered against the five suspects at Sadar police station last month and after a probe, the suspect was arrested. “Atul Goyal was arrested in this matter and produced in court on Tuesday. The police will question him during the remand period of five days,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/forgery-five-booked-for-selling-senior-citizen-s-plot-using-fake-signature-101630431352766.html

The state has been asked to respond within 10 days. The court was further informed that while centres for coastal districts like Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Raigad had already been set up, the ones in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg had not been initiated, hence the PIL sought directions to the government to do so immediately. The two districts have been ravaged by calamities in recent times. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL by Sharad Raul, a retired revenue department official from Ratnagiri was informed by advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that the civil defence centres were intended to provide assistance and protection in the event of hostile attacks or natural disasters such as cyclones, earthquake, flooding, landslides among others. Bhatkar submitted that while the six districts had been declared multi hazardous areas in 2011 and directions were issued to set up civil defence centres, the state had set up the centres in four districts only. The bench was informed that a representation seeking urgent setting up of the centres in the remaining two districts in 2018 was not responded to by the authorities hence the petitioner was constrained to approach HC. The petition states that though the two districts were most vulnerable, by not setting up the centres which are provided for under the Civil Defence Act, 1968 the residents of the two districts were exposed to loss of property and life during natural calamities. After hearing the submissions and perusing the petition, the court observed that had the centres been in place, the two districts Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg which witnessed several natural calamities could have provided better and timely rescue services thus saving losses. The court then directed the state home secretary to file an affidavit in reply within ten days and posted hearing of the PIL after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-raps-maharashtra-govt-for-not-setting-up-civil-defence-centres-in-ratnagiri-sindhudurg-101630431112653.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records fourth-driest August in a decade||The city saw its heaviest rains in a month on Tuesday, recording 78.44mm of rain in the nine hours ending 5.30pm, as per data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) observatory in Santacruz. The total amount of rainfall received this month — until 8.30am on August 31 — now stands at 338.8mm of rain (against the monthly normal of 531.3mm), making it the fourth-driest August in a decade as per IMD records. This follows last year’s above normal reading when August recorded a whopping 1,247.7mm of rain.Current forecasts suggest that rainfall prospects for Mumbai-MMR over the next two weeks are going to be better than in the previous month, and also the second fortnight of September, although a continuous wet spell appears unlikely. Tuesday’s showers, too, are likely to become subdued by Wednesday, with only light to moderate rain continuing over the next week, according to officials with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.“It was a near miss for Mumbai today. Circulation over the north Konkan and south Gujarat area helped to ensure that most of the rain on Tuesday was felt in Thane and Palghar districts. The next few days will bring some relief and then there is another spate of heavy showers expected in a week. The last two weeks of September again the monsoon activity will become subdued,” said a meteorologist with the IMD in Mumbai.Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have been placed under yellow alert for Wednesday, indicating very likely chances of heavy rain at the isolated places. Palghar district (where over 200mm of rain was recorded in Dahanu on Tuesday morning) has been placed under an orange alert, indicating very likely chances of heavy to very heavy rain very likely on Wednesday.Mumbai has so far received a total rainfall of 2,421.8mm since July 1, which is 9% over the seasonal normal amount of 2205mm. In August, however, the city saw a deficit of 36%, as did most districts in Maharashtra. Only four districts — Beed, Ahmednagar, Dhule and Aurangabad — saw above-normal rains, while 24 of the state’s 36 districts saw deficits ranging between 20 to 59%. Pune, Satara and Sangli districts saw large deficits of above 60%.The rains caused a perceptible dip in mercury, with temperatures in both Colaba and Santacruz dipping to 26 degrees Celsius (down from 29.9 degrees Celsius the day prior). The daytime maximum temperature over the next week, however, will rise to about 32 degrees Celsius by September 6, suggests the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai.BOX:Largest August deficits in 10 years:August 2013: 256mmAugust 2015: 153.9mmAugust 2018: 235.2mmAugust 2021: 338.8mm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-fourth-driest-august-in-a-decade-101630430992651.html

He was addressing reporters on the sidelines of a function at Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC).Farooq also said that government officials will be made accountable once there is a people’s government in the erstwhile state and asked J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to make them answerable to the people. Farooq lambasted the government officials, saying they don’t take phone calls of the people and political leaders.“They (bureaucrats) will be made accountable for what they have done. Today they consider themselves kings which they are not. They are meant to work for the people of the J&K and are servants of the people,” he said.Earlier speaking at a function on the parliamentary outreach programme for strengthening Parliamentary Raj Institutions (PRIs) that was also attended by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, Farooq said NC shouldn’t have boycotted the panchayat polls in 2018. “Our party should have taken part in the panchayat and block development council elections. We regret that,” he said.Soon after the governor rule was imposed in J&K in 2018, National Conference and the PDP boycotted panchayat polls.

Many BJP workers were killed, Apni Party leader was also killed recently. The panchayat members, BDC members can only work in the field if they are given proper security,” he said.He said the political leaders who stand for the country are being targeted by the militants and it’s the responsibility of Union government to protect them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nc-will-emerge-as-largest-party-in-elections-farooq-101630430513203.html

Farmers in state have threatened to boycott Adani Agrifresh and are constantly blaming cartelisation between the Group and arhtiyas.Bhardwaj on Tuesday inspected Mehandli mandi in Rohru and organised a meeting with departmental officers to ensure proper arrangements during the apple season.He said during the tenure of the previous government, only Re 1 was increased under MIS in five years, whereas under the present state government ₹2.5 has been increased under the MIS.“During the apple season, the Opposition parties need to leave politics and focus on statistics,” he said.He said the state is trying to resolve the problems faced during the apple season.

With bomb injuries presenting complex diagnostic and management challenges, the doctors performed multiple flap surgeries on him, providing the war victim with much-needed relief. His spinal cord injury was treated and with the help of a physiotherapist, he is now able to walk again.Dr Abhishek Ghosh, microvascular reconstructive surgeon at Noble hospital who operated on the boy, said, “Gradually, the patient also developed bed sores on all pressure points including the back, thighs, knees and ankles. His wounds were getting infected resulting in Septicaemia. But we successfully treated his infected wounds. Multiple flap surgeries were performed on him to cover all defects.”Multiple flap surgery entails using healthy tissue to cover up defects in the body where there is loss of skin, fat or muscle movement. During the operation, shrapnels embedded in the patient’s palm were removed. The patient’s wounds have healed now and he is undergoing physiotherapy.Dr Ghosh said, “The bomb blast cut his spinal cord at the L3 L4 level. With the help of physiotherapy, he has started walking now. This bomb blast injury was not just any regular thermal injury; the boy had many pellets inside his body. Some of the pellets I removed were stuck deep inside his body.”The surgery was performed on August 12 and the patient has now been declared fully recovered. Bone-, bullet-, burn- and mine blast- injuries comprise a majority of injuries when it comes to treating war zone patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-doctors-help-paraplegic-war-victim-walk-again-101630430093302.html

Meanwhile, there was a mood of celebrations and enjoyment at Sharad Kumar’s home. Surendra Kumar, Sharad’s father, said it’s been the much-awaited moment for the family. “We have been waiting for this moment.

SRA officials said that instead of various developers raising stand-alone buildings, the redevelopment project in the heart of the city would be taken on as a “cluster”. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is likely to hold a meeting regarding the redevelopment of these 17 slums with stakeholders in Pune on Friday. “In Mangalwar peth there are many slums. That is a cluster sort of situation. The cluster development approach is suitable there. We are thinking of planned development which will include all of these slums,” said Rajendra Nimbalkar, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). These 17 slums, housing approximately 2,500 families, include the following postal addresses: 251 Mangalwar peth, Indiranagar; 230 Mangalwar peth, Kore plot, Gosavi Vasti and Kachi Mala. “If this project picks up, then a huge area of the main city would be developed. Once this project goes ahead, it can be replicated in other areas as well,” said Nimbalkar. Sadanand Shetty a developer of SRA schemes said collective efforts are needed to rehabilitate the slums in Mangalwar peth. “These slums are as old as 50-60 years. Slums have been located near the main road towards the Shivajinagar court. If the redevelopment plan is undertaken, then Mangalwar peth can be freed from slums. It is the main area in the city. Approximately 2,778 families are living in these areas. The deputy chief minister has promised a meeting regarding this. Hopefully, the development plan will start from here,” said Shetty. In 2008-2016, SRA received 179 proposals for development. Post 2017, this number has drastically reduced. Rajendra Nimbalkar also insisted on the need of expediting SRA projects. “There are multiple technical issues because of which the SRA projects get delayed. It requires serious attention from stakeholders such as the government, developers, and citizens of the city. Considering all these points, we have submitted a new SRA policy for approval to the state government, which will help to resolve these issues,” Nimbalkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mangalwar-peth-cluster-development-plan-for-on-table-for-17-slums-101630428232894.html

Rail traffic has been stopped till further orders in view of passengers’ safety,” said Saraswati Chandra, senior divisional commercial manager cum media in-charge. Under the move, operation of as many as 14 trains has been cancelled, while six trains have been short terminated and four trains have been short originated. Besides, routes of as many as 16 major trains have been diverted via Muzaffarpur- Sitamarhi stations.Earlier on July 10, rail traffic between the section was suspended due to flood water flowing above danger level at bridge number one between Muktapur-Samastipur, a railway official said.Meanwhile, incessant rains along catchment areas have increased the threat of flood in the four districts of Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia.In several areas of Seemanchal, Mahananda, Kankai, Parman, Das and Bakra rivers were flowing above danger level at various places, creating panic in several areas. Katihar’s Kadwa block, Amour and Baisa in Purnia, Teragachh in Kishanganj and Araria’s block were the worst-affected by floods, caused by rise in water level of Mahananda, Parman and Kankai rivers.Kadwa block development officer (BDO), Zulfikar Adil, who visited the flood-affected areas on Tuesday, said “Water level of Mahananda has risen suddenly and several areas have been inundated. Relief and rescue operations are being carried out in flood-affected panchayats.” Amdabad, Manihari and Kursela blocks of Katihar were already ravaged by floods caused by Ganga and Kosi rivers. However, after Ganga and Kosi rivers started showing a receding trend, flood situation has gradually improved in the areas, said Manoj Kumar Mandal, a local panchayat leader of Kursela.However, the district administrations were faced by another challenge to prevent erosion after flood waters have started receding. “We have urged several officials and leaders to take appropriate measures to prevent erosion, but to no avail,” said Purnia resident Md Imtiyaz Alam.Chief engineer, Katihar unit of flood control and drainage at water resources department (WRD), Rajendra Kumar Mehta, said there was no need to panic, even as Mahananda, Kankai, and Parman rivers were rising slowly. “Rising trend in rivers is due to continuous rainfall and is likely to fall once it stops raining,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-rail-movement-between-darbhanga-samastipur-suspended-due-to-floods-101630428232449.html

Nagaland scored highest in our metric because of high-quality granular data reporting through weekly bulletins,” said co-authors of the study Varun and Abeynaya in a letter to the Nagaland health department on Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by HT.Appreciating the effort of the state government in bringing out the “high-quality bulletins”, the letter stated that Nagaland government is empowering people to be proactive about their health by releasing the data and its interpretations, along with public health recommendations.“It’s a joint effort by team Nagaland, driven by the belief that all data should be made available to the public transparently,” principal secretary of Nagaland Health and Family Welfare Department, Amardeep S Bhatia, told HT.With India among the top three countries in the world both in Covid-19 cases and death counts, and the pandemic being far from over, the study was stated to have been conducted in view that timely, transparent, and accessible reporting of Covid-19 data continues to be critical for India’s pandemic efforts.The paper states that Nagaland reports cumulative cases and deaths disaggregated by age and gender and cumulative deaths disaggregated by comorbidities, while in contrast, the low scoring sub-nationals report little or no granular data.While Nagaland topped the surveillance reporting score, Kerala, Ladakh, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu followed close. Bihar, Lakshadweep, Uttar Pradesh, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu scored the lowest.As per the study, Chandigarh and Haryana were found to be violating privacy by including individuallyidentifiable information in their reporting. Chandigarh continues to release a document containing the name and address of people who have completed or are under quarantine, while Haryana is releasing a document containing the name, age, gender, and address of cases from its Jhajjar district.On vaccination reporting, the paper states that the CoWIN application does not report total vaccination stratified by eligibility category for each dose. The number of severe and serious events disaggregated by vaccine type is missing and only 14 out 36 sub-nationals report on their digital platforms the total vaccination stratified by eligibility category for each dose. Karnataka is the only sub-national that is reporting the number of severe and serious (adverse event following immunization) AEFI cases.As for vacant bed availability reporting, 20 out of 36 sub-nationals report by hospitals and frequently update them while others are either not publishing any data on vacant bed availability or are reporting the total/vacant number of beds without classifying them....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nagaland-tops-covid-19-surveillance-reporting-in-india-study-101630427993293.html

For the Haj House, PMC said that it would require the state government’s permission, but now they are approving the Ram sculpture. It must also require the state government’s clearance. “A Haj House operates like a “transit location” for pilgrims on their way to perform the Haj in Saudi Arabia.

On August 3, in a in its 4:1 judgment, it ordered the demolition of the Waqf building within a month.The high court had also directed the Bihar government to constitute an inquiry commission to fix responsibility on government officials who permitted the construction of the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-orders-status-quo-on-patna-hc-order-to-raze-bihar-waqf-board-building-101630426613166.html

The total amount of rainfall received this month until 8:30 am on August 31 now stands at 338.8mm (against the monthly normal of 531.3mm), making it the fourth-driest August in a decade as per IMD records. This follows last year’s above normal reading, when August recorded a whopping 1,247.7mm of rain.Current forecasts suggest that rainfall prospects for Mumbai-MMR over the next two weeks are going to be better than previous month, and also the second fortnight of September, although a continuous wet spell appears unlikely. Tuesday’s showers, too, are likely to become subdued by Wednesday, with only light to moderate rain continuing over the next week, according to officials with the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.“It was a near miss for Mumbai today. A circulation over north Konkan and south Gujarat area helped ensure most of the rain on Tuesday was felt in Thane and Palghar districts. The next few days will bring some relief and then there is another spate of heavy showers expected in a week. The last two weeks of September again the monsoon activity will become subdued,” said a meteorologist with the IMD, Mumbai.Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagir districts have been placed under a yellow alert for Wednesday, indicating very likely chances of heavy rain at the isolated places. Palghar district (where over 200mm of rain was recorded in Dahanu on Tuesday morning) has been placed under an orange alert, indicating very likely chances of heavy to very heavy rain very likely on Wednesday.Mumbai has so far received a total rainfall of 2421.8mm since July 1, which is 9% above the seasonal normal amount of 2205mm. In August, however, the city saw a deficit of 36%, as did most districts in Maharashtra. Only four districts - Beed, Ahmednagar, Dhule and Aurangabad - saw above-normal rains, while 24 of the state’s 36 districts saw deficits ranging between 20 to 59%. Pune, Satara and Sangli districts saw large deficits of above 60%.The rains caused a perceptible dip in mercury, with temperatures in both Colaba and Santacruz dipping to 26 degrees Celsius (down from 29.9 degrees Celsius the day prior). The daytime maximum temperature over the next week, however, will rise to about 32 degrees Celsius by September 6, the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Mumbai suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-fourth-driest-august-in-decade-101630425174551.html

Phanidhar Talukdar, the lone Hindu among AIUDF’s 16 MLAs, was elected from Bhabanipur constituency in Bajali district. He is slated to resign as a legislator on Wednesday and join the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “I am herewith resigning from the post of secretary, AIUDF legislature party with effect from today. In addition, I am also withdrawing my primary membership of AIUDF party in the larger interest of the people of my constituency and the people of Assam,” Talukdar wrote in his letter to AIUDF president Maulana Badruddin Ajmal. Tuesday’s development comes a day after Congress decided to sever ties with the AIUDF. Both parties were part of a ‘grand alliance’ of 10 parties opposed to the ruling BJP in the assembly polls. Formed in 2006, the AIUDF primarily has a base among Bengali-speaking Muslims. Apart from Talukdar, all other MLAs who got elected in this year’s assembly polls are Muslims. Talukdar is the third newly elected MLA who had resigned from the parties after the assembly polls. Earlier, two Congress MLAs, Rupjyoti Kurmi of Mariani and Sushanta Borgohain of Thowra, resigned from the party and also quit as members of the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lone-hindu-aiudf-mla-quits-party-set-to-join-ruling-bjp-101630422952746.html

The police will also look at the CCTV footage of the incident.“I have ordered the DSP (sachiwalaya) to investigate the matter and submit a report as soon as possible,” said senior superintendent of police (SP) Upendra Sharma.Meanwhile, SK Singh, the station house officer (SHO) of SK Puri police station, denied the involvement of the accused policemen in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-policemen-allegedly-throw-boiling-milk-on-minor-boy-for-refusing-them-free-tea-101630420313212.html
31-08-2021||Pune||Pune teacher duped of ₹3.2 lakh through credit-based mobile app||PUNE: A 32-year-old man was duped of ₹3,19,806 in an online fraud through a credit-based borrowing application. The complainant, who works as a teacher in Pune, lodged a complaint and an FIR was registered at the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. The incident happened on July 23 around 8 am when the complainant was at his home in Ambegaon. The police have booked the accused who identified himself as Munaf Ali Sheik along with bank account holders from Surat in Gujarat, West Bengal, and Loya in Andhra Pradesh. The complainant made a payment through his savings bank account using the credit-based application. However, he did not receive an SMS confirming the transaction worth ₹89,949. In order to contact the customer care service of the application, the complainant searched for a contact on Google and called a mobile number from the search options. Either the Google search is manipulated or there are serious security discrepancies in the mobile application format, according to the police. The accused asked the complainant to enter information like card number, expiry date, and security code onto the “address menu” section of the credit application, according to the complaint. “Once the information was uploaded, his phone stopped working. So, he used the SIM card of his friend’s mobile phone and found that money from his savings account has been debited. He lodged a police complaint. The accused may have accessed the complainant’s bank account and hacked into his Gmail account,” said inspector (crime) Vijay Puranik of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station who is investigating the case. A case was registered under Sections 419 (impersonation), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66 (C) and 66 (D) of Information Technology Act at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-teacher-duped-of-rs-3-2-lakh-through-credit-based-mobile-app-101630419891037.html
31-08-2021||Other||Guest Column | Settlement of agricultural debt in Punjab: Rhetoric versus reality||The burgeoning farm debt in Punjab is a concern not only for economists and sociologists but also for the central and state governments. Political parties tend to make considerable noise about this issue, especially in the build-up to the Vidhan Sabha elections. The fragmented farmer and agricultural labour organisations have been sporadically protesting but the subject has paled into insignificance after the farmers’ ongoing agitation against the three central farm laws. The latest official figure from Nabard is ₹71,305 crore of farm debt from the organised sector alone is in the hands of about 15 lakh families. This does not include the debt from the unorganised sector, more particularly the arhtiyas (commission agents-cum-moneylenders), the amount of which is estimated to be around ₹30,000 crore. Sensing the public pulse in an election year, the Akali-BJP government had enacted the Punjab Settlement of Agricultural Indebtedness Act, 2016. The widespread expectation was that this law would effectively extinguish the usurious debt on the head of the Punjabi farmers, piled by the greedy moneylenders. On the other hand, the Congress, which was seeking to wrest power in the state after being in political wilderness for a decade, promised an absolute and unconditional waiver of all farm debt. This March, the Punjab finance minister announced that the state had cumulatively waived loans amounting to ₹5,810 crore, covering 6.96 lakh small and marginal farmers. Recently, Punjab waived loans worth ₹590 crore outstanding in the accounts of landless famers and agricultural labour, including ₹520 crore in the hands of 2,85,325 members of various co-operative societies. Thus, not more than 9% of the outstanding loan from the public-sector institutions has actually been waived. 2016 Act more of instrument in lender’s hands The Punjab Settlement of Agricultural Indebtedness Act, 2016, has turned out to be a disappointment for the poor and marginalised Punjabi farmers and agricultural labourers though it might have provided significant relief to the then beleaguered arhtiya community. A plain reading of this enactment would reveal that no straight-forward extinguishing of any usurious loan is mandated therein (section 3). It merely contains enabling provisions to set up district-level forums for an arithmetical evaluation of the outstanding amount, subject to the provisions of the instant 2016 law. In 2018, the district forums were converted into divisional-level forums, through an amendment, making the access for the poor debtor even more difficult. The Act itself did not stipulate a specific, maximum rate of interest, which was to be subsequently notified under Section 4 by the state government. It was accordingly notified on September 6, 2016, as the sum of the extant base lending rate of SBI plus the lending rate of Nabard to the co-operative societies. On the date of the notification, it was 9.3%+2.5%= 11.8%, and would currently be around 10.4%, the interest being simple interest. The Act of 2016 is more of an instrument in the hands of the lender/creditor – both private and public sector – to effect summary recovery of the loan rather than a protective legal device to provide any relief to the debt-ridden farmer. There are no figures in the public domain regarding the number of cases settled by such forums – our estimate is that these would be only in double digits. A lender (arhtiya) rarely allows the loan to go bad, because he invariably deducts the principal and the interest, while disbursing the payment received from agencies in respect of the farmers’ agricultural produce. Friction between farmers and arhtiyas persists The united front put up by the farmers and arhtiyas in the ongoing agitation protest against the farm laws may create an impression that they are working as harmonious units in the rural, agricultural socio-economic society. However, the subterranean stresses continue to persist. The relatively large number of deaths related farmer suicides in Punjab bears a testimony to the potentially horrible dimension of this disaster looming large on the state. It is easy for any political party to make promises, but with the state debt already hovering in excess of ₹3.2 lakh crore, the state exchequer will just not have the resources to waive this debt in totality. The answer would necessarily lie in diversification, remunerative MSP mechanism for other agricultural produce, promoting agro-based and agro-processing industries, scientific storage facilities and cold chains and perhaps the resurrection and refurbishment of the Punjab Relief of Indebtedness Act, 1934, the Punjab Debtor’s Protection Act of 1936, popularly called the Sir Chhotu Ram laws. Ironically, the former has been repealed by the Punjab law of 2016. These two laws, much talked about but rarely invoked, not only capped the maximum rate of simple interest chargeable but also provided relief to the distressed, indebted landowners against sale of their land and attachment of the standing crops, in execution of the civil court decrees. Perhaps what is required in case of Punjab are provisions similar to the one that Indira Gandhi incorporated in the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, which not only rendered bonded labour contracts and customs are null and void, but also extinguished the bonded labour debt and barred any suits for recovery. Till such bold legal-cum-political initiative sees the light of the day, we will continue to see cosmetic tinkering with a disease that requires, not sweet medicines, but immediate surgery. kbs.sidhu@gmail.com The writer is a retired Punjab cadre IAS officer.

TS Singh Deo, who flew to Delhi again on Monday, is yet to return to the state.On Sunday, Baghel met Machhua Kalyan Board Chairman MR Nishad and parliamentary secretary Kunwar Singh Nishad, (both representatives of the fisherman community). He also met Chandranahu Kurmi Samaj’s (one of the other backward castes) representatives, who invited him for a congregation in Mahasamund district on September 26.Although, functionaries close to Singh Deo asserted that the Delhi visit of the minister was ‘purely personal’, the timing of the visit has made headlines in the local dailies.Baghel has been silent after his return from Delhi and avoiding media but continuously meeting the various community representatives in Raipur.The same day, Baghel exhorted that the shortage of rainfall has given rise to ‘drought-like conditions’ in several areas and his government stands with farmers in this time of crisis.“Farmers who have sown paddy, kodo-kutki (millet), arhar pulse in the ongoing kharif season and if their crops get destroyed due to lack of rainfall, they will be given an assistance of ₹9,000 per acre on the basis of survey (for assessment of damage) under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana,” an official statement from Baghel stated.The leaders and Congress functionaries are now eyeing the two-day visit of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and hoping for some clarity with respect to the high command’s decision on the power-sharing formula.On Saturday, after returning from Delhi, Baghel told the media that Gandhi will be on a two-day visit to the state this week.“It is obvious that Rahul Gandhi will talk to leaders, functionaries and MLAs about everything including the government, policies and power-sharing formula... I don’t know what will happen but Gandhi’s visit will be crucial,” said a senior Congress leader.However, Congress functionaries in the state claimed that the schedule of Gandhi’s visit is not finalised till now.“Our party’s Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia will come first and chalk out the plan for Rahul Gandhi’s visit. On August 3, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken will be in Raipur to address a press conference on the new National Monetization Pipeline announced by the central government while Baghel ji will be addressing media, on the same issue in Lucknow. We are not expecting any political development before August 4,” said Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, chairman, Chhattisgarh Congress media cell.Meanwhile, most of the Congress legislators are still in a state of confusion about the power-sharing formula and waiting for a clear indication from the high command.“Both of them look confident in their statements after their return from Delhi on Saturday. Most of us are still in confusion about the power-sharing formula… One among the two leaders is misleading the MLAs and Congress,” said an MLA on condition of anonymity.The bureaucrats of Chhattisgarh are also eagerly watching the political developments of the state.“Things are not the same in Chhattisgarh as they were a week ago. Most of us are waiting for further political development because nothing is clear,” said a senior IAS officer.“The Congress party is suffering in the ongoing tussle between the two leaders of the Chhattisgarh. I believe that whatever happens, the Congress will have to face the dent in the next assembly elections due to this infighting. Secondly, the whole bureaucracy is at a standstill since everyone is waiting for the final decision of Congress high command,” said Ashok Tomar, a political commentator, based in Raipur.On Friday, Baghel met Gandhi and said that he had said “everything” to his leader. Asked if he would still be the chief minister when Gandhi arrives in Chhattisgarh, Baghel said he had invited him “as the chief minister”.Singh Deo on Thursday fuelled the speculation about the change, saying anyone who plays in a team “wants to be the captain”.In December 2018, in the aftermath of dominant Congress performance where the party won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too.Four state leaders, Baghel, home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the chief minister’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker, friction between Baghel and Singh Deo meant that Sahu first emerged as the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi, reportedly arrived at a power-sharing arrangement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-return-from-delhi-tight-lipped-baghel-meets-community-leaders-in-state-101630415513226.html

The arrested was identified as Ghahininath Ambadas Saravade (33), a resident of Ambika Pathar area of Pune. The deceased lived with her husband in their house at Ambika Pathar. The two had been married on February 1, 2019 and have a 18-month-old son who was in the house when her mother took the extreme step. “They used to live in Solapur before moving to Pune. In Solapur, the couple used to have frequent fights as the woman wanted her husband to seek a job in Pune and settle family in the city. However, once they moved to Pune, the domestic scuffles continued. On Friday, the couple had a verbal fight after the man brought street food ‘Pani Puri’ for dinner and the woman said that he should have informed her beforehand as she had already cooked food. They slept without eating. The next day she attempted suicide around 1 pm, and was declared dead under medical treatment on Sunday,“ said assistant police inspector Sachin Dhamne. The woman was a housewife and her husband worked at a nearby private company. A complaint was lodged by Prakash Pise (55) of Beed and the father of the deceased. The complainant told the police that the arrested man used to beat up his daughter. A case under Ssections 306 (abetment to suicide), 498 (A) (domestic violence), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (insult with an intention of provoking breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-in-custody-for-driving-wife-to-suicide-in-pune-101630414970628.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Stay on eviction, demolition, dispossession in Maharashtra till Sept 30: HC||Taking into consideration the opinions of experts that the third wave of the Covid pandemic is knocking at the doors, the full bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday decided to keep in abeyance orders passed by various courts and authorities related to eviction, dispossession and demolition in the state till September 30.The bench noted that in light of lockdown norms being relaxed, which has resulted in crowding at public places, the warning by the experts could not be neglected, hence the government should take steps to curb it. A full bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta, justices AA Sayed, KK Tated and PB Varale extended the interim orders while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) instituted last year in April to provide protection to those who were unable to access justice due to restricted functioning of courts due to the pandemic. While observing that the administrative committee of the HC in its meeting on Monday had been apprised by of the possibility of a third wave due to rising Covid cases by the head of the special task force, it had decided to continue physical hearing of cases with certain precautionary measures and also continue with the hybrid system. The bench also referred to the view of the special task force head that the country could not get rid of the pandemic till April 2022 and held that in light of this, the state had to ensure that all safety protocols were followed. “Considering the view placed by the experts, the situation of uncertainty and the ensuing festivities which could pose a threat to the humankind, we are of the opinion that the interest of justice would be served if the protective interim orders are extended till September 30,” noted the full bench. The full bench will again assemble on September 24 and take a review of the situation and decide on whether the interim orders need to be extended or not. In the previous hearing, the bench had indicated that while it was extending interim orders till August 31, it was not inclined to extend the protection any further thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stay-on-eviction-demolition-dispossession-in-maharashtra-till-sept-30-hc-101630414250934.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Climate change: Snow cover in Himachal down by 18%||The snow cover of the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh that feeds four major river systems is down by 18% in a year, indicating climate change. A government study has found that 23,542 sq km was under snow cover in 2019-20, which dropped to 19,183 sq km in 2020-21, a decline of 3,404 sq km or 18.52%. The Centre on Climate Change of the Himachal Pradesh Council for Science Technology and Environment (Himcoste) and the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, conducted the study to assess spatial distribution of seasonal snow cover in Himachal Pradesh from October 2020 to May 2021. “Scientists used space technology to study the cyrosphere, comprising the glaciers over the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh. Satellite data was analysed to map the geographical extent of snow cover and understand the contribution of snow in catchments to sustain the hydrology of the river basins,” Himscote member secretary Sudesh Kumar Mokhta said. Fluctuating trends affect weather cycle “If there is a shift in snowfall pattern, as has been observed over the past few years, the long-term implications will be on water availability in the river basins as the seasonal snow cover contributes to the river discharge during the lean season,” said SS Randhawa, a principal scientist at Himcoste, who headed the study team. The late snowfall patterns that extend into summer are not sustainable as it melts fast due to more water content. Similar trends were observed during the 2020-21 winter that was comparatively warmer, he said. If such fluctuating trends continue for long, they affect the weather cycle, resulting in erratic rain, snowfall and heat and ultimately water availability. Himachal Pradesh gets winter precipitation in the form of snow at the higher altitudes. About one-third of the total geographical area of the state remains under thick snow cover during winter. Most major rivers such as the Chenab, Beas, Parvati, Baspa, Spiti, Ravi, Sutlej and their perennial tributaries originating from the Himalayas depend on the seasonal snow cover for their discharge dependability. Four major river basins record area reduction “Data analyses show that all four major river basins in Himachal, namely the Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Beas, recorded reduction in terms of the total monthly average area in 2020-21,” said Randhawa. The snow cover in the Chenab basin fell from 7,154.12 sq km in 2019-20 to 6,515.92 sq km in 2020-21, a reduction of 638.2 sq km. The Beas basin shows a decrease of about 19% with its average snow cover area having decreased from 2457.68 sq km to 2002.04 sq km, a loss of 455 sq km. The Ravi basin saw an overall reduction of 23% in the total area under snow cover. This year, the basin recorded snow cover of 1,619.83 sq km compared to 2,108 sq km last winter. The reduction in terms of area under snow cover was 488 sq km. Snow cover in the Sutlej basin shrunk by 2,777 sq km (23%). It was 11823.28 sq km in 2019-20 and 9,045.51 sq km this year. Less snowfall affects runoff patterns In the beginning of winter in October 2020, all basins were characterised by less snow cover area and the decrease of about 51% in the Chenab, 64% in Beas, about 77% in Ravi and 72% in the Sutlej. It was 31% in case of Chenab, 6% in Beas, 52% in Ravi and 21% in the Sutlej basin in November. In January, the Chenab basin shows a decrease of about 2%, the Beas 27%, Ravi 16% and Sutlej 24%. The four river basins again show a decrease of 2%, 27%, 16% and 24%, respectively. It indicates there was less snowfall during the 2020-21 winter, which may affect the runoff patterns during the summer. However, the marginal increase of 8% and 1% in Chenab basin and the Sutlej basin, respectively, indicates that the winter precipitation has extended to the summer months. An analysis of summer months reveals that in the Chenab basin, 85% of the total basin area in April and 71% in May is still under the impact of snow, reflecting that about 14% of the total basin area melted during this period. “In other words, we can say that 52% of the total basin area would melt during the next ablation month (June to August), meeting the discharge dependability from the Chenab basin,” Mokhta said. Likewise, the Beas basin in April had 49% of the total basin area and in May about 35% was under snow cover impact, whereas in the Ravi basin, 29% of the total basin area in April and 24% was covered with snow. The Sutlej basin, comprising Baspa, Pin and Spiti rivers, indicates that 41% of the total area in April and 37% in May was under snow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/climate-change-snow-cover-in-himachal-down-by-18-101630412993338.html
31-08-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s power crisis deepens due to coal shortage, 7 thermal units shut||Due to the shortage of coal, seven thermal power units in Rajasthan are shut and the rests have 3-4 days of stock left, HT has learnt. The Rajasthan Vidhyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (power generation firm) failed to make payments for coal due to a shortage of funds, and now the supply has become difficult as the coal mines are flooded with water. Undeclared power cuts of 4-5 hours have begun in rural areas and if the situation remains the same, urban areas may suffer power cuts as well. Due to the long weekend on the occasion of Janmasthami on Monday, the power consumption was less by industrial units and markets, but the load would increase by 15,000 MW in normal days. However, officials of the energy department denied any further power cuts and said it was done for the last two days as the demand increased but with the monsoon reviving in the state the demand has declined again. A senior official of the energy department said six units of Suratgarh (250MW each), and a unit of Kalisindh are shut due to coal shortage. The Kota thermal plant is also running at 70% capacity. Another private thermal plant in Kawai (Baran) is also shut. The remaining thermal units are left with 3-4 days coal stock. He said due to weak monsoon, the demand for commercial and domestic electricity has increased. The consumption of electricity in the month of August every year is around 20 crore units per day, which has increased to 31 crore units per day. Besides, some of the thermal plants are also on maintenance. Rajasthan has thermal units in district Suratgarh with 2160 MW capacity, Kota (1240MW), Chhabra (1320MW), Kalisindh (1200MW), Giral 250MW (Barmer), 270.50MW plant in Jaisalmer. Another official of Rajasthan Urja Vikas Limited, the government firm which handles the purchase and sale of power, said there has been no load-shedding as the electricity demand has declined with the monsoon. “In normal days, the electricity rate per unit is ₹6-7, which had increased to ₹20 per unit. With increasing demand and shortage of power with the exchange the national load dispatch, the Centre denied an overdraw. With an adequate supply of coal to plants, the situation will improve,” he said. However, despite all odds, department minister BD Kalla is confident of resolving the issue in a week. “The coal shortage issue will be resolved in a week. Under the agreement, Coal India was supposed to supply four and a half rakes, instead was sending three. We have urged to meet the gap by sending nine racks (one rake contains 4000 tonnes),” the minister said. The shortage is because of coal mines flooded with water – the water is being pumped out and soon supply would start, he said. As of August 1, 2021, Rajasthan has to clear an outstanding of ₹409 crore to Parsa Kanta Collieries Limited (PKCL) while ₹1375 crore has been paid. A total of ₹68 crore is to be cleared of Northern Coalfields Limited, ₹325 crore is released; ₹444.6 crore is pending for South Eastern Coalfields, ₹530 crore has been released, said the official. The state government needs to clear a pending amount of over 900 crore to coal companies. Amid the crisis, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has released ₹900 crore while another ₹1,000 crore will be sanctioned to clear the dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthans-power-crisis-deepens-due-to-coal-shortage-7-thermal-units-shut-101630412752307.html

No casualties have been reported so far.This comes a day after three houses collapse following heavy rains, leaving five people dead and two others missing in Pithoragarh in the state. Right above the landslide site in Nainital is a girls’ hostel of Kumaon University. However, only two girls were in the hostel at the time and they were evacuated soon after. Nainital district disaster management officer Shailesh Kumar said boulder fall was being reported on Thandi Sadak for the past three days. “There was a major landslide at the same site this morning. The district administration has decided to call experts to check the area and make recommendations,” he said. Prof Lalit Tiwari, research director Kumaon University said, “We will discuss the matter with the district magistrate (DM) following which we will take a decision on when it will be safe to allow students in the hostel.” The DM is scheduled to visit the area later in the evening.Nainital is one of the most landslide-prone areas in the state. Since 2018, this small hill station and the areas around it have been witnessing landslides and cracks on the roads. Surrounded by hills, the Nainital lake is situated at an elevation of 1,938 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/landslide-rocks-nainital-lake-area-boulders-and-debris-fall-into-waters-101630412390981.html
31-08-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Choose wisely, the next elected body must set us right on climate action||The upcoming elections, the public representatives we choose, and their performance from 2022 to 2027 will be crucial to address critical contemporary challenges such as economic recovery from the pandemic and climate action. Election manifestos must present the parties’ proposed policy directions and show wisdom and commitment to sustainability. The public on its part must assess election promises for development projects carefully. We should become system thinkers and critical thinkers to check if proposals really improve wellbeing and reduce carbon emissions and other negative environmental impacts. We will need to be wary of false solutions, an example of which I describe below. But first, indulge me for a quick reminder of what travel (or not) in Pune needs to look like, the sooner the better. Back-cast the future Sustainability thinkers use “backcasting” as a tool – visualise the future and work backwards to devise the projects we should take up today, and to change unsustainable behaviours and investments. For example, by 2027, we should expect the city’s transport system to be climate-friendly, safe, stress-free (no driving road rage) and affordable. And we should have changed, stopped or reduced the policies, projects and behaviours that are getting us into troubleWe envision a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transport. Private transport is known to be the biggest contributor. Thus, public transport would have excellent frequency and connectivity across the city such that people would happily ditch bikes and cars and take the bus instead. Road space would be mainly for walking and cycling. At crossings, pedestrians and cyclists would occasionally stop to allow buses and the few vehicles to pass. We would be able to reach bus and metro stations with a short walk, cycle ride or auto-shuttle trip. Opportunities to work without travelling much would continue and become better. We would be able to access most daily needs without private motor vehicles. Our city government needs to work backwards from such a scenario (already envisioned in Pune’s mobility plan, cycle plan, street design guidelines). So now, it should implement critical actions – an extensive bus fleet, efficient management, and road design supportive of sustainable mobility. False solutions Unfortunately, instead of envisioning and acting for a sustainable future, false solutions are peddled out. For example, a proposal for a “neo-metro” with elevated roads on which trolleybuses will run appears to show that folks are thinking about public transport. In fact, it indicates the thinking that roads will remain congested with motor vehicles and that buses can have a rapid run only if there are elevated roads. Worse, a need for elevated roads (built at a huge public expense) is projected for public transport, but actually private motor vehicles will get a free run. Two lanes of the elevated neo-metro road are proposed as private motor vehicle lanes. Though the stated intent is to provide public transport, precious public funds will subsidise private transportation. Do we really need to be stuck with road construction for several years only to still be driving or riding? That is not a future we should aim for. We cannot afford to waste time and scarce resources on fake solutions that increase carbon emissions, congestion and crashes, and make the real solutions much more difficult to implement. Responsible decisions needed We hope political parties will take the challenge of sustainable mobility seriously and reduce the city’s carbon footprint in the next five to seven years. The IPCC’s Code Red has signalled that governments and communities at all levels must take urgent steps to reduce carbon emissions. Since time is of the essence, the upcoming elections are crucial for Pune’s future. Pune should emulate the municipal corporation of Greater Mumbai that has just launched a climate action planning process. It focuses on waste management, sustainable mobility, clean energy, urban floods and water management, urban green cover and biodiversity, and air quality. The PMC’s Resilience Plan prepared as part of the 100 Resilient Cities programme already covers such areas and can be the basis for Pune’s climate action plan. Pune now needs to go beyond the excellent plans it develops, to allocating municipal budgets and timelines, and ensuring implementation. Political parties must craft their manifestos keeping environmental sustainability and peoples’ wellbeing at the core. We expect the next city government to firmly set Pune on a course of sustainable development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-choose-wisely-the-next-elected-body-must-set-us-right-on-climate-action-101630411308664.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Secret of wearing a thick skin, saving it||When I joined as a bank officer in 1984, our batch had to undergo an induction programme at the staff training centre (STC), according to the standard procedure at that time. Bank officials who imparted training at the STC were called instructors. It was a month-long programme in a residential campus. The instructors were the bank’s general cadre officers who had been picked up from operations for the training assignment for a fixed tenure. The instructors were repatriated to operations on the completion of their tenure in the training system. There were six instructors at the STC who would take our classes, four in a day, by rotation. Besides teaching us the basics of banking, they would regale us with humorous anecdotes from their work experience. Each one of the instructors had their own eccentricities and peculiar experiences, which would be reflected in their lectures. The lectures of one instructor would be interspersed with two particular tips. He would often tell us, in between his lectures, to “save your skin first”. It was said in the context of decision-making that as bankers we were going to be involved in after completion of the probation period. It was a practical advice to safeguard our job first and foremost while taking any decision, especially those related to credit. Another advice he would repeat frequently was to “be thick-skinned”. It implied that as officers we should not be sensitive to reproach and rebuke from our seniors and customers. He gave to us these pieces of advice from what he had imbibed from his experience in the operations. One day, when he was repeating the same counsel for the umpteenth time, a retort from one the trainees brought the house down with laughter. The trainee summed up succinctly the instructor’s exhortations in a witty riposte: “Sir, do we have to be skin specialists?” Later on in our career, the advisories given by our instructor stood us in good stead. Now that I have retired from the bank service, a reference to ‘skin’ again made an impactful impression during a chat with an NRI friend settled in New York. There was this conversation around health that navigated towards organs of the body. It was a revelation for me when my friend told me that the skin was the largest organ in the human body. I was surprised to think of the skin as an organ. My friend was a bit bemused at my ignorance of this plain fact. But my scepticism didn’t let go of the conversation around the skin. I wondered aloud, seeking clarification from my friend, as to what care did we take of this largest organ? My friend was prompt to satiate my curiosity with a simple counter question. “Don’t we bathe regularly?” It immediately dawned upon me that our bathing basically serves the purpose of cleansing and maintenance of our skin, the largest organ of our body. The significance and secret of the skin were revealed to me again! chander59@icloud.com The writer is a Panchkula-based retired banker||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/secret-of-wearing-a-thick-skin-saving-it-101630410646544.html

Four party workers were booked in Worli for defying the government orders.The MNS celebrated the festival in places such as Thane, Kalachowki, Dadar, Mulund and Mankhurd.Assailing the state government, MNS chief Raj Thackeray said, “Everything is going on normally and there are crowds everywhere...A perception is being created that Covid-19 spreads only during the festivals. Fear is being created among the people. Hence, I told my party workers to celebrate Dahi Handi with gusto.” He said it is ironic that ‘Jan Ashirwarad Yatra’ and other gatherings are being held while festivities are being curbed. “Let there be a similar law for everyone,” he added.Dahi Handi is a clay pot filled with milk, yogurt and other such milk products, hung from a height. Young people form a human pyramid to break it. This is one of the major festivals celebrated across Maharashtra where winners get prizes.In Thane, the MNS broke the dahi handi at 12midnight with women volunteers forming a pyramid. In Dadar, MNS workers celebrated Dahi Handi at Khandke building at 7am. At Kalachowki, MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar was not allowed to enter the Bhagat Singh ground so he broke the handi outside. Mumbai Police detained him later.Mumbai Police have booked four MNS workers at Worli under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for violating the order prohibiting public celebration of the festival. “”Four members of MNS have been arrested by Worli Police for violating the norms against celebrating the festival last night,” said Dyaneshwar Chavan, additional commissioner of police Central region.MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande, who organised the Dadar event, said: “It was the 50th year celebration at Khandke building and we celebrated it despite the ban by the government.

In its judgment, the top court observed that the construction of the two towers, comprising total 1000 flats, was carried out illegally.Also Read | 'You are in cahoots with them’: Supreme Court roasts Noida Authority over Supertech towersA two-judge bench of the apex court, comprising Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah which, during the previous hearing, pulled up the Noida Authority for its "shocking use of power" in sanctioning the structures, observed in its final judgment that their construction was due to a "collusion" between officials of the Authority and Supertech.In the last hearing, on August 5, the bench reserved its order over the demolition of the towers, named Apex and Ceyane.In its final order, the Supreme Court said that the demolition should be done within a period of two months, adding that Supertech will have to carry out the exercise at its own cost. Additionally, every flat owner will have to be paid a reimbursement at an interest rate of 12 per cent.For Apex and Ceyane, the court ruled that the violation was indeed under the minimum distance requirement between the two.On April 11, 2014, the Allahabad high court issued directions to raze Apex and Ceyane observing that these stood too close to each other. This, the high court noted, was against the minimum distance of 16 metres as required under the Noida Building Regulations, 2010. It also noted that Supertech did not take consent of the homebuyers as mandated by the Uttar Pradesh Apartment Owners Act, 2010.The demolition order was challenged in the Supreme Court by Noida Authority and Supertech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/sc-orders-demolition-of-supertech-s-twin-towers-in-noida-101630393679105.html

They all died recently.The leader quoted above said the tour had to be postponed as Raje’s daughter-in-law was unwell. The BJP stalwart will visit Ajmer, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Banswara and Udaipur districts during her visit, he said. “Raje may come to Jaipur before the start of the assembly session on September 9. Her tour is likely to begin after the session,” he said.She may also visit Tripura Sundari and Charbhuja Nath temples during her 2-3 day long tour, he added.Talk of Raje’s tour after the controversy over the absence of her picture from the Jan Aashirwad Yatra posters has created a buzz in the state BJP, particularly among senior leaders, who see it as an attempt by Raje to increase her visibility and following keeping the 2023 assembly elections in mind.“On Saturday she went to Aligarh and met relatives of late governor Kalyan Singh, and visited the Mahadev temple there. She has started [her] tour with this and will continue the same in Rajasthan after the assembly session. The former CM is planning these visits to maintain her relevance,” said a senior party MLA, who didn’t wish to be named.He said while the people close to her call it a “personal” tour, it is meant to increase her activities as the elections are now little over two years away. “A similar attempt was made by her in March with a two-day yatra in Bharatpur region, a show of strength on her birthday. The yatra was attended by a large number of MLAs, MPs, ex-MLAs and MPs. The issue was also raised before the Central leadership,” he said.Political analyst Manish Godha said such tours were like warm up exercises before the polls which will also boost workers’ morale while keeping her politically relevant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/vasundhara-raje-s-plan-to-visit-udaipur-and-ajmer-divisions-creates-buzz-in-bjp-101630392225940.html

31-08-2021||Bangalore||Seven dead in Audi car crash in Bengaluru||Seven people, aged between 20 to 30, were killed when an overloaded and speeding luxury Audi car lost control and first rammed into bollards and later a building in Bengaluru’s Koramangala on Tuesday, police said. Karuna Sagar, son of Tamil Nadu’s ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam lawmaker Y Prakash, was among those killed in the accident. The six others were identified as Ishita, Dhanush, Akshay Goyal, Utsav, and Rohit. Joint police commissioner (traffic) B Ravikanthe Gowda said the speeding car carrying seven people lost control around 1:45 am and crashed into the building. “The car was completely mangled in the accident. None of the passengers were wearing seat belts; so, the airbags did not open,” said Gowda. He added six of the seven died on the spot while the seventh succumbed on the way to a hospital. “Traffic police personnel reached the location within 10 minutes of the accident and were taking the injured person to the hospital, but he died on the way.”A second traffic police officer cited the CCTV footage from a building near the accident scene and said it shows the car passing through in a fraction of a second. “Looking at the footage, we suspect that car was speeding at over 150 km per hour,” said the officer, who did not want to be named. The officer added the car lost control and first rammed into bollards on the road. “These bollards are heavy and sturdy, but the car was traveling at such speed that it went through them. Then after hitting the bollards, the car crashed onto the Punjab National Bank building. The car hit a corner of the building. Since the ground floor of the building was slightly elevated, the car hit a solid concrete block.”Vishwanath, who lives close to the accident site, said when he came out after hearing a loud noise, he saw a lot of smoke coming from the vehicle. “...though we wanted to check on them, someone said the car could blast, so we were uncertain. But soon, we decided to pour water on the car and pull them (the occupants of the car) out,” he said. He added the person who was alive in the car after the accident was coughing. “So, he was pulled out first and police took him to the hospital in an autorickshaw. Others were clearly dead. There were three people in the front and four at the back. All of them had severe injuries or blood coming out of their mouths. It was hard to see... (there was) one woman at the back (and) something had pierced through her neck. It was very a horrible scene.”Gowda said they have filed a case under Sections 279 (rash driving on a public way) and 304 (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. “As per the preliminary investigation, this is a case of over-speeding and negligent driving. We will know if the driver was under the influence of alcohol after post-mortem.”A relative of one of those killed said he was informed about the tragedy around 3 am. “We were told that he (Rohit) had gone out with his friends. We got a call on this phone and when we reached the police station, they showed us some photos of the accident and said he had died. Rohit’s parents had passed away and he was working in a private firm in Bengaluru,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/seven-dead-in-audi-car-crash-in-bengaluru-101630386645792.html

A building is sealed in Mumbai if it has five or more Covid-19 patients, according to the current civic protocol. Chahal said on Monday people living in such buildings in Mumbai might be inconvenienced by the order but asked them to cooperate so that the pandemic could be controlled. "Given our previous experience in this regard, we need to be very vigilant about the implementation of Covid preventive measures. In this connection, as per the rules already enforced, the building in which more than 5 Covid-19 infected patients are found is sealed, must be followed," Chahal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. "Precautionary measures must be taken very strictly considering the possibility of a third wave and to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to others," he added.Also read | Covid-19 cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region rise slightly in past few daysThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release that no one would be allowed to enter these sealed buildings and people who come to provide various services would also be stopped.

31-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Another way to see Jama Masjid||They literally live in the shadow of the Jama Masjid. Right under the Mughal-era monument’s west-facing wall, towards which the attendees inside the mosque offer their prayers.This late night, the men are lying — head to feet, head to feet — on the pavement that runs along the mosque’s boundary wall. Only one man has his eyes wide open. He is sitting on a low wooden chest, staring expressionlessly at the road in front. “We are 200 people,” says Nizamuddin, 52. Dressed formally at this late hour in pants and full-sleeved shirt, he informs that “we are mazdoor”. The generic description doesn’t give justice to the specialised skills that distinguish these men. Nizamuddin agrees. “Some of us are beldar, some are raj mistri, some are carpenter, some are rang painter, some are plumber… I’m a rang painter.” As he chats on, elderly raj mistri Hamid and teenaged rang painter Farid, sleepily lying on either side of Nizamuddin, appear to listen to him now and then. Occasionally, headlights of passing bikes fall on their faces. Nizamuddin continues: “Some of us are from Bijnaur, some are from Moradabad, some are from Meerut… we are all UP wale.”Daily wage labourers in many parts of the city tend to gather at select intersections to get assignments. Such places are colloquially referred to as “labour chowk”. For these men, the pavement on which they live is their labour chowk. “Contractors needing hands for building projects come here to hire us.”Gesturing towards the many bags lining the pavement wall, Nizamudddin says they contain beddings and clothes. “No outsider touches our bags.” The wall is scrawled with mobile numbers of the men who live here. Nizamuddin talks of a “public nalka (tap)” nearby under which the men wash themselves, and their clothes.It’s now midnight. Most shops have rolled down their shutters. Traffic has thinned. Rats the size of pigeons are out of their hiding holes. And the historic Jama Masjid is looming over like a giant seaside cliff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-another-way-to-see-jama-masjid-101630371656737.html

31-08-2021||Noida||Noida aviation hub to get bigger||The civil aviation hub at Jewar, which includes the upcoming Noida International Airport on 5,000 hectares along Yamuna Expressway, is set to get bigger as the Yamuna expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) has decided to add another 1,000 hectares to the project by merging three proposed industrial sectors with the airport plan.The airport is billed to be the largest in India, and will be the National Capital Region’s third, after the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) and the civilian terminal at Ghaziabad’s Hindon airport. In December 2020, the Uttar Pradesh government approved the design of the airport at Jewar.“Earlier, we planned the aviation hub on 5,000 hectares. But now, due to demand for more industrial land and other requirements, we have decided to merge three industrial cities planned in sectors 8, 30 and 31 with this project. These three sectors were planned on around 1,000 hectares. Therefore, now the aviation hub, which includes the Noida international airport, will be developed on 6,000 hectares. We are revising the master plan of the civil aviation hub accordingly,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida and NIAL, the nodal agency of the UP government to monitor the airport project.The three sectors were among four proposed industrial cities to be built along the periphery of the Noida international airport. Officials said the fourth city, Sector 7, will now be built as a separate project.“It was merged with the aviation hub as we realised MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) of aircrafts has a huge potential to create millions of jobs in this region for skilled workforce,” said Singh.MRO units ensure service worthiness of an aircraft with facilities for inspection and maintenance. The upcoming MRO facility at Jewar will be the first of its kind in Uttar Pradesh, officials said.Yeida and NIAL have already handed over 1,334 hectares of the total 6,000 hectares to Yamuna International airport private Limited -- a special purpose vehicle set up to undertake the airport project -- which has begun constructing boundary walls and levelling the land. The airport project is expected to be completed by 2024 and will entail an investment of around ₹20,000 crore.Further, the authorities also plan to develop a smart city -- modelled on European cities -- on 1,400 hectares of land near the airport.“In the European model, we have commercial spaces on the ground and residential condominiums above it. The smart city near the airport will be a one of its kind urban development with all world-class facilities, zero waste discharge into soil, and best commuting options,” said Singh.‘Economy boost’Singh said the airport project will boost the local economy, creating jobs for residents and business opportunities for investors.“The local economy will witness a seven-fold jump as huge investment is being made by foreign and domestic investors after the airport project picked up pace at Jewar. We have received around ₹15,000 crore in the last three years. This region (along Yamuna Expressway) will generate around 500,000 jobs in the next three years,” said Singh.He further said that several new projects, including warehouses, entertainment zones, amusement parks, apparel parks, logistics hub and film city, will come up once the airport becomes operational in 2024.“The airport will create rental incomes for farmers and other stakeholders because MNCs and industrialists are on way to set up their businesses. The airport at Jewar will fuel growth just like the IGI airport did for south Delhi and Gurugram,” said Singh.Hurdles along the wayLand acquisition for the project was a challenge initially as farmers refused to part with their land and demanded compensation four times the existing circle rate. Officials said that with negotiations running into a stalemate, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh held multiple meetings with farmers to push for acquisition.The MLA said, “We are also requesting the government to set up a skill university for creation of jobs for the local youngsters.”In his comments last month when the state government finalised the airport’s design, Christoph Schnellmann, CEO of the Yamuna International Airport Pvt Limited, said, “We are committed to developing the aviation ecosystem in India, with an investment of ₹5,700cr for phase I of the airport development. The Noida International Airport will hold strategic importance and will be an economic engine for growth in Uttar Pradesh and India.”In November 2019, Zurich Airport International AG (ZAIA) won the contract to build and operate the airport in Greater Noida for a period of 40 years, which includes the phase one construction period of four years.Last year, a consortium of Nordic Office of Architecture, Grimshaw, Haptic and consultants STUP were selected to design the airport. The new passenger terminal is aimed to be ‘India’s greenest airport’ reaching the goal of carbon-net-zero targets as well as efficient and enhanced passenger flows and digital services.Officials have said that Jewar, situated along the Yamuna Expressway, will be connected to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and also have a Metro link to Greater Noida besides the ambitious high-speed Delhi-Varanasi bullet train with a station at the Noida airport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-aviation-hub-to-get-bigger-101630367898530.html

With the two arrests, the police claimed to have solved the murder case of 36-year-old Shahnaz Akhter at Keri Gulatta village last week, they said. Akhter’s body with visible injury marks was found 100m from her house on August 24 and a special investigation team was constituted to probe her death.“The blind murder case was solved within a week with the arrest of the husband and the mother-in-law of the deceased,” sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Mendhar, ZA Jaffri said. He said an 11-member police team zeroed in on the accused persons who allegedly carried out the murder in a well-planned manner and also tampered with the evidence to escape arrest. Officials identified the arrested husband as constable Irfan Manhas who is posted with Indian Reserve Police Battalion in Srinagar. They said the couple, married with three daughters and a son, were having some family dispute. They said the accused had reached his house around midnight on August 24 and allegedly strangled his wife to death with the active support of his mother.He had left the house for his place of posting after dumping the body to evade suspicion, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-cop-mother-arrested-in-poonch-over-alleged-murder-of-his-wife-101630355865223.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Will not shift stand on restoration of Art 370: Bukhari||Apni Party president Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari on Monday demanded immediate restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood, completion of delimitation and conduct of elections.Bukhari was speaking at a press conference organised after a meeting of the party’s core group at Lal Chowk, in Srinagar, where the socio-economic political situation in J&K was discussed.Taking a dig at the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the leader said, “There is no room for shifting stands in Apni Party. Meanwhile, the PAGD which on one hand speaks about ‘No Compromise’ on Article-370 and 35A, has also become a signatory to memorandums that do not mention restoration of these special laws,” he said, adding that the PAGD must clarify whether it had given up on their demand for restoration of the Articles 370 and 35A. “I want to assure the people that we will not give up on the protection of our identity, culture, land, and jobs , which was enshrined in Article 370,” he said, adding the party had been quiet on the issue as the matter is subjudice. “Our identity and statehood have been snatched. Before the electoral process starts, we demand that the government of India restore statehood in J&K. This is the basic right of our people,” he said, adding that the delimitation process be completed at the earliest.“Our demand assumes more significance in view of the remarks made by the Parliamentary Committee on Home Affairs which in its recent visit to J&K expressed satisfaction over the security situation saying that militancy is at an all-time low and there have been no instances of stone pelting in the Valley,” he said. In the meeting, Apni Party leaders demanded a thorough security review of political activists so that they could continue with a hassle-free political process across Jammu and Kashmir. They also raised concern over the exponential increase in unemployment rates while seeking stern action against those involved in corruption irrespective of their position and status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-not-shift-stand-on-restoration-of-art-370bukhari-101630355745555.html

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Apple price slide: Farmer unions to stage protest in HP on Sept 13||Reeling due to the plummeting price of apples in the wholesale market, farmer unions in Himachal Pradesh will stage a statewide protest against the government for failing to protect the interests of apple growers in the state on September 13.Apples account for around 90% of the state’s horticultural production. The Samyukt Kisan Manch (SKM), a joint forum of farmers’ organisations, on Monday announced that a statewide protest will be organised on September 13 over the falling prices of apple and the problems being faced by the agrarian community in the state. Should the government fail to take corrective steps, a mega protest will be carried out September 26. Representatives of around 20 farmer unions along with political leaders cutting across political lines met at the Kalibari Hall in Shimla. The leaders who attended the meeting included Harish Chauhan, Sanjay Chauhan, Deepak Singha, Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, KN Sharma, Rajesh Chauhan, Rajinder Chauhan, Sushil Chauhan, Dimple Panjata, Sandeep Mastana, Sohan Thakur, Satyawan Pundir, Aam Aadmi general secretary SS Jogta, Zilla Parishad member Vishal Shangta, BJP’s mahila leaders Neelam Saraik and Shimla’s former deputy mayor Harish Janartha besides Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh and CPI(M) legislator Rakesh Singha. SKM convener Harish Chauhan said that the September 13 protest will be held at block and subdivisional level. “All delegates agreed that the agriculture sector was in crisis. While production cost is steadily increasing, farmers are not getting a reasonable price for their produce, ultimately affecting their livelihood,” said Chauhan. “Though the numbers of markets have increased, but government agencies like agricultural produce market committees (APMCs) that have been entrusted with the responsibility to protect interest of farmers have failed in their objective,” he said, adding that due to the lack of intervention by the government growers are not getting a fair price for their produce and the exploitation by traders and arthiyas is increasing,” said Chauhan. The Kisan Morcha also condemned urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj’ statement at the Parala Market wherein he said that the prices are decided on the bases of demand and supply. “His statement reflect the pro-corporate attitude of the state government,” said Chauhan ,adding that horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur had pulled a disappearing act at a tike when the orchardists were in a crisis. The Kisan Morcha also raised 10 main demands, including implementation of the market intervention scheme (MIS) to stop the exploitation of apple growers. Under the MIS, A, B and C grade apples should be purchased at a support price of ₹60, ₹44 and ₹24 per kg respectively. APMC law should be strictly implemented in the markets of the state. Open bidding should take place and arbitrary charges being imposed on farmers in the name of labour charge, discount and bank charge should be nullified and amount recovered should be returned to the farmers, the farmers’ union said. As per the APMC Act, the payments to the farmers should be ensured on the day of procurement. “Strict action should be taken against the traders and the agents who are yet to pay farmers. The hike in prices of packaging material should be withdrawn.The government should provide compensation to the farmers for the loss caused due to hailstorm and unseasonal rains, snowfall and drought, Chauhan said. The unions have demanded that increase in transportation charges should be rolled back and apple and other fruits crops should be sold on the basis of weight. Payments for the apple crop lifted by HPMC and HIMFED should be released immediately. The subsidy on fertilizers, seeds, insecticides and fungicides and farm tools should be restored. The outstanding subsidy of sprayers, tillers, anti-hail nets,should also be released immediately.“ Plummeting rates of apples is not a political issue, it is the moral responsibility of leaders cutting across the political parties and all elected representatives of the apple growing regions to stand for the cause,” said Singha. Vikramaditya Singh said, “Stalwart leaders Virbhadra Singh, Vidya Stokes andNarinder Bragta have stood with apple growers. The apple economy is in deep crisis and fruit growers must unite against the forces manipulating the prices in the market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apple-price-slide-farmer-unions-to-stage-protest-in-hp-on-sept-13-101630354786423.html

To increase the salaries of the employees as per the DC rate, the annual budget needs an additional amount of about ₹3 crore to ₹4 crore. “The UT’s finance department hasn’t decide on the salary hike of the NHM staffers and the health department is waiting for its response before giving written assurance to the protesting employees,” said Arun Gupta, UT principal secretary, health. Since 2013, NHM employees in Chandigarh have been working below the pay scale of DC wage rate while the protesting employees claim that their monthly salaries are insufficient to meet their daily needs. The agitating employees on Monday staged a protest at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, and raised slogans against the UT administration and the central government. “Even on a day of festival, the NHM members, including paramedical, managerial employees and ANMs, participated in the protest. Instead of going to the temple, all the employees offered their prayers from the protest site so that the administration fulfils our genuine demands,” said Amit Kumar, general secretary, NHM union, adding that they will continue to suspend the health services until their demands are met. Due to non-availability of NHM workers at the government health and wellness centres, especially in the rural areas, the general out-patient department services and Covid vaccination drive were hit badly. “From 9am to 5pm on Tuesday, five of the NHM employees will go on a hunger strike while others will continue to protest against the administration. Soon, our family members will join our stir and will be a part of our sit-ins,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nhm-staffers-stir-chandigarh-admn-yet-to-take-call-on-pay-hike-101630354369338.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: 32-bed paediatric ICU centre to come up at GMSH-16||To tackle the spread of Covid infection among children during the possible third wave of the pandemic, the Government Multi Speciality Hospital (GMSH) in Sector 16 has decided to set up a 32-bed dedicated paediatric ICU centre. As per medical experts, the third wave could be more aggressive and is likely to affect the unvaccinated people. “The dedicated paediatric unit will be built at the hospital’s vacant nursing hostel. Since the nursing hostel was shifted to the campus of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, we had enough space for this centre. The paediatric centre will have 12 ventilators while the remaining 20 beds will have medical oxygen facility,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, health services, Chandigarh.“A team of experts will be available around the clock at the centre to monitor the children. In case of emergency, we will expand the facility. The project is at tendering stage and the ICU centre will start functioning in a month,” he added. The Sector-16 hospital already has 20-bed ICU facility for kids which has eight ventilators and 12 beds with oxygen facility at the hospital’s surgical ward.“Since very few children were infected with the virus during the first and the second surge, we are expecting low severity among the paediatric population again. Despite that, we are upgrading the facilities and taking no chance. Even if the new centre takes some time to start functioning, we already have 20 ICU beds available at present to handle the situation,” Dr Nagpal said. Other government hospitals in Chandigarh are also ramping up their facilities. GMCH-32 has also reserved 14 ventilators at its paediatric ICU (for children below 10), while a dozen ventilators are available at the neonatal care facility. During the second wave of the pandemic, around 10 ventilators were dedicated for the paediatric population at the NHE Covid Block of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). Besides, PGIMER also had 35-bed ICU with oxygen facility at the institute’s paediatric department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-32-bed-paediatric-icu-centre-to-come-up-at-gmsh16-101630354364555.html

The minister, who was virtually delivering the third Balramji Das Tandon Memorial Lecture hosted by Panjab University, said the initiatives being taken to strengthen India’s national security are unprecedented. “In the recent years, there has been a lot of change in the action taken by the Indian Army. The confidence and morale of the army is high, which can be estimated from the fact that in the last seven years, it has not allowed a single major terror activity take place in the hinterland,” said Rajnath Singh. He said the Pakistan-backed terrorism is slowly subsiding in India. “Lately, Pakistan had increased ceasefire violations on the border, but they always got a befitting reply from the Indian Army. At present, India is taking actions not only against terrorism within the country, but also successfully destroying terror outfits across the border,” he added. The Union minister said the entire world is now aware of India’s strength. Referring to China, he said, “We have had a perceptual difference with China for a long time. The agreed protocol between the two nations was ignored by China, after which the Indian Army once again showed its valour to the world by responding to Chinese PLA.”During the programme, BJP leader Sanjay Tandon said deriving inspiration from his father, he was also trying to uplift the society through Competent Foundation and Balramji Das Tandon Charitable Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/country-needs-to-upgrade-itself-rajnath-singh-101630354245755.html

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana, Punjab CMs locked in wordy duel over farm agitation||A verbal battle erupted between the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana on Monday over the ongoing farm protests as controversy raged over police action on cultivators two days ago in Karnal and farm groups issued an ultimatum to the state government.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar accused the Congress government in Punjab of driving the farmers’ agitation against the BJP-led Centre’s three farm laws. “Isme Punjab government ke logon ka haath hai. I’m levelling a serious allegation here. Otherwise (farmer leader) Balbir Singh Rajewal would not have been offering sweets to the Punjab chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh),” he said at a press conference in Chandigarh.Khattar said that 85% of those sitting at the Singhu and Tikri borders adjoining the national capital were from Punjab.On Amarinder asking him to apologise to farmers, Khattar said: “Who is he to ask me to apologise or resign. Rather, he should resign for instigating farmers. You can count people sitting on Delhi’s borders. They are mostly from Punjab, not from Haryana. Farmers of Haryana are satisfied.”Later in the evening, he posed a series of questions to the Punjab CM. He said Haryana procured 10 crops at minimum support prices, provided incentives, late payment fees and irrigation facilities, and asked what Punjab had done for farmers. Khattar said the protesting farmers should adhere to norms of democracy.“A positive dialogue was held between these protestors and district administration wherein they had given written consent that they would only protest in a symbolic manner and will not violate the law-and-order situation. However, it is really unfortunate to see that how at the behest of some politically motivated leaders, they had broken their promise,’’ the CM added.Hours later, Amarinder Singh hit back. “The BJP’s adamant refusal to revoke the laws reflected the vested interests of the party and its leadership, which had once again placed their crony capitalist friends over the common man....the crisis would not have assumed such grave proportions had the BJP heeded the farmers’ concerns and empathised with them,” he said. He said Khattar’s “anti-farmer” agenda was exposed. “Can’t you see that the farmers of your own state are angry with you for your apathetic attitude towards them and your party’s stubborn refusal to repeal the farm laws?” he asked.Khattar and Karnal magistrate Nishant Yadav shielded under-fire sub-divisional magistrate, Ayush Sinha, who stirred a row on Saturday by instructing police to “break the heads” of farmers during a protest against three central laws. Farm groups say police thrashed protesters without any provocation. One person died and another 10 were injured.“He (Sinha) should not have used such language though it is the job of officials to enforce law and order. I’m not saying he should not have enforced the rule of law strictly,” he said. The CM clarified that Sinha was deputed at a spot about 10-12 kilometres away from the spot where the lathi-charge took place.A 2018 batch officer, Sinha was heard instructing police personnel to hit farmers on the head if they broke barricades to disrupt a BJP meeting on Saturday.“Some words shouldn’t have been used. As head of Karnal administration, I express my regret. But SDM, on duty, is a sincere officer. He used some words in heat of the moment, he shouldn’t have. But his intention wasn’t wrong,” said Yadav. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala had on Sunday promised action against Sinha amid mounting criticism of the lathi-charge on farmers.The lathi-charge on protesters has sparked protests across Punjab and Haryana with farm groups blocking highways in several places. On Monday, farmers from across the state gathered for a mahapanchayat in Gharaunda town and sought registration of a case against those involved in the lathi- charge.They also threatened to lay siege to the secretariat if their demands were not met by September 6. “Our brothers suffered injuries in the lathi charge...Officials involved in it, be it the SDM or police officials, a case against all of them should be registered,” said Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni.The three farm laws were passed last year but sparked protests from farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other states. Since last October, tens of thousands of farmers have been siting in protest against the laws on the edges of the Capital -- a majority of whom hail from the foodbowl states of Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-punjab-cms-locked-in-wordy-duel-over-farm-agitation-101630354184959.html

He also said that women heads of BPL families will be entitled to a grant of ₹2,000 per month. “Development work which has been halted completely by Capt Amarinder Singh will be restarted,” he said.Badal said he has planned to set up a mega solar plant, and the power generated from there will be offered to the people of the state for free.Earlier during the day, SAD supremo Sukhbir Singh Badal faced protesting farmers during his visit to Machhiwara. Badal was visiting the town to meet party workers.

However, only a few departments have agreed to fully adopt it.The Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) has already opposed the move. The varsity has now constituted a 17-member panel to go through the suggestions received from various departments/centres. The response from the departments was sought in May. The panel headed by dean university instructions (DUI) will prepare a consolidated reply which will be sent to UGC.UGC in May had said institutes will be allowed to teach up to 40% of each course, other than SWAYAM courses, online and the remaining 60% syllabus could be taught offline.Issues stated by departmentsA number of PU departments in their suggestions stated that there was a need to develop necessary infrastructure essential for blended mode of teaching-learning, which will need additional budget.

A few departments have also said that there is a growing dissatisfaction among stakeholders on the feasibility of this system, which is evident from the feedback forms submitted by students at the end of the semester.The departments have said that there was a need for orientation programmes for faculty and students about the use of technology for online academic activities.

This is for sure...The Manohar Lal Khattar government has no right to remain in power,” the Sena said.It said the lathicharge incident might make farmers in India revolt and take revenge for each drop of blood that was shed by them.“The farmers in Haryana were lathicharged on their heads because they raised slogans against CM Khattar. A Union minister speaks of attacking the chief minister of Maharashtra and when action is taken against him legally, the state government is called intolerant.

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Half of working women in rural Punjab have an average debt of ₹1.5 lakh||Nearly half (48.38%) of the working women in rural Punjab have an average debt of ₹1.51 lakh, a study by the Punjab State Farmers and Farm Workers Commission has revealed. Also, women construction workers in the state are the most distressed as majority of them have no access to bank credit and depend on non-institutional sources, thus paying interest rates as high as 13.55%. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents interviewed in the study demanded that the government should roll out financial assistance schemes for them, says the study on women involved in agriculture and allied sector activities like dairying and poultry; manufacturing, construction, retail trade, education, health, social work, and domestic services. The working women in rural areas contribute substantially to their household incomes, it was found. The study was conducted in 74 villages of all districts and 20 working women were selected from a village, thus covering a total of 1,480 respondents. One-third of the households have deficit incomes wherein expenditure is more than earnings. Most of these households have a family member suffering from an ailment for many years. But most (80%) of them benefitted from the state government’s Atta-Dal scheme and are aware of the government run schemes for the poor. Women working as farm labourers want to work for more days in a year. Also, the average daily wage is a meagre ₹213 while it is ₹128 for those working as domestic helps. Besides, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) contributes just 4.6% of the total household income of rural women with an average annual earning of Rs. 2,780. An average woman domestic worker owns assets worth ₹26,000, a construction worker ₹53,000 and a farm labourer to the tune of ₹95,000, the study says. On the other hand, women involved in cultivation or dairying own assets worth ₹30 lakh, the highest average, followed by women working in health and education sectors who possess average assets to the tune of ₹27.28 lakh and ₹25.20 lakh. Their expenditure on house construction is nearly 75% of the total spending. In rural Punjab, women constitute 47% of the total population with a literacy rate of 65.8% against to 79.2% of their urban counterparts. Women comprise 42.2% of the rural workforce, according to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/half-of-working-women-in-rural-punjab-have-an-average-debt-of-rs-1-5-lakh-101630353165704.html

Being prepared mostly for consumption at the jail, these spices — powdered turmeric (haldi) and coriander (dhania) — are also available in small quantities at Srijan, an exclusive outlet in Sector 22 where all products made by the inmates are sold.At present, the jail authorities are buying raw turmeric and coriander seeds, which are ground and packaged by women inmates at its spice corner. There are also plans to grow the raw material on the jail fields. “The idea is to make the jail inmates self-sufficient and independent,” said inspector general (IG, prisons), Chandigarh, Omvir Singh Bishnoi. As of the now, the spices are sold in packets with a sticker of the Burail Jail on them. “The department is in the process to get the brand patented,” said additional inspector general (AIG, prisons) Virat, adding that it would add authenticity to the products. Besides CITCO hotels (Hotels Mountview, Shivalikview and Parkview), the department also plans to supply the spices to the police canteen and mess, UT Guest House and other places where government-supported kitchens are operating. Furniture already a hit Already, furniture and mementoes prepared by inmates at the jail factory are in great demand. The jail inmates are trained to design and make wooden chairs, tables, computer tables and desks among other furniture items. The items are exhibited with price tags at Srijan, which was inaugurated in 2019, and the jail shopping complex in Sector 51. If anyone intends to buy the furniture, it can be pre-booked and is delivered within 15-20 days, said an official. The furniture is also being supplied to many schools and colleges. Even clothes made by inmates are sold at khadi outlets in the city. The jail authorities are also supplying food prepared by inmates to anganwadi centres in the city. They also sell a special thali comprising four chapatis, rice, dal, two vegetables, raita, pickle and a sweet dish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-spices-ground-at-jail-to-add-flavour-to-food-at-hotels-101630353164510.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Garbage collectors don’t listen to us anymore, rue residents||The Chandigarh municipal corporation’s move to take over door-to-door garbage collection has dramatically changed the relationship between residents and waste lifters. The waste lifters, who were earlier employed by private contractors, have started manning the MC’s twin-bin garbage collection vehicles after the takeover in December last year.While many residents have been complaining about the implementation being sporadic, they now find even the waste lifters being “uncooperative”. “For starters, the behaviour of the garbage collectors has changed overnight. They were earlier were responsive to our suggestions. But now we have no say over their working, as they think they are answerable to the MC and not the residents,” said Pankaj Gupta, president, resident welfare association (RWA), Sector 38 West.Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, said, “Even though the same people have been employed by the MC, they have stopped picking garbage from houses on the first and second floors as they used to do earlier. This is particularly tough for the aged people who are not able to go downstairs on a short notice.”“The residents have no control over how the garbage is being collected. There is still lots of confusion, and neither the MC nor the garbage collectors are of any help nowadays,” said Pardeep Chopra, secretary, RWA, Sector 21, adding that earlier the system was much better as the RWA could easily coordinate with garbage collectors.While some residents complained that the garbage is being picked on alternate days, others claimed the workers have been skipping one day every week. A few also pointed out that garbage collectors have stopped entertaining requests for picking up the horticulture waste.‘We are just following rules’ Om Prakash Saini, chairman, Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said: “We are just following MC’s rules. In view of Covid-19, we have to maintain distance from houses. As far as the garden or horticulture waste is concerned, the MC’s two-bin vehicles are not equipped to handle it.”On the collectors taking a day off every week, Saini said: “Like in any other job, taking a day off is the right of a garbage collector. The relationship is bound to change as now the MC is the in-charge and not the waste collectors or residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhgarbage-collectors-don-t-listen-to-us-anymore-rue-residents-101630353044696.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Amid Covid curbs, BJP begins its temple run in Maharashtra||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday staged protests across Maharashtra demanding reopening of temples and other places of worship. Key state unit leaders participated in the protest demanding opening up of temples and threatened to forcefully open them next week if the demand is not met. BJP’s spiritual coordination cell organised the protest against Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s decision to prevent entry of general public to places of worship as part of restrictions imposed to check spread of Covid-19 epidemic. BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil asked all party workers, office-bearers and elected representatives to participate actively in the protest near their homes. Significantly, three days ago, Union health ministry asked the state government to restrict religious activities and celebrations during upcoming festivals amid potential threat of third wave of Covid-19. Patil led the protest at Kasba Ganpati temple in Pune, while former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar led it at Babulnath Mandir in Mumbai. Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and MP Sujay Vikhe Patil participated in protest at Sai Baba mandir in Shirdi. Party legislator Ram Kadam staged protest outside Siddhivinayak temple at Prabhadevi in Mumbai. Party’s Aurangabad leaders and workers tried to break open gates of Gajanan Maharaj Mandir in Aurangabad, following which police arrested the party workers. Patil said that their agitation was not merely for the temples. “We have been demanding opening up of temples, churches and masjids as there is unrest among the people. It is the question of sentiments of 120 million people of Maharashtra. It’s time for the Uddhav Thackeray government to wake up and take decision,” he said.Mungantiwar questioned why the state government, which allowed bars, liquor shops and malls to reopen and fully vaccinated commuters to take trains, is not allowing temples to open. “Temples in all other states have been allowed to open. Kerala, which have been reporting the highest number of cases, has allowed online darshan for worshippers. Then, why has the state government then opened other establishments? Maharashtra is the only state which has kept religious places shut. It is not true that [Narendra] Modi government has asked the state to keep temples shut,” he said after protest at Babulnath temple in Mumbai. Kadam said they were demanding opening up of temples with some restrictions. “We are not asking to violate the Covid-19 lockdown protocols, but our demand is to allow worshippers to visit temples by following Covid protocols.”However, those who participated in the protests were not seen following social distancing or other Covid protocols. The Congress, one of the three ruling parties, alleged that the Maharashtra BJP was politicising the issue despite Modi government’s orders about imposing restrictions on festivals and religious activities. State Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “Maharashtra BJP has been blatantly violating Modi government’s directions. They have been violating Covid-19 restrictions by crowding and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Why doesn’t the Maharashtra BJP protest against the Modi government for imposing restrictions on festivals? Modi government takes the state governments to task for rise in the number of patients, while party leaders have been indulging in crowding which will lead to rise in the number of patients. The BJP was responsible for intensifying the second wave, and now they are indulging in events to ensure advancement of the third wave.”Sena leader Sanjay Raut said, “The BJP should first check whether temples are open in all others states. The Modi-led Central government has asked Maharashtra and Kerala governments to take utmost care amid high number of Covid cases, and not allow festivals. Then, action should be taken against it first for the curbs (on religious activities).”On August 27, Union health and family welfare secretary Rajesh Bhushan had sent a letter to Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte asking the state government to take due precautions during festivities. “In view of the mass events and public gatherings expected during the celebrations of upcoming festivals, including Dahi handi and Ganpati utsav in Maharashtra, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings,” the letter stated.Meanwhile, the BJP also attacked state government after videos of pujas performed by Sena leaders emerged. Aurangabad district president and legislator Ambads Danve held Kawad Yatra and performed abhishek at Lord Shankar temple in Aurangabad. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane tweeted a video in which sons of Guhagar Sena MLA Bhaskar Jadhav’s sons are seen performing abhishek at a temple on Monday. Danve claimed that he did not perform abhishek but just offered holy water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-covid-curbs-bjp-begins-its-temple-run-in-maharashtra-101630352984615.html

31-08-2021||Mumbai||ED raids Sena MP’s premises in money laundering case||Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers on Monday conducted searches at seven places linked to Bhavana Gawali, Shiv Sena member of parliament (MP) from Yavatmal-Washim.ED officers along with armed CRPF jawans raided five different institutions controlled by Gawali, including Janshikshan Sanstha at Rishod, a degree college at Shirpur, an Ayurveda college at Degaon, Shri Balaji Sahakari Particle Board Karkhana Ltd at Malegaon, and Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan at Rishod. Two other places including one in Mumbai were also raided.ED officers claimed they have seized some documents from these places. They also questioned and recorded statements of some people at the places that were raided.Officers of the central agency said they have registered an enforcement case on the basis of a first information report (FIR) registered with Washim police in connection with alleged financial irregularities in a trust linked to Gawali. ED suspects Gawali’s involvement in money laundering and embezzlement of funds to the tune of ₹17 crore as well as misuse of power in obtaining government grants and funds for a project. Gawali is a five-term Lok Sabha member, representing Yavatmal-Washim constituency since 1999. ED sources said the alleged irregularities revolve around Gawali obtaining loan of around ₹43 crore from National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) through Balaji Sahakari Particle Board which was allegedly misused and not utilised for the purpose for which the loan was provided.Harish Sarda, former vice-president of Shiv Sena’s Washim district unit, had first unearthed the alleged misappropriation of funds at Shri Balaji Sahakari Particle Board Karkhana and named Gawali in his complaints to various authorities. He had also filed petition before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) after local police and other authorities did not act on his complaints. Sarda in his complaint alleged money laundering and embezzlement by misusing power by Gawali and her associates in obtaining grants and funds for Balaji plant located at Malegaon in Washim. Gawali’s father Pudalikrao, who also represented the region in the Lok Sabha, was its chief promoter. The factory was set up in 1998 to collect crop residue and use it for preparation of particle boards for making furniture, partition material and other purposes. The basic aim of the project was to provide employment to local farmers. However, the factory never started functioning. In 1998, the estimated project cost was ₹43.85 crore but undervalued to ₹7.9 crore by a firm called MITCON and was later sold to Bhavana Agro Products run by Gawali on August 16, 2010.Sarda had in his complaints stated that Gawali’s father illegally transferred 14.90 hectares of factory land to Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan in 2001 without obtaining necessary permission from competent authorities. Cooperative society land cannot be transferred to any public trust without government approval, Sarda had stated.Sarda had last year sought thorough investigation into irregularities from any central law enforcement agency like ED or Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).ED initiated an investigation in the matter and is also looking into alleged misappropriation of funds availed by Gawali’s firm Bhavana Agro Products and Service Ltd from the two banks. The agency is likely to summon Gawali for questioning. ED raids 3 places linked to Anil Parab’s aideED on Monday also raided three places in Maharashtra in connection with the Anil Deshmukh money laundering case. These places are related to Nagpur’s deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate, who is said to be closely associated with transport minister Anil Parab, a close confident of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. However, ED has not revealed the places which were raided. The central agency has already issued summons to Parab and he has been asked to attend the agency’s office in Mumbai on Tuesday. These developments have taken place after a viral video showed Parab purportedly instructing the superintendent of police of Ratnagiri to arrest Union minister Narayan Rane without waiting for an arrest warrant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-raids-sena-mp-s-premises-in-money-laundering-case-101630352504762.html

Dnyaneshwar Sawant, an employee of the company, was also sentenced to one year’s imprisonment.Among bank officials, Utsav Prasad, then customer service officer, and Ram More, then assistant general manager, were sentenced to three years imprisonment; Jayant Bijapurkar, then assistant vice-president, was sentenced to two years in jail; and Neela Samant, then assistant general manager of Opera House branch of the bank, as well as then deputy manager Nand Kumar Karnik got one year in jail.The special court, however, acquitted Kailash Chand Dayani, then assistant general manager, giving him the benefit of doubt.Public Prosecutor Jeetendra Sharma had argued for CBI and had pointed out that Vijay Seth, who expired during pendency of the trial, and Divendry, both directors of National Steel Corporation Private Limited, had forged documents like balance sheets and other documents and in connivance with bank officials availed cash credit from Opera House branch of SBI to the tune of ₹90 lakh. The amount was, however, transferred to their personal accounts, thereby committing a fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-court-convicts-5-sbi-officials-director-of-private-firm-in-loan-fraud-101630352324794.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Woman drug peddler awarded 10-year jail||A woman drug peddler, who has earlier served a two-year jail term, has been awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment by a Chandigarh court.The court also imposed a fine of ₹2.5 lakh on the woman, identified as Nirmala, alias Nimmo, of Dadumajra Colony. She was arrested for possessing 200 grams of heroin and 30 vials of psychotropic drugs during checking in Sector 40 in July 2018. Into drug trade for a decade, Nimmo was earlier booked in at least seven cases in the tricity and was jailed once for possessing 5-kg ganja. According to police, she used to roam on a scooter in Sector 38 West and its adjoining areas in search of customers. Her family members are also facing drug peddling charges in separate cases.A mother of four, the woman in court prayed for a lenient view and said there is no one else to look after her children. She said that there was no pending case against her, though she has faced trial earlier and was convicted in one case.However, public prosecutor Phool Singh argued that Nirmala is a habitual offender and the amount of the recovered contraband falls within the commercial category and does not entitle her to any leniency.“Nowadays, drug menace has become a social malady and it has attained monstrous proportions and is tearing families apart. Sale and consumption of narcotics in an illegal manner is immensely affecting the society,” Singh argued, adding that the need of the hour is to choke the supply of drugs and to curb the trade with heady hands.After hearing the arguments, the court of Dr Rajneesh, judge, special court, Chandigarh, found Nirmala guilty under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The court has also ordered that separate proceedings be initiated to confiscate the scooter that was used by her in committing the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhwoman-drug-peddler-awarded-10-year-jail-101630352204499.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Bandra, Mahim, Kandivli in Mumbai see highest new Covid-19 cases in a week||Dadar, Mahim and Matunga in central Mumbai, and Bandra West, Andheri, Kandivli and Borivli in the western suburbs reported the highest number of new Covid cases within the past week, which also corresponds to the days that Mumbai saw higher number of daily cases in comparison to one week ago. HT on Saturday reported of an increase in the daily number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai since Wednesday last week, in comparison to the dip in daily cases witnessed by the city from mid-August. Within the past week, cases have shot up to over 300 per day, whereas Mumbai had hit as low as 195 and 196 cases on August 16 and 17 respectively, and subsequently reported less than 300 cases per day until the surge. According to ward-wise data available with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) until Sunday, H-West (Bandra West), G-North (Dadar, Mahim, and Dharavi), F-North (Matunga and parts of Wadala), R-South ward (Kandivli), K-West (Andheri west), and R-Central ward (Borivli) have all reported a total of over 100 cases respectively, within the past week. This is followed by areas of Andheri East, Malabar Hill, Byculla and Bhandup, which have reported over 90 cases each over the week. The lowest number of cases has been reported in C and B ward in south Mumbai, 12 and 15 respectively, over the week. A senior civic official from the BMC’s public health department said, “These figures largely represent the number of cases reported in these respective areas. In same cases, areas that have public hospitals show a larger number of Covid-19 cases due to the tests conducted on the premises. Mumbai is still recording more cases from residential buildings, in comparison to slums. Wards which are prominently residential areas are reporting relatively higher cases.” For example, in the G-North ward (Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi), on Monday, Dharavi reported three new covid-19 cases, Dadar reported 10, and Mahim reported four. Similarly, on Sunday, Dharavi reported four new cases, Dadar seven, and Mahim 12. In mid-August, Mumbai became free of containment zones in its slums. As of Monday, no slums and chawls are in containment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bandra-mahim-kandivli-in-mumbai-see-highest-new-covid-19-cases-in-a-week-101630352145740.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||BJP, MVA polls apart; Sena the new target||The main opposition party in Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has believably decided to step up its attack against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, especially after the chances of the Sena joining hands with it to form the government became bleak. It was evident on Monday as prominent BJP leaders participated in agitations across the state demanding reopening of temples. On the other hand, Central government’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) turned the heat on Sena leaders — transport minister Anil Parab and MP Bhavana Gawali — prompting the ruling party to allege political vendetta by the BJP-led government at the Centre. Led by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and formed with the support of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, MVA has been under fire from the day one of its formation on November 28, 2019. And the BJP has stepped up the attack further in past few months and is not leaving any opportunity to corner the government and CM Thackeray, on issues such as reservation for Marathas an Other Backward Classes (OBC), handling of Covid, ban on traditional bullock cart race in western Maharashtra among others. The attack from the BJP is likely to intensify in the near future as the local body elections —considered mini assembly polls, as more than two-thirds of municipal corporations, councils of the state will go to polls — draw closer.BJP leadership has also strategically tried to corner MVA on issues related to reservation of particular communities and evoke religious sentiments on the issue of the opening up of temples. The party has blamed MVA for its failure in keeping the reservation to Marathas in jobs and education, which was quashed by the Apex court in May. BJP leaders alleged the state government did not present the grounds on which reservation was given in the Supreme Court. It blamed the MVA government after the OBC reservation in local bodies was set aside by the SC two months ago. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis has said MVA was totally against reservation to OBCs and hence it did nothing to restore it. “From day one of its formation, the BJP was expecting MVA government to crumble. The hopes were on till recently when the last ditch attempt was made two months ago ahead of the expansion of the Central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Since the hope has come to an end as the Sena did not concede to it, the opposition is targeting the state government tooth and nail. The party appears to have shifted its focus on the Sena among the three ruling allies,” said a Congress leader, requesting anonymity. Within a few months after MVA government came to power, BJP cornered it over the killing of seers in a mob lynching in Palghar. The ruling parties were then targeted in the death cases of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and celebrity manager Disha Salian last year. Former forest minister Sanjay Rathod resigned from his post in the Thackeray cabinet after allegations of his involvement in the death of a TikTok star from Pune. The BJP had launched an attack on Thackeray by holding the minister responsible for the girl’s death. Ruling parties in the state alleged ED notices to Parab and former home minister Anil Deshmukh were done out of political vendetta. However, BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “They should have some shame while alleging that the action is being taken out of vendetta. CM Uddhav Thackeray had backed former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze by questioning why he was being targeted as if he is Osama Bin Laden. Vaze was a blue-eyed boy with whom the Sena leader shared dinner and partied till he named Sena leaders saying they were behind his misdeeds. The leaders from the ruling parties should not be scared if they have not done anything wrong.” Reacting to the attacks, water resources minister and NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil said, “Not only leaders from the ruling parties, but everyone who expresses views against the BJP are being harassed by finding out cases related to them. The notices given by the central agencies will be replied to. It is a systematic attempt to defame the state government.”“As the local body elections draw closer, attack from the BJP will intensify. The BJP earlier targeted NCP and has now shifted its focus on Sena in an attempt to wrest power from it in BMC elections. Union minister Narayan Rane’s induction in Union cabinet was with the sole intention of using him against his bete noire Shiv Sena. As the possibility of re-alliance between the Sena and BJP comes to an end, the latter has stepped up the attack,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-mva-polls-apart-sena-the-new-target-101630352084477.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||University of Mumbai releases third merit list for UG courses||As the University of Mumbai (MU) released the third and final merit list for undergraduate (UG) degree courses on Monday evening, at least one coveted college added extra divisions to select courses this year owing to the increase in demand.St Xavier’s College in south Mumbai, a popular destination for students, has added an extra division of 65 seats each in self-financed courses including bachelor of mass media (BMM) and management studies (BMS) this year to incorporate a high number of applications for these courses.“State government gave us a letter stating that being an autonomous institute we need not go through the regular process for permission to start a new course or new division to the existing numbers. This will only be for the current batch, and will be functional till the current batch graduates,” said Rajendra Shinde, principal of St Xavier’s College. Earlier this month, the state government released a circular addressing it to universities and respective affiliated colleges stating that due to a higher number of students completing Class 12 this year which automatically increased the number of candidates applying for admissions, colleges have been given the option to add an extra division to certain popular courses to accommodate all students.While the government feels this decision will help accommodate more students in undergraduate degree courses, many colleges feel this will not be helpful for all. “Adding a new division will not be an easy task for colleges. While this can be managed while classes are online, soon colleges will reopen and then colleges will grapple with infrastructure constraints,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college.Overall, cut-offs in most popular colleges dropped less than a percentage point from the second to the third merit list. At RA Podar College in Matunga, cut-offs dropped by less than a percent point for BCom and BMS courses — from 95.7% in the second merit list to 95.2% in the third one.Similarly, at Mithibai College in Vile Parle, overall cut-offs across courses dropped by one to three percent points. For BCom course, it dropped from 96.3% to 93.4%.The first merit list announced earlier this month pushed cut-offs across popular colleges to 10-13% points higher compared to last year.Rising Covid-19 cases forced most school education boards to scrap Class 12 board exams this year and instead promote students based on their past performance and that during the year, following a 30:30:40 formula. This led to a rise in the overall score of students from all boards. While CBSE and ISC schools witnessed a hike in the number of students scoring 90% and 95% in their batches, the state board witnessed a 12-fold rise in the number of students scoring 90% and above this year, including 46 students who scored a perfect 100%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/university-of-mumbai-releases-third-merit-list-for-ug-courses-101630351904616.html

31-08-2021||Other||Tiffin bomb intel in Punjab: Ludhiana police beef up security||After an alert was sounded in Punjab over the possibility of a tiffin-bomb attack, heavy police force was deployed outside temples and other religious places in Ludhiana on the occasion of Janamashtami on Monday evening.Director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta, in a review meeting of senior officers, had asked all police personnel to stay alert ahead of the festival season and keep an eye out for abandoned things, including tiffin boxes, mobile phones, boxes and other such things.Following the directions of the DGP, Ludhiana police made special security arrangements outside temples.

31-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra got 5L extra Covid-19 vaccine doses in August: Centre||The Central government, in an affidavit in response to the public interest litigation (PILs) which sought better administration of the CoWin portal and app and streamlining of allocation and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to the state, has informed the Bombay High Court that Maharashtra was given five lakh additional doses for August. The affidavit states that instead of the 86.74 lakh doses which were allocated, the state received 91.81 lakh doses from the manufacturers. The affidavit also stated that work on addressing the issue of permitting jab beneficiaries to make corrections on their vaccine certificates on CoWIN portal was under development and would be available soon, especially the fake vaccination drive victims in Mumbai city. The affidavit filed by Satyendra Singh, under-secretary, department of health and family welfare, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has stated that the Centre had been procuring 75% of the vaccines being manufactured and allocating it to states and union territories for free. The affidavit adds that a month-long date wise allocation schedule has already been provided to the states and supplies of the vaccine are being provided based on it. In the previous hearing of the PILs, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had been informed by advocate Jamsheed Master for petitioner Yogeeta Rajesh Vanzara and advocate Anita Castellino for petitioner Siddharth Chandrashekhar that many vaccination centres had been unable to provide slots due to shortage of supply. The bench was also informed that the facility to make corrections in Covid vaccine certificates on the CoWin portal was not fully functional. The court had directed the centre to respond to the same and had sought an affidavit enumerating the number of doses being provided to the state of Maharashtra and the status of the correction facility. While responding to the issue of making corrections on the CoWin portal, the affidavit states that while correction of dates of both doses has been resolved and users can rectify the same and download the certificate with correct dates after the technical glitches in the software have been resolved. The affidavit adds that work on allowing further corrections is underway and would be made available soon to all users including those who were victims of fake vaccination drives. The PILs were listed for hearing on Monday but due to paucity of time will be taken up on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-got-5l-extra-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-august-centre-101630351664918.html

31-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Slight rise in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region but no need to worry yet’||Covid-19 cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) have seen a slight surge in the past 15 days. In mid-August, Mumbai had reported around 250 cases every day, while in the past five days, it has been clocking around 350 cases daily. Significantly, suburban trains in Mumbai have been opened for fully-vaccinated travellers since August 15. However, state health department officials said the surge it is not a trend and that easing of restrictions could have resulted in the minuscule increase in fresh cases.On Monday, Maharashtra reported 3,741 Covid-19 infections to take its tally to 6,460,680. It added 52 deaths, taking the toll to 137,209. The active case count in the state was 51,834 on Monday.As per the state health department, Mumbai recorded around 325 cases on August 1, which declined to 262 on August 15. On August 29, the city reported 345 fresh cases. Similarly, Navi Mumbai had 72 new cases on August 1, which decreased to 51 on August 15, but rose to 87 on Sunday. Kalyan-Dombivli and Vasai-Virar, too, have shown a similar increase in the past 15 days. Thane city reported 67 cases on August 1, which decreased to 50 in mid-August. On Sunday, 44 were cases reported.In the past few days, there has been an increase in fresh Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, against the dip in daily cases in mid-August. Cases have shot up to over 300 per day, whereas Mumbai had hit as low as 195 and 196 infections on August 16 and 17 respectively. After August 17, the city reported less than 300 cases daily.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, said: “Cases in Mumbai and rest of MMR could have seen some minor increase, but it is not a trend,” adding that that overall, there is a downward trend in the state and even in MMR. When asked if opening up of local trains earlier this month could have resulted in the increase, he said, “It is too early to judge that, but easing of restrictions does have some impact [on viral activity].” A senior health department official added, “It take about two incubation cycles or 28 days to see the impact of any restriction being eased or imposed. It has only been 15 days since trains were accessible to more people. By mid-September, we will know if the opening up of trains has had any significant impact on viral activity.”The slight increase in cases in the region has, however, left a section of officials and civic authorities worried, especially with the festive season approaching. The state government on Monday issued an order, prohibiting all public gatherings such as community rituals, cultural events and human pyramids for the Dahi Handi festival in the state. The order issued by the state home department directed to organise symbolic events and telecast them through local cable TV networks and online to avoid crowding in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic and concerns expressed by the Central government in this regard.State health minister Rajesh Tope indicated that the festive season is a cause of concern, with Ganeshotsav – one of the biggest festivals in the state – round the corner. “I spoke to the Kerala health minister to understand the surge in cases there. The minister attributed it to Onam festivities, celebrated by a large number of people. The second reason the minister said was an increase in testing. They tested around 50,000 samples a day, which was increased to 175,000,” said Tope. He added that all the Covid-19 protocols have to be followed by all those going to Konkan for Ganeshotsav, which falls on September 10. “People heading to Konkan for Ganeshotsav must go but the rules and protocols issued by the state must be followed in public interest,” he said. Meanwhile, the minister added that there is no decision to introduce night curfew so far. “The Centre has given guidelines for night curfew for Kerala and Maharashtra. These guidelines are studies by the CM (chief minister), health department and the [Covid] task force. However, so far there has been no decision on it. However, a discussion on this will be held and the CM will take an appropriate decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/slight-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-but-no-need-to-worry-yet-101630351365504.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Nominations filed for UCPMA polls||Nominations for the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) elections were filed on Monday. The polls are scheduled for September 3.For the post of president, veteran industrialist Avtar Singh Bhogal will be up against four-time and incumbent president DS Chawla. Also, Prince Bansal of Chawla group will contest against another veteran industrialist, Gurcharan Singh Gemco, for the post of senior vice-president.Before filling of nominations, member of Sachdeva (United Alliance) group led by Bhogal had sent invitations to all members of the association to assemble at a local restaurant on Dugri Road. On the other hand, members of Chawla group were campaigning door-to-door to garner support and calling voters over the phone.Compared to Sachdeva group, Chawla group has given an opportunity to newcomers this time, who are relatively younger. During the association’s annual general meeting (AGM) on August 18, Chawla was allegedly assaulted and his turban was tossed. He has accused the opposition’s Avtar Singh Bhogal, Gurmeet Singh Kular and Gurcharan Singh Gemco for orchestrating the attack.Later, the police booked 31 people including Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) president and industrialist Gurmeet Singh Kular, cashier Asru Ram Gupta and members Walaity Ram, Vicky Kular, Satnam Singh Makkar and Rajinder Singh Saholi under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs) and 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of the offence committed in the prosecution of common object) of Indian Penal Code. The then police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal had also marked an inquiry into the matter.On the other hand, Bhogal, Kular and Gemco said the allegation are baseless and accused Chawla of not allowing the members, who were raising the issue of corruption in the UCPMA, to enter the venue where the AGM was taking place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nominations-filed-for-ucpma-polls-101630351314923.html

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Monsoon in Chandigarh: August was driest in five years||With just 168.3 mm rain recorded in Chandigarh this month, this August has been the driest since 2016, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) records. The trend is likely to continue in September too, with chances of heavy rain remaining low.Overall, too, the rain recorded this monsoon has remained the lowest since 2016. With 427.7 mm showers since June 1, monsoon is 39% deficient at this point. The season comprises four months from June to September. “Rain received across the region has been on the lower side. During monsoon, if low pressure areas form over the Bay of Bengal and then travel to this region, it brings a good amount of rain. However this time, the systems dissipated in the central India. Interaction of easterly winds with westerly winds, which can also bring rain in this region, was also missing,” said Manmohan Singh, director, IMD, Chandigarh. While it is too early to give predictions for September, Singh said that heavy remain will be unlikely though scattered showers are expected to continue in Chandigarh. According to the IMD, the average date for monsoon withdrawal is September 23.Meanwhile, maximum temperature in the city went down from Sunday’s 34.8°C to 32.9°C on Monday.

31-08-2021||Mumbai||Within a week, 36% rise in sealed buildings in Mumbai||With the rise in the number of cases, the city saw a surge in the number of sealed buildings by 36% and sealed floors in the past one week. Mumbai civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal has now asked civic administration to be on alert in anticipation of a third wave of the pandemic. According to the civic body’s Covid protocol, it seals a floor or floors of a building if one or less than five cases are reported. Further, an entire building is sealed if five or more cases are found in it. As per the data, as of August 22, there were 22 sealed buildings and 1,089 sealed floors in the city. According to the data, as of August 28, the city had 30 sealed buildings and 1,107 sealed floors. The number of containment zones has, however, remained zero.

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Zirakpur: Mohali ADC finds seven illegal colonies in Zirakpur||There are seven illegal housing colonies in Gazipur and Nabha areas of Zirakpur. These are the preliminary findings of the probe being carried out into the mushrooming of illegal colonies in the town. Mohali additional deputy commissioner (general) Komal Mittal, who is conducting the probe, has also alleged that despite repeated requests, the Zirakpur municipal council (MC) is not cooperating with her.“I have looked into seven colonies in two areas so far. I found that they were constructed illegally. However, officials of the Zirakpur MC are not cooperating with us in providing the required documents. The complete report will be ready within a week,” said Mittal.The inquiry was ordered after a joint action committee of local resident welfare bodies submitted a complaint about illegal colonies to the Punjab chief minister’s office in July this year. Mittal said most colonisers have taken no-objection certificates (NOC) for plots of smaller sizes and later merged them to raise high-rise buildings, which is against the regularisation policy of 2018.Also, most colonisers did not even leave space for roads earmarked in the master plan, constructing buildings there, she said.Joint action committee president Sukhdev Chaudhary, who is leading the campaign against illegal colonies, said: “Colonisers are constructing illegal colonies in connivance with MC officials. If they hand over the documents pertaining to illegal colonies to the ADC, they will be in the dock.”Girish Verma, executive officer, Zirakpur MC, said: “I have joined recently, and will find out that why the officials concerned are not providing documents to the ADC.”According to the Punjab local government department, there are 59 illegal colonies within the Zirakpur MC limits even though sources say the number could be much higher. Most of these colonies were developed after the master plan was notified.In February 2018, then Mohali ADC Charan Dev Singh Mann had also submitted a report, in which he cited alleged connivance between MC officials and builders as the root cause for the mushrooming of illegal colonies in Zirakpur. “The situation on the ground is alarming and the safety of buyers and their hard-earned money is at stake,” he had said in the report.Even the Zirakpur MC House comprises mainly of realtors and colonisers. Of the 31 councillors, as many as 20 are into real estate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-mohali-adc-finds-seven-illegal-colonies-in-zirakpur-101630350764535.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||ED heat on Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena leaders: Party says BJP, agency ‘hand in glove’||With two Shiv Sena leaders — a minister and a five-term member of parliament (MP) — facing action by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Sena leaders trained their guns at the central agency, saying it is “hand in glove” with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sena on Monday fought back, saying that action against party leaders was “vendetta politics”, adding that it won’t have an impact on Sena or the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.A week after the Uddhav Thackeray-led government took action against union minister Narayan Rane and arrested him over his slap remark, the heat on Sena has been turned by the ruling party at the Centre.After state transport minister Anil Parab received a notice from ED on Sunday, properties of Bhawana Gawali, Sena MP from Yavatmal-Washim, were raided by teams of the agency on Monday. Parab, who has been summoned to ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday, is unlikely to remain present before ED officials. He is expected to respond to the notice, people privy to details said.“The ED is hand in glove with BJP and this must be investigated,” Sena leader Sanjay Raut said. He also said, “For the past few days, BJP leaders had been saying that Anil Parab is next [to face ED action]. Either ED has kept one desk officer in BJP headquarters or a BJP office-bearer has been deputed as a desk officer in ED. Hence, all these actions are happening. Otherwise how did they know that Anil Parab will get notice or when he will be summoned for questioning. Kirit Somaiya, Chandrakant Patil and many others know.”Responding to the allegation, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “Everybody has the freedom to level allegations. But ED, CBI and other agencies are independent bodies that are not controlled by one person or one party.”Terming the ED notice as “love letters” Raut said, the ED notice is not a big thing. “It is not a death warrant, but a medal for us. The frequency of such love letters has increased after unsuccessful attempts to topple the MVA government, which is strong and unbreakable. Anil Parab is being targeted by the BJP and he will respond to the ED notice and cooperate with the ED’s investigation,” said Raut.Parab met Raut at Saamana office in Parel on Monday afternoon where the two leaders reportedly discussed the issue. Later, Parab met NCP’s state chief and his cabinet colleague Jayant Patil at Mantralaya. The MVA allies are expected to put up a united front on the issue. When asked if Parab will appear before ED officials, Raut said, “This is a legal battle and they have to be fought in that manner. Anil Parab is a lawyer himself, he knows what needs to be done.” Patil, however, denied that the meeting between the two was not related to the ED notice. He said, “The ED is being used to create trouble for NCP, Congress and Sena leaders. Whoever has opposed BJP in the country is facing such actions. I am confident that whichever leader from the three parties get notices, will respond to them. But there is an attempt to defame the government.”Stepping up its attack on the BJP, Raut reiterated his statement that he has names of over 100 BJP leaders who are allegedly involved in the wrongdoings. “This is vendetta politics, it is of no use. Everybody gets their turn, we, too, will have ours in Delhi. We, too, will release list of names; I stand by what I said,” he said. Raut in November 2020 said that he would release names of 120 leaders of the ruling party to the ED and Ministry of Finance and await action against them.Further, Raut dismissed the notice to Parab as an attempt to target Thackeray and said they remain unfazed by such moves. When asked if the action against Parab, who is close to CM Thackeray and his family, was a warning to Thackeray, Raut dismissed it and said, “Many people are close to the chief minister, not just one leader. Anil Deshmukh too was close to Sharad Pawar. I also got a notice. We do not worry about any such warning. You can use these agencies as weapons.Gawali, meanwhile, said that the ED raid on the institutions she runs in Vidarbha district was tryannical. Comparing the use of agencies against political opponents to the Emergency, she said, “These raids are tyrannical and akin the Emergency... I think this is being done to damage me, a five-term MP, who has been working for the people. Shiv Sena ministers and representatives are being targeted. I have institutions, including schools and Ayurveda college, which have been raided today. I did not get any notice.” Raut echoed Gawali’s view and added that such things won’t have any adverse impact on the party in the local body polls. “Shiv Sena is the target and everyone knows why it is being done. However, it will have an iota of impact on the Maharashta Vikas Aghadi. Shiv Sena’s resolve will not be dented, instead it will be strengthened. People understand everything and it will have no impact on the urban local body elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-heat-on-shiv-sena-leaders-party-says-bjp-agency-hand-in-glove-101630350585576.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Will celebrate dahi handi, say BJP and MNS||Even as the Maharashtra government prohibited all sorts of public gatherings such as community rituals, human pyramids and cultural events for the dahi handi festival to be held on Tuesday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) announced that they will defy the Covid-19 restrictions and celebrate the festival. Health experts have expressed concern and cautioned that such celebrations may turn into super-spreader events in the backdrop of the fast-spreading Delta variant.The state government asked citizens to celebrate the festival in a simple manner and at home. A circular to this effect was issued by the state home department on Monday.This is the second consecutive year the state government has banned public celebrations of festivals.As part of the curbs put in place to prevent the spread of the Covid-19, the state government has banned public celebrations of festivals as well as religious and cultural gatherings. Last week, the central government also sent an advisory to the state asking it to put curbs on festivities so that they don’t turn out to be Covid-19 super-spreaders as the threat of a third wave of the pandemic looms large.Dahi handi and Ganesh Chaturthi are major festivals in Maharashtra and are celebrated with much fanfare. Last year too, the public celebration was banned due to the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. In a meeting held on August 23, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urged organisers of the dahi handi festival to prioritise health amid the raging pandemic and set aside festivities for a while.“Celebrate dahi handi in a simple manner by holding rituals at home. Do not hold any community rituals or cultural programmes. Organise symbolic events instead and telecast them live through local cable TV network or online to avoid crowding in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic. Many mandals celebrate the festival by organising community events, in order to prevent transmission of Covid infections, and do not gather for any community events. Do not form human pyramids to celebrate the festival. Instead, hold blood donation and health camps,” states the circular issued on Monday.However, BJP accused the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of deliberately banning Hindu festivals.BJP legislator Ram Kadam, who organises dahi handi festival at Ghatkopar, said he will go ahead with his event. “We will celebrate the festival in a traditional manner and ensure that there is no crowding. The state government should have come out with rules like allowing only vaccinated people to participate and ensuring social distance. However, this has not been done. This shows that the state government is hell bent on not allowing Hindus to celebrate their festivals,” said Kadam.He said the circular displays the arrogance of the state government. “We will first go to the Ghatkopar police station and seek permission. If they give, it’s good, but if they refuse we will still proceed with our programme,” Kadam said. He also accused the state government of twisting the central government’s advisory. “Even we don’t want people to crowd and will take all precautions, just not allowing is muzzling our rights,” he added.The MNS, which is organizing a grand dahi handi at Thane, accused both the state and central government of hypocrisy. Party leader Bala Nandgaonkar said MNS will celebrate the festival come what may. “The state government cannot decide what we should celebrate. Other religions are allowed to celebrate, but when it comes to Hindu festivals all curbs are laid on us. We don’t care about the third wave,” said Nandgaonkar.“The central government allows its newly appointed ministers to undertake ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ but prohibits Dahi Handi festival. Similarly, the Yuva Sena (youth wing of Shiv Sena) can hold demonstrations disregarding Covid-19 norms and we are told to not celebrate any festival. We will go ahead with the festival,” said MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande.The Shiv Sena has accused both the BJP and MNS of playing with the lives of people. “The entire aim of both the parties is to paint us as anti-Hindu and for that they are ready to put the lives of the citizens in danger. It is the BJP-led Central Government which has asked us to impose curbs and their local party leaders are going against them,” said Sena legislator Manisha Kayande. “The dahi handi organised by Ram Kadam is a purely commercial event and has nothing to do with the festival. The state has allowed symbolic dahi handi, but what they want is a grand event which we cannot allow as we are staring at the third wave and cannot risk the lives of the people,” she added.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, expressed concern saying that the Delta variant is active in the state, which is also the fastest spreading Covid variant. As the cases doubled in Mumbai in the past ten days a lot of strict vigilance and tight adherences to Covid protocols are required to be followed. “The active Delta variant is in circulation and we need to be very cautious and careful. One must have seen, in the last ten days in Mumbai there has been a doubling of cases, which had gone down earlier. Such celebrations can become super spreader events, when we are just getting out of the second wave. We have seen what has happened after Eid and Onam in Kerala,” said Dr Joshi.“We have seen that the world is suffering with Delta strain. It is as fast as chicken pox. It is not like the old strain. The R-naught of Delta is around 10-11 and is also the fastest spreading Covid strain. The R-naught of the old strain was only 3.5. Festivities across all religions need a lot of strict vigilance, control and tight adherences to Covid protocols,” he added.On Thursday, the central government suggested the state government impose restrictions in the districts where test positivity is higher during upcoming festivals. “Even though the trajectory of daily new cases has shown a decline over the last month, there are some districts in Maharashtra which are showing early signs of upsurge in Covid-19 cases and test positivity… In view of mass events and public gathering expected during celebrations of upcoming festivals (including dahi handi and Ganeshotsav) in Maharashtra, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings,” stated a letter written Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare on August 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-will-celebrate-dahi-handi-says-bjp-and-mns-101630350584457.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s August rainfall deficit stands at 46%||With just a day left for the month to end, Mumbai’s rainfall deficit for August stood at 46% on Monday, data from the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) monitoring station at Santacruz has revealed. Till 8.30am on Monday, Mumbai had recorded 288.8mm of rain as against the monthly normal of 531.3mm. Experts and officials attributed the deficit to weakening of monsoon winds, but clarified that there are higher chances of rain for the city and its surrounding areas during the next fortnight.Light to moderate showers were felt across MMR early on Monday, with IMD’s observatory in Santacruz recording 1mm of rain up to 5:30pm. Most of the monitoring stations across the city, Thane and Navi Mumbai saw between 1 and 5mm of rain during the same period.“The offshore trough, which is an elongated low-pressure region off the coast of Maharashtra, plays an important role in bringing proper rainfall to Mumbai and the larger MMR (Mumbai Metropolitan Region) area. As the overall monsoon wind pattern across the South Asian region remained weak, the offshore trough could not gain strength during most of August. Even monsoon low-pressure systems forming over the Bay of Bengal or eastern India could not help in strengthening the offshore trough as the overall monsoon wind pattern was weak,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD student at University of Reading.Current forecasts suggest that rainfall prospects for MMR during the first fortnight of September are better than those in August and second fortnight of September, although a continuous wet spell appears unlikely in the first half of September. Under the influence of a monsoon low-pressure system, the region can expect some increase in rainfall with cloud cover on Tuesday, following which subdued or low rainfall conditions are expected to continue during rest of the week.“There might be an active rain spell around the next mid-week. For Maharashtra in general, the first fortnight of September is expected to be wetter than the second one. The interior parts of the state are expected to be benefitted by two monsoon low-pressure systems over the next two weeks, Deoras added.IMD on Monday issued yellow category storm warning for Mumbai for the next two consecutive days, indicating a very likely possibility of heavy rain at isolated locations. It issued an orange alert (very heavy rain in some locations) for Thane and Raigad for Tuesday and for Palghar on Wednesday. “On August 30, a monsoon low-pressure area is over Chhattisgarh and 15 degrees north of it is the east-west shear zone... much awaited rains will come to Rajasthan and Gujarat. For Maharashtra, too, it is good news,” said KS Hosalikar, scientist with IMD’s surface instrument division in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-august-rainfall-deficit-stands-at-46-101630350284613.html

31-08-2021||Kolkata||CBI probes rape, murder in post-poll violence in 5 Bengal districts||Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday recorded complaints of several families in five districts of West Bengal as part of its probe into post-poll violence, said officials aware of the development.Officials said statements of at least two women who alleged rape were recorded as part of this exercise.The Calcutta high court ordered CBI on July 19 to probe the violence and asked the central agency to file its report in six weeks. On Monday, CBI officers visited North 24 Parganas, Bankura, Jhargram and Birbhum districts in south Bengal. A fourth team went to Sitalkuchi in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district. In Birbhum, CBI recorded the statement of a woman who was allegedly raped in the Nanoor area. The probe agency also talked to officers of the Santiniketan police station but the state police personnel were not allowed to be present when the woman was questioned. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that she was raped because her family supported the saffron camp during the March-April polls.Birbhum is a stronghold of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) which won 213 of the state’s 294 seats as compared to the BJP’s 77 seats. In Birbhum, the BJP could win only one out of 11 seats.“The TMC unleashed a reign of terror after the polls,” said Dhruba Saha, BJP’s Birbhum unit president. In North 24 Parganas, a CBI team visited the home of TMC worker Akash Yadav who was shot dead at Jagaddal on May 2. “I gave my statement to the CBI officers. I hope justice will be done,” said Sunita Devi, the victim’s mother. BJP leader Arjun Singh, who represents the Barrackpore constituency in the Lok Sabha, dismissed the allegation. “The family is trying to divert attention. Our party was not involved in the incident,” Singh said.In Jhargram, the allegations of a tribal family at Vadui village were recorded by CBI officers where relatives of BJP worker Kishore Mandi told the officers that he was killed by TMC workers. A CBI team also visited several families in Bankura district to probe allegations of murder and rape but the officers did not talk to the media about these cases till Monday evening. The CBI team in north Bengal visited the home of BJP worker Dhiren Burman in Sitalkuchi. Burman’s body was found inside a bamboo grove on May 24. The leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, had alleged that he was murdered by TMC workers. In Kolkata, the elder brother of Abhijit Sarkar, the BJP worker who was murdered by a mob in the city’s Narkeldanga area on May 2, handed over the victim’s mobile phone to the CBI on Monday afternoon. “My brother took videos of the attacks carried out TMC workers before he was killed. Local police officers were caught in those videos. Abhijit also went live on social media using this phone. The police asked for the handset but my brother had hidden it. We suspected that the police would tamper with evidence. I have also submitted a letter that has details of the complaints we have against the Kolkata Police,” said Biswajit Sarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-probes-rape-murder-in-post-poll-violence-in-5-bengal-districts-101630349924329.html

The police also found the unit overcrowded on two visits on August 24 and September 4, 2019, with 19 and 18 occupants on each occasion respectively.“Investigations revealed that at all material times, Damandeep and some of the other registered tenants illegally sublet the unit to more tenants, in breach of the HDB rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/overcrowding-in-flat-singapore-official-jailed-for-alerting-punjab-origin-tenant-about-inspection-101630349745065.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||BJP responsible for farmers’ unrest, not Punjab: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday slammed his Haryana counterpart for defending lathi-charge on peacefully protesting farmers by putting the onus of the agitation on Punjab, saying that Manohar Lal Khattar’s remarks had exposed his government’s anti-farmer agenda. Amarinder reminded Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala that the farmers who were protesting against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting in Karnal and cops who rained lathis on them belonged to Haryana and not Punjab. He was reacting to Khattar’s and Dushyant’s allegations of Punjab being behind the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws. Had the BJP, including the Haryana CM and deputy CM, heeded the farmers’ concerns, the crisis would not have assumed such grave proportions, said Punjab CM said blaming the BJP for farmers’ wrath. He trashed Khattar’s claim that Haryana Police used force only after the farmers disturbed the state’s law and order, pointing out that the viral video of the SDM giving explicit instructions to the cops to bash up the farmers nailed the CM’s lies. “How did the SDM know that the farmers intended to resort to stone pelting etc, as claimed by Khattar?” asked Amarinder. Farmers are fighting for their survival and did not need provocation from Punjab or any other state to protect their rights, he said, adding that the sentiment of the entire country was with the farmers. Responding to Khattar’s remark on farmer leaders giving him (Captain Amarinder) laddoos after the resolution of the sugarcane farmers’ protest, the Punjab CM quipped: “You repeal the farm laws and not just the farmers but even I will share laddoos with you.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-responsible-for-farmers-unrest-not-punjab-capt-101630349626699.html

According to police, she was stabbed in the neck by a colleague on Monday morning while she was on her way to work near Doddabele Road in Kengeri.Police have arrested 27-year-old Venkatesh on charges of murder. According to police, after stabbing Anita, the victim, Venkatesh tried to take her to the hospital with help of a colleague, however, she was declared dead on arrival.Venkatesh and Anita hail from Andhra Pradesh and were working for an FMCG manufacturing company near Kengeri. “They have been in Bengaluru for the past two years and were living in the accommodation provided by the company. They were friends for a long time,” said Kengeri police officials who have registered an FIR.During the interrogation, police learned that Venkatesh had developed feelings for Anita and proposed marriage to her. However, Anita turned him down saying her parents will not agree to the marriage. As he continued to insist, she told Venkatesh that she was married to a relative back home when she was minor, but Venkatesh refused to believe her, said police.“On Monday, he approached her when she was on her way to work. He tried to convince her several times, but when she refused, he pulled out a knife and stabbed her on the neck,” said a Kengeri police official.Later, with the help of his colleagues, he took the profusely bleeding Anita to a hospital where she was declared dead. “He confessed that he had purchased the knife from a nearby shop and planned to attack her,” police officials added.Kengeri police have taken the accused into custody and recovered the knife from the scene of the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/female-stabbed-to-death-by-colleague-for-refusing-his-marriage-proposal-101630349347222.html
31-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court rejects NIA’s plea for Sachin Vaze’s custody, allows him to undergo surgery||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Monday rejected the plea of the central agency, seeking the custody of dismissed Mumbai Police officers Sachin Vaze and Sunil Mane, arrested in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder cases. Instead, the court allowed Vaze to undergo a coronary artery bypass graft surgery at a private hospital.NIA’s had on Saturday sought Vaze’s custody for two days and Mane’s custody for five days. However, after hearing both the sides on Monday, special judge Prashant R Sitre rejected NIA’s application. The court also allowed Vaze’s application for home food for a period of 60 days, if the doctors recommend the same.NIA special prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves argued that as per the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the agency can demand Vaze and Mane’s custody, who are currently in judicial custody in Taloja jail for 30 days.“We want the custody for a limited purpose. After the arrest of the last five accused in June, we have seized some incriminating materials. The roles of some key suspects – who are major conspirators both in the planting of explosives as well as in the murder case – have surfaced after the seizures,” Gonsalves told the court.He further submitted that Vaze and Mane need to be questioned on the material and new evidence available, as the agency is in its final leg of investigations.“A large amount of cash has been seized in the case and we need to find out its origin in a reverse trail. It’s a pre-planned conspiracy and the suspects have also played a key role. Vaze and Mane have dodged the investigators earlier by misleading them as the two are trained police officers. However, now they need to be confronted on the new material available,” said Gonsalves.Senior counsel Sudeep Pasbola and Raunak Naik, who appeared for Vaze, opposed NIA’s plea. They said all the grounds mentioned in the plea for custody were repetitive and nothing new or substantial was said in it. Pasbola said the application was not sustainable.“The agency’s application doesn’t have merits. The agency was acting in a callous manner. Why do they require confronting the two when they had Mane’s custody for so many days? They have all the cash and documents; they can verify whatever they want. The investigation has not progressed anywhere,” Mane’s counsel told the court.Pasbola also pointed out that the doctors at Sir JJ Hospital had given in writing that Vaze needs to undergo the cardiac surgery at the earliest, and as the fatality rate is high in government hospitals, he wanted to undergo it in Surana and Sethia Hospital that has branches in Mumbai and Thane.“Nothing can be important than this,” Pasbola told the court.He added Vaze was not even able to walk properly and he should be not given any stress during such a critical time.When the court asked Vaze if he wanted to say anything, he said: “Please don’t let me die like Stan Swamy [Jesuit priest arrested in Elgar Parishad case].”Judge Sitre then rejected NIA’s plea and allowed Vaze to undergo the surgery at the private hospital and report to the court in 15 days about the former officer’s condition.NIA is likely to file a charge sheet soon against Vaze, Mane as well as the other accused in the case – Vilas Shinde, Naresh Gor and Riyaz Kazi.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a note threatening to kill the members of the industrialist’s family.On March 5, the body of Hiran – the SUV’s owner who is an auto parts dealer from Thane – was found dumped in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.NIA eventually took over investigations in both the cases and claimed that Vaze was the main accused in the case and had carried out the crimes out of purported desperation to “restore his lost glory in police.” Later, NIA also arrested former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others who allegedly throttled Hiran in a car and dumped his body in the creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-rejects-nia-s-plea-for-sachin-vaze-s-custody-allows-him-to-undergo-surgery-101630349325881.html

Such exemption was, however, not extended to tourists who had to produce a negative certificate even if they were fully vaccinated.Monday’s order paves way for the state to extend the benefit of the exemption to tourists as well.“The High Court has allowed the application by the state government where people who are fully vaccinated, post 14 days of their second dose, can enter Goa without an RT-PCR negative test or a rapid antigen test,” Advocate Nikhil Pai, who represented the South Goa Advocates Association, the original petitioners, said.Children above two years of age will have to come with an RT PCR test report. Children below two years of age, if symptomatic, will have to carry an RT PCR report while no test report is needed if they are asymptomatic.A person who has completed two weeks since his/her second dose is considered fully vaccinated as per the orders of the High Court.Back in May when the second wave was at its peak, the High Court had asked the Goa government to insist that people entering the state be asked to produce a Covid-19 negative certificate that has been issued 72-hours prior, saying there was “no justification in the state of Goa not insisting upon a negativity certificate from persons who seek entry into Goa at this crucial juncture.”Goa has recorded 1.74 lakh cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. About 3,198 deaths have been reported more than half of which have been recorded in the months of April and May this year during the peak of the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fully-vaccinated-people-allowed-to-enter-goa-without-negative-covid-19-report-101630348998037.html

Speaking to ANI, Rawat said: “The same allegations were made earlier when I praised Navjot Singh Sidhu. We have many faces at the national level like Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. At the local level also, we have several faces like Captain Amarinder Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu and even Pargat Singh. One should not be impatient. 2022 elections are nearby and everyone is watching us. So, I believe these conflicts should have first been discussed with the right medium inside the party. I know when I need to say and what to say.”Amid the ongoing turf war in the party’s state unit, Jalandhar Cantt MLA Pargat Singh on Sunday questioned AICC general secretary Rawat and asked who gave him the right to take a big decision about Punjab.Pargat, who is close to Sidhu, said: “When all the MLAs had met the three-member Kharge committee constituted by the party high command in Delhi three months ago, it was decided that the Punjab assembly elections, to be held in 2022, would be fought under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Now, if Harish Rawat is saying that the 2022 Punjab elections will be fought under the leadership of Amarinder Singh, then he should also tell when this decision was taken.”“Congress state in-charge Harish Rawat is my good friend but who gave him the right to take such a big decision about Punjab at his level? What is the meaning of Captain’s leadership now after the Kharge committee’s decision to contest elections under Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi?” added the Congress MLA.Pargat’s statement comes at a time when Rawat is scheduled to visit Punjab soon and meet Amarinder and Sidhu.Meanwhile, Rawat met the party high command to discuss the turmoil in Punjab Congress. “I had a very short meeting with Rahul Gandhi. I had briefed him about whatever the situation is in Punjab. I have already briefed the Congress president. Nothing more than this,” Rawat told media persons after the meeting on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/several-faces-in-party-one-should-not-be-impatient-rawat-on-pargat-remarks-101630349144253.html
31-08-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing: Fearing arrest, Saini seeks advancing of hearing on 2018 plea after SIT summons||Former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini has moved the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking advancing of hearing in a plea filed by him in 2018 after Punjab Police SIT served him a notice for appearance on September 6.The notice says SIT wants to conduct his voice analysis test as it feels that he is intentionally concealing some important facts about the case. Besides Saini, the SIT has also summoned former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma and suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal on the same date. But Umranangal has not been asked to give voice samples in the summons. The SIT is likely to use these samples for Layered Voice Analysis (LVA), which is a technology used as a tool for helping detect stress and other emotions by analysis of the human voice. The 2018 plea demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into FIRs registered against him during the present Congress regime. On this plea, the court had directed that Saini be given a week’s prior notice in the event of his arrest in a case in connection with his service period.The case was to be taken up on September 9, but in the fresh plea, Saini says he has received a letter from the special investigation team (SIT) regarding FIRs registered in connection with the alleged police firing on protesters in 2015 in Kotkapura, to appear at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini, New Delhi, on September 6.Saini apprehends that he will again be detained by Punjab Police in some other case like earlier when he went to comply with high court orders. Hence, advancing of hearing in the 2018 plea be allowed. The application will be taken up by the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi on Tuesday.Saini was arrested by Punjab Police when he had gone to join investigation into a September 2020 corruption case on August 18. A day later, the high court termed his arrest illegal and in violation of high court orders on a plea moved by his wife and ordered his release.He has also moved another application seeking permission to place before the court purported videos of some interviews given by Punjab Police officers in which he claims they are levelling allegations against the court of passing the August 19 order “in a tearing hurry” and in “a pre-determined manner by not affording any opportunity” of hearing to state vigilance. These interviews are being circulated on the social media, he has submitted in the application. This application too will be taken up on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-fearing-arrest-saini-seeks-advancing-of-hearing-on-2018-plea-after-sit-summons-101630348964353.html

It however said that no-objection certificates can be obtained for vehicles aged between 10 to 15 years for states where it is permissible to operate them. The Delhi government cited a Supreme Court order for impounding end-of-life diesel and petrol vehicles.The Centre in its voluntary vehicle scrapping policy allowed plying of old vehicles in case they pass fitness tests. The policy provides for a fitness test after 20 years for vehicles used by individuals for personal purpose and commercial vehicles require it after the completion of 15 years. There are at least 37 lakh end-of-life vehicles in Delhi, including two-wheelers out of one crore registered vehicles.Most of these vehicles ply on the roads causing pollution but authorities cannot take any tough action against these vehicles due to logistical issues of lack of adequate number of scrapping facilities and space for holding impounded vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-advises-against-plying-decades-old-petrol-diesel-vehicles-101630346317308.html

Seedcopter, an aerial seeding solution for rapid and scalable reforestation, will bring community, science and technology together for an inclusive, sustainable and long-lasting solution, the release said.This project uses drones to disperse seed balls over thin, barren and empty forest lands to turn them into lush green abode of trees. The process begins with a field survey and mapping of the terrain area to understand the ecosystem and demarcate the areas needing urgent attention.The seed balls are prepared by the local women and welfare communities which are dispersed via drones in the targeted areas. Further, the area is continuously monitored to track the growth of plants sown, according to the release."Forests are essential to maintain a clean and habitable environment for human life, and emerging technologies have potential to support the afforestation efforts. Being already at the forefront of using drones for new use-cases, we are initiating Hara Bahara to plant seeds increase the forest areas across all the districts of the state," Rama Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/telangana-to-use-drones-to-drop-seeds-for-afforesation-101630348012320.html

However a distinction shall be made between ’forests’ and ’green cover’, wherein areas now categorized as ‘forests’ shall continue to be conserved, while conservation of the areas now designated as ’green cover’ areas shall not be mandatory.”This move could impact the conservation of Aravallis as they are not designated as forests under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, but are afforded protection as NCZs, after being categorised as such by the NCRPB in 2018.The draft plan, which will be discussed in a meeting by the National Capital Regional Planning Board on Tuesday, states, “The 0.5% of total area under Natural Conservation Zone is allowed for related compatible development which could be either at one place or at multiple locations, subject to other approvals, acts of different states and related sectors and land use compatible with the area.”Experts said that earlier, the 0.5% construction clause applied to each plot separately, but now this can be applied to the whole area of an NCZ. Earlier, construction could only be carried out on 0.5 acres of each 100-acre plot, but now, if the draft regional plan is approved, construction activities may be allowed on a larger scale as it does not elaborate on what constitutes “related compatible development”.When a similar clause was proposed earlier in the draft Regional Plan 2021, the ministry of environment forest and climate change had objected to it. In a letter to the NCRPB in 2014, the ministry said, “Though the Mega Tourism Policy of Haryana allows construction of residential and commercial real estate up to 20% and 10% respectively, in a minimum area of 300 acres, it is reiterated that in the remaining part of NCZ (excluding forests and protected areas), construction activities, even those related to regional recreational activities, shall not exceed 0.5% of the area.”The draft plan 2041 has also removed the clause of forest cover target of 10% for the National Capital Region.Reacting to the distinction, experts said that this will adversely impact the Aravalli forests in this region.“The forest cover of the NCR is just about 4% and it is a shame that the NCRPB has succumbed to the real estate lobby and removed the limit on construction in the NCZ and so called ‘green’ areas. The draft has further removed the target forest cover of 10%, which was there in the regional plan 2021,” said Chetan Agarwal, an independent forest analyst.SS Oberoi, a city-based environmental and legal expert, said, “With climate change picking up steam, groundwater going down, forest cover continuously reducing and the population of Gurugram and Faridabad increasing every year, more area should be conserved instead of a reduction.”Meanwhile, Jagdish Parwani, the director of administration and finance, NCRPB, said, “The draft plan will be discussed in a meeting on Tuesday, after which only we will be able to share more details in the public domain.”When asked, Parwani said all aspects of the plan will be discussed at the meeting and it is not necessary that all facets of the plan will be passed.The NCRPB has also sought suggestions at feedback.ncrpb@nic.in concerning the draft Regional Plan 2041.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ncr-draft-plan-2041-proposes-doing-away-with-mandatory-conservation-of-areas-designated-as-green-cover-may-affect-aravallis-101630346269577.html
31-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get new plan to combat climate crisis by year-end||The city will have a new 10-year action plan to combat climate change ready in the next two months and the plan will be implemented by the year-end, said officials of the Delhi government on Monday.The environment department has already requested the Union ministry of environment and forests (MOEF) to release a fund of ₹20 lakh to prepare the action plan.“A request has already been placed before the MoEF for the release of the fund to hire knowledge partners. Once we get the money, we will be able to hold consultations with stakeholders and ready the plan within two months. It will most likely be implemented by the year-end,” said a senior official from the environment department, asking not to be named.The Centre, in 2009, prepared the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and asked states to prepare their own area specific plans. However, Delhi submitted its plan only in 2019, the last state to do so.“The plan could not be implemented and it expired in 2020. Now, we are due a new plan,” the official quoted above said.The previous plan focused on six areas, including energy, transport, green cover and urban development, and projected a significant decrease in cold days and nights and an increase in heavy rainfall in Delhi.For the new plan, a German agency is likely to be engaged as a knowledge partner, the official said.All extreme weather events of the past 10 years are being analysed to prepare a comprehensive plan which will focus on air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, transport issues, air conditioning, heat islands, agriculture patterns, etc., the official said.The action plan will identify activities causing increase in greenhouse gas emissions and fix responsibilities. It will set targets to be achieved in phases over the next 10 years.The environment department had taken eight years to complete consultations with stakeholders concerned while preparing the previous plan. Delhi had recorded its coldest day since 1901 on December 30, 2019. Since August last year, the city has been breaking weather records every month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-new-plan-to-combat-climate-crisis-by-yearend-101630345904773.html

According to the police, the accused had hit the complainant with a rod during the fight.In February 2021, the parties settled the matter amicably and thereafter sought that criminal proceedings be quashed.In his order, justice Prasad imposed a cost of ₹10,000 on the brothers so that they do not repeat the offence and directed them to deposit the amount in the “Army Welfare Fund Battle Casualties”.“The petitioner no 1, Mohit and the petitioner no 2 Rohit Kumar are also directed to perform social service for one month. Accordingly, they are directed to do community service at Lok Nayak Hospital for a period of one month — August 23 to September 23,” the court said.The judge said after completion of one month of community service, a certificate from the medical superintendent should be filed to show compliance of the court order.“In case of any absenteeism/default or any misbehaviour on the part of the petitioners, the same shall be conveyed immediately by the medical superintendent to the concerned SHO...for bringing the same to the notice of the court,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/parking-brawl-delhi-hc-orders-two-brothers-to-do-community-service-101630345664224.html

31-08-2021||Delhi||Govt allows others to collect ration for those not able to authenticate info||Ration cardholders who are unable to authenticate their biometrics to receive their monthly quota of subsidised food grains in the capital can now nominate others to collect it on their behalf, the Delhi government said on Monday.The government’s food and civil supplies department issued an order to this effect on August 26,after its field officers reported biometrics authentication failure due to technical glitches at some of the fair price shops over the past one month.Even those who cannot visit fair price shops due to old age or disability can also nominate others to collect their monthly quota of subsidised food grains, a senior officer in the department said on condition of anonymity. “The order has been issued to ensure that no PDS (public distribution system) beneficiary drops out of the safety net due to biometric failures, especially since ration shops in Delhi have implemented the e-POS (electronic point of sale) system under which a beneficiary can collect food grains after thumb or iris authentication,” the official said, adding, “The latest order will be very helpful for Delhi because the city is seeing one of the highest usages of portability of ration cards under the Centre’s one nation, one ration card (ONORC) programme.”The latest order allowing beneficiaries to nominate ration collectors on their behalf came after the Centre wrote to the states to implement these steps to address e-POS-related grievances. Accordingly, the Delhi food and civil supplies department identified three categories of beneficiaries who could avail of the facility: a family with members all aged above 65 or below 16 and not in a position to visit the shops themselves; if all members of a family are suffering from leprosy, are differently-abled, bedridden, or affected by other diseases and impairments; and those families whose every member faces biometric authentication failure despite correct Aadhaar seeding. A nominee must have his/her ration card registered in the same fair price shop as that of the family designating him/her.ONORC, introduced in 2019, aims to add digital muscle to the country’s public distribution system through which food grains are offered at subsidised rates to about 739 million beneficiaries under the national food security law. ONORC allows a beneficiary, such as a migrant worker, to access her share of subsidised ration from anywhere in the country regardless of the place where her ration card is registered. In other words, it allows the mobility of food entitlements.The Delhi government implemented the ONORC scheme only on July 20 this year. Data showed that so far, at least 29,600 transactions have already taken place in the city under the scheme since its launch, making Delhi the state/UT having the highest off-take of subsidised grains for migrants from other states.On July 27, a week after ONORC was launched in Delhi, HT had reported how many ration card holders returned empty-handed from fair price shops in south and east Delhi due to glitches in the e-PoS devices.To prevent inconvenience, the government asked the fair price shops to put up boards outside to inform about machines not working.In Delhi, people can get cheap grains from any of the 2,000 fair price shops. For this, the government has deployed 2,005 e-PoS devices across the capital to get ONORC going.Meanwhile, experts said there are flaws in the government order.“This recent order of the Delhi government shows a lack of both understanding and empathy. It says a nominee can only be allowed if the biometrics of all family members fail. What if the person whose biometrics match is the sole bread winner? Should they miss an income-earning opportunity to get ration? A simple bypass system should be put in place, based on self certification and verification,” said Anjali Bhardwaj, member of the Right to Food campaign which surveys FPSs in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/those-unable-to-authenticate-their-biometric-can-now-nominate-others-to-collect-ration-on-their-behalf-101630345124189.html
31-08-2021||Delhi||RFID tags a must for all commercial vehicles entering Delhi from Tuesday||Commercial vehicles will be challaned and their permits may be cancelled if they enter Delhi without radio frequency identification (RFID) tags from Tuesday, according to a notice issued by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).The notice, issued on Friday, stated: “With effect from August 31, all commercial vehicles will be allowed to enter Delhi on payment of the toll tax/environment compensation charge (ECC) through RFID system only.... those vehicles that enter Delhi without paying through the RFID mode shall be liable to face legal action including penalty/cancellation of permit...”SDMC issued a similar notice last month, and the officials were stopping vehicles without RFID tags or telling them to return. A fresh notice had to be issued because last month’s drive was discontinued in view of long traffic jams on the city border points.Corporation officials said, the order will be enforced in a different manner this time.“Earlier, vehicles without RFID tags were told to return leading to pile ups. This time, we will let vehicles pass and note their registration number. These will be sent to the Delhi government’s transport department to issue challans, and cancel their permits.”“We will write to the transport department,” said a senior SDMC official.A transport department official said they were yet to receive any formal request in this regard. “Once we get an official intimation, action will be taken accordingly,” the official said.SDMC is the nodal agency for collection of environment cess and toll tax. ECC was imposed on commercial vehicles by the Supreme Court in 2015 to dissuade their entry into the Capital in order to reduce air pollution.The fresh notice has led to a strike threat by the association of cab drivers. Kamaljeet Gill, president, Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi, said using RFID tags to move within Delhi-NCR is not feasible.“We have raised the issue with the civic body earlier too. Cab drivers make multiple trips in a day between Delhi, Noida and Gurugram. This means, every time we cross the toll plaza, ₹100 will deducted. This is not acceptable at all. We hope the civic agency will come up with a solution, otherwise we will have to go on strike,” said Gill.The RFID tags can be obtained and recharged at 39 point of sale systems set up at the city borders. The tags could also be recharged online on the SDMC website (www.ecctagssdmc.com) and the MCD-Toll mobile app.In order to enforce the order, special teams will be deployed at the 124 toll plazas from where commercial vehicles enter Delhi. “All 124 toll plazas were made RFID compliant by March-end. Now, there is no reason for commercial vehicle owners to not get the tags or recharge them to enter Delhi. This must be put in place before winters when air pollution in the city goes up. The whole point of RFID was to make the toll and ECC payments cashless so that vehicles don’t pile up on the borders and cause pollution,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rfid-tags-a-must-for-all-commercial-vehicles-entering-delhi-from-tuesday-101630345006462.html
31-08-2021||Delhi||Work on revamped Chandni Chowk stretch in Delhi likely to be complete by Sept 5||Work on the 1.3km-long revamped Chandni Chowk stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid will be completed by September 5, according to the minutes of an August 26 meeting attended by nodal officers for the project.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will inaugurate the project on September 12.Officials said they are trying to wrap up pending work quickly in the run-up to the inauguration. While work on the installation of CCTV cameras is expected to be completed by the end of the month, boom barriers will be installed by September 5, the control room for which will be handed over to the Delhi Police by September 5, the minutes said. During the meeting, the transport department also invited expression of interest for operators of vintage golf carts.In July, the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) proposed to run electric vehicles similar to golf carts designed to look like vintage cars on the revamped stretch, which has been made a no-go zone for motorised vehicles between 9am and 9pm. These low-speed electric golf carts are expected to have a maximum speed of 25-30 kilometres per hour. The service is being proposed to help the elderly and infirm who visit the popular market and will be run for free. These cars are expected to become operational by October.Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, SRDC, which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said the expression of interest had been sought. “The notification for it was issued on August 26,” said Panigrahi. The last date for submission of EOIs is September 10.According to EOI, the objective of the introduction of golf carts is to cater to the mobility needs of the elderly, disabled people, women and children visiting Chandni Chowk. The carts will be of vintage look in line with the aesthetic and heritage environment of Chandni Chowk, the EOI stated.The golf carts will be run on the main Chandni Chowk stretch and might be subsequently extended to roads adjoining it. As part of the first phase, 11 golf carts will be allowed to operate in the area. In subsequent phases, the number of such vehicles is likely to be scaled up to 22. The golf carts will be eight-seater vehicles.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that the carts will add to the market’s character. But he added that it is crucial to ensure that other issues pertaining to pending work and encroachment are also looked at and dealt with.Conceived in 2006, the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project was launched after a prolonged delay in December 2018 following the directions of the Delhi high court, which is also monitoring the project. In the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric and other cables were taken underground, and dedicated lanes for non-motorised transport and walkways were constructed. Facilities such as toilets, ATMs, and benches and bollards were also set up. In the second phase of the redevelopment project, façade restoration will be taken up by the SRDC and PWD. A uniform façade will be implemented on the stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-revamped-chandni-chowk-stretch-in-delhi-likely-to-be-complete-by-september-5-101630345004881.html
31-08-2021||Pune||Pune residents see red over trimmed branches strewn on footpaths, roads||PUNE: The residents of Magarpatta city, Hadapsar, are miffed with the garden department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for leaving trimmed branches of trees on footpaths and roads which in turn are blocking the view and posing hurdles while walking.According to the residents, the tree-trimming work has been going on for the past 15 days and clipped tree branches have been left uncleared at many places, including Akashwani Hadapsar, near Lohia hospital, Solapur road and the Magarpatta corner.On his part, Dnyanoba Balwadkar, garden superintendent, Hadapsar ward, said, “The job of clearing the pared branches got delayed as it was the weekend and tempos were not available. Beginning Monday morning, we have started picking up all cut branches and in a couple of days, the area will be cleared.”A junior official of the garden department of the PMC who did not wish to be named echoed similar views saying, “A two-day delay occurred while clearing the branches from footpaths and roads. We have already told officials to clear the sheared branches and instructed them to clean up the area where tree-trimming work is undertaken in future.”However, Gajanan Shinde, who resides at the Magarpatta corner, said, “They (officials) are throwing all the pruned branches in nearby places and when we tell them to clear the place, they say it is not their job and that the same will be done in the morning by garbage collectors.”While Vijay Patil, who stays near the Lohia hospital, said, “The trimmed branches are lying on footpaths since the last five days and could soon become places for mosquitoes to breed if not cleared soon. Cases of dengue are already on the rise so the PMC needs to be more cautious.”Acknowledging the mistake, Ashok Ghorpade, superintendent of gardens, said, “Such an incident has taken place for the first time. Generally, our people clear the complete area where tree-trimming is carried out.”In the coming days, the PMC garden department will be clipping trees in other parts of the city as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hadapsar-residents-see-red-over-trimmed-branches-strewn-on-footpaths-roads-101630343323583.html

With Janmashtami on August 30 the day for the “dahi handi” tradition - a one person scaling a human pyramid to break a pot of curds suspended high above the ground – is August 31.This city will not hold any such event despite mandals and troupes in Mumbai appealing to the government to allow the event on a small scale. “We will not be celebrating dahi handi this year in the city. We are following the state protocols,” said Amol Balwadkar, BJP corporator.“We will hold a representative dahi handi within the Ganpati temple to break to allow children to enjoy this moment,” said Deepak Marne, president of Babu Genu Mitra mandal.Troupes in Mumbai met with state minister Aaditya Thackeray, appealing that they would form small pyramids using limited fully vaccinated participants.MNS corporator Vasant More has also said no to celebration of this festival. “We have not planned, nor will be holding dahi handi this year, looking at the covid situation,” said More. The Central government has advised state to impose local restrictions in view of the upcoming festive season to prevent mass gatherings so as to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Despite the state showing decline over the last month, there are some districts in Maharashtra which are showing early signs of an surge in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-dahi-handi-events-to-be-held-in-pune-101630341343446.html
31-08-2021||Pune||Pune police issue rules for upcoming 10-day Ganesh festival||PUNE The Pune police have issued rules and regulations for the upcoming 10-day Ganpati festival which begins on September 10. The order was passed by Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of Pune police.These rules were formulated after a meeting held by the Pune municipal corporation with major Ganesh mandals, public representatives, and other government stakeholders.For the sale of Ganpati idols, local government will give permission for certain school grounds and open grounds to set up stalls. No processions on the first or the last day will be allowed this year. The police have urged temples which have a big enough sanctum to not move the idols to mandaps. This rule will be applicable mainly for the bigger mandals, like the five main Ganpatis of Pune, which attract huge crowds of devotees.The height of public idols is limited to four feet, while household idols cannot cross two feet in height, according to the police rules. The puja cannot be attended by more than five people who are required to follow sanitisation, use a mask, and observe social distancing. The police have urged mandals to include only workers of those mandals among the five who attend the aarti. All other devotees will have to settle for online darshan. The police have asked all major mandals to install and record CCTV footage around their idols. They have also urged the installation of the idol to not hamper movement of essential services like ambulances autorickshaws and other large vehicles.In order to avoid untoward incidents like robbery or theft, the police have urged the mandals, which have large quantities of ornaments on their idols, to appoint mandal workers to maintain round the clock security.The police have also urged mandals to not put up huge displays or ‘live’ skits which are otherwise an integral part of the celebration. The mandals are also urged to keep disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite ready and in use at all times.No processions will be allowed for the visarjan (immersion) as well. While public mandals are urged to create immersion spots near the idols, societies are urged to form immersion spots for their own societies. Household ganpatis can be immersed inside the house. Mobile immersion pods by the municipal corporation will also be moving around the city on immersion days.The noise pollution guidelines prescribed by the Supreme Court will be in effect. Additionally the state government rules for noise pollution and the district government noise pollution control orders issued on February 4 will also be in effect between 6am and midnight. However, on the fifth day, seventh day, ninth day and the final 10th day music systems will be allowed to play from 6am till midnight. On all other days the police have urged the mandals to shut down music by 10pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-issues-rules-and-regulations-for-upcoming-10-day-ganesh-festival-101630341104581.html
31-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police arrest 12 people for running fake call centre||The police has arrested 12 people for allegedly running a fake call centre in Rohini and defrauding over 700 by promising them loans at low interest rates under the a cooked-up government programme called the ‘Pradhan Mantri Loan Yojana’, spokespersons of the agency said on Monday. The owner of the call centre, however, is still at large, said the police.The police said that the arrested suspects rain the operation for at least seven months, and cheated people Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said the district’s cyber cell received information around 11.30pm on August 28 about a fake call centre being operated from a building near Vishram Chowk in Rohini’s Sector 6.The 12 people — 11 women and one man — were arrested during a raid later that day.“They were defrauding people in the name of providing loans,” said Tayal.The arrested man was identified as 24-year-old Deepak Saini, a resident of Delhi’s Nangloi. Police have not disclosed the names of the arrested women.Tayal said the arrested women worked as tele-callers and called people in different states. They introduced themselves as authorised agents offering a central government scheme providing loans to start businesses at exceptionally low interest rates.“Any client interested in the scheme was asked to fill a form meant for getting financial assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Employment Generation Programme. The loan amount ranged from ₹one lakh to ₹20 lakh. The suspects then roped people in with lucrative offers and tricked them into depositing money as a processing fee for the loan amount. They used to charge between ₹40,000 and ₹2.5 lakh to sanctioning the loan, said Tayal.In some cases, the suspects even issued fake loan approval letters.“The arrested people duped more than 700 people in less than a year. We have got a few complaints and have identified some more victims who will be contacted for their complaints,” said an investigator who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-arrest-12-people-for-running-fake-call-centre-duping-over-700-across-states-101630335465037.html

Alert Army troops detected the infiltration bid by effective use of the integrated surveillance grid”.“On being challenged by Army troops, there ensued a fierce firefight with the terrorists in which one terrorist was neutralised and his body along with an AK-47 rifle has been recovered,” he added.The operation is still in progress in the area.“In continuation of operations in Poonch, search operations near the LoC revealed the presence of the body of another terrorist with AK 47 across the LoC. Thus, two terrorists have been successfully neutralised by the Indian Army which remains ever vigilant,” he added.This action by alert Army troops displays the resolve of the Indian Army to thwart any sinister design of the adversary along the Line of Control, he added.Since June this year, there has been a spurt in infiltration bids from across the LoC in Rajouri and Poonch districts.Since then, there have been four encounters in the Rajouri district.On August 10, director-general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said that “after a brief lull following renewed truce deal between the two DGMOs on February 25, infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir resumed” and added that “terror camps across the border were still intact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/infiltration-bid-foiled-on-loc-in-poonch-2-terrorists-killed-101630334926444.html
