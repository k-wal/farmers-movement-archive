15-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Close to 2.3mn passengers board local trains on Day One of restart||Nearly 2.3 million passengers travelled on Mumbai’s lifeline — its suburban train network — on the Central and Western Railway on Sunday, which was the first day of local train services resuming for all citizens, provided they are fully vaccinated and have taken their second dose at least 14 days prior. No incident of crowding was reported inside the trains, railway platforms or outside booking offices on both lines as services for the general public resumed after a gap of four months. The process of issuing universal passes has also been smooth, the officials said. Railways has issued nearly 120,000 monthly season passes to eligible passengers in the last four days since August 11.Approximately 1.2 million passengers travelled by local trains on CR and the rest 1.1 million passengers travelled on WR.On an average, nearly 2.3 million passengers travel by trains on CR and 2.1 million passengers commute on WR every day. Passengers, who travelled on Sunday, stated that the train commute will ease their financial burden.Anticipating an increase in the number of passengers next week that could result in crowding, both the zonal railways will be increasing the number of local train services from Monday. Around 1,300 local train services will be operated on the WR as opposed to the present 1,201 services. On CR, 1,686 services will be operated, as opposed to 1,612 currently.“I have missed travelling by local trains. I’m travelling today as it is a public holiday and the crowding will be less. I will travel all the way to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and back and enjoy the train travel,” said Aarti Jain, a resident of Vidyavihar.“I am happy that my company got me fully vaccinated and I was able to get a monthly pass. I was spending over Rs300 every day to travel to my workplace in Andheri. There is no financially viable alternative to local trains for commuting in Mumbai,” said Aslam Shaikh, a Kurla resident.Low passenger turnout was witnessed on Sunday. Railway authorities have stated that fewer passengers on Sunday was due to public holiday.“Sunday and Monday are both public holidays, which is why we are expecting fewer passengers. No incidents of crowding were reported. General commuters travelling by local trains are expected to increase from Tuesday.” said a senior railway official.Train services were suspended for the general public on April 15 due to the spike in coronavirus cases in the city.A universal pass embedded with Quick Response (QR) code is being made available to commuters through both offline and online systems. After verification of vaccination certificate, a passenger can take a monthly season pass at the booking office of any suburban railway station.By Sunday evening, 130,064 monthly season passes were issued to passengers on the suburban railway network. Of them, 87,875 passes were issued by Central Railway and 42,189 by the Western Railway, the officials said.The Maharashtra police and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel have been deployed at all entry and exit points of suburban railway stations to ensure no unauthorised entry is allowed at the railway platforms.Railway authorities have also deployed special squads, consisting of ticket checking staff and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel, for inspection of vaccination certificates and railway passes both by the CR and WR. Ticket-checking inspectors have also been deployed inside local train compartments.Railway authorities have also stated that the process of issuing seasonal monthly passes has been smooth. The CR and WR are operating 617 railway ticket window counters for passengers that will issue monthly passes. Of them, 341 windows are functional on CR stations and the remaining 276 ticket windows will be on WR stations.“The process of issuing railway passes has been smooth. No incidents of crowding have been witnessed either on the registration desk or booking windows. We are operating all booking windows on all the railway stations.” added the railway official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-close-to-2-3mn-passengers-board-local-trains-on-day-one-of-restart-101629051921290.html
15-08-2021||Bangalore||‘Conflict of interest’ new challenge for Karnataka Cabinet||After dissent over portfolios within the party, eyebrows are now being raised over portfolios of few ministers which attract conflict of interest. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its national leaders have taken into consideration aspects like regional and social representation in the Cabinet, the possibility of a conflict of interest doesn’t appear to have been their top priority.Murugesh Nirani, who heads the business conglomerate MRN Group, was named the minister for large and medium industries in Karnataka as part of the new Cabinet, whileAnand Singh, the former mining baron, who has over dozen cases lodged for violating the Forest Act, has been demanding that he be given the forest portfolio which he was entrusted with in the BS Yediyurappa Cabinet.“This is my family-run agriculture and agro-based industries. I don’t hold any office or position in these industries. I am a full time public servant,” Nirani told Hindustan Times in a statement on Sunday.He added that it was the prerogative of the chief minister who chose to give these portfolios after “due diligence and thorough thought”. Nirani said that he had already established these industries before his electoral debut in 2004 and served in the same portfolio under three different chief ministers between 2008-2013.“For (the) past few years, I am nowhere directly or indirectly related or holding any position or office in any of businesses or industries. I am (a) full time public servant. My family members look after the industries. The industries, which are family-run has nothing to do with the current portfolio I am in-charge,” the minister clarified.N Nagaraju (MTB), one of India’s richest legislators who has a real-estate empire, owning and renting large buildings and a host of other businesses, is Karnataka’s minister for Municipal Administration, Small Scale and Public Sector Industries.He has been demanding to get the housing portfolio, which he handled during the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government in 2018.Nagaraj and Anand Singh could not be reached for comment. Transparency International defines conflict of interest as “confronted between choosing between the duties and demands of their position and their own private interests.”Though it remains a common feature in the Cabinets--state and union--, public officials and others, the glaring possibility of any conflict of interest is overlooked, activists and constitutional experts said.In February 2015, E.M. Sudarsana Natchiappan, a former member of Parliament from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu, introduced for the second time The Prevention and Management of Conflict of Interest Bill, only for it to get lost in the duel between the ruling and Opposition banters and deafening voices.Natchiappan told Hindustan Times on Sunday that the reason for bringing up such a bill was that senior IAS officers and others who join large corporations soon after the “cooling period” in plum posts were unethical as it endangers the interests of the country for corporations.He said that when officials and politicians work out of such conflict, “they are not working for the country, but their own individual interests.”The possible cases for conflict of interest, however, is not limited to Karnataka as several politicians are known to operate big businesses, educational and medical institutions. And this has been the case for decades.Former power secretary P Abraham, who was heading the ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) expert appraisal committee (EAC) on river valley and hydropower projects was alleged to be on the board of at least half a dozen power companies, citing a clear conflict of interest, Hindustan Times had reported on June 17, 2009.Disgraced liquor baron and former member of the Rajya Sabha, Vijay Mallya, was a member of the standing committee on fertilizers despite the fact that his own UB Group had a sizeable stake in a fertilizer company.Shyama Charan Gupta, who owns the over ₹350-crore Shyam Group of Industries which includes the popular Shyam Bidi works was on the Central committee to enforce bigger pictorial warnings on cigarette packets.Professor Ravi Kumar Varma, former advocate general of Karnataka and a constitutional expert told Hindustan Times on Sunday that there is an increasing trend in India where democratic processes are “hijacked” by vested interests. “It is a clear indication that vested interests are able to hijack the entire democratic process which are supposed to work against such interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/conflict-of-interest-new-challenge-for-karnataka-cabinet-101629051625649.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Day 1: Mumbai malls reopen to poor response||While restaurants and malls reopened to extended timings till 10pm from Sunday, the condition that staff and visitors have to be fully vaccinated led to poor response on Day One. Malls have reopened for the first time after a gap of four months post the lockdown announced on April 4. Mall owners said as a majority of their visitors are in the 18-45 age group, very few are fully vaccinated, leading to low footfall. They said the turnout was only 10-15% compared to pre-Covid times. Restaurants and bars, too, saw poor turnout as Sunday was a dry day on account of Independence Day. Sachin Dhanawade, chief operating officer (COO) retail & real estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Limited, which operates Growel’s 1O1 Mall in Kandivli, said, “The footfall was 5% of the usual footfall before the pandemic. Fully vaccinated customers were happy to shop in a safe and sanitised environment. However, many customers who are not fully vaccinated had to be turned away. We are hopeful that citizens who have got their first dose of the vaccine will be allowed soon.” Gurvineet Singh, CEO of Viviana Mall in Thane, said, “We welcome the move of the government to allow us to trade on Independence Day. However, the permission has come with riders due to which the business is going to be hit. Statistically, there are very few citizens in the 18-45 age group, our main clientele, owing to the minimum gap of 84 days. Also, the first drive for this age group began only in June. Lakhs of citizens are directly or indirectly dependent on the economic activity at malls across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.” In a statement, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) said the government needs to reconsider its decision. “Malls have been opened as per the government order. Given the restrictions on customer entry, footfall has been extremely low: 10-15% of pre-Covid levels. We have had instances where customers with a single jab were disappointed at being denied entry into malls. The government needs to reconsider this stance and allow customers with a jab to visit malls.” Viraj Mamania, a resident of Borivli, said, “I was denied entry inside the mall in Kandivli considering I am not fully vaccinated.” Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president at Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said, “We have appealed to the civic body and also the state that the condition of fully vaccinated staff for operating up to 10pm should be relaxed to at least one dose. We understand that it is our responsibility to get our staff vaccinated, but there is a gap of 84 days between two doses.” Shetty added, “Considering Sunday was the first day, the visits were fewer, but they will pick up considering the festive season and inquiries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/day-1-mumbai-malls-reopen-to-poor-response-101629051621643.html

15-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Missing’ Covid vaccine vials found at a hair transplant clinic in Mumbra||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has found 40 vaccine doses, which allegedly went missing from a vaccination centre in Mumbra, in a hair transplant clinic on Sunday. The civic body has sealed the clinic and is inquiring if the incidents are connected. Locals had on Saturday complained that vaccine doses were missing from the vaccination centre at Kausa, Mumbra. The owner of the clinic claimed the vials were taken for a vaccination camp being conducted for healthcare workers in Mumbra. However, no such permission for a private vaccination camp was taken from TMC. Based on a tip off, TMC officials visited Shah Hair Transplant Laser and Cosmetic Clinic at Kausa, Mumbra on Sunday morning and found vaccine doses in the clinic. “We found four vials which constitute 40 doses from a clinic in Mumbra. Currently, we are busy with the ongoing vaccination drive across the city and cannot share further details,” said Dr Hemangi Ghode, medical officer, Kausa, TMC. Senior TMC officials confirmed that an inquiry will be conducted to ascertain which batch these vials are from and whether these were from the vaccination centre. Meanwhile, Mumtaz Shah, owner of clinic, said they had a stock of vaccines for a camp that was organised for healthcare workers in the city. “There was a shortage of doses in the city last week; many doctors did not get their second dose of vaccine. Hence, we decided to conduct a vaccination camp for healthcare workers. Ten medical practitioners were vaccinated on Saturday as part of the camp. We have conducted such camps in the past as well with the permission of the civic body,” said Shah. TMC officials claimed no such permission was given. “We did not get any such request for a vaccination camp, and we have not handed over vials to any such clinic officially. Hence, we seized the vials and sealed the premises,” said a senior TMC official on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, Shah, who is associated with a political party as well, said, “The vials were being used for a positive cause; it was for healthcare workers. We had similar number of vials remaining from a vaccination drive conducted 10 days ago which we had kept at the stadium. In place of those, these vials were taken, we did not take another official permission for the same though,” said Shah. On Saturday, the vaccination centre in Kausa stadium saw a huge crowd of beneficiaries. As this was a walk-in vaccination centre, tokens were distributed to all those who wanted to get inoculated. After around 150 tokens, the authorities at the centre asked other waiting beneficiaries to leave, “TMC always shares a list of vaccination centres along with the number of doses available at the centre. Despite 300 vials being available on Saturday, the centre at Kausa stadium provided tokens to only 150 people. We started asking them about the remaining doses as we were waiting in the queue for almost two to three hours. Only after much insistence did they decide to give a few more doses,” said Riza Merchant, 38, resident of Kausa who got vaccinated at the stadium on Saturday. Another Mumbra resident, Saif Pathan, said, “This incident clearly shows that the vials have been taken from the vaccination centre with the consent of someone at the centre. Mumbra mostly comprises of people from low-income groups staying in congested settlements. There is an urgent need for vaccination in such places. With the shortage of doses within Thane city and the increasing demand to get fully vaccinated at the earliest as part of the new relaxation rules, such incidents of missing vials could increase.” TMC resumed vaccination drive on Saturday after a gap of four days in view of vaccine shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/missing-covid-vaccine-vials-found-at-a-hair-transplant-clinic-in-mumbra-101629051322023.html
15-08-2021||Delhi||DDA struggling to provide land for compensatory afforestation in Delhi||New Delhi: With several large-scale development projects requiring “diversion of deemed forests” the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is finding it difficult to make available non-forest land for compensatory afforestation (CA) in the Capital and is currently exploring if such land can be provided in neighbouring states.DDA officials said that for diversion of deemed forests -- an administrative process by which the land is reclassified for non-forest purposes -- equivalent non-forest land has to be provided for CA.Of the requests for 136 hectares of non-forest land for CA from various agencies in the past one year, DDA officials said the government agency has been able to provide nearly 116 hectares, in areas like Dhulsiras village in Dwarka, Holambi Kalan and Todapur village, and is struggling to find land to meet the remaining requests.“The green cover in Delhi is 23% and most of the spaces earmarked as green are saturated in Delhi. It is difficult to find large land parcels for CA,” said Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, principal commissioner, DDA.Non-forest areas with high density plantation are treated as deemed forest by the Delhi government’s forest department. “All development agencies have placed requisition before DDA for equivalent non-forest land for CA as per rules,” said the DDA official.Due to paucity of land for compensatory afforestation in the Capital, the land-owning agency is now exploring if land for CA can be provided in neighbouring states for proposed central government projects in Delhi. In May this year, the DDA wrote to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change seeking clarity on the issue, following which the ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC), which discussed the matter in June end, has asked Delhi authorities to provide additional information about their plan for the Capital’s green cover.“The FAC has been conscious that any relaxation in the compensatory afforestation norms will ultimately lead to reduction in forest cover of Delhi which is not a desirable situation for residents of Delhi in the present and in the future,” as per the minutes of the meeting.DDA officials said that they are yet to get an official communication in this regard.DDA, which is the main land-owning agency in Delhi, said that there is very limited land available in the Capital.“Delhi is largely urbanised. Most of the areas identified as recreational green under the Master Plan have already been used either as parks or for plantation. So, availability of Master plan green areas for the purpose of CA are now very limited,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.With increase in population, another DDA official said, the limited vacant land parcels available in Delhi also need to be reserved for planning public utilities.Compensatory afforestation can also be done on degraded land -- it is to be spread over twice the extent of the forest area diverted -- in case of projects implemented by the central government or its public sector undertakings.The official said this is the reason why the DDA wrote to the environment ministry, asking if degraded forests for CA can be given in neighbouring states for Central government projects proposed in Delhi.However, not everyone is in favour of looking for land outside for projects in Delhi. “This is an ecologically flawed idea. The move, if allowed, will defeat the purpose of compensatory afforestation. It should be done in the same state. The focus should be on sustainable development and cities need to take necessary measures and frame policies to bring down use of private vehicles etc. Just building flyovers is not a solution,” said Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and curator of Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram.A DDA official said that with Yamuna rejuvenation work going on at a fast pace, “there is not much land available for CA as most of the floodplain area has already been committed to the compensatory plantation requirement of various agencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-struggling-to-provide-land-for-compensatory-afforestation-in-delhi-101629051320676.html
15-08-2021||Delhi||Painted storks make an early visit at Delhi zoo; officials plan guided birdwatching tour||New Delhi: This monsoon, the Delhi zoo has an early winged visitor which usually arrives from eastern parts of the country around mid-August. “This year, painted storks were spotted here as early as on August 6. The numbers have been growing since... Usually they are seen arriving from eastern parts of the country by mid or late August. The zoo is one of the few places in Delhi where painted storks nest and breed, which is one of the major factors for the zoo to be considered a birding spot,” said Ramesh Kumar Pandey, Delhi zoo director.Almost 140 painted storks have already arrived, zoo officials said, adding that the shallow water bodies in the zoo are full of the winged creatures with long, yellow beaks. “By the end of August, the numbers may reach more than 500,” said Pandey.With the season for migratory birds just beginning, the zoo authorities plan to organise guided birdwatching tours for students and bird enthusiasts over the coming weeks. “We plan to organise the first guided trip over the coming week when there will be more number of birds. It will be organised on a day when the zoo is closed for visitors. Initially, we plan to have a group of 20 bird watchers. We will hand over a pair of binoculars to the participants and lead the tour,” said Pandey.According to zoo officials, August to October is the peak breeding season for the painted storks which stay here till March before flying away with their chicks.“A structured bird-watching tour can be good learning for bird enthusiasts as well as students. The zoo does have a good diversity of bird species and could emerge as one of the many birdwatching sites for birders in Delhi,” said Pankaj Gupta, a birder.The zoo has at least 50 kinds of free-ranging avian species most part of the year including herons, white-breasted kingfisher, cormorants, parakeets, yellow-footed green pigeon, brown-headed barbet, black ibis, grey hornbill, jungle babbler and spot-billed ducks.According to a research paper titled “Breeding patterns of painted storks at Delhi zoo” authored by Abdul J Urfi, from school of environmental sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, the Delhi zoo has been an important breeding site for the painted stork since 1960. “Most nesting occurred in mesquite trees (Prosopis juliflora) on islands in the ponds at the Zoo. The breeding season begins in late August. This zoo site may be the only nesting colony site for the painted stork in the Delhi region,” it stated.Birders said that though the painted stork, a wetland bird, is found in many marshes and green patches in Delhi, they have been found nesting only at the Delhi zoo. Close to Delhi’s border, the Sultanpur National Park, essentially a bird sanctuary on the Gurugram-Jhajjar highway, is also known for a huge nesting colony of painted storks. “The painted storks have been spotted there as well,” said Gupta.The Delhi zoo opened on August 1, more than two months after it was shut during the second wave of the pandemic.The Delhi zoo was shut for visitors on March 18 last year, a week before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, and was followed by the avian flu in January this year. The zoo had finally reopened on April 1 this year, only to be closed again on April 15, as the second wave of the pandemic struck the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/painted-storks-make-an-early-visit-at-delhi-zoo-officials-plan-guided-birdwatching-tour-101629051201977.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Solapur bidi workers seek hearing on suggested ban on cigarette, bidi sale amid Covid||A union of bidi workers, which represents around 70,000 women who work in bidi manufacturing units in Solapur, has approached the Bombay high court (HC) through former MLA Narsayya Adam, seeking to intervene in a public interest litigation (PIL) pertaining to improper Covid management during the pandemic. The union filed the intervention application after the HC, in a previous hearing of the PIL, had sought to know the stand of the Centre and state government in the face of reports by experts that smokers were more prone to contracting Covid-19 as their lungs were weakened due to smoking. The application by Adam and general secretary of the union Mahamadgaus Shaikh, filed through advocate Sarang Aradhye, stated that in light of the HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni suggesting a temporary ban on sale of cigarettes and bidis during the pandemic, bidi workers were seeking permission to be heard before any adverse orders, that would prejudice the union workers, were passed. The application stated the bidi manufacturing business in Solapur has been going on since more than 150 years and the source of livelihood of around 500,000 people is solely based on bidi manufacturing and the business associated with it. The applicants said if any decision is taken by the government in this regard, it will affect all such persons. The application further stated there is absence of material including research about Covid-19 victims addicted to smoking, and hence it was necessary to hear the applicants before any orders or directions are passed.“If any adverse action is taken and sale of bidi and cigarettes is banned during pandemic, serious harm and prejudice will be caused to the workers whose bread and butter is dependent on said business, as due to the ban, bidi manufacturing will be completely stopped... The court may direct the petitioner to implead the applicants as party respondent in the PIL,” it stated.Similar intervention applications have also been moved by Federation of Retailers Association and Mumbai Bidi Tambaku Vyapari Sangh, opposing the suggested ban on smoking and sale of cigarettes and bidis. In June, this year, the state had submitted a June 15 report by director of Tata Memorial Centre Dr Rajendra Badwe which referred to several research and global studies indicating that smokers are likely to be more prone to Covid-19 infection. The state had, however, informed the HC it was not contemplating any blanket ban till there was conclusive proof. The application is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/solapur-bidi-workers-seek-hearing-on-suggested-ban-on-cigarette-bidi-sale-amid-covid-101629051081397.html

Meanwhile, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has provided more than two vaccination centres at other wards. Residents said they have often faced overcrowding and difficulty in getting access to vaccine, hence they approached local political leaders to resolve their problem. “We have only one centre in Diva and hardly any private vaccination centres. We are left with no option but to travel to far off areas to get jabs. The centre at Diva is always crowded. People turn up at 3am or 4am to wait in queue to get vaccinated. Our issues are not attended to while people from Ghodbunder Road have access to more than three centres in their vicinity itself,” said Sunita Jadhav, 42, resident of Diva. Since the past two months, the centre at Diva has allowed only walk-in vaccinations, leading to long queues. “We have mobile vaccination facility that reaches out to places which do not have enough provision to set up vaccination centres. Often our mobile vaccination units have pit stops at various places in Diva for the convenience of residents,” said Dr Khushboo Tawri, Medical officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-one-covid-vaccination-centre-in-diva-locals-upset-101629050781203.html

Four more similar flags were inaugurated by other Delhi government ministers in Patparganj, Shakur Basti, Kalkaji and Dwarka.The national flags inaugurated on Sunday are part of the Delhi government’s project to set up 500 flag poles across the city by January 26 next year, for which ₹45 crore was allocated in the government’s 2021-22 budget.“To promote patriotism among the people, Kejriwal government installs sky-high tirangas at five places across Delhi as part of 75th Independence Day celebrations,” the government said in a press statement.“Five tirangas have been installed in Delhi. By the upcoming Republic Day (January 26), 500 tirangas will be ready. The purpose of installing the national flags in Delhi is to instil a sense of patriotism among people. When a person steps out to work, they should see the tiranga and feel love for their country... In the hustle and bustle of daily life, we often forget about our country. Now, these tirangas will act as a constant reminder of love and patriotism towards the nation,” said Kejriwal, addressing the Independence Day event in East Kidwai Nagar.“Delhi will be the first city in India where such a large number of tricolors will be installed. While we are filled with pride and patriotism seeing the tricolor, in the real sense, patriotism is when we work for the progress of our society,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, after unfurling the Tricolour in a 115-feet pole in Patparganj.Inaugurating a flag in Shakur Basti, health minister Satyendar Jain said, “We must never forget the sacrifices of our freedom fighters and should draw lessons from their legacy. Sacrifice and service of our medical fraternity in battling Covid-19 is a perfect example of patriotism.”Earlier in the day, Kejriwal announced that government schools in the city will roll out deshbhakti (patriotism) curriculum from September 27, and from October 2, the government will roll out a yoga programme at public parks, residential areas and community halls. The scheduled launch dates of the two programmes coincide with birth anniversaries of Bhagat Singh and Mahatma Gandhi respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-high-mast-tricolours-unfurled-by-cm-ministers-across-delhi-101629050601805.html

On March 22 last year, two days before the nationwide Covid-pandemic induced lockdown was imposed, a total of 26 flights (13 each of landings and departures) were recorded at Shirdi, with around 20,000 to 25,000 people coming in daily. “The 2,500-meter runway was unable to accommodate bigger planes... These aircraft need a larger flight run for a take-off and must cover a certain distance after landing before they come to a halt. When the flight operations at the airport were stopped (after the lockdown was imposed), we utilised the opportunity to extend the runway length from 2,500m to 3,200m,” said Deepak Kapoor, vice-chairman and managing director, Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC). The extended runway was tested and completed recently.Kapoor said this would allow large aircraft to land and lead to airlines ferrying more pilgrims to the temple town in a plane.The MADC has installed and tested night-landing infrastructure at the airport. It has written to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is mandated with installing the necessary weather instrumentation for the purpose. The IMD has instructed its western region office to undertake the work. Once it is completed, night landing can be launched at the airport. This will enable pilgrims to attend the kakad aarti (the aarti performed at the crack of dawn) in Sai Baba temple without coming there a day earlier. While the runway extension and taxiways cost around ₹41 crore, the night landing infrastructure with CAT-1 lights and other equipment cost ₹9.85 crore.The present terminal building can handle 10,000 to 12,000 passengers daily, and the MADC is planning a new passenger terminal that can cater to around 20,000 to 25,000 passengers per day. It has sought ₹230 crore from the state for the new terminal building. The capacity expansion will ensure the airport can handle around 35,000 passengers.Kapoor added the Government of India had permitted cargo operations from the airport and in the pre-Covid period, they exported 250kg flowers to Delhi and 400 kg of fruits like pomegranates and grapes to Chennai and Bengaluru. “This will create an additional source of revenue for farmers... There is a lot of horticulture and floriculture around Shirdi. Based on a market survey, we realised that there is a huge demand for marigold and rose flowers in Chennai and Delhi. The farmers had to transport these flowers to Nashik, which affected the quality due to the low shelf-life and consequently, the prices,” he said. The MADC also plans to construct a separate cargo terminal to ensure seamless cargo operations and has appointed a consultant, who will submit a report in around two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-shirdi-airport-all-set-for-upgrade-101629050601136.html

15-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Fitness enthusiasts cycle for 75km to mark 75th Independence Day||A group of more than 25 fitness enthusiasts from different high-rises of the city marked the 75th Independence Day by cycling for 75km on Sunday. The cyclists said that their aim was to bring awareness among the denizens about a healthy lifestyle. The ride started at 4.30am from Manav Rachana School in Sector 51 and ended at 9am at Meghdutam Park in Sector 50, via the City Centre , Mahamaya Flyover, Pari Chowk, and Metro Depot in Greater Noida. The Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), a residential body, organised the event named NOFAATHON. The cyclists said that while the ride to commemorate the Independence Day was thrilling, the “cycling in the city is not easy, especially due to the poor conditions of various roads”. They pointed out the lack of proper cycling tracks and safety of riders in the city. “More than 25 residents from over 10 high-rise societies participated in the event covering a distance of 75km to celebrate the 75th Independence Day. The participants expressed concerns over several potholes and broken roads on the route. Such conditions discourage other residents to come forward and participate in such a recreational event. We urge the authorities to help make the city roads more cycle friendly and improve the already existing cycling tracks,” said Rajiva Singh, president of NOFAA.According to the official figures, the city has 17 different cycling tracks of total length 62.52km across 10 work circles (barring work circles 6 and 7). The longest track is of 12.30km along sectors 145, 146, 147, 154 and 161, while the shortest is 300 metres near Mahamaya Balika Inter College in Sector 44.However, the cyclists said that none of the tracks are in proper condition. “Most of the cycling tracks have eroded or are encroached upon. They are full of potholes, or are used by commuters to evade signals,” said Singh.Ashmita Arora, a resident of Sector 75 who participated in the event, said that Noida has some beautiful green patches but riding a cycle along them is a dangerous affair. “We have to be extra cautious as there are so many potholes and rough patches. Also, since all roads are not properly illuminated, we were dependent on our cycle lights since it’s early morning. Such experiences discourage many cyclists from plying on roads. Our today’s ride was aimed at raising such issues, including potholes and dark stretches,” said Arora.Officials of the Noida authority said that they are working on improving the condition of roads in the city. “We are already working on making the roads pothole-free. We have fixed over a thousand potholes in the past week,” said an official, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, two other groups -- Noida Express Cyclists (NEC) and Noida Express Walkers ( NEW) -- on Sunday concluded a 300km week-long cycling and 75km week-long walking challenge, respectively, and also held a separate 75km cycle ride marking the 75th Independence Day.“The week-long challenges and the 75km one-day cycle ride were held to promote a healthy living. A number of group members participated in the challenge and resolved to maintain a healthy living,” said Dr DK Gupta, who is the member of the NEC and NEW groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-fitness-enthusiasts-cycle-for-75km-to-mark-75th-independence-day-101629050240534.html
15-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Ineligible people book slots for booths meant only for parents, turned away||Healthcare workers in Gautam Budh Nagar district are having to turn away beneficiaries, who book their slots at the parents’ special (Abhibhwak Vishesh) Covid vaccination booths as they do not qualify or meet the conditions --of having a child of 12 years and below--based on which the inoculation centres have been set up. The special vaccination booths have been set up at the J P International school, which administers around 100 doses per day, and at a primary school in Bisrakh, which administers 300 shots a day, exclusively for parents whose children are 12 years and below. Both the centres are administering Covishield vaccines. Officials said that while the CoWIN app doesn’t have a mechanism to restrict unmarried people from booking slots at the special vaccination booths for parents, people too don’t pay attention to the exclusivity of the booths. Dipesh Kumar, a health worker deployed in the vaccination booth set up at Bisrakh, went into a tizzy on Friday as he had to cancel the slots of many bachelors through the CoWIN portal. “We know these beneficiaries haven’t deliberately booked their slots here as the portal doesn’t restrict them in doing so. People who have at least one child below 12 years of age are eligible to get vaccinated at these booths. Parents who have booked their slots for vaccination here need to produce a document of their child’s age proof to avail of the facility,” he said. Echoing similar views, Rakesh Kumar, a healthcare worker deployed at the vaccination booth in J P international school at Greater Noida Omega-1, said only beneficiaries who can furnish a document establishing the age of their child as 12 years or below can get a jab at these booths. “In the absence of such a document, they will not be vaccinated. On an average, we refuse at least 25 people daily, who are either unmarried or do not have any issue,” he said. Shekhar Suman Singh (49), who lives in Greater Noida, had to return from JP International school on Friday without taking the second dose. “My children are settled in the US. The nomenclature ‘Abhibhawak Vishesh’ caught my attention and I booked the slot without going through details. I was informed at the booth that since my children do not fall in the 12-year-old age bracket, I am not eligible to take the jabs. Anyway, it was my fault and I’ll get it from some other booth after booking the slot again,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said, “Following directions from the Uttar Pradesh government, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has started vaccinating parents of children below 12 years of age against Covid-19 from June 1. “I’ve also got reports that few ineligible beneficiaries turn up every day at these two booths without checking the criteria to be vaccinated at these booths. Since we don’t have any mechanism to mention the exclusivity of these booths, people book the slots unknowingly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ineligible-people-book-slots-for-booths-meant-only-for-parents-turned-away-101629050180563.html

15-08-2021||Gurugram||Corporates, govt staff felicitated during Independence Day celebrations||At least 15 corporate companies and 82 employees from various government departments were felicitated by the governor of Haryana, Bandaru Dattatreya, during the 75th Independence Day celebrations at Tau Devi Lal Stadium on Sunday for their contribution in handling the second wave of Covid-19 this year.Dattatreya, the chief guest for the celebrations, unfurled the national flag and inspected the parade troupes at the stadium. In his address, he pointed towards the state’s excellence in industrial production, automobile industries, foreign investment, education, sports and agriculture.The governor also highlighted the new schemes run by the state government to support farmers in the state. He said that for the development of agriculture, farmers are getting electricity at minimum rates per unit. “At least 5,309 villages across the state are getting 24-hour electricity supply. The state government has taken a historical decision to cut the electricity rates by 37 paise per unit,” he said.To ensure indigenous products developed by micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) in the state can have a market, Dattatreya said that a new department has been created to promote the small-scale industry. “Under this policy, the target is to generate 500,000 new jobs,” he said.Appreciating the duties performed during the pandemic, the governor felicitated officials of Maruti, M3M, DLF, Hero Motocorp Limited, iamgurgaon, Doctors for You, CISCO and IFFCO for arranging beds, oxygen concentrators, medicines and testing kits in April and May when the Covid-19 wave was at its peak.Gayatri Paul, the chief executive officer (CEO) of DLF Foundation that supplied 10,000 oximeters to the CM’s Covid Relief Initiative and set up oxygen plants in Bulandshahr and Gurugram, said, “It is a great honour for DLF Foundation to receive this award. We are humbled and remain committed to contributing meaningfully to the social development of the state and making a difference in people’s lives.”Dr Payal Kanodia, a trustee of M3M Foundation, said, “I would like to take this opportunity to thank the governor of Haryana and district administration for recognising our efforts in serving the nation during Covid-19.

15-08-2021||Gurugram||E-rickshaw zone comes into effect, 600 vehicles to be launched||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will launch 600 e-rickshaws in the city on Monday and put into effect the city’s first electric three-wheelers zone (ETWZ), officials said on Sunday. Diesel and CNG autorickshaws will not be allowed to operate in the zone, they said.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will kick off the e-rickshaws from Galleria Market around 11am. While 150 e-rickshaws will be flagged off from the Galleria Market, 450 will start off from other points in the zone. The launch of the vehicles and the creation of the electric three-wheelers zone project is being referred to as the Parivartan project.A spokesperson for the district administration said that Khattar will inaugurate three projects in the city, costing around ₹259 crore, and preside over the district grievance redressal meeting on Monday afternoon.“The Haryana chief minister will first launch the Parivartan project. Under this project, there is a plan to run electric three-wheelers in place of diesel-powered three-wheelers that are currently running in Gurugram. This is a joint effort of the MCG, regional transport authority (RTO), and Gurugram traffic police. Under this project, initially, 2,000 diesel-powered three-wheelers will be replaced at a cost of around ₹6 crore by e-three wheelers,” the spokesperson for the district administration stated in a release.According to MCG officials, the zone covers Udyog Vihar, Ambience Mall, DLF Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4, DLF-5, Cyber City-Golf Course Road stretch, Mall Mile, Huda City Centre (HCC), sectors 28 and 29, and Wazirabad.Gurugram traffic police and MCG officials have been carrying out awareness programmes for diesel autorickshaw drivers since July and cautioned them that upon entering the barred zone, they will be penalised and that repeated offences may lead to vehicles being impounded.The launch of e-rickshaws is a part of MCG’s plan of replacing 2,000 diesel autorickshaws with a cleaner mode of transportation to reduce the city’s air pollution. Efforts in this regard have been underway since last September.MCG officials did not disclose the fare details of the 600 e-rickshaws. However, they said that the fee will be nominal.“Taking cognisance of the high level of air pollution as well as the longstanding demand of citizens to introduce a metered mode of travel, the MCG is launching e-rickshaws across the city. This will not only help residents but also assist drivers, as the running and maintenance costs (of e-rickshaws) are far lower than diesel autorickshaws,” Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, the commissioner of MCG, said.In coordination with a private electric mobility service, the MCG has set up five electric parking and charging hubs in the zone. The charging hubs at Udyog Vihar and Wazirabad have a capacity of accommodating and charging 150 vehicles, while the ones at Huda City Centre, MG Road Metro station and Sikanderpur have a capacity of accommodating and charging 20-50 vehicles each. The MCG has also proposed setting up charging hubs in DLF Phase-3, Guru Dronacharya Metro station and Galleria Market, which will also have a capacity of accommodating and charging 20-50 vehicles each.The formation of an electric three-wheelers zone was announced by the MCG on July 9 following a meeting with Gurugram traffic police officials, district transport department officials and representatives of a private electric mobility service.In April, the MCG held a meeting with diesel autorickshaw owners and drivers to sensitise them about the environmental harms caused by diesel autorickshaws and MCG’s policies, including monetary aid, for switching to the electric mode of transport.However, members of autorickshaw unions said that they were not consulted and that they received mixed information on whether CNG autorickshaws will be allowed to operate in the zone.“Our union was not called for any meeting with MCG officials and the matter was discussed with auto owners and a few drivers alone. While we are not against the move, we want clarity on whether CNG autos can ply in the ETWZ as we have received mixed information on the matter,” Yogesh Sharma, state general secretary, Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, said.According to Sharma, there are 8,265 diesel autorickshaws in Gurugram.“The MCG needs to ensure that they have some form of parameters or standards for e-rickshaws to ensure that only the safest and sturdiest e-rickshaws are introduced in the city,” said Sewa Raman, an urban transport system design expert and a faculty member with the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/erickshaw-zone-comes-into-effect-600-vehicles-to-be-launched-101629048622806.html
15-08-2021||Gurugram||Khattar to inaugurate water supply, waste facility and electric vehicles||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will inaugurate infrastructure projects worth ₹259 crore in the city on Monday, following which he will take part in the monthly grievance redressal committee meeting and participate in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally in Jamalpur, officials said. A spokesperson for the district administration said that CM Manohar Lal Khattar would inaugurate a water supply project in sectors 81 to 99. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority undertook the project at a cost of ₹76.21 crore, through which piped water supply will be provided to 16 sectors, 81 to 91, 93, 94 and 99, located along the Dwarka Expressway. The water supply will also start partially in five adjoining residential sectors through a 55.33-kilometre-long water pipeline that was laid, said officials. With the inauguration of the project, developers can apply for new water connections and can get a regular water supply for the residents instead of depending on water tankers for the purpose. Khattar will also inaugurate a solid waste management project digitally, which is being made operational in Sonepat. An electric three-wheeler project will also be launched in the city on Monday in Sector 28. The electric three-wheeler project is being launched to replace the diesel autorickshaws operating in the city to reduce pollution. As per a rough estimate, over 8,000 diesel autos operating in the city need to be replaced. Khattar will chair the monthly grievance committee meeting later in the day, which will be held in Sector 44. After the meeting, the chief minister will go to Jamalpur village near Pataudi to participate in the Jan Ashirvad Yatra, which is being organised by the BJP in south Haryana and parts of Rajasthan to felicitate the newly appointed union cabinet minister Bhupinder Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khattar-to-inaugurate-water-supply-waste-facility-and-electric-vehicles-101629048621198.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay’s Afghan students granted permission to join campus||Afghan students enrolled in the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay have sought permission from the institute to return to campus as conditions deteriorate in war-torn Afghanistan. Almost all cities in Afghanistan have fallen to the insurgent group Taliban, which is engaged in a military takeover of the country. As the Taliban waits to take over the presidential palace in capital Kabul, scores of Afghans have been attempting to flee the country.“The nine students, who registered during the current semester, have been permitted by IIT-B to come to the campus. Since these students are ICCR sponsored students, ICCR Mumbai office is working closely with the Indian Embassy in Kabul to issue visas to the students,” said Amit Agrawal, dean, international relations, IIT-B. The two senior students admitted in 2019 and 2020 are already on campus. At IIT-B, one student from Afghanistan is admitted to the academic years 2019 and 2020. In the current academic year, nine Afghan students have been admitted to the M-Tech programme and have been attending lectures online, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, amid deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan, the nine students had requested the institute to allow them to come to campus. “We offered admission to quite a few students from Afghanistan in the Master’s programme this year under scholarships from Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). Because of online instructions, they were participating in the class from home. However, due to rapidly deteriorating conditions in their homeland, they wanted to come out of their country and join the hostels on the campus. Although we have approved their request to come to the campus as a special case, we are not sure how late it is for them to pursue their dreams. We hope that they are all safe and can join us soon,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B. Renu Prithiani, regional director, ICCR Mumbai, declined to comment on the matter. Vinay Sahasrabudhe, president, ICCR, remained unavailable for comment. “These Afghan students, through their training at IIT-B, like our other alumni, would play crucial leadership roles in developing their country, once the current nightmare ends. These international students later in life will become the greatest ambassadors of our country. It is imperative that these students and their families, along with others, are safe today. They are in our prayers,” said Chaudhuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombays-afghan-students-granted-permission-to-join-campus-101629046401176.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees heaviest rains in over two weeks||After a prolonged dry spell lasting more than two weeks, Mumbai received its heaviest showers of August on Sunday. In the 24 hours ending at 8.30am, the city’s automatic weather station at Santacruz recorded 25.6mm of rain (considered to be ‘moderate’), while Colaba recorded heavier showers with 42.8mm of rain in the same period.Parts of the city’s northern suburbs, in addition to Thane and Navi Mumbai, experienced isolated heavy showers, recording between 40 to 70mm of rain in 24 hours ending 8.30am on Sunday. Bhayander saw the heaviest showers as per data from the IMD’s mesonet system, with 69.5mm of rain. Moderate to intense intermittent spells of rains over the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) continued till about 2pm, before petering out toward the evening. Experts and officials attributed the revival to an upper air cyclonic circulation forming over the Bay of Bengal, which has helped to activate a monsoon trough along the Maharashtra coast and strengthened rain-bearing westerly winds.“As we had predicted earlier this month, we are starting to see signs of a monsoon revival over the Konkan coast. The next two weeks will see higher chances of moderate to heavy rains. Over Mumbai, rains are expected to be moderate for the next three days at least. When the circulation over the Bay of Bengal intensifies into a low-pressure area, we will get heavy rains again in about four to five days,” said a meteorologist with the IMD’s regional centre in Mumbai.Mumbai has been placed under a ‘green’ category weather alert till August 19, indicating chances of light-moderate rain, which will be scattered and isolated. More widespread rain is expected around August 19. The maximum and minimum temperatures, for the next week, are expected to remain around 30 degrees Celsius and 24 degrees Celsius respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-heaviest-rains-in-over-two-weeks-101629045440749.html

Raut also targeted the Central government and said that the independence of several institutions is dying today as the Parliament, judiciary and media are unable to function freely. He asked if independence meant not allowing political opponents to speak in the Parliament and calling marshals to stop them from doing so.The Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP), in his weekly column Rokhthok, also said that Sibal said unless elections move back to the ballot paper, instead of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), success in polls is not possible.“Opposition parties met at Kapil Sibal’s home on [last] Monday over dinner. There was a consensus among all that unless we come together, we will not succeed. But a law expert like Kapil Sibal raised questions over the manner of voting. Sibal said that until we do away with EVMs, we will not succeed in 2024. We must fight to get the ballot paper back. I do not speak without evidence. Sibal is not a leader or a lawyer who would merely shoot in the dark. The EVM issue will have to be resolved. Where there is a huge question mark over the election process, what can one speak on democracy and the Parliament,” Raut wrote in his column published on Sunday.Over the past few weeks, opposition parties have united against the BJP-led government in the monsoon session that concluded last week. Around 15 opposition parties took on the Centre over the Pegasus snooping reports and held protests. They collectively held meetings chaired by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.Raut said that for the past few days “democracy is dead in Delhi” and said that opposition was stifled in the Parliament by the “absolute majority” of the ruling party. “Democracy crushed under the boots of ‘Marshal’ Law in the Parliament... While we celebrate the Amrut Mahotsav of the country’s independence, many institutions are losing their independence. Parliament, judiciary, media do not have the independence of working freely. Political opponents are not allowed to speak in the Parliament and an army of marshals is brought there. Is this freedom?” Raut asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/parliament-judiciary-media-do-not-have-independence-to-work-freely-raut-slams-centre-101629045140796.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court orders police to probe former NCP MLA’s role in 2016 firing case||The sessions court has directed the Nehru Nagar police to investigate the alleged role played by former Nationalist Congress Party MLA Milind Kamble in connection with the 2016 firing at a construction site manager.According to the prosecution case, on August 19, 2016, Kamble’s driver Mangesh Waghmare, a resident of Sakharabai Shingare Chawl in Kurla had fired six rounds from a country-made pistol at the site manager - Anil Laxman Bhise. Four bullets had hit Bhise but he survived the attack.Sessions judge Dr UJ More, while ordering further investigation in the case observed, “The incident of six bullets shot by a revolver in the body of the applicant/ complainant took place near the container /room at about 2.30pm. On the date of the incident after being shot by the last bullet, only Milind Kamble and Gautam Shinde were present, meanwhile, the accused ran away. This is suspicious needs to be investigated properly.”Almost five years after the incident, Bhise approached the sessions court pleading to direct the police to investigate Kamble and his bodyguard Shinde’s role in the firing.Bhise alleged that he was attacked by Waghmare on instructions of Kamble, as he was not getting the consent for the redevelopment of the chawl where Bhise and Waghmare were residing. It was alleged that Waghmare had used Kamble’s pistol which was in the car at the time of the incident.Bhise had raised suspicion about the circumstances under which Waghmare attacked him. He has also claimed that the statements of Shinde and Kamble were contradictory.Bhise’s lawyer contended that when Kamble had a car at the time of the incident, why did he not take him to Sion hospital. Bhise was taken to Rajawadi Hospital in an autorickshaw.Bhise has alleged that at the time of the incident, a man with ₹22 lakh was sitting in the car. However, the police charge sheet has no mention of it.“On this count also further investigation is required by inquiring that unknown person and about ₹22 lakhs cash in his hand,” the court said while directing the police to further investigate.“In this case being certain role in the commission of an offence, as the revolver i.e., the weapon which is used for attempting murder, was lying in that car only. It is to be noted that Ex-MLA Milind Kamble was not accompanied by the injured complainant at Rajawadi Hospital and Sion Hospital. On that count also investigation needs to be carried out by the investigating agency,” reads the court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-orders-police-to-probe-former-ncp-mla-s-role-in-2016-firing-case-101629043640667.html

15-08-2021||Delhi||Independence Day 2021: Another year of dismal sales for kite sellers due to Covid-19||In the run-up to Independence Day, seeing skies full of vibrant and unique kites is a sight to behold. The streets of Old Delhi are flooded with enthusiasts making their way through the stalls, checking and picking out the latest kite designs. However, Covid-19 has spelt subdued business for kite sellers in Lal Kuan, the wholesale hub for kites in Delhi, the second year in a row. Shop owners reveal a further decline in sales than last year and a dearth of buyers. Some also opine that the craze of kite flying has diminished. Drop in sales “The business has decreased by 50%. On average, we used to get 10-12 customers. Now, it has reduced to only five or six,” says Altaf Qureshi from Kallu Bhai Patang Wale. The reason for the drop in sales could be the financial losses or personal losses amid the pandemic, believes Himanshu Gupta from Bishan Chand & Sons. He says, “Now people have the mindset that pehle apne ghar ki needs poori karni hai, baad mein occasion dekhenge.”Restricted timings The guidelines to shut shops earlier than usual are hindering the sales, too. Qureshi says, “Earlier, we used to be open till 11pm or 12am as wholesale buyers come at that time. Now we shut our shops by 9pm.”Lack of interest in kite-flying The sellers also feel the craze of kite-flying is fading. “School ke bachche kaafi aate they, ab schools are shut so there’s hardly any crowd,” says Mohammed Ahmed from Haji Kite House. To this, Qureshi adds, “Bachchon ka dhyan mobile phone mein divert ho gaya hai.” Less demand, less supply Ahmed says, “Stock jo tha wahi nikaal rahe hain. It’s a challenge to even sell this lot.” Gupta, too, has placed a smaller order with dealers. He says, “Customers from Haryana used to come and buy kites in bulk, but ab bahar ke aate nahin hai lene.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/independence-day-2021-another-year-of-dismal-sales-for-kite-sellers-due-to-covid19-101629019279230.html

15-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains open for fully vaccinated passengers: Check SOPs here||Mumbai local train services resumed for people who have taken both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine from Sunday, after a gap of four months. Passengers were restricted from commuting in local trains in the first week of April after the second wave of coronavirus pandemic. Local train services resumed on February 1 this year, after nearly a year of the network remaining off-limits for people beginning March 2020 amid the first wave of the pandemic.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on August 8 said that in order to continue the economic cycle, the state government is imposing certain criteria and restrictions to allow ordinary passengers to travel locally. “Passengers who are fully vaccinated will be able to travel by local from August 15,” Thackeray added.Ahead of its resumption of services of local trains, the state government on Thursday launched an online facility to enable citizens who have taken their second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine a fortnight ago to obtain passes to travel in suburban trains.Here are the SOPs issued for travelling in Mumbai local trains:1. Passengers who have smartphones can download the train pass through a mobile application. "Passengers who do not have a smartphone can take photo passes from municipal ward offices in the city as well as suburban railway stations. These passes are for local travel which will have QR codes so that the railway administration can verify their authenticity. I urge you not to allow anyone to obtain passes illegally. Get fully vaccinated and travel," Thackeray said.2. Universal passes with Quick Response (QR) code are being made available to the commuters through both offline and online systems. The offline system of verification of vaccination certificates and issuing passes was started outside railway stations by municipal bodies and now the commuters could also get their certificates verified and obtain e-passes online by logging on to http://epassmsdma.mahait.org/.3. Special squad teams consisting of ticket checking staff and Railway Protection Force (RPF) have been deployed for inspection of vaccination certificates and railway passes both by the Central Railway and the Western Railway.

15-08-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal says launch of Deshbhakti curriculum in Delhi schools from Sept 27||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced the roll out of the Deshbhakti (patriotism) curriculum from September 27 in government-run schools in the city and Yoga programme at public parks and community halls on October 2. These programmes were mentioned in the Delhi budget 2020-21 presented by the Kejriwal government.In his Independence Day speech from the lawns of the Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal further elaborated on Delhi’s experience with Covid-19 pandemic while appreciating the role of healthcare and frontline workers in fighting the pandemic. He also highlighted the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) efforts to enhance public welfare services and act as a role model for other states.“For the last 1.5 years, people are facing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic and a large number of doctors, paramedics and frontline workers have lost their lives. India has witnessed two waves of Covid-19. Delhi has witnessed four – in June 2020, September 2020, November 2020 and April 2021. The April wave in Delhi was the most dangerous. There will hardly be any family in Delhi which has not seen infection among relatives. So many of them lost their loved ones. It was an emotional phase for us. Our ministers, MLAs, officers worked 24x7 to save lives,” said Kejriwal in his Sunday’s speech.At its peak, Delhi recorded more than 28,300 new Covid-19 cases in 24-hours on April 20 and a positivity rate of more than 36% on April 22. The Covid-19 surge left the city’s healthcare system overburdened, which was worsened by a severe crisis of oxygen, resulting in a high number of deaths.The chief minister further said, “I salute the doctors, nurses and paramedics who served us with utmost dedication. They are no less than a soldier. There was an existing Delhi government scheme to help martyred soldiers’ kin with ₹1 crore in financial assistance. We extended the same scheme to healthcare and frontline workers. Lives of people are priceless. This amount is the minimum token of gratitude for their service to the people of Delhi. Delhi government stands with the patients too.”“The children who have been orphaned are our children. We can’t abandon them. We have made a scheme for them too. We have also made a scheme for those who lost breadwinners,” said Kejriwal – referring to financial assistance schemes under which children orphaned by Covid-19 and households losing their primary breadwinners in Delhi are entitled to a monthly financial assistance of ₹2,500.Highlighting the AAP government’s role in the education sector, the chief minister said: “In 74 years, in schools of our country, we have taught physics, chemistry, maths, history but not patriotism. We assumed that students would learn that themselves. I am happy to announce such a curriculum in Delhi’s schools to encourage our students to take pride in the nation. This will be a completely activity-based programme to make children understand their roles and duties as a responsible citizen. Every child will be prepared to contribute to nation building and sacrifice everything for the nation. There is no better day to start the programme than Bhagat Singh’s birth anniversary. He had sacrificed his life for the nation at the age of 23. I also urge parents to discuss patriotism and responsibilities with children when they are home.” Bhagat Singh’s birth anniversary is on September 28.Kejriwal said he was happy to announce that the Delhi board of school education has signed a MoU (memorandum of agreement) with the international board to offer a much sought after and internationally recognised curriculum in the city schools.Kejriwal also claimed that Delhi had become a good governance laboratory under his party’s rule. He said his government recognised its responsibility to provide quality basic services including education, healthcare, water and electricity to residents and the AAP government’s model was now being adopted by other political outfits.“We are doing experiments on every aspect of governance. Recently we made the regional transport offices provide all services online—no queue, no crowd, no loss of working day, no touts. If one does not know how to use the internet, just call 1076. We started with the transport department. Slowly, we will provide all government services online. In recent years, we launched the doorstep delivery model – which has more than 150 services now. In schools we launched a happiness class aimed at medication, positivity, encouragement. We launched entrepreneurship classes,” he said, naming a few initiatives of the government.Highlighting the importance of Yoga and meditation along with Gandhian values, Kejriwal said, “We have to make Yoga a part of people’s life. This year from October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will launch a programme of Yoga classes in parks and community centres. We are training a large number of yoga instructors for the programme. If groups of residents of any colony ask us about instructors, we will help them under the programme.”He further spoke of his ambitions to bring Delhi’s per capita income at par with Singapore’s and bidding for the Olympics in 2048, promises made during the budget session of the assembly earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-says-launch-of-deshbhakti-curriculum-in-delhi-schools-from-sept-27-101629013098970.html

The firm neither had experience of conducting tests nor did it have a registered office...,” said the official.While attempts to contact Mela health officer Dr Arjun Sengar went unanswered, Haridwar CMO Dr SK Jha refused to comment on the report.“As far as Max Corporate Services is concerned, I had already stated that its application was rejected for conducting Covid-19 tests in Mahakumbh as it was not listed by the Indian Medical Research Council,” Jha said.Allegations of fake testing surfaced at the Kumbh after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/fake-covid-testing-scam-probe-report-questions-role-of-2-health-officers-101628976635533.html

The gesture was appreciated by both the armies and is expected to further promote goodwill and mutual trust,” he added. A senior BSF officer also said sweets and pleasantries were exchanged between BSF and Pak Rangers on four meeting points along the 200km-long international border in Jammu region. “Today, Pak Rangers and BSF exchanged sweets on the occasion of Pakistan’s Independence Day at various border outposts along the 200km long Indo-Pak international border from Kathua to Akhnoor,” said BSF Jammu frontier DIG SPS Sandhu. The sweets exchange programme was held at Chamliyal, Chinaz and Octroi posts. At Octroi post, Pak Rangers officer Ashiq led his side. This was the second exchange of sweets between the countries after the Pulwama terror attack on a CRPF convoy by a suicide bomber that left 40 CRPF personnel dead on February 14, 2019. It was carried out by a Jaish suicide bomber, who rammed a vehicle carrying over 100kg of explosives into the CRPF bus in Pulwama district. The attack also left many critically wounded. On July 21, both countries had indulged in sweets diplomacy on the Indo-Pak borders to celebrate the festival of Eid-ul-Adha. On August 10, director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said that “after a brief lull following a renewed truce deal between the two DGMOs on February 25, infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir has resumed” and that “terror camps across the border were still intact.” India will reciprocate with a similar gesture on Sunday on the occasion of her Independence Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/paks-i-day-indian-pak-troops-exchange-sweets-along-loc-101628972646074.html

Her husband who used to run a cybercafé was also out of work due to the lockdown.The school her seven-year-old daughter studies in will be giving them a phone to ensure the girl’s education is not affected.The Balak Mandir Sanstha Primary School at Tilak Chowk in Kalyan (W), a Marathi medium school established in 1949, took the initiative of giving mobile phones to those students who are deprived of online education as their parents could not afford one. The school, which has around 500 students, gifted mobile phones to 35 students recently. The funds for the phone were allotted by the alumni of the school.Joshi said, “The phone which I have is given for my son’s online class. I was clueless about my daughter’s online class. Also my husband’s phone is an old model. When the school decided to give her a phone, she was happy. During the lockdown, we both lost our jobs and have also taken up selling stationeries. However, that also did not succeed as the schools are shut and most people buy stuff online now-a-days,” said Joshi.After collecting the funds, the school also formed a team to do a survey of those students who were not able to attend the online class due to lack of mobile phones. The team visited their houses and checked their financial condition and learned about the ordeals of the parents.“Most of the students who were not able to attend the online class are from remote areas. Their parents could not afford phones. We decided to give them one so that their education was not affected. We also helped them with SIM cards and did the recharge for two months so that they start attending the lectures online,” said Vilas Likhar, a Class 4 teacher at the school.Yogita Sutar, 38, a parent of two girls, said, “My younger daughter could not attend the class for two months as I had only one phone to give to my elder daughter for her class. She was upset about it while we were struggling to buy a new phone. My husband works in Mumbai and we earn very less. Now, she had started attending the class regularly”Vrushali Kulkarni Joshi, 29, an alumni of the school, said, “When I came to know about the school initiating to give phones to the students, I decided to discuss this in my alumni group and most of them agreed. We managed to raise ₹1 lakh and give to the school. I passed out in 2006-07, and I am still connected to my school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-school-alumni-funds-phones-for-students-to-continue-with-online-classes-101628969526587.html

At present, the Covid tests are in the range of 45,000 to 49,000 per day.Chairing a Covid review meeting, the CM directed the health department to undertake priority sentinel testing for patients at government and private hospitals, travellers at entry points, government offices, industries, labour colonies, staff at marriage palaces, restaurants, pubs, bars, gyms etc. Amarinder also directed the health department to gear up for full utilisation of the additional vaccine supply, of which he had been assured by the Union health minister. Noting that more than half of the eligible population of the state had already received one dose of vaccine, with the entire available stock being used without any wastage, the CM said he had, during his meeting with the Union health minister earlier this week, sought immediate supply of 55 lakh doses to inoculate Punjab’s eligible population. He had been assured of increased supplies, said Amarinder. Stressing that there was no doubt regarding vaccine effectiveness, the CM urged all eligible persons to come forward to get themselves vaccinated.

That is why we have developed an off-grid, manual washing machine, which saves 60-70% of time and 50% of water, for people in low-income and displaced communities,” notes the charity’s fundraising drive.“This idea was born out of a friendship. Nav, our founder, was on a sabbatical in rural South India, making clean cook stoves when he met his neighbour, Divya. It was through their conversations at the end of each day that Nav came to realise the significant burden unpaid labour places on women,” it notes.Sawhney was on a sabbatical from his engineering career in the UK when the idea of a hand-cranked washing machine struck him.“While in Tamil Nadu, I lived in a small village called Kuilapalayam. The community had limited access to continuous electricity, and water was switched on twice a day,” recalls Sawhney.“My next-door neighbour Divya and I became excellent friends. While we talked, she would hand wash her clothes. I was always so shocked at how long and how much effort it would take to conduct the relatively unproductive task,” he said.This led to him coming up with the “Divya 1.5” model of his manual washing machine, inspired by a simple salad spinner. Now 30 of the Divya 1.5 will be used at Mamrashan Refugee Camp in Iraq with the help of the charity Care International. It is expected to positively impact 300 people and save up to 750 hours annually per household, equivalent to two months of daylight hours. Sawhney plans to head to Iraq at the beginning of September to help distribute the machines.Later this year, the washing machine project aims to fulfil orders to refugee camps in Jordan. Eventually, the plan is for these machines to be shipped to other parts of the world, including India and Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/british-sikh-engineer-s-low-cost-washing-machines-to-head-to-india-101628968625183.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Will Maharashtra guv clear all 12 MLC nominees easily?||After the Bombay high court’s (HC) remarks over the nomination of the 12 members for the legislative Council from the governor’s quota and the subsequent meeting between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi, some development is expected over the issue, which has been a reason for the ongoing friction between the Raj Bhavan and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Raj Bhavan officials opined that Koshyari is unlikely to clear the proposal easily and may raise questions over some of the recommendations made by the MVA government. The 12 names recommended to the governor from the fields of literature, science and art, social service and cooperative movement are as per the provision of filling a sixth of the posts in the upper house of the state legislature. The MVA government, ruled by Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, had recommended four names each to Koshyari last November for the posts, which are lying vacant since May-June last year. But he has not taken any decision on the names. MVA leaders have been accusing Koshyari of playing politics over the nominations. In response to a petition, HC had on Friday said that the governor is duty-bound to declare his decision on the nominations within a “reasonable time” and the failure to do so defeats the statutory intent. HC also said that the governor should have communicated his reservations about the list to the chief minister (CM) instead of keeping the posts vacant indefinitely, which amounts to an unreasonable time lapse.The MVA government’s council of ministers, led by CM Uddhav Thackeray, had submitted the list of 12 members recommended to be appointed by the governor on November 6. The list included the names of actor Urmila Matondkar, Vijay Karanjkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; farmers’ leader Raju Shetti, former minister Eknath Khadse, Yashpal Bhinge and folk singer Anand Shinde from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress.“Though the governor’s meeting in Delhi on Friday evening was a scheduled earlier, the duo [Shah and Koshyari] must have discussed the remarks by the court. The governor will now have to act upon the state government’s recommendations, but it does not mean that all the 12 names will be cleared immediately. In 2015, the then Uttar Pradesh governor and former BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) leader Ram Naik had deferred the appointments to the Council recommended by the Samajwadi Party government in the state. After a lot of noise, Naik had cleared a few of the nine names recommended. Koshyari, too, is likely to adopt a similar approach after the court remarks,” said a Raj Bhavan official, requesting anonymity.“The recommendations of the council of ministers are binding on the Governor as Article 163 says: There shall be a council of ministers with the CM as the head to aid and advice the governor. It also adds that the discretionary powers of the governor exist for constitutional reasons, under which the appointment of the 12 members does not fall. In this case, under Article 167, the governor can raise queries related to credentials of the nominees from the respective fields they have been recommended. But ultimately, the power of the decision over whether any particular nominee fits into the recommended category lies with the cabinet and not the governor,” said constitutional expert Ulhas Bapat, adding that in his opinion the time taken by the Maharashtra governor to clear the proposal is unreasonable.After the MVA government had made the recommendation in November, Naik had said: “The governor cannot replace his own name as the recommendation by the cabinet is binding on him, but he can seek clarification from the government on the proposal. I released the first list of four out of nine recommended names after three months and refused to clear the remaining ones as there were criminal and income tax cases against them. The then CM Akhilesh Yadav had to replace the names, which were later approved.”“We hope that the honourable governor will clear the names as soon as possible. I don’t know if the meeting between Koshyariji and Amit Shahji was in the capacity of their constitutional posts or as former party colleagues, but we expect the recommendations to be cleared now,” state minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said.Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said, “The constitutional provisions can’t be different in two different states. The nominations made by the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar after being elected last November were cleared by the governor within days. How could there be a different treatment in Maharashtra while dealing with the similar constitutional affairs? The governor will have to reply to this question,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-maharashtra-guv-clear-all-12-mlc-nominees-easily-101628968505456.html

Officials said the contraband was smuggled from Pakistan and was concealed in a battery of a tractor across the barbed-wire fence. The seizure was made after disclosure of an accused, who was arrested under the charges of NDPS Act a few days ago, they said. “The arrested man told us that three packets of heroin, which is suspected to have smuggled from Pakistan a few days ago, have been concealed between the barbed-wire fence and the zero line at an abandoned area,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP-STF), Amritsar, Vawinder Mahajan.An STF team was sent to the border to coordinate with the Border Security Force (BSF) and launch a search operation. “During the search, three packets of heroin weighing 3kg and 130gms were recovered from the tractor battery,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3kg-heroin-seized-along-pak-border-in-gurdaspur-101628968325166.html

Meanwhile, the World Punjabi Organisation has appealed to the Union home minister for early evacuation of 257 Afghan Hindu and Sikh families from Kabul.In a statement, international president of the organisation Vikramjit Singh Sahney said it is the need of the hour to bring the Afghan-origin Sikhs and Hindus safely to India as their lives are in grave danger.The organisation is ready to do the needful for the rehabilitation of those who would come from Afghanistan and provide them training for job-oriented courses free of charge, the statement said.Sahney had last year sent three chartered flights to evacuate 500 Hindu and Sikh families from Kabul, Ghazni and Jalalabad and other areas of Afghanistan.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-safety-of-afghan-sikhs-sgpc-to-centre-101628968264994.html
15-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai slums free of Covid-19 containment zones||The city is completely free of containment zones in its slums. The last two slums that were under containment at K-East ward, which covers Andheri East, were released on Friday. Meanwhile, there are still 30 micro containment zones in non-slum pockets of the city. This again establishes the fact that non-slums areas are the main source of Covid-19 infection in the city. Meanwhile, amid Covid-19 cases declining in the state, the lockdown will ease from Sunday onwards. Restaurant owners can extend business hours till 10pm, while shopping malls will be open to the public. Further, fully vaccinated citizens will be allowed to travel in suburban trains in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Private offices can function round-the-clock at full strength, while restrictions on people attending weddings have been relaxed. Containment zones are places where positive cases have been detected and that surrounding area have been sealed to protect everyone inside and outside from further spread. When the second wave started from the middle of February, the city had 54 active containment zones in slums. This increased to around 80 by the end of April when the pandemic curve was at its peak. However, this number is far less than compared to the first wave. In May last year, over 650 slums were under containment zones where movement of the dwellers were strictly regulated. With a steady decline in Covid-19 cases, the last two containment zones at K-East ward have been released. “We had two slums under containment zones which have been released. For the first time this year, we don’t have any containment zones,” said Prashant Sapkale, ward officer of K-East. Since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, nearly 2,800 containment zones in slums have been released in the city. Meanwhile, the city has 30 sealed buildings, with five or more cases which are also referred to as micro containment zones. These are spread across 10 wards, out of 24 wards, with the highest in K-West (Andheri, Jogeshwari). If there are fewer than five Covid-19 cases in a building, then the floors of the building where the active Covid-19 patients are identified are sealed by the civic body. As per BMC data, there are around 1,300 sealed floors in separate buildings across the city. More than 50% (6,534,460) of Mumbai’s total population of 12,442,373 (as per 2011 census) resides in slum areas, making the inhabitants vulnerable to contracting the infection owing to their poor and unhygienic living conditions. But as the BMC figure shows, non-slums residents were the major contributors of the second wave. “We have conducted ward-wise studies in the second wave which showed that 90% of the cases are from residential buildings. There can be several contributing factors like high sero prevalence in slums as shown in sero surveys,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The Covid-19 containment proactive strategies not only helped BMC in controlling cases in slums, but their ‘Dharavi model’ also bagged them national fame and appreciation.Through door-to-door surveys at slums, BMC created a health map that helped diagnose Covid-19 patients faster and maintain a record of high-risk patients who were immediately isolated in Covid Care Centres (CCC).“We followed three strategies in slums— test, isolate and treat. Other than RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), we have been conducting rapid antigen tests on the floating crowds in slums,” added Kakani. At present, the average growth rate of the last seven days stands at 0.04%. Coming to the ease in lockdown, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said people need to take adequate precautions, while facilities are opening up. “The easing is being done to facilitate the economic cycle and all precautions should be taken to curtail the Covid-19 transmission rates. If people let their guard down and don’t adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, then we are in trouble again due to the impending third wave,” he warned.The second wave this year was more severe than last year’s first wave as it infected more people and caused more deaths than the first one. This resulted in lockdown. As the state opened up, all shopkeepers and restaurant owners were allowed to function till 4pm only. On August 3, only shopkeepers were allowed to function till 10pm while restaurants were not given any relief. This resulted in anger among the hoteliers who protested to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Now the state has also extended their timings till 10pm.Romi Chaddha, director of the Cosmic Group, which has four hotels in Mumbai, said they would be opening three of their outlets on Sunday. “We are taking all precautions as it is not just our consumers but it even our health is at stake due to this pandemic,” said Chaddha.Also, those visiting shopping malls will also have to carry the final vaccination certificate,Private offices whose employees are fully vaccinated have been allowed to keep their offices functional 24X7, but they have to stagger the work hours and keep 25 per cent strength at one time.Gymnasiums, parlours and salons in the state will be allowed to open with 50 per cent capacity. The spas and gymnasiums will be allowed to function till 10pm, The government has allowed weddings in open place with a cap of 200 people. In case the venue is a closed hall, the number has been limited to 100 or 50 per cent capacity of the venue, whichever is less.Indoor games have been allowed till 10pm provided everyone is fully vaccinated.BMC officials say that in view of the shortage of vaccines, they will allow employees of the shops to work only if they have taken at least on vaccine dose. However the owners should ensure that the employee also takes the second one.Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 5,787 Covid-19 new cases with 134 deaths. Mumbai’s tally of new cases was 265 with 6 deaths, thus bringing its total death toll to 15977.The total number of Covid-19 patients right from the outbreak last year has now reached 63,87,863.There were 2,14,215 tests done on Saturday while the number of recoveries clocked 5352.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 63,262, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 1,34,909. There are currently 63,262 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 14,738 patients, followed by Satara with 7295 active patients and Sangli with 6,591.The death toll has now reached 134,909, with Pune leading with 18,727 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,977 and Thane with 11,142.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-slums-free-of-covid-19-containment-zones-101628968212230.html

15-08-2021||Mumbai||IT Rules: Bombay HC stays 2 clauses, says people would be starved of liberty of thought||People would be starved of the liberty of thought and feel suffocated to exercise their right of freedom of speech and expression, if they are made to live in the times of content regulation on the Internet with the code of ethics hanging over their head as the Sword of Damocles, the Bombay high court (HC) said on Saturday while staying two clauses of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.“This regime would run clearly contrary to the well-recognised constitutional ethos and principles,” said the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while staying clauses (1) and (3) of Rule 9 of the IT Rules.Rule 9 (1) required publishers to observe the code of ethics laid down under the IT Rules. Rule 9(3) provided for a three-tier mechanism – self-regulation by the publishers, regulation by self-regulating bodies of the publishers and oversight mechanism by the Centre – for ensuring observance of the code of ethics and for addressing grievances made in relation to the publishers.The interim order came on a petition filed by Agij Promotion of Nineteenonea Media Pvt Ltd, which owns and operates digital news web portal The Leaflet, and a public interest litigation filed by Mumbai-based journalist Nikhil Wagle.They had moved HC challenging the validity of the new IT Rules, contending that the rules are ex-facie draconian, arbitrary and patently ultra vires the provisions of the parent legislation – the IT Act and the provisions of Articles 14, 19 (1) (a) and 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution which guarantee fundamental freedoms to the citizens.HC accepted their contentions and held that Rules 9 (1) and 9 (3) infringe on fundamental freedoms of the petitioners.“Dissent in democracy is vital,” said the bench. “For proper administration of the state, it is healthy to invite criticism of all those who are in public service for the nation to have a structured growth, but with the 2021 Rules in place, one would have to think twice before criticising any personality, even if the writer/editor/ publisher may have good reasons to do so” the bench added.HC said the indeterminate and wide terms of the new IT Rules bring about a “chilling effect” qua the right of freedom of speech and expression of writers/ editors/publishers because they can be hauled up for anything if the inter-departmental committee (to be set under the Rules) so wishes. “The 2021 Rules are, thus, manifestly unreasonable and go beyond the IT Act, its aims and provisions,” said the bench.The court added that allowing the operation of the 2021 Rules in its form and substance to operate would result in the writer/editor/ publisher standing the risk of being punished and sanctioned, should the inter-departmental committee be not in favour of criticism of any public figure. “It is, therefore, quite possible that the writer/editor/publisher on contravention of the provisions of clause (1) of Rule 9 of 2021 Rules, but without even transgressing the boundaries set by clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution, may expose himself/itself to punishment or sanction under the 2021 Rules.”HC concluded that allowing Rule 9 as it is “would generate pernicious effects” and therefore, stayed operation of Rules 9(1) and 9(3).The bench also found the two rules ultra vires the provisions of the IT Act, as the Rules introduced measures for contravention of provisions of two completely different enactments – the Press Council of India Act and the Cable Television Network Act – by introducing the code of ethics for publishers of the news portals, online news aggregators etc.HC, however, refused to stay Rule 7 of the new IT Rules which seeks to withdraw the protection granted to intermediaries under section 79 (1) of the IT Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/it-rules-bombay-hc-stays-2-clauses-says-people-would-be-starved-of-liberty-of-thought-101628968145249.html

The launch was attended by all top UT officials, some of whom even cycled a distance with the administrator. The launch board, however, mentioned that the inauguration was conducted in the presence of Chandigarh member of Parliament Kirron Kher when she is away to Mumbai for cancer treatment. Cholera outbreak in Zirakpur triggers political blame game After two residents died and 430 cases of cholera surfaced in colonies of Baltana township last week, leaders of the Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party resorted to blaming each other. Akali MLA NK Sharma said the Congress government had failed to change water and sewerage pipes in the area over the past six months leading to the situation, while the Zirakpur municipal council president Udayvir Singh Dhillon, who is from the Congress, claimed that it was the SAD-BJP to blame for not replacing the pipes during its rule. AAP leader Navjot Saini blamed both the Congress and the SAD besides the administration for negligence.Real first phase recycled A day before the launch of the first phase of the public bicycle sharing system, confusion prevailed among journalists and cycling enthusiasts. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had inaugurated the bicycle sharing system on December 10, 2020, which the Chandigarh Smart City Ltd had called the first phase. So, when a clarification was sought, a UT official said, “Oh! That (December 10, 2020) inauguration wasn’t the first phase; it was only the inauguration of the cycle4change competition.

Sanjay’s son Praveen, currently the BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh, too, was present at the meeting. Earlier, Sanjay Nishad had expressed unhappiness at his party not getting representation in the recent expansion-cum-reshuffle of the Union council of ministers last month.Sanjay Nishad, who claims his party has influence in 160 assembly constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, had previously met chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya in Lucknow on June 23. The BJP in UP has delayed announcing names of four candidates for MLCs and Sanjay Nishad is expecting that his party would bag one of these nominations. There is no clarity yet on whether, months ahead of the elections, the Adityanath government would opt for a reshuffle-cum- expansion but Sanjay Nishad is also among the claimants if there were to be one, party leaders said.Sanjay Nishad responded with “dekhiye (let’s see)” when asked on the likelihood of his becoming an MLC or a minister in UP. He wouldn’t say if these issues also figured in his talks with BJP leaders.“We discussed 2022 UP polls and also discussed the political and constitutional ‘hissedari’ (share) of Nishads in governance,” he said.In 2018 Lok Sabha by-polls, Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Nishad had stunned the BJP by winning the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, however, the BJP wooed the Nishad party and Praveen won the Sant Kabir Nagar seat on the BJP ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nishad-party-chief-meets-amit-shah-bjp-chief-nadda-discusses-up-assembly-polls-101628967244932.html

The HC bench of justice HS Madaan said, “The petitioner by not complying with the requirement of submission of self-attested hard copy of the application form within the stipulated period, no fault can be found with rejection of his candidature.” Rohit Kumar, a Kaithal resident, had applied for the post of manager electrical advertised by the Haryana Public Service Commission for appointment in the HSIIDC to an advertisement put out in July 2018 and revised in June 2019. He submitted all documents as asked for through online modewere submitted but subsequently when the candidates were asked to send the self-attested hard copy of the application form, he could not do so as he had misplaced the same. His application was rejected by the HPSC, a decision he had challenged in the HC. The HPSC had maintained that candidates as per general instructions were directed to retain printed/hard copies of their online application form, so that they should not face any problem in sending the hard copy to the commission as and when required and if a candidate fails to do so, his candidature would liable rejected. It was also submitted that if this plea is accepted, there would be 150 odd other applicants whose candidature has been rejected due to various reasons. The court, taking into account the submissions of the HPSC, observed that no ground is there to issue any direction to the HPSC to supply hard copy of the application form to the petitioner to enable him to submit the same after self attesting it, since the last date for doing so has already been elapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hpsc-refuses-to-interfere-on-plea-allowing-submission-of-job-form-after-prescribed-date-101628967184797.html

15-08-2021||Bangalore||Schools to reopen in K’taka dists with less than 2% TPR||Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday announced that schools will be reopened in districts with Covid test positivity rate of less than 2%. Schools in border districts recording an increase in cases will remain shut. “All parents, teachers and non-teaching staff should be vaccinated. In case the positivity rate goes beyond 2% in any districts after schools are reopened, they should be closed and reopened after a week looking at the situation,” Bommai told reporters after holding an emergency meeting with health experts and the cabinet.He said a standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening schools is ready and it will be released at the earliest. The state government had earlier decided to reopen schools for Classes 9 to 12 from August 23. The government has also announced that the decision to reopen schools for students up to Class 8 will be taken in the last week of August after looking in all aspects of a third wave. The government has decided to decentralise the fight against Covid-19. “Directions have been given to make district-specific Covid-19 plans,” Bommai said. He said the BBMP commissioner has been given the power to impose strict measures in the city if the positivity rate in Bengaluru city goes beyond 2% and bed occupations reach 40%. “At present, the positivity rate is around 0.75%. The authority to implement the required steps is now with the BBMP commissioner,” said Bommai. “The situation is different in each district. In some districts the positivity rate is high, while in some other districts death rate is high. In Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Hassan, Mysuru, Kodagu, Bengaluru rural, Chamarajanagara, Shivamoga and Chikkamagaluru, which are border districts, we have identified places where testing and vaccination have to be increased,” Bommai said. In a new policy, the government has decided that in areas and villages within 10 km of Kerala and Maharashtra border, complete testing has to be done. The government has identified Raichur, Kalburgi, Ballari, Bidar, Koppal, Haveri, Vijayapura, Tumkur, Chikkamagaluru and Bengaluru rural as districts with poor testing rates. “Instructions have been given to increase the testing in the coming days,” Bommai said. The chief minister said that the six genome testing labs will be opened within the next three weeks. These labs will be spread across the state. “The labs will be set up in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shimoga, Hubli, Kalburgi and Belagavi. The new delta variant has to be studied carefully and we need to keep track of any new variants. So, these labs are important. The tests take two to three weeks, so we want to have more centres,” he said. The chief minister said that the state has administered close to 40 million vaccinations. “I will be meeting the union health minister and asking for 10 million vaccinations so that the entire population can be vaccinated,” he said. The state is recording 1,500 plus Covid cases on an average and so far 15,919 deaths have occurred due to the virus. The state reported 1,632 new cases on Saturday, taking the active caseload to 22,698. Bengaluru accounted for 377 new infections, taking its active cases to 8,200. As many as 25 fatalities were reported across the state on Saturday, which took the state’s toll to 36,958. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 15,934, with 1 death being reported on Saturday, according to the state health department.

Flood water has started receding in several areas of the city, including Chota Baghara, Bara Baghara, Bakshi Khurd, Sadiabad, Shivkuti, Guas Nagar, Salori, Karelabagh, Daraganj, Nagvasuki, Harshvardhan Nagar etc.The downward trend comes as good news for residents and the district administration alike as many of the localities that where earlier approachable only by boats were now accessible by cycles and foot. Even some residents have started coming back to their houses while others were providing essential items to those who had opted for staying back in the houses. “In our locality, while the families had shifted to relief camps, it was the responsibility of students like me to guard the belongings but now as the water is receding many people are coming back,” said Rajesh Patel, a student who was putting up at Chota Bagrada locality. Rajesh Srivastava, an aspiring civil servant staying at Daraganj said, “Last one week was pure hell with water level rising with each passing hour. It was harrowing staying in the first floor of my rented room watching the river water inching close. But thankfully the water has receded dramatically during the past 24 hours.” However, the receding water has left behind a trail of filth and waste. Piles of garbage, silt, rotting vegetation, sewage, plastic etc can be seen piled up everywhere.The district administration said massive drive to clean up the localities has started. “Now that the flood water is receding and leaving behind piles of garbage the cleaning work has started in all these localities,” said PRO of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation, PK Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flood-water-recedes-from-many-localities-in-up-s-prayagraj-101628966827710.html

However, former PU senators and a few candidates of the graduates’ constituency also joined in.The protesters condemned varsity’s move to defer polls and demanded that they be conducted immediately.The registered graduates’ constituency was to go to polls on August 18, but PU on Friday deferred polling saying that the decision was taken for the “time being” in view of non-availability of required booths in Punjab and Haryana.DPS Randhawa, who is contesting from the constituency, said, “These are deliberate attempts to tinker with the democratic set up of PU. We are against the deferring of polls and we will not stop until elections are held.”The registered graduates’ constituency is the largest with around 3.61 lakh voters who elect 15 members to the senate. Polling booths are set up across seven states/UTs.“I think this was all planned because for the first time the polling of this constituency was scheduled on a working day. Voters can be given alternative booths to vote wherever the varsity is facing problems, but elections should be held immediately because the PU is functioning without a governing body,” said Jagwant Singh, general secretary of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisations (PFUCTO), who is also a candidate.Meanwhile, Panjab University Teachers' Association also issued a statement on Saturday that the postponement of elections was not good for restoration of democracy: “PUTA will continue to fight till democracy is restored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-senate-polls-former-senators-students-protest-101628966826553.html

15-08-2021||Other||Farming on fallow lands to get boost||Tamil Nadu tabled an exclusive budget for agriculture on Saturday, a first of its kind in the state and a key initiative is to bring 1.18 million hectare of fallow land into cultivation. State agriculture minister MRK Panneerselvam presented the budget in the assembly on the day the DMK government completed 100 days in office. A sum of ₹34220.6 crore is provided for the demands of the agriculture and its related departments for 2021-2022.The state has carried out preliminary surveys in 36 districts where currently an area of 1.93 million hectare of fallow lands has been identified. “Fallow lands are the next level of hope to expand agriculture in Tamil Nadu,” said Panneerselvam. “Area under cultivation will be increased by making the fallow lands into fortune lands.” The scheme will be implemented in 2,500 village panchayats in the current year.By increasing cultivation areas, augmenting water resources and other measures, Panneerselvam said his budget’s aim is to achieve overall agricultural development and self-sufficiency in all the villages of Tamil Nadu by collaboration with allied departments. This will be implemented under a grant scheme -- Kalaignarin Anaithu Grama Orunginaintha Velaan Valarchi Thittam -- named after DMK patriarch and five-time chief minister MK Karunanidhi. The scheme will be implemented annually in one-fifth of the total 12,524 village panchayats in Tamil Nadu with an aim to cover them all in the next five years. Experts are of the opinion that bringing back fallow lands into cultivation is feasible but say that the execution should be comprehensive. “If the farmer has kept a land fallow for less than two years, it can be easily brought in because it would have been kept fallow for specific reasons during that particular year mostly due to insufficient water supply,” says R Gopinath, senior scientist, MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). “But older fallow lands require more effort as many of these are in the hands of small and marginal farmers, so they cannot spend on irrigation and land development activities.” He says that it’s also important to know what kind of crops they’re going to cultivate. “The intervention should be throughout the life cycle of the crop,” says Gopinath. “Even if the fallow lands are in rainfed regions, you can use rainfed crops by providing adequate support in all aspects. If the government offers packages which include seed, money for land preparation activities and input subsidies and help them market, it will boost farmers to bring those lands into cultivation.”The state also has a vision to achieve food and nutritional security in the next 10 years. As paddy is the principal crop in Tamil Nadu, a special paddy production plan is in place to cover an area of 1.9 million hectare with an aim to achieve the production of about 7.5 million metric tonnes. Contending that indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have affected soil fertility, environment and affected people’s health, the Budget highlighted that there is awareness among people giving momentum towards the demand for organic produce. A separate wing for organic farming will be established within the agriculture department. To encourage farmers, the government will give input subsidies for adopting organic farming. Addressing another healthy eating food, the budget points out that in Tamil literature people had relished millet flour with honey. But with the increase in the consumption of rice, millets are gradually disappearing from the native soil as well as in rural homes. This is seeing a reverse once again as people are replacing rice with millets and there are exclusive restaurants for millet based food. “Millets and minor millets can be cultivated with minimum inputs,” Panneerselvam said. Millets can grow well even in low rainfall areas and the farmers will be given training to cultivate millets and facilities will be provided to market their produce. The government said that it would award the best performing farmers in organic farming, exporting produce and also local inventions in agriculture. Agro Industrial Corridor in Cauvery Delta AreaThe Cauvery delta area covering five districts -- Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam and Trichy -- will be declared as an Agro Industrial Corridor. This is to promote agro-based industries by plugging infrastructure gaps, creating new industrial infrastructure and by attracting private investments to the region, Panneerselvam said. Rice, pulses, banana, and coconut, among others, are produced throughout the year in this region. The government will take the help of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) department to improve the existing industrial estates, create new industrial estates, improve road connectivity to have better linkage with markets and ports and to augment power supply infrastructure. “The current facilities available are only to harvest and sell grains and agricultural produce immediately. But this move facilities value addition,” says Gopinath. “For instance, paddy stock can be converted into a product, and pulses which are declining in this area can be promoted through industries. It can also be turned to reduce input cost of farmers and bring them better incomes through these value-addition activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farming-on-fallow-lands-to-get-boost-101628966284671.html

15-08-2021||Mumbai||Hair, eyes, skin infections: Is Covid affecting us in more ways?||In the first week of July, a 45-year-old woman walked into Tardeo’s Bhatia Hospital with a lump of hair packed into a zip-locked plastic bag. The Parel resident had recovered from Covid-19 in May but since then she was troubled by severe hair fall. “I wanted you to believe that I am not exaggerating. I am losing enormous amounts of hair every day,” she told the consultant dermatologist, Dr Saurabh Shah. The Sars CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 is known to attack the lungs, often in a debilitating manner. Patients who have a severe form of Covid-19 take several months to recover fully, battling fatigue, aches and breathing difficulty. But the viral infection is leaving its mark in more ways than we know. Patients are struggling with sudden and severe hair loss, skin infections, eye ailments and medical experts have gradually started linking these conditions to after-effects of Covid-19. Often, after a major illness like typhoid, jaundice, dengue, malaria or sometimes due to crash diets and fasting, people experience severe hair loss that needs medical attention. “We call this condition chronic telogen effluvium- hair loss triggered by certain stressers,” said Shah, who treated the 45-year-old Parel resident with a cocktail of tricho-nutrients such as biotin, copper, iron, zinc, magnesium, selenium among others. Tricho nutrients are supplements prescribed to maintain healthy hair. In addition to the supplements, the woman was also treated with Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy, which involved injecting her platelets into the scalp to accelerate the hair growth. Of the 20 odd people with hair loss related complaints that Shah consults daily, nearly 10 to 12 have a Covid-19 history. He said that the numbers have increased during the second wave when Covid-19 affected a huge number of people. Doctors said that men and women have been equally affected with post-Covid hair loss. Many patients are in the age group of 25 to 30, without any underlying ailments like thyroid or diabetes, suddenly losing lumps of hair. “On a positive note, those with a Covid history are responding to hair loss treatment sooner, as compared to let’s say a typhoid patient who would need treatment for several weeks altogether,’ said Shah. It is believed that Sars CoV-2 could be damaging the hair follicles leading to the immense shedding of hair. However, doctors say that the hair fall is self-limiting in most cases as patients regain their immunity over two to three months. But one must see a dermatologist if the hair fall continues. Hives, herpes zosterCovid-19 affects the immune system of the patients leaving them susceptible to a range of secondary or opportunistic infections that strike when the body’s defence mechanism is functioning sub-optimally. Doctors are treating a range of skin infections such as red patches, hives (itchy, raised bumps), blisters among others. These skin conditions have been noticed in patients freshly diagnosed with Covid-19 or in the post-Covid phase. Some patients have complained of skin infections just before testing positive for the disease and most respond to anti-histamine drugs. In the West, there have also been reports of a condition called Covid toes wherein the patients’ toe or other fingers develop discolouration, swelling and blisters. Patients have difficulty in wearing shoes due to this condition. In Mumbai, some doctors have seen increased cases of herpes zoster- a painful rash caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus- in patients with Covid-19 history. “This is the virus that causes chickenpox. It remains dormant in the patient’s body and reactivates when the immunity of the person is at its lowest,” said physician Dr Hemant Gupta. “It could be that Covid is precipitating the reactivation,” he said. Shah from Bhatia Hospital, for instance, has seen double the number of herpes zoster patients every month as compared to pre-Covid times. A majority of them have a recent Covid history, he said. Red eyes, ocular hypertension In some patients, Covid-19 erupted with conjunctivitis along with other symptoms suggesting that ocular manifestations due to the virus were possible. In many others, Covid-19 and its treatment impacted eyes in newer ways. For instance, a 34-year-old Thane resident who suffered from a severe bout of Covid-19 in April was hospitalised and put on multiple drugs including Remdesivir, steroids and antibiotics. Soon after discharge, the digital entrepreneur began suffering from red eyes and his left eye felt heavy. A thorough ophthalmological consultation revealed that he had developed ocular hypertension- increased pressure in the eye. “A high dose of steroids or long use of steroids could lead the raised pressure in the eye,” said Dr Ragini Parekh, head of the ophthalmology department at the state-run Sir JJ Hospital. “A lot of Covid-19 patients are put on steroids which may be leading to such problems,” she said. According to Parekh, Covid-19 patients typically suffer from asthenopia or ocular fatigue and could have symptoms like dry or watery eyes, tiredness, sensitivity to light among others. A March 2021 paper published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology had cited cases of Covid-19 patients who suffered from diminution in vision, gradual blurring, the onset of diplopia (double vision), swelling of the eyelid among other things.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hair-eyes-skin-infections-is-covid-affecting-us-in-more-ways-101628965804812.html

I do not know how and where my three uncles and their families are,” says 23-year-old Meena Azimi, anxiety palpable in her voice. Azimi, who studies at Dev Samaj College for Women, Sector 45B, Chandigarh, is among the Afghan students who gathered at the student centre of Panjab University (PU) on Saturday to condemn the continuous onslaught of the Taliban, which has been rapidly gaining territory in Afghanistan. The protesting students held placards that read, ‘we deserve peace’.“Our country is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis. Taliban fighters are killing innocent people and families are being displaced,” she says.It is estimated that around 350 students from Afghanistan are enrolled in higher education institutes in Chandigarh, many of whom are studying at PU as well.Ali Nazar, who studies at DAV College, Sector 10, says, “My family is in Kabul and they are scared. Many of my relatives live in the provinces that have been captured. Citizens are suffering and want an end to the war. The Taliban should end this violence and come to an understanding with the government. Our only hope is the United Nations and world powers. They must act.”As per recent reports, the Taliban now controls around half of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Political science student, Abdul Monir Kakar, who has been in India for the last six years, says, “People in Afghanistan are trying to flee to other countries. Families are trying to arrange for visas.”Panic prevails in every part of Afghanistan and other countries must intervene so that peace can prevail, the students said. “The future of the Afghan people is uncertain. Casualties are mounting by the day. It is high time that the government and Taliban came to an agreement,” said Zahid Aria, 29, who studies at PU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/we-deserve-peace-world-powers-must-act-afghan-students-101628963344288.html

He was admitted to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital and then shifted to Gurugram’s Medanta Hospital when his condition deteriorated and was put on ventilator support.With the condition of his lungs not improving, the family had to look for ECMO beds (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a machine that performs the functions of the heart and the lungs) as a bridge for a lung transplant.Gupta was a contractual staff of the Delhi government, due to which they are not entitled to healthcare benefits on the lines of regular employees. “The Delhi government is paying an ex gratia of ₹1,00,00,000 to the next of kin of the corona warriors, but not taking care while they fell sick during the course of their public duties,” the NHRC had observed on May 19 on a complaint filed by Gupta’s family.The NHRC had asked the union health ministry as well as the Delhi government to offer adequate medical care and financial protection to contractual medical and paramedical staff, including “getting medical insurance to facilitate their treatment in private hospitals in these testing times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-doctor-dies-was-on-heart-lung-bypass-machine-support-for-three-months-101628961604432.html

While receiving a copy of the curriculum from a team comprising education directorate and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) officials, Kejriwal said that while the country had focused on all other subjects over the years, Deshbhakti (patriotism) was not taught in schools.“We kept on teaching Physics, Chemistry, Maths for 70 years, (but) no one thought of teaching children Deshbhakti. I am delighted that the Deshbhakti curriculum will be launched in schools of Delhi to instil patriotism in young minds,” he said.The chief minister tweeted to congratulate parents, students, and the education department on the initiation of the curriculum. “The Deshbhakti curriculum is all set to be implemented in Delhi schools on the 75th anniversary of Independence. Love and Patriotism towards the country will help youngsters build India as our freedom fighters aspired it to be,” tweeted Kejriwal. Emphasising on the need to celebrate the spirit of freedom daily, Kejriwal said that the celebration of Independence Day in Delhi government schools will no longer be symbolic, but substantive.In August 2019, the Aam Aadmi Party promised to introduce Deshbhakti curriculum in all Delhi government schools once re-elected to power. Following the announcement, a committee was constituted by SCERT in October 2019 to prepare the curriculum. Earlier this year in March, while presenting the annual budget, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced that the Deshbhakti curriculum will be introduced in the 2021-22 academic session. Last week, the government announced that the governing council of the SCERT has adopted the framework for the curriculum. According to officials, the government plans to launch the curriculum in public schools as soon as schools reopen.Aimed at instilling a sense of respect towards constitutional values, the curriculum follows the pedagogical guidelines of the National Curriculum Framework 2005 and ideas of National Curriculum Framework 2020, the government said in a press release on Saturday.The curriculum framework focused on eight learning outcomes such as self-awareness, self-confidence, problem-solving, practising constitutional values, pluralism and diversity, environmental sustainability, ethical social behaviour, collaboration and social and civic responsibility.With the goal of creating awareness and inculcating a sense of respect for constitutional values among students, the curriculum will cover three overarching themes: Knowledge (awareness of constitutional values, plurality and diversity, and freedom struggle, among others), Values (honesty, integrity, love and respect for the country) and Behaviour( standing up against injustice, scientific reasoning), the release stated.The curriculum will be implemented through a 5 stage process that will entail class discussions, team activity among students, and homework to engage with the family and the larger community. Evaluation for the curriculum will be done through self-assessment, peer assessment, and assessment by the teacher on a regular basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-will-teach-patriotism-in-our-schoolskejriwal-101628960883086.html
