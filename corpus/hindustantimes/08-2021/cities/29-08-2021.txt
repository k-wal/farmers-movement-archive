Why?” Dushyant said, accusing Congress of adopting ‘shoot and scoot’ policy.“Why is Haryana the epicentre of the agitation? Why are there no road blockades in Punjab and UP after Saturday’s developments in Haryana? It’s because they want Haryana to remain in turmoil so that its economy and agriculture can be weakened,” he said.Action will be taken against Karnal SDM for telling cops to ‘break farmers’ heads’: DushyantCondemning Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha’s instructions to the police to “break the heads of the protesters if they breach the cordon to reach the BJP meeting venue”, he said that action will be taken against the IAS officer.“What the officer is saying in the video clip does not meet the ethical standards that an IAS officer is expected to maintain,” Chautala said.Responding to a question on police crackdown on farmers in Karnal that left a dozen-odd farmers injured, the deputy CM said: “Equally unacceptable was the aggression shown by the farmers when they attacked cops with agricultural implements.”“Farmers, in the garb of the agitation, stopping political programmes and not allowing the public to move is bizarre. What is their agenda?” he said.The deputy CM said what is the objective of the ongoing agitation when Haryana has been procuring foodgrains smoothly and giving MAS, besides opening new mandis.“Former Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar and later his successor Navjot Singh Sidhu have repeatedly praised agriculture practices of Haryana, admitting that agriculture in Punjab has failed due to flawed policies. It is also due to this reason that some people in Punjab are causing an unrest in Haryana,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/forces-behind-farmers-stir-want-to-derail-economy-of-haryana-dushyant-101630261787462.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Curbs likely in districts with high Covid-19 positivity rate||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 4,666 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing its count to 6,456,939. The tally of active cases slightly increased to 52,844 as 3,510 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours.State health minister Rajesh Tope said they will follow the directives issued by the central government. On Thursday, the central government suggested to the state government to impose restrictions in districts where the test positivity rate is higher during upcoming festivals. He also said they are working on to vaccinate all teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5, which will be their first step towards reopening schools in the state.The state saw 131 casualties and the total fatalities now stands at 137,157. Pune reported the highest toll with 24 deaths. Of them, 21 were found in the district and the rest three in the city. It was followed by Solapur and Satara with 18 fatalities each.As August is coming to an end, the daily cases continue to remain stagnant in Maharashtra. Despite relaxations granted by the state government, no significant change was observed as daily cases remained between 4,000 and 5,000 cases. Going by the trend, the state is likely to report around 1.5 million this month, which is much less than what was recorded last month.Till Saturday, the state had reported 145,333 cases, compared to 226,29 reported in the corresponding period last month. The total cases reported in July were 239,854 and in June 316,283 cases were reported.The health minister said that they need to be very careful as many festivals are lined up, which may lead to a spike in cases that has happened in Kerala. “Onam led to a spike in cases in Kerala, considering this we also need to be careful as many festivals are lined up in the coming months such as Gauri Ganpati, Dussehra and Diwali. This is the reason the central government issued the guidelines, which will be followed by the state. The final decision will be taken by the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray),” Tope told reporters in Jalna on Sunday.“Even though the trajectory of daily new cases has shown a decline over the last month, there are some districts in Maharashtra which are showing early signs of upsurge in Covid-19 cases and test positivity… In view of mass events and public gathering expected during celebrations of upcoming festivals (including Dahi Handi and Ganesh Utsav) in Maharashtra, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings,” stated a letter written by Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare on August 27.Tope said that they have directed the state administration to complete vaccination of teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5. “We have asked to complete the vaccination drive of teaching and non-teaching staff by September 5. They have also been told to hold a special drive for the same, if required,” he added.He said that this is a first step towards opening the schools and further decision will be taken after holding deliberations with the state task force.Maharashtra is the state with highest number of Covid-19 cases. Now, it also has maximum Delta plus variant cases.On Sunday, Mumbai clocked 345 cases and reported a total 743,499 cases till date. It also recorded two fatalities taking the toll to 15,974.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 203,210 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.29%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 12.03%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated only 111,774 people on Sunday and has administered a total 57,165,318 doses till date, according to the data available on Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-curbs-likely-in-districts-with-high-covid-19-positivity-rate-101630261671789.html

Hit them with your cane straightaway. Any doubt? Will you hit them? Will you let them cross this barricade? There is no doubt, no confusion,” he had said in the video.“The next government will be of pro-farmers and the officers who think of democracy as a rule of ‘lathi tantra’ will have to give answers for their actions,” Hooda said.“Such words were said by the officer after getting patronage from the BJP-JJP coalition,” the Congress MP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deepender-hooda-seeks-action-against-karnal-sdm-over-saturday-s-lathicharge-101630261663151.html
29-08-2021||Other||FIR against 3 over Madurai flyover collapse||Police on Sunday filed an FIR against three people in connection with the collapse of an under-construction flyover in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai district which led to the death of a construction worker. Tamil Nadu’s highways minister blamed the contractor for callousness. A case has been registered against project in-charge Pradeep Kumar Jain, engineer Satendra Verma, and hydraulics machine contractor Baskaran under sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery) and 304 (A) (causing death by negligence) of IPC, said an official in Madurai. Finance minister and Madurai MLA Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and state highways minister EV Velu along with district officials reviewed the situation. Velu told reporters that the accident happened due to the carelessness of the contractor. “This was an accident that was avoidable,” Velu said. The flyover has been under construction for the past two years as part of the Madurai-Natham four-lane highway project Rs. 545 crore monitored under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and is to be completed in April 2022. To ascertain the cause of the accident, he said that they have to probe if there has been a malfunction in the hydraulic machine as a thread had been found broken. “This flyover isn’t under the Tamil Nadu government. This is fully under the union government under SagarMala Project and the NHAI is monitoring it and allocating funds for it,” said Velu. “But our people are going to use this flyover. Our officials reached the spot within 15 minutes.” The minister said that no safety measures were followed. “This is entirely the contractor’s fault. No one else can be blamed. The contractor should have put an engineer on the site to supervise the labourers.”The accident happened on Saturday evening when a portion of an under-construction flyover collapsed at Narayanapuram in the district. One of the guest workers, identified as Akash Singh from Uttar Pradesh, succumbed to his injuries. The state highways minister has instructed the district collector to review the situation on site by bringing a team from National Institute of Technology (NIT)-Trichy to submit a report so that the state government along with NHAI can decide on further course.The highways minister added that after the DMK formed the government in May, a team has been set up to study road projects to report cases of negligence following which contractors were issued notices. The complainant in this case is the NHAI’s team leader for the project A Anilkumar. “Before the end of the week, the NIT team will submit a technical report that will reveal the cause of the accident based on which we will take further action,” said a police official of the Tallakulam police station where the case is registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/firagainst-3-over-madurai-flyover-collapse-101630261661362.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab to come up with revised OTS policy for building violations||The Punjab government has decided to come up with a revised one-time settlement (OTS) policy for non-compoundable building violations.The state local government department has prepared a draft policy, “The Punjab one-time voluntary disclosure and settlement of building constructed in violations of the building bylaws policy, 2021”, after incorporating suggestions of all stakeholders, including municipal corporations, councils, nagar panchayats and improvement trusts. The earlier policy was conceptualised and notified during the tenure of former local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, but was put in abeyance after Brahm Mohindra took charge in June 2019. Mohindra then termed the policy faulty and asked officials to revise it before re-implementing it. The policy was held back as it received a lukewarm response. The new draft policy aims to keep check on non-compoundable building violations so that they could be corrected once the policy is notified, said an official aware of the development. “It will provide people the opportunity to get their unauthorised residential and commercial units regularised by paying composition fee, which has been slashed by 25% than the previous notified policy,” the official said. The regularisation policy is meant to ensure that the existing unauthorised buildings were aligned with parking, fire and safety standards, as it was no longer feasible for the government to demolish such structures.Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra said all formalities have been completed and the draft policy has been sent for legal noting.“After going through the suggestions from stakeholders, we have redrafted the earlier policy so that maximum people can be benefitted. The notification related to the fresh policy will be out soon,” Mohindra said.Under the new policy, an applicant will have to make structural changes in the building, if required, to fulfil the requirement of fire safety and parking within two months from the date of submission of details and will also submit mandatory clearances from other departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-come-up-with-revised-ots-policy-for-building-violations-101630261542319.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC pulls up state, MSRTC for plight of ST bus commuters||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently pulled up the ministry of transport and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) over the condition of State Transport (ST) bus stands and depots across the state. After being informed of lack of facilities such as drinking water, nursing rooms, toilets, unhygienic kitchens and absence of sufficient police personnel which affects the hygiene and safety of commuters, through a public interest litigation (PIL), the HC expressed its displeasure and asked the authorities to respond to the grievances raised on behalf of 8 million commuters who travel by ST buses every day. The division bench of justice VK Jadhav and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by activist Mukesh Rajesh Bhatt on August 25, was informed by advocate AP Lohade of the various lacunae in the services being provided by MSRTC at its depots and bus stands. Lohade also informed the bench of the total lack of security and unhindered access to unauthorised travel agents on MSRTC premises which resulted in the abduction of a disabled boy who was later found murdered away from the depot. The PIL also highlighted lack of medical facilities.The petitioner stated that after the murder of the boy, he had conducted a survey of various bus stands and depots across the state and had taken photographs of the facilities and MSRTC canteens within the depots which showed food was unhygienic and not fit for consumption. Lohade added that apart from this, depots also lacked clean drinking water. He submitted that despite usual commuters on ST buses belonging to the lower strata of the society including the elderly and women from rural areas, there were no nursing rooms nor any stand-by ambulances stationed at bus stands and depots which is a standard requirement at these places. He added that provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act that mandated having basic first aid kits on every public transport bus was also flouted. While submitting that nearly 80% commuters his client had spoken to had expressed dissatisfaction, Lohade sought an urgent intervention of HC to alleviate the troubles of the commuters. After hearing the submissions and perusing the outcome of the survey and other documents placed on record, the bench said, “We are aware that most of the travellers in public transport buses are poor persons having no voice to raise their dissatisfaction against the so-called facilities provided by the respondent – MSRTC – at various bus stands. Further, we are shocked to see security lapses, which not only resulted in the earlier incident as pointed out by the petitioner, but also the recent incident in which one woman traveller was assaulted by a private travel agent with a knife, when she refused to board his private vehicle.”Holding that MSRTC and the road transport ministry were answerable for the lapses, the court asked the state and MSRTC to respond and posted hearing of the PIL to September 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-pulls-up-state-msrtc-for-plight-of-st-bus-commuters-101630261541214.html
29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 4 held for impersonating ED officials, extortion||:The Delhi Police on Thursday arrested four people from Delhi, who impersonated officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and sent fake notices to people on behalf of the agency to extort money from them.Police said one of the arrested men, identified as Santosh Rai, is a habitual cheat allegedly involved in over 30 cheating cases registered in Delhi and other states, such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, over two decades. Police said Rai produced a South Indian movie titled “Godse” with the money he earned from his criminal activities. However, the movie was never released. He was previously running an admission racket, in which he duped aspirants seeking MBBS seats in leading medical colleges across the country, said police. Rai was arrested for his involvement in running many such fake MBBS admission rackets in south Indian states and Delhi in the past. Police said a Saket court also sentenced him to one-year rigorous imprisonment in a case registered against him in 2008. In the present case, Rao was impersonating a special regional officer named Rajeev Singh in the Central Region Office of the ED, and sent a notice under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to a customs clearing agent from northeast Delhi, demanding ₹50 lakh to settle the matter. However, no such officer named Rajeev Singh was there in the agency, said a senior police officer associated with the investigation.“Rai posed as an ED official and issued a notice to the customs clearing agent, with the intention of extorting money from him for “settlement” of a fictitious case,” said an ED officer, who did not wish to be named. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj said earlier this month, the crime branch received a complaint from the ED, which alleged they had received several complaints about a person who impersonated an ED officer and extorted money from people after sending fake notices on behalf of the agency. “Preliminary enquiry revealed the fake notices were sent using some apps to spoof e-mails from NIC mail and calls were made from different government office numbers to terrorize the victim. A case was registered and teams were formed to nab the frauds,” said Bhardwaj.Investigators said the customs clearing agent, who was one of the complainants, was convinced to tell the suspects that he was ready to settle the matter and pay the first instalment of ₹7 lakh. It was decided that the money will be delivered near the Parliament Street police station in central Delhi on August 26.The teams of the ED and the Delhi Police’s crime branch laid a trap and the caught two men when they arrived to collect the money. One of them was Rao, and the other was Bhupender Singh Gusain, who posed as a lawyer. Their interrogation led to the arrest of their associates--Kuldeep Kumar and Sanjay. All four are in their forties, said police. “Their interrogation revealed that one Afzal Ahmed, who is out on parole, hatched the conspiracy with Kuldeep, Sanjay and one Arjun Raghav, who further included Rai in it. Rai roped in one Aakash Chauhan, who is a cyber fraud expert,” said the DCP. Police said Sanjay, who makes projector screens for a living, ran his business from a rented property owned by the customs clearing agent. It was Sanjay who asked the other gang members to target his landlord. His role was to monitor the activities of the customs clearing agent after he receives the notice and the calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi4-held-for-impersonating-ed-officials-extortion-101630261366378.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Institutions should do research in the midst of regular patient care’||As the Covid-19 pandemic in India may be entering an endemic stage, vaccines will continue to be the mainstay to deal with this viral disease. While that covers the prevention aspect, definite treatment options still elude the medical community, prompting the urgent need to boost indigenous research and investment in scientific processes. Hindustan Times spoke to Dr Sanish Davis, president of Indian Society for Clinical Research, on the research landscape in India or the lack of it. Edited excerpts:Could India have done better in Covid-19 clinical trials and research? It would be easy to say we could have done better but we must look at the Covid-19 trials against the backdrop of the entire clinical trial environment in the country. In 2019, the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules were announced in India, a development that created a more robust regulatory framework for the conduct of clinical trials in the country. Prior to that, clinical trials in India faced very challenging times with activism, misinformation and regulatory uncertainty, resulting in a significant drop in clinical trials done in the country. Clinical trials were beginning to pick up but the pandemic hit and it temporarily halted this progress. The focus turned more towards Covid-19 trials and rightly so. In 2019 we were doing around 4% of global clinical trials in India and that number has since dropped to less than 2% overall (industry-sponsored Covid and non-Covid research). India has the second-highest population in the world and the highest disease burden; so, the percentage of clinical trials in India is nowhere near what we should be doing. However, we must also take pride in the research and development work being done in India in the fight against the pandemic which has resulted in the discovery and development of both drugs and indigenous vaccines.Is the Indian scientific community well equipped and trained to design and conduct good quality clinical trials?India has an abundance of high-quality research talent, world-class sites, a large and diverse patient pool and perhaps one of the most stringent clinical research regulatory environments in the world. Ultimately, the real quality of our research will be demonstrated in audits and inspections, and I am happy to say the findings of such inspections will validate the high quality of clinical research being done in India. What are the shortfalls or areas of concern in the Indian clinical research environment? More than shortfalls, we see opportunities. The pandemic has helped us look at clinical trials in a new paradigm and highlighted the importance of two major aspects — how digital adoption can advance and hasten the clinical trial process without compromising on quality, safety or patient centricity, and how collaboration across stakeholders will aid safe, secure and conducive ecosystem of trials. Institutions should be sensitised about the importance of doing research in the midst of regular patient care. There is also a need to reach out to a vast swathe of population to help them understand the importance of clinical trials. A recent opinion piece in the British Medical Journal highlighted fake trials or what are known as zombie trials. What is the extent of such fraudulent trials in India? In most cases, fake or zombie trials can be traced to independent trials. However, the number of such trials is almost negligible. Much like any other service industry, you will have players operating at both ends of the spectrum and it is important to note that fake or zombie trials are clearly an exception rather than the norm. There are two broad types of clinical trials — regulatory and academic. Regulatory clinical trials require three main components — approval of the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) or Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), scrutiny of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) for approval to conduct the trial and registering the trial in the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI), an open-source public information platform hosted at the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Medical Statistics. Due to the above protocols, the chances of a fake trial or unsupervised trial are highly unlikely. Most countries have a debarment list, a kind of blacklist that features researchers or organisations that have indulged in fraudulent practices. Isn’t it important for India to have such a list? Undoubtedly, a blacklist or a debarment list is important and required. In the US, a debarment list is maintained by US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). This list is accessible to pharmaceutical companies and contact research organisations to verify if an investigator they want to work with is on the list. In India, the National Medical Commission (erstwhile Medical Council of India) for academic studies and CDSCO for regulated trials should maintain a debarment list. CDSCO does regulatory inspections at sites and hence they are well placed to constitute, review and update the list. This will increase the confidence in the clinical research ecosystem in India and will also ensure an additional layer of checks and balances for all stakeholders of clinical research, including patients. What has been ISCR’s contribution to encourage and promote good quality research during the pandemic?The pandemic has played a catalytic role in driving more digital adoption. We have collaborated not just with the regulators but also with all stakeholders to embrace these new changes through workshops, direct discussions and training sessions. The opportunity to do things virtually has also led to an incremental increase in the number of training sessions and webinars organised by our various councils which have been extremely well received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/institutions-should-do-research-in-the-midst-of-regular-patient-care-101630261364562.html

We are holding a meeting on Monday and if the government fails to take action against the SDM, we will intensify the protest,” said Chaduni.He said that the cops, few among them relatives of politicians, deliberately attacked multiple times on the head of unarmed farmers.“Many of the farmers have suffered senior injuries on the head. Some of the farmers are complaining of impaired vision. Many farmers have their nose broken and the SDM, who was behind it, is being sheltered,” said Chaduni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/take-action-against-karnal-sdm-for-break-heads-remark-chaduni-101630261241036.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai saw 28% more vaccination in August than July||Despite frequent disruptions in the vaccination drive at public centres owing to shortage of vaccine doses, 28% more beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Mumbai in August compared to the last month. According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), between August 1 and 28, more than 1.9 million citizens were vaccinated in the city, as compared to 1.4 million vaccinated in the corresponding period last month.It stated that in the first 28 days of August, 1,919,971 vaccine doses were administered, which is 420,836 doses more than the 1,499,145 vaccine doses administered during the corresponding period in July.However, one reason for the rise in vaccination is the shift from public centres to private centres in August compared to July. In July, private hospitals administered 669,814 vaccine doses that went up to 984,262 in August. Doses administered at public vaccination centres also slightly increased than last month. In the first 28 days of July, 829,331 vaccine doses were administered at public vaccination centres that went up to 935,709 in August in the corresponding period.A BMC official from health department said, “The number of vaccines administered at private hospitals went up because these also include figures of those administered second doses. The data, in a way, represents those who took their first dose at private hospitals, especially those in the 18 to 45 years of age group, considering vaccination at public centres was shut for the below 45 age group for 20 days straight. This is that segment of citizens who did not mind paying for the vaccine. However, in the coming days, figures for public centres are also expected to increase significantly.”Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “The increase in vaccination at private centres is also because of vaccination drives conducted by NGOs and those administered under corporate social responsibility (CSR), which led to the numbers in private centres going up in August.”Meanwhile, as of August 28, 9,143,824 vaccine doses have been administered in the city ever since vaccination was kicked off on January 16. Of these, 6,728,736 were first doses and 2,415,088 were second doses. BMC’s target is to fully vaccinate 9 million citizens in the age group of 18 to 45 who are working class. The data reveals that 3.9 million of these nine million have been given at least one dose of vaccine and 377,891 are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-saw-28-more-vaccination-in-august-than-july-101630261121159.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers in Punjab block roads, burn effigies over lathicharge in Haryana||Chandigarh/Sangrur/JalandharFarmers blocked roads and highways in Punjab for two hours on Sunday in protest against the lathicharge on peasants in Haryana.Owing allegiance to various farmer bodies, the protesters burnt the effigies of the BJP-led Haryana government for using “force” on farmers in Karnal.Around 10 people were injured on Saturday as police allegedly lathicharged a group of farmers disrupting traffic movement on a national highway while heading towards Karnal to protest against a BJP meeting.The two-hour-long agitation in Punjab that started at noon also caused inconvenience to commuters, who got stuck in traffic snarls at several places.The protest caused disruption of vehicular traffic at many places and affected routes along the Jalandhar-Pathankot highway, Ludhiana-Chandigarh highway, Amritsar-Ganganagar highway and Ferozepur-Zira road.Farmers also burnt the effigies of the central government in villages of Sangrur, Barnala and Patiala districts and blocked state and national highways. In Sangrur, the Chandigarh-Sangrur national highway was blocked at Kalajhar toll plaza, Ludhiana-Sangrur road at Ladda toll plaza and Sangrur-Patran road at Kheri village. In Barnala, farmers blocked the Bathinda-Chandigarh nation highway at Badbar toll plaza, Barnala-Ludhaina NH at Sanghera village, Barnala-Moga NH at Pakho and Barnala-Mansa road at Handiay from noon till 2pm. In Patiala, the Chandigarh-Patiala road was blocked near Rajpura, besides other state highways.During a protest in Amritsar, Kisan Sangharsh Mazdoor Committee general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar should resign on moral grounds as he has no right to continue on the post after the police action on farmers.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) staged protests at 56 places in the state and castigated the “shameful” act of the Khattar government.In Jalandhar, the farmers blocked the PAP Chowk on the Jalandhar-Ludhiana national highway. Similarly, the Kisan Majdoor Sangarsh Committee (KMSC) members blocked the national highway in Lohian Khas . KMSC president Salwinder Singh said the Haryana government must take action against the erring police officials. Meanwhile, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu also condemned the Haryana police action on farmers in Karnal.“Deplorable assault on the protesting farmers is an attack on fundamental rights of every Indian...earned after innumerable sacrifices during the freedom struggle, It impinges and impedes on the spirit of the Constitution and breaks the backbone of India’s democracy!!” he said in a tweet and also shared a video of “use of force” by police on farmers in Haryana.Condemning the police action, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) declared to support the “Bharat Bandh” call by farmer unions on September 25. In a statement, AAP’s kisan wing Punjab president and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan slammed the Haryana CM for indiscriminate violence against farmers. “The BJP will have to pay the price for such a repressive policy,” he said. He also lashed out at Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for alleged cane-charge on farmers in Amritsar.Amarinder had on Saturday expressed shock at the “brazen brutality” of the Haryana Police and had slammed Khattar for “unleashing such a vicious assault on the peacefully protesting farmers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-in-punjab-block-roads-burn-effigies-over-lathicharge-in-haryana-101630260943788.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||IIT-B develops app that will alert when Covid vaccination slots are available||To help people book a Covid-19 vaccination slot conveniently, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), have designed an app that allows applicants to set up alerts for the availability of slots nearby.CoVaccinator is a mobile application for android phones designed by researchers from Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR), IIT-B, that can access data from the servers of the Co-Win portal. Once downloaded, users can log in using their registered mobile numbers akin to the Co-Win portal and book slots.What sets this application apart from Co-Win is the option to set up an alert for available slots at centres near the user. “The rush for vaccination has subsided as the drive intensifies. However, people have been facing trouble looking for available slots and then by the time they book, the slots are gone. To avoid this, we have enabled the alert option,” said Manjesh Hanawal, associate professor, IEOR, who heads the team.One can log in, search for available centres by pin code, district and centre name. The user can then set up an alert for the centre of their choice.“The mobile application gets regular updates from the servers of the Co-Win portal. As soon as a slot is available in the centre of your choice, you get an alert on the phone. By clicking on the update, you can log in to the application and book a slot. You can save the time of looking for slots, finding the centre and then booking an appointment,” said Hanawal.As of now, none of the web and mobile-based portals can facilitate auto-booking for slots that are available for security reasons. Hanawal said that the application has been developed to help people find vaccination slots, alert generation when vaccination becomes available in a centre.“One can download certificates and add beneficiaries. We are exploring if we can add a feature that will auto book slots when the slots become available. This app is built using approved Application Programming Interface (API) from the Co-Win platform,” said Hanawal, adding that the application will soon offer information on other vaccination drives such as drive-ins or arrangements made by local government bodies, all at one place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitb-develops-app-that-will-alert-when-covid-vaccination-slots-are-available-101630260708095.html

29-08-2021||Delhi||DU’s executive council likely to approve FYUP||In addition to approving reforms under the National Education Policy (NEP), including the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP), Delhi University’s executive council will on Tuesday also discuss other important matters such as providing financial assistance to students who lost their parents to Covid-19, setting up digital infrastructure support for colleges and departments, and naming two new facilitation centres in outer Delhi.The matters on the agenda are likely to be passed, because there are only two elected teacher representatives in the EC, which is the university’s highest decision-making body. DU Teachers’ Association (DUTA) vice-president Alok Pandey also said the teachers will hold an online demonstration on August 31 to protest against the NEP-based reforms, arguing that they were approved in last week’s academic council (AC) meeting without much consultation. Last Tuesday, the university’s AC passed the NEP-based reforms including FYUP, multiple entry-exit scheme allowing students to exit the course at any year, and academic bank of credits (ABC) which will allow students to earn credits for different courses from the next academic session (2022-23).“The University shall retain the three years honours degree as well as well as assimilate in its structure the four years honours degree and four years honours degree with research,” said the minutes of the August 24 meeting.Along with approving the minutes, the EC will also deliberate on a fee waiver programme for students who lost their parents to Covid-19. Students can submit a copy of the application including necessary documents to the colleges and departments for waiver or assistance. Colleges can take the approval of governing body to extend the waiver.Pandey said the concession won’t help students much. “Though it is a welcome move, the fee components included in the waiver don’t account for a large amount of the fee. Colleges and the university will have to allow for other forms of concession as well. Though full waiver won’t be possible, university has agreed to allow multiple forms of financial assistance,” he said.Another set of pandemic-induced reforms, including setting up DU Digital Infrastructure Support for Colleges and Departments (DUDISCD). The committee will assist colleges and departments develop more effective e-learning processes and create in-house digital infrastructure. The committee will also set up a resource centre that will help record and edit videos to be disseminated through a centralised DU platform.The university has also announced that it will set up facilitation centres in Roshanpura in Najafgarh and Bhati Kalan in Fatehpur Beri on plots allotted by the Delhi government. In August, HT reported that DU was considering naming an upcoming college at Fatehpur Beri village in south Delhi after late Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union minister Sushma Swaraj.These centres will cater to students staying in far-flung areas of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) as a first step toward opening a full-fledged college. Examination and admission-related facilities will be extended to the students through these facilitation centres.While the administration proposed four names — Sushma Swaraj, Swami Vivekananda, Veer Savarkar and Sardar Patel — the academic council proposed five more names. The EC agenda item for Tuesday states: “The Council resolved that the name of these Colleges/Centers may be given after the names of Sushma Swaraj, Swami Vivekananda, Veer Savarkar, Sardar Patel. The Council also suggested including the names of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Savitri Bai Phule, Arun Jaitley, Choudhary Brahm Prakash and CD Deshmukh. After general discussion/suggestions, the Council resolved that the vice-chancellor be authorised to finalize the name.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-executive-council-likely-to-approve-fyup-101630260701125.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 17 injured in gas cylinder blast in Dharavi, 5 critical||At least 17 were injured including four minors following a gas cylinder blast reported in a slum area of Shahu Nagar in Dharavi in Mumbai on Sunday. Five patients are critical and 12 are stable. “Two patients are on ventilator support, including an 8-year-old boy, have over 50% burns on their faces. As a result, their faces have swollen and they are unable to breathe on their own so we have to incubate them for artificial breathing support,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital. “They are quite critical. They have been admitted under the medicine department. The remaining patients are stable,” he said.The minors have been identified as Alina Ansari, 5, Faiyaz Ansari, 16, Attazam Ansari, 4 and Sonu Jaiswal, 8. The incident was reported around 12.15pm, which took place opposite Hotel Mubarak in Dharavi. Two fire engines, one jumbo water tanker and a team of civic and police officers reached the site immediately.All the injured were rescued and rushed to Sion hospital. However, access to the site was difficult due to the narrow lane, the BMC officials said.A BMC official said, “It looks like the gas cylinder was already leaking but was left unattended outside on a road and suddenly caught fire. It appears that someone dropped a cigarette after smoking beside it unknowingly. The fire was doused by 12.50pm.”The five who are in critical condition include Sataradevi Jaiswal, 40, who has suffered 60% burns, Shaukat Ali, 58 with 60% burn injuries, followed by Sonu Jaiwal, 8, whose face is burned. Anju Gautam, 28, and Prem Jaiswal, 32, also suffered burn injuries on their face, while Sabina Ahmad, 32, and Meharunissa Khan, 4 sustained minor burn injuries and their condition is stable. According to BMC officials, not all injured are locals, but a few also include passersby who were walking through the narrow lane when the blast took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-17-injured-in-gas-cylinder-blast-in-dharavi-5-critical-101630260221161.html
29-08-2021||Gurugram||Encroachment drive on at Sadar Bazar ahead of second pedestrian-only trials||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has started a 10-day anti-encroachment drive in Sadar Bazar to pave the way for restarting pedestrian-only trials on the main market road from mid-September, officials said on Sunday.The move comes after Gurugram was shortlisted among 30 cities selected for the second round of the Streets4People Challenge, organised by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. MCG officials said that heavy encroachment by street vendors is proving to be a major obstacle for turning the area into a no-vehicle zone and the only way forward is to have “complete control” over it.“If encroachments and trials occur simultaneously, the entire project is once again doomed to fail. For converting Sadar Bazar streets into pedestrian-friendly stretches, it is vital that all possible encroachments are removed from the area and the scope for such future violations are either completely closed or minimised to the lowest possible extent,” Jitender Garg, joint commissioner, MCG, said.Garg said that to remove encroachments, the MCG has constituted a special enforcement team comprising eight bouncers, a supervisor, two operators to use earthmovers, and a crane operator for towing vehicles.“The team will be present in Sadar Bazar around the clock. Earlier, we would carry out encroachments periodically and within a few days, the illegal street vendors would return to the same spot. In the 10-day drive, MCG officials will be revisiting the same spots after a gap of 20 minutes to ensure there is no scope for future encroachments and action against the violators can be taken immediately,” said Garg, adding that teams of MCG officials would continue to inspect and monitor the area even after the drive is completed.The MCG, while signing up for the event in September 2020, proposed to convert a 600-metre stretch of Sadar Bazar, between Jama Masjid and post office, into a pedestrian-friendly stretch and turn it into a model road for the city.However, when the MCG had banned vehicles as part of a trial run on March 20 this year, shopkeepers of the market held a protest against the move, with MCG acceding to their demands soon after.In July, the MCG constituted a seven-member expert committee for drawing up a design to make the stretch pedestrian-friendly, following which the civic body planned to restart the project in August.Garg said that on Friday and Saturday, the MCG carried out extensive anti-encroachment drives in the presence of a heavy police force, in which 80 street vendors were evicted and 35 illegal ramps were demolished.“There are three main areas where encroachments are in high presence, at the Sadar Bazar, Bada Bazar, and Gurudwara Road, essentially covering the stretch between Kamla Nehru Park and Naya Bazar. Clearing these spaces will create parking space for accommodating at least 250 four-wheeler vehicles. This will solve the main problem over which the first trial had faced resistance. Once the encroachments are cleared, we are aiming to start the trial from mid-September,” said Garg. As part of its new design, the MCG is also setting up toilets, carrying out civil work, lighting and other electrical works in the area.The main contention of shopkeepers during the March trial run was the commute between the parking site and the market would discourage many from visiting the market and lead to a loss in business.In March, the MCG had set up parking sites at Old Jail Complex, Grover Ground and the ground near Session House, each located 600-800 metres from Sadar Bazar, from where visitors had to either travel on foot to the market or avail of a shuttle service arranged by the MCG.“We are not against the trial but the timing of it could not be worse. Shopkeepers are still reeling from the effects of Covid-19. Business is at an all-time low, and we fear that such trials will further impact our earnings. The MCG needs to ensure that the shopkeepers are on the same page and that parking spots are located in the vicinity for customers,” said Bablu Gupta, the president of Sadar Bazar Traders’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/encroachment-drive-on-at-sadar-bazar-ahead-of-second-pedestrian-only-trials-101630259926852.html
29-08-2021||Gurugram||Houses in Jamai Colony, set up on Aravalli land, to be razed||Faridabad agencies are gearing up to clear illegal houses constructed in Jamai Colony over five acres of Aravalli land, on the lines of a demolition drive in Khori village that was recently completed, officials said on Sunday. Around 300-400 houses are constructed in Jamai Colony in violation of norms, officials said.Following the recent orders of the Supreme Court, in which Faridabad agencies were directed to clear all illegal encroachments from forest land, a four-member team of the Faridabad Police inspected the area on Saturday. Officials said that notices have been sent to around 300-400 families living in the area. “A team has already visited the area on Saturday and asked residents to vacate within three to four days. Notices have already been given to the residents there by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) for vacating the area before demolition starts. The colony is set up on MCF land and demolitions are likely to start next month,” a senior official of the Faridabad Police said, requesting not to be named. Officials said that a team of the Urban Local Body (ULB) had started a demolition drive in the colony in 2019, but it was stopped following protests by residents. In the third week of July, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about the illegal constructions in Khori village of Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception.” After the court issued directions, the forest department started preparations to raze all illegal structures, including farmhouses, banquet halls and institutes, constructed on forest land. Until now, 10 farmhouses that were set up in the Aravallis have been demolished in Faridabad, officials said. Last week, MCF told the Supreme Court that it has removed all structures in the Khori Village that came up on 150 acres of Aravalli forest land, along with 10 of the 140 illegal farmhouses “acting without exception while taking action against encroachments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/houses-in-jamai-colony-set-up-on-aravalli-land-to-be-razed-101630259925637.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Healthcare staff facing Covid burnout?||A 27-year-old resident doctor from BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central always carries a strip of anti-anxiety pills in her pockets. At night, she breaks into a sweat when images of the over-crowded Covid-19 wards flash in her sleep. In May, she had a mental breakdown and had sought psychiatric help from a private doctor.“I have been taking care of Covid-19 patients since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. The first wave was exhausting and frightening as we didn’t know much about the virus. But by the time the second wave hit us, we were already mentally and physically burnt out, and I couldn’t take it anymore,” she said.Nair Hospital was the first civic-run hospital that was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. Since the start of the pandemic, the hospital has treated over 18,000 Covid-19 patients and hundreds of resident doctors like her, have been the backbone of the hospital.Although the pandemic curve has flattened and the daily Covid cases have come down to below 400 on an average compared to 10,000 cases recorded in April this year, it has left a long-lasting impact on the mental health of the healthcare workers (HCWs) including doctors, nurses radiographers, lab technicians and anaesthetists, Class 4 employees among others. With an anticipated third wave, they urgently need mental health support, claim doctors.Increased alcohol useA 37-year-old Class 4 employee who works at the morgue of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel turned into an alcoholic to cope with the burnout in the second wave. “He has been in the morgue for the past 10 years but I never saw him so distressed. In April, he was handling 10-15 bodies daily. He would maintain distance from us. Soon, he submerged himself in addiction. Now, he is undergoing counselling at the psychiatry department of the hospital,” said his wife.During the first and second waves, HCWs had to handle grief, console patients’ families, and other issues added to their mental burnout. Many of these workers had to isolate themselves from their families to avoid the chances of transmission Covid-19. This has caused a severe interruption in family life and relationships.National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) conducted a survey among 3,083 HCWs across India. They published their findings in April in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry which revealed that 26.6% and 23.8% of the respondents had anxiety and depression respectively.“In the backward stepwise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions,” reads the study—Mental health issues among health care workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.Many suffer from anxiety, distressEven after 18 months since the outbreak of the pandemic, city psychiatrists are getting a lot of HCWs who are suffering from anxiety, distress and depression due to the pandemic.A psychiatric clinic, Aavishkar Center along with MediaMedic Communication started a mental care helpline number—9172284386 for the HCWs in June. Since, its launch, the helpline has received 632 calls. Almost 90% of the callers complained of anxiety, frustration and fear-related Covid-19 duty in hospitals.“HCWs are experiencing elevated psychological distress, burnout, and increased risk of mental illness. In April, when cases shot up, there were shortages of beds and oxygen. So, these young resident doctors had to prioritise the treatment of patients. In this, many have lost their critical patients. Now, they feel responsible for their death,” said Dr Nirmala Rao, director of the centre. “They are under too much distress which is also affecting their personal relationships,” she added. Considering the good response at the helpline number, now it is being made available to the public. It will be functional between 9am and 6pm daily.In many cases, the HCWs who were asymptomatic carriers ended up infecting their family members which further added to their mental health. “My husband and both of my in-laws contracted Covid-19 from me. My father-in-law who was 68-year-old succumbed to the infection. I still feel guilty for it,” said Sunita Rao, 34, a nurse with the government-run JJ Hospital.No leaves for mental health ailmentsDr Harish Shetty, a well-known psychiatrist said that HCWs aren’t even getting the time for recovery amid the ongoing fluctuation of the pandemic curves. “With rising variants, there may be more pandemic waves like the anticipated third wave. This means that healthcare providers won’t get the required rest for their mental health. While we are focusing on vaccination and more research on the virus, we need to focus on caregivers also,” he said.Medical colleges have started counselling their HCWs but due to the fear of getting stigmatised, many opt for private counselling. “Mental health still gets stigmatised, hence many of the HCWs avoid getting counselling in their own department and approach doctors outside to maintain their secrecy. Several HCWs from lower working grades don’t even consult psychiatrists or psychologists until it is too late,” said Dr Rao.Many young resident doctors claimed that there are no leaves for mental health ailments. “Our hospitals talk about the need for mental health but we don’t get any sick leaves for it. We are being denied leaves for recovery from anxiety and depression due to Covid-19 duty for months. No one fights for us,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/healthcare-staff-facing-covid-burnout-101630259924294.html
29-08-2021||Gurugram||Residents protest lack of infra, poor services by developer||Residents of BPTP Park Serene in Sector 37D on Sunday held a protest against the developer for failing to complete the installation of necessary infrastructure and providing inadequate services, despite obtaining an occupancy certificate (OC) from the Department of Town and Country Planning. The president of the residents’ welfare association, PK Naithani, said that if problems faced by residents are not resolved soon, they will go on an indefinite strike. They alleged inaction by authorities despite repeated complaints filed against the developer. The protesters said that the developer did complete pending works after getting a partial OC. “The sewage treatment plant (STP) is incomplete and has lesser than required capacity. The sewage water is not treated properly and is dumped on the roadside. The sewer lines in Sector 37D are non-functional and the developer has to manage the service, but there is no action on the ground,” said Naithani. Residents alleged in July and August, the electricity supply was down for 160 hours in total, with the longest outage lasting for 36 consecutive hours, because the developer has not handed over the electricity distribution to the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN). They also said that the basement is in a poor condition due to frequent flooding and waterlogging, with seepage at several spots. “We have to park vehicles on the surface as basement parking is flooded. We also demand that the structural integrity of the towers be tested by independent auditors. The developer should take steps to stop further depletion and repair the harm done so far,” said Hemant Kumar, a resident. However, the developer said that several infrastructure services are yet to be installed by government agencies, which has led to problems. “Electrical infrastructure, including our 33KV substation, is ready but it can only be energised once the main feeder 33KV substation at Sector 99 is commissioned, which shall be taking time. Diesel generators are working in power failure situations. As master stormwater drains are yet to be laid, we have no other option but to pump out water to adjoining areas to avoid flooding of our site. The club will be made operational within six months but alternative arrangements have already been made for residents,” Rajeev Gupta, the managing director of BPMS, a sister concern of BPTP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-protest-lack-of-infra-poor-services-by-developer-101630259922980.html
29-08-2021||Gurugram||Lal dora areas identified, agri land to be mapped next||Officials of the Haryana government on Saturday said they have completed drone mapping of lal dora (non-agricultural land) villages and the Survey of India will map revenue estates (agricultural land) from August 31. The mapping of the revenue estates is expected to take six months, senior government officials said.Sanjeev Kaushal, additional chief secretary, revenue and disaster management department, Haryana, said that the Central government has given its approval for mapping the revenue estates by the Survey of India. The cost of the work will be borne by the state government, he said. Lal dora land in every village is generally used for residential purposes, without any revenue record. The term lal dora was first used in 1908 to define basti (population) land of a village that was used only for non-agricultural purposes. To separate lal dora from agricultural land, the revenue department demarcated land around villages as lal dora.Kaushal said that mapping of lal dora land in 6,329 villages of 22 districts was completed on August 24, with the Survey of India having processed the data of 5,333 villages so far.According to the revenue department, the mapping of lal dora areas will ensure that properties in these areas get official recognition, for residents to avail of loans from banks on immovable property and villagers being able to buy or sell properties. Kaushal urged the district deputy commissioners to publicise the registration of properties being done free of cost under the Svamitva [Survey of Villages And Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas] scheme in the villages. Kaushal said that earlier, lal dora areas were exempted from building by-laws/construction laws/scheduled areas etc., which led to a growth of these properties. Also, lack of registration led to conflicts over the demarcation of spaces. Despite owning a property, there were no papers to establish the ownership of the property and there was no proper demarcation of the land used by the villagers and land owned by the panchayat, due to which public spaces, such as playgrounds, ponds, drains etc, were encroached.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lal-dora-areas-identified-agri-land-to-be-mapped-next-101630259921607.html
29-08-2021||Noida||Noida: Over 330K vehicles violated traffic rules till July this year||The Gautam Budh Nagar police commissionerate has fined 335,253 vehicles in the last seven months for traffic violations, of which nearly 180,000 were two wheelers, said officials. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Prasad Saha said that the total fines imposed was over ₹2.45 crore. “Around 150,000 vehicles were four-wheelers and and 4,248 heavy vehicles. April had the most number of challans at 57,715 that amounted to ₹34,69,900. March had the most penalty amount of ₹54 lakh against 56,636 challans. This year, the traffic department seized 3,629 vehicles, including 1,430 cars, 1,133 motorcycles and 600 heavy vehicles, till July 31,” he said. Expressing concern over rule-breakers not clearing the challans against them, he said, “A Lok Adalat will be held in the Surajpur district court on September 11 where offenders may get a chance to avail a 50% waiver on the penalty if they clear their challan,” he said. “So far, we have sent 289,000 challans to the violators’ residential addresses of the violators. We have also called over 100,000 violators over phone whose mobile numbers did not match with the number linked with the vehicle,” he said. This has been made possible after GB Nagar traffic police had CCTV cameras installed at various traffic signals across the district to capture violations. “Traffic police personnel posted at all traffic signals have been directed to take pictures of vehicles violating stop lines and zebra crossings on their smart phones,” the DCP (traffic) added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-over-330k-vehicles-violated-traffic-rules-till-july-this-year-101630259380478.html
29-08-2021||Noida||104 O2 cylinders went missing from Sanjay Nagar district hospital during peak of 2nd Covid wave||More than 100 oxygen cylinders meant for Covid-19 patients were allegedly stolen from Sanjay Nagar District Combined Hospital (SNDCH) during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic. Police have booked some unidentified persons based on the hospital authorities’ complaint, and an investigation is underway.The hospital -- an L2 category facility -- dealt with patients having moderate Covid-19 symptoms and had used 60 oxygen cylinders per day between April 11 and May 11 this year.“On June 8, 2021, our nursing staff said that 104 oxygen cylinders, including 82 D-type and 22 B-type, went missing from the hospital. We formed a committee of five officers immediately to probe the incident. It also came to light that an oxygen supply vendor had not returned 49 oxygen cylinders, and attendants of patients allegedly took away the remaining 55 cylinders amidst the mad rush in the hospital from mid of April... We have decided to uphold a payment of ₹3 lakh to the oxygen supply vendor,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent, SNDCH.“We have hospital marking on our oxygen cylinders and are numbered in an order. Following an FIR, an oxygen vendor returned 49 old and worn-out oxygen cylinders, without our marking. The remaining 55 cylinders are still missing, and we suspect that attendants of patients may have taken those away. Now, it is up to the police to recover the missing cylinders and take action against the suspects,” he added.The hospital filed a police complaint on Thursday (August 26), and an FIR was lodged against unidentified persons under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 380 (theft) the same day at the Madhuban Bapudham police station. The hospital authorities have also written a letter to additional chief secretary (health), director general (medical health), divisional health officials and district officials on this matter.“During the second Covid-19 wave, the hospital was equipped with CCTVs, and common people were also abstained from entering the premises. The oxygen cylinder stock and other equipment are the responsibility of the hospital. If they suspected that attendants of patients were stealing oxygen cylinders, they should have reported the incident immediately. The incident will be investigated thoroughly,” said a senior health department official, requesting anonymity.Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1), said, “We have lodged an FIR based on a complaint filed by the hospital authorities.

The river continues being rated under category ‘E’, making it unfit for bathing or propagation of aquatic life, the report said.According to the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board’s (UPPCB’s) report for July, the river does not have presence of dissolved oxygen (DO) against the minimum requirement of 5 milligrams per litre (mg/l), while the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels have worsened since June. However, the low presence of coliform levels is the only positive takeaway, the report said.UPPCB analysis of the samples collected from downstream of Kulesra in Noida, for July 2021, found the BOD levels to be 54 mg/l (18 times higher than the permissible limit) as against 46 mg/l in June. At the same time, DO levels have been consistently zero throughout the year so far in Noida. The last spot where the river had some DO level (2.20 mg/l) was at Karhera village bridge, Ghaziabad, and Mohan Nagar Road Bridge, Ghaziabad (1.90 mg/l). However, soon after that the DO levels go nil as soon as the river reaches Chijarsi at Ghaziabad border and thereafter at Kulesra, Noida after which the river meets the Yamuna.The faecal coliform levels have reduced to 150,000 most probable number (MPN)/100 ml (against 1.1 million in June), the UPPCB report said. However, the coliform levels for July are still much higher than the max permissible limit of 2,500 MPN/100 ml. The higher level of coliform shows that high volume of sewage is flowing through the river, experts said.According to the data from the India Meteorological Department, Gautam Budh Nagar received about 100mm rainfall till July. “For a healthy river to support outdoor bathing, DO must be 5 mg/l. The BOD is the oxygen required to diffuse biological matter, and it must not exceed 3 mg/l,” says Sushmita Sen Gupta, senior programme manager (water pollution), Center for Science and Environment (CSE).Manoj Mishra, environmentalist and river pollution expert, said, “The rains can revive a river temporarily or do improve the water quality. But we have to understand that it’s the source of pollution that needs to be addressed. Monsoon would pass, but the pollution sources will remain there.”According to UPPCB officials, it’s the unauthorised and untapped sewer from illegal settlements along the river that pollutes it. “The sewage treatment plants are working properly and we are also keeping tabs on the industrial waste. However, the river receives untreated waste from a number of unauthorised settlements and some drains that fall into it untreated,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB (Noida region).Hindon comes from Saharanpur and enters Greater Noida from Chijarsi border after passing through Meerut, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, and Ghaziabad. After covering a length of 50km across Gautam Budh Nagar district, the river disappears in almost equally polluted Yamuna at Momnathal in Tilwara village of Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/monsoon-rains-fail-to-revive-polluted-hindon-in-noida-101630258900461.html

Under it, the agency will have 10 years to earn revenue to recover the cost, plus earn profit, from advertising on the bridge space and then transfer it to the authority. This way, officials from the authority said, the authority will not have to spend any money on the project.“If all goes per plan, then the work will start on these three FOBs by September-end and will be open for public in nine months from that day,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Greater Noida Authority.The locations where the FOBs are slated to come up are heavy and high-speed traffic zones that pose a risk to pedestrians and people have long been demanding a resolution to this almost daily affair.“The authority has been promising the FOBs at these three points for a long time, but nothing has happened. We hope that now this time the work will not get delayed and general public will not be made to suffer for more time. Pedestrians have to face a lot of risk and trouble in the absence of FOBs,” said Alok Singh, founder member of Active Citizen team, a social group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-three-footover-bridges-planned-for-pedestrians-safety-101630258660512.html

There will be no change in the train timings,” she said.With an aim to reduce the travel time during the peak hours, the NMRC had started the fast train service between Noida and Greater Noida from February 1 this year. The service was made available from terminal stations -- Noida Sector 51 station and Greater Noida’s Depot station -- from 8am to 11am, and 5pm to 8pm on weekdays to cover the peak rush hour.Out of the 21 stations on the Aqua Line, 10 stations at sectors 50, 81, 83, 101, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147 and 148 with low ridership earlier have been skipped under the new system. However, owing to the public demand, the NMRC allowed to stop the fast train at the Sector 81 station from August 2 this year.Brajesh Sharma, a resident of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Noida Sector 78, said that this is a good move. “There are a number of residential complexes, including ours near Sector 101 metro station. We had demanded that the NMRC stops the fast train service at these stations. This move has come as a big relief for daily commuters and office goers. We hope that the NMRC stops trains at other five stations too, and it also provides the last mile connectivity.”The Aqua Line Metro, shut amidst the Covid-imposed lockdown, resumed services after 40 days on June 9, 2021. In the past three days -- from August 26 to 28 – the metro has recorded 12,837, 13,334 and 12,460 commuters, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-now-fast-train-service-at-four-more-metro-stations-on-aqua-line-101630258240521.html

If such a decision has been taken, then it will have an impact on the politics of Punjab,” Pargat said, adding that according to his understanding, the Mallikarjun Kharge committee, formed to end factionalism in the Punjab unit in June, had decided that the state assembly polls would be held under the leadership of Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. On Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s statement last week that, “Without having the power to decide, being a mere showpiece is useless,” Pargat added that Sidhu was pointing to Rawat. On the cancellation of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), Pargat said the issue needed to be dealt with transparency and without legal complications. “We should not get stuck in any legal tangles like the Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing cases. The CM needs to work with compassion,” he added, claiming that the party needed to call a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) under the supervision and monitoring of the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) to ensure Punjab’s citizens know the truth.On the use of force on farmers in Haryana on Saturday, Pargat, said, “The BJP is intentionally disrupting the peaceful protest of farmers and is down to playing its dirty games. The SAD is equally responsible for giving the country these three black farm laws, as it had a cabinet berth in the Central government, but did not stop it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/who-decided-on-capt-as-leader-for-2022-polls-pargat-s-poser-to-rawat-101630257521911.html

LFU – which provides free coaching for NEET to deserving underprivileged students – realised that language is becoming a barrier for students from tribal and rural areas who otherwise have the potential to get admission in government medical colleges.Dr Farooque Faras, vice president of LFU, said, “As per government statistics, exactly 31,239 students had opted to appear for NEET in the Marathi language in 2019. Sadly however, there is no textbook or reference book in the Marathi language.”Dr Santosh Chate, who was teaching LFU students in Melghat last year said, “Tribal students do not look at English with ease and comfort. There is a lot of fear in their mind when it comes to English. Many even drop the idea of pursuing a medical education because of the language barrier. Last year, we had to take a lot of effort while teaching them and making them understand Marathi and tribal languages. Next year, we are also planning to add tribal languages like Korku and Gondi to the dictionary.”The English-to-Marathi dictionary has the Marathi equivalents of all English words mentioned in the chemistry and biology books of NCERT Classes 11 and 12. While medical education has become expensive, it has also become difficult for students belonging to humble backgrounds to train themselves for the NEET.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/an-english-to-marathi-dictionary-to-aid-students-preparing-for-neet-101630254520254.html

As a result, water has started spreading in low lying areas of dozens of villages in Kuchaikote and Thawe blocks of the district.However, officials ruled out any threat to the Saran embankment on the Gandak river. “The patrolling of the embankment has been intensified,” said Gopalganj DM. Meanwhile, the water level of Lalbakeya, Gandak, Chatiya and Sikarahana rivers in East Champaran and Pandarai, Sikarahana, Harbora, Oraiya and Masan rivers in West Champaran has increased following the heavy discharge of water (3.14 cusec) on Sunday and heavy rainfall in Nepal and its catchment area.

BSP national coordinator Akash Anand, who is also the nephew of party supremo Mayawati, announced the decision at the first joint rally of the two parties since the alliance was formalised. Phagawara is the Centre of Doaba, a region with the highest proportion of Dalit population. According to the seat-sharing arrangement between the parties, the BSP will fight on 20 of 117 assembly seats.At the ‘Alakh Jagao Rally’ (Reignite your pride), SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal announced that if voted to power, it will provide 33% reservation in government jobs to students who pass out from government schools.Sukhbir also raised issues of delay in welfare schemes, including Shagun Scheme or Blue cards, and post-matric scholarship scheme. “The Congress government in Punjab has stopped the post-matric scholarship scheme for Scheduled Caste students to deprive Dalit students of higher education,” speaker after speaker alleged at the rally.Attacking chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Sukhbir alleged the Congress government had ruined Punjab while its ministers and MLAs of the ruling party have the sole agenda loot Punjab. “Besides looting the state, the government has failed to continue social welfare schemes launched during SAD government,” he claimed, adding, “All theses schemes will be restored and the current SC welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot will be jailed.” He claimed that the SAD-BJP alliance had unnerved the Congress, the BJP and the AAP.Claiming that the SAD-BSP alliance will last for 25-40 years or more, he said the SAD snapped ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) because it “stabbed” Punjabis and farmers in their back.“We have to fulfil the dreams of Kanshi Ram, the BSP founder. All of us have to work with unity to ensure we voted in to form the next government,” Anand said at the rally.MP Ram Gautam, who is also the national coordinator of the BSP, alleged that the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government that the Congress led were scam-tainted. “The BSP is with farmers and will always support them. We have also protested shoulder-to-shoulder in their protest on for the past few months. The AAP government in Delhi was the first to implement the Centre’s three farm laws and the party is an off-shoot of the RSS.”“Four ministers of the Congress government in the state are already under the lens for committing ₹multi-crore scams,” alleged Garhi.Every speaker who addressed the rally also flayed the use of force on farmers by the Haryana Police in Karnal on Saturday.

As a result, the PMC contractor has completed only 25% of the work till date.V G Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of the road department, said, “The road widening work will not be completed till September 2021 as we are yet to acquire the necessary land for the project from 162 people. As of now we cannot say when the project will be completed.”Giving 162 land owners cash as compensation for acquiring their land is not possible for the PMC as project costs would touch Rs700 crore. Sudhir Chavan, executive engineer of the road department, said, “It is not feasible to give cash to all the people whose land will be utilised for the project. We had proposed to give them floor space index (FSI) and transfer development rights (TDR) as compensation according to land acquisition rules. We are planning to continue the scheduled work on a step-by-step basis.”With residents from Katraj and Kondhwa facing traffic snarls every day, there is a major need to widen the road to avoid traffic congestion. “New societies are coming up on both sides of the road. After the second wave of covid, traffic has increased again which is leading to traffic jams every day. If the project is completed, the problem of traffic jams will be solved,” said Rajat Deshmukh.To address the traffic woes in the area, the PMC will construct the 3.5 km Katraj-Kondhwa road between Rajas society chowk and Khadi machine chowk. The corporation has planned three grade separators and two vehicle underpasses along the stretch. The foundation stone laying ceremony for the project was held on November 2, 2018 in the presence of the then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. A PMC-appointed contractor began the work of increasing the width of the road from the existing 15 to 20 metre to 84 metre.

Earlier, on March 8, the department promoted and posted as civil surgeon of Sheikhpura, Dr Ram Narayan Ram, who had died on February 7.According to the latest order, Dr Shiwangee was posted to Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) as a senior resident in the department of anesthesiology. However, the head of the department at the hospital said he was shown news reports of her death last year."Some journalists showed us newspaper cuttings of the news related to the doctor's death last September when she was posted at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital in Patna. All I know for sure is that she has not joined my department as yet," associate professor and head of the department of anaesthesiology at DMCH, said.The government’s rule requires the 406 doctors on the list to join their place of posting within a week from the date of the order.“You should pose this question to the department,” said Dr Manibhushan Sharma, medical superintendent, DMCH, when asked about Dr Shiwangee’s posting to the anaesthesiology department of his hospital.“We get to hear from people that the doctor, posted here as per the order, died some 11 months back,” he added.Dr Sharma then cited a technicality to suggest that her name could have been added “erroneously” to the list.“The posting order in the case of Dr Shiwangee clearly mentions under the column of ‘online registration number’ that she ‘did not apply’ [for posting]. Registration numbers are mentioned in case of applicants [seeking posting]. So, how was a person, who did not apply, posted to some place. Her name may have figured erroneously in the list,” he said, referring to the fact that only those who applied for these merit-based preferential postings could have been on the list but the entry against Dr Shiwangee's name suggested she hadn't applied, which pointed to the possibility of a goof-up.The head of department of anaesthesiology at Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), Patna, where a doctor named Shiwangee was previously posted, said: "One Dr Shiwangee, a senior resident, died after some days of her posting to our department last year. However, I will not vouch for the fact whether she is the same doctor the health department has posted to the DMCH," said Dr Ashok Kumar.A senior officer in the health department refused to comment, saying he was not the competent person to speak to the media.It is clear that only the health department can confirm if it has indeed ended up issuing a posting order for a doctor who died in September last year. However, a doctor, who was a batchmate of the deceased anaesthesiologist, said on condition of anonymity, "There was only one Shiwangee in our batch to take up MD anaesthesiology. Moreover, the government order does not mention any other Shiwangee in the list of 406 doctors reshuffled.”He, too, pointed out that the posting order clearly mentioned against her name that she 'did not apply' when the health department invited applications in February for merit-based choice posting for doctors, who had completed their post graduation course from state-run medical colleges, for the mandatory three-year tenure in government facilities. It could only mean one thing, he said.The earlier goof up in the March 8 order involving Dr Ram Narayan Ram was raised by opposition leaders in the legislative council to embarrass the government.Health officials had then clarified that the incumbent was alive during the interviews for promotion and the department did not get to know about the doctor’s death in the intervening period before the transfer orders were issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dead-doctor-posted-to-bihar-s-dmch-101630254221309.html
29-08-2021||Patna||PM Modi praises Sukhet Model||An initiative called the Sukhet Model, adopted by Dr Rajendra Prasad Agriculture University in Madhubani and local agricultural research centres to check pollution in the villages, was praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Maan Ki Baat address on Sunday.The PM said that the initiative has given strength to the Swachh Bharat Mission, besides providing benefits to the farmers. In his address, the PM talked about the major highlights of the Sukhet Model, like how cow dung and waste from houses of villagers are collected and in return, the villagers are given money for gas cylinders. He said the waste collected from the villages is used in manufacturing vermicompost, which is made available to farmers. The PM said the model has a four-fold benefit, like pollution free environment in villages, waste disposal, monetary assistance to villagers for gas cylinders and availability of organic fertilisers to farmers. “ Just think, how such initiatives can increase the strength of our villages. It is a subject of atma nirbharta. I will urge all panchayats to think about doing something like this,” the PM said.The Sukhet Model was launched by the agricultural department as a part of the Climate Resilient Agricultural Programme in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pm-modi-praises-sukhet-model-101630254160917.html

We get many complaints that roads are not getting cleaned properly and that garbage is not being lifted daily in some areas. That employees are remaining absent and there is no proper system monitoring them. The GPS system will help track each employee from the central control room, whether he/she is working at the designated place.”“The PMC is not the only municipal corporation to introduce the system. Some municipal corporations have already initiated it. Even Telangana has introduced it for the entire state. The corporation is negotiating with the agency to bring down the prices of these wrist watches and the overall system. The wrist watches would be required for almost 13,000 employees,” Khemnar said.According to civic officials, there are many employees with jobs in the solid waste department or sweeping section who are taking home salaries without doing the designated work. Under the existing system, employees need to be present at the Aarogya Kothi in each ward office, where they need to first sign on the muster. Later, the supervisor is expected to keep a watch on these employees but that is not being carried out effectively. The civic administration is keen on introducing the GPS-based system as it would force employees to do their jobs properly while giving good service to citizens. Later, the system will be introduced for others like drivers, with PMC vehicles already having a GPS system.“After clearing all the technical doubts, the municipal administration will place the proposal before the standing committee for approval,” said Khemnar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-sanitation-staff-to-get-gps-enabled-wrist-watches-as-monitoring-devices-101630254100251.html

The relaxations, which were introduced recently on August 25, are a part of Unlock 6. Several prominent schools, including Mount Carmel, St Dominic Savio’s High School, Don Bosco Academy, are set to reopen for primary students from Tuesday, while other schools, which have already reopened, are preparing to call students at full strength. Mary Alphonsa, principal of Don Bosco Academy, said on Sunday, “Following the government’s guidelines, we will resume classes for students of classes 4 to 6 from Tuesday and for classes 7 and 8 from September 6. All Covid-19 safety guidelines are being followed for safety of students.” The state government earlier allowed schools to call to students of classes 9 to 12 from August 7.“We are also currently conducting terminal examinations for classes 10 and 12 in conventional mode, which will conclude on September 2,” she added. Similarly, Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, principal of Baldwin Academy, said, “We welcome the government’s decision of allowing classes to resume at full capacity. The move will encourage parents to send their wards to school and improve attendance.” Meanwhile, teachers also heaved a sigh of relief as conducting online and offline classes was hectic for many. “It was very difficult for teachers to conduct online and offline classes, as we need to repeat the same content twice. Besides, completing syllabus is also tough as we spend double time to cover the same topic,” shared a class 10 mathematics teacher. Meanwhile, parents of kindergarten and primary students are reluctant to send their wards to school as threat of Covid-19 looms large. Anjali Sharma, mother of a class one student, said, “I am apprehensive to send my daughter to school owing to Covid-19 threat. I will continue teaching her at home.” PU clears pending examsPatna University has released exam schedule for clearing pending semester exams. As per exam schedule, students of Bachelors of Arts, Science and Commerce students will take the exams from September 10 to October 5 at five exam centres.Anil Kumar, dean of students’ welfare at PU, said, “Final year exams are going on, while semester exams of degree part II students are scheduled. After completion of exams, normal classes will begin at respective colleges following Covid-19 safety guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/edu-institutions-set-to-hold-classes-at-full-strength-under-unlock-6-101630254040774.html

The civic administration claimed that the absence of prior permissions or documentation to start the respective social spaces prompted this move. Further, the corporation will not rent out these spaces to get income by floating tenders for the public properties.A final proposal seeking retrieval of the said properties from different social organisations, social workers, self-help groups, Ganesh mandals and elected members of corporations has been prepared by the social welfare department. There are 137 such social spaces out of which 108 have been selected for reclamation and lease according to the department. Legalities such as signing of memorandums or agreements have been missing for the said properties for more than a decade now, while a few of them have been fetching a pittance as compared to the space allocated to occupants, the department said. The current effort is aimed at bringing all such spaces under a uniform policy.PMC joint municipal commissioner Dnyaneshwar Molak said, “A report has been readied and sent to the commissioner for approval. The said properties were given as per the old rules while recently, new guidelines have been introduced. The PMC is following the new guidelines to ensure that social spaces get the necessary rental income which can add to the revenue earnings of the corporation. Once approved, tenders will be released by the civic body as per the guidelines of the Municipal Corporation Act.”The report sent to the commissioner for approval points out that some of the social spaces that were leased out had been sublet in violation of the Municipal Corporation Act. The act stipulates that spaces cannot be sublet by the lessee to others and this will invite action or even termination of the contract or memorandum of understanding.Social activist Altaf Shaikh said, “Most of the social spaces located at strategic locations have been taken by elected representatives. Currently, there is no policy for allotment of these spaces and hence, violations are being seen every now and then. Once the policy is framed, proper tendering and allocation of these plots can be carried out so that the deserving ones get these places for carrying out social work. Most of the time, elected representatives are seen occupying these spaces to carry out their work and the real purpose namely, citizens’ benefit is lost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-reclaim-108-social-spaces-from-elected-representatives-101630253980220.html

The council also passed a resolution that the party chief would head the party’s parliamentary board in keeping with the party’s Constitution.“It has also been decided that the party would contest assembly election in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur. The party would like honourable seat-sharing in UP and other states. In 2017, the party did not contest despite demand and that affected our expansion. The council also reiterated its demand for caste census, for which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had led an all-party delegation to the PM earlier this month,” he added, emphasising that JD-U had remained the most reliable partner of the BJP.The council also passed a resolution demanding that the Rohini Commission recommendations be made public. In 2017, the Centre had set up Justice Rohini Commission, which favoured sub-categorisation of reservation for other backward castes (OBCs) in the government sector by splitting 27% quota into different categories of OBC for equitable distribution of benefits among different sub-castes. After several extensions, it could submit its report, dividing 2633 OBC sub-castes in the central list into four sub-categories with 2%, 6%, 9% and 10% quota to add up to 27%. However, its report has not yet come out.The council, while favouring the need for population control, reiterated Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s stand that the objective could be best achieved by creating awareness and boosting education among girls, as Bihar had experienced over the last one and half decades. Kumar also presented facts as to how the total fertility rate (TFR) had come down from over four to three and it could reach two with the expansion of girls’ education and resultant self-reliance due to a range of initiatives for them.“Merely making a law will not serve the purpose. It needs an overall approach as it requires a change in mindset, which can come only through education and empowerment,” he added.In his address, Kumar also batted for caste census and its importance to frame policies and programmes for the left out parties. Parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said that he was also part of the delegation to PM and there has been no opposition to the demand for caste census from any quarter, which speaks about its need.The council discussed a range of issues, including organisational strengthening, upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states and the party’s expansion plans in its quest for national status.The council also tried to dispel speculations about the internal rift in the party by presenting a united front. Lalan Singh was effusive in his praise of union minister RCP Singh, from whom he took the baton of party’s national chief, in the presence of Nitish Kumar and all the senior party leaders. RCP Singh said that Lalan Singh was an old associate and the party would grow further under his leadership.During the discussion, Nitish Kumar’s potential for being a PM candidate also surfaced, though it was stated that he was not a candidate for the post, but had all the qualities.RCP Singh said that there was no substitute to Kumar and his work spoke for him not only as of the reformist Bihar CM but also as a capable union minister in important ministries like Railways and agriculture..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-nation-council-reiterates-demand-for-caste-census-says-law-not-enough-for-population-control-101630253860842.html

On Sunday, Pawar held a meeting with the people’s representatives, officials from the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), and the district administration to discuss the draft Development Plan (DP) for the metropolitan region published by PMRDA. Ajit Pawar said that valid suggestions would be incorporated in the DP. The deadline for filing suggestions and objections to the draft DP has been extended till September 15. Pawar said that in the light of the increasing population in some areas under the metropolitan region, the formation of new municipal corporations cannot be ruled out,Elected officials at the meeting pointed out that the draft DP should have provisions for such a possible required infrastructure, in terms of newly formed administrative units. “There is recurring demand for a separate municipal corporation in Hadapsar. In the areas of Chakan and Rajgurungar, the population has been increasing. After some years, a separate corporation for areas around Pimpri-Chinchwad could be thought of, considering the number of industries and population in that area,” said Ajit Pawar. Pawar mentioned that when a new administrative unit is formed space is required to build offices and other infrastructure. “If a tehsil is converted into a district, then land has to be given for government offices, like central building, police stations. There have been suggestions in the meeting to consider these points as well in the draft DP,” said Pawar. He said that some of the suggestions that came up in the meeting were really good and the PMRDA officials have been instructed to incorporate those in the draft DP. PMRDA has published the draft development plan for the PMRDA region and the 23 villages recently merged into the PMC limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-civic-corporations-for-pune-metro-region-not-off-the-table-ajit-pawar-101630253681439.html

Ajit Pawar said, “On one hand the central government is asking us to take care (of Covid cases) and on the other hand it is asking the four newly inducted ministers (from Maharashtra) to take out rallies. People are gathering at these rallies, which will obviously affect the cases.”Pawar, who interacted with the media in Pune on the side-lines of a meeting held to discuss the PMRDA’s draft development plan, was reacting to BJP leader Narayan Rane’s criticism of the MVA government “Wherever these rallies are taking place and gatherings are happening, we will see the effect (of increased cases) in the coming days. Though we are of the opinion that cases should not increase, but still if it happens at these places where rallies are taking place, who shall be held responsible? This must be considered as well,” Pawar said.Reacting to Rane’s arrest, Ajit Pawar said the newly inducted union minister should have behaved more responsibly and avoided unnecessary provocation. The BJP’s nation-wide Jan Ashirwad Yatra began earlier this month to enable newly inducted ministers in the recent cabinet expansion to reach out to people. Earlier on Friday, the deputy CM also sought to downplay a controversy involving Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab’s purported commented in a video that went viral, in which he was seen instructing the Ratnagiri police to arrest Rane immediately and use force if necessary. “The arrest happened only after all the legal proceedings took place. His (Rane) supporters had moved court seeking anticipatory bail which was rejected. I haven’t seen the videos, but as a guardian minister of Ratnagiri District, he (Parab) must have been contacted by the police and he asked them to follow the law,” Pawar informed. Rane, a recently sworn-in union minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) was arrested earlier last week for his controversial comments against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He has since been granted bail.Pawar said currently the country’s highest number of Covid cases are coming from Kerala. “After some festival celebrations, cases have increased there. We have upcoming festivities such as Dahi handi, Ganesh utsav, Navratri and Diwali, which are celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm. If a mass gathering happens or Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed, then Covid cases will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ajit-pawar-accuses-centre-of-double-standards-says-yatras-could-lead-to-spike-in-covid-cases-101630253320255.html

A complaint was lodged by Nandkishor Kantilal Verma (41), on Friday, and a case was registered in the early hours of Saturday. The plan to do this was found to have been hatched by Verma’s friend who allegedly pretended to have gotten kidnapped along with him. The arrested men were identified as Vyas Gulab Yadav (34), Bhaiyasaheb Vitthal More , Kirankumar Nayar (31), Maruti Ashokrao Solanke (30), Umesh Arun Ubale (24), Ashok Jagannath Sawant (31), Suhas Suresh Thorat (32), Rohit Sambhaji Patil (23), according to the police. Yadav, More and Shyam Achyut Tormal (31), gathered Nayar, Solanke, Ubale, Sawant, Thorat, and Patil and executed the plan.On Thursday night, the complainant was with his friend, who is also an accused in the case, at Jambhulwadi road when the group of men arrived in a car. They introduce themselves as IT department officials and told him that they had come to conduct a raid at his house. The complainant got scared and followed their instructions, as the victim was asked to sit in the car. The men then took him to Swami Narayana temple and stopped the car on the service road. The men then produced weapons and asked him to give ₹75 lakh.“The men threatened them and then took them back near his house and took the cash and gold from his house. All this while Yadav was with him, pretending to have gotten kidnapped as well. After they had left, he consulted with his family members and people who had knowledge about the IT department and realised that he had been cheated. The next day he approached the police and lodged a complaint,” said Sushma Chavan, assistant commissioner of police, Swargate division of Pune police. “The main accused accompanied Verma to the police station to lodge a complaint and pretended that he did not know anything about the plan. However, during the course of the investigation his suspicious behaviour let us to believe that he was somehow involved. Upon Interrogation he revealed the plan in bits and parts,” said Rahul Patil, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2 Pune“The officials of Bhaarti Vidyapeeth police station traced them to Kolhapur and when they found the car and the men in it they tried to flee. Officials jumped on the car and broke the windshield to stop them from escaping. It is because of them that we got all of them and the car,” said Jagannath Kalaskar, senior police inspector of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.Yadav and the complainant are close friends which is why he knew about the latter’s financial situation. Verma ran a business along with three of his brothers and had refused to give money to Yadav when he had asked for it. Yadav had asked for ₹6 lakh from Verma in order to buy a shop.“Yadav wanted the money to buy and shop. Two of the accused are also booked in a case of murder registered in Beed. They wanted to use the money for legal fees and other proceedings in that case,” said DCP Patil.Vyas himself does not have a criminal history. However, he approached More who has multiple cases registered against him in the past. More gathered the others and planned for 20 days before stealing from Verma. A case under Sections 363, 364(a), 395, 394, 397, 387, and 506 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/8-arrested-for-taking-20-lakh-in-cash-30-tolas-of-gold-from-jeweller-after-posing-as-it-officials-101630249660070.html

On thorough examination, it was found that 3400 kg of Ganja was concealed into the truck. It was packed systematically in 141 gunny bags,” Amit Ghawate, zonal director, NCB (Bangalore Zone) said in a statement on Sunday.The bust comes at a time when Karnataka has been heavily cracking down on narcotics in its continued war on drugs that continues to seep into India’s IT capital and other large cities through intricate networks and innovative ways to avoid detection.In this case, the gunny bags were concealed under tarpaulin sheets and further covered by varieties of nursery saplings in huge quantities in the truck.“It was difficult to detect the contraband,” according to the statement.At least three people, who are suspected to be from Latur district in neighbouring Maharastra were arrested. Law enforcement authorities and other drug control agencies have been using one seizure to get information on more such operations to dismantle a large web of networks.“This operation was developed out of earlier operations, wherein seizure of a total quantity of 3992 kg of Ganja was affected resulting in the arrest of 16 persons and subsequentbusting of 3 separate Ganja trafficking networks,” according to the statement.There is also an alleged “kingpin” for this particular consignment who is based out of Maharashtra, the NCB said. The source of the contraband is the Andra Pradesh and Odisha border.The narcotics detection agency said that these drugs are peddled in various colleges, parties and other places through an elaborate ground network.“During the year 2020, a total quantity of 1971 kg of Ganja was seized, resulting in the arrest of 8 persons. This year by the end of August 2021, a total quantity of over 7500 kg Ganja has already been seized by the NCB, Bangalore zone, resulting in the arrest of 25 people. The two enforcement actions of the NCB and recent substantial seizures of Ganja clearly indicate that the Ganja traffickers have been desperate and taking the risk of carrying maximum quantity of the contraband at a time,” the agency statement noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ncb-sleuths-bust-interstate-drug-racket-3400-kilograms-of-marijuana-seized-101630248402466.html

29-08-2021||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar says Jan Ashirwad Yatras will impact Covid-19 numbers in state||Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar targeted the Centre on Sunday accusing them of violating the Covid-19 preventative measures imposed by them through the Jan Ashirwad Yatras organised by the newly inducted Union Cabinet ministers.“On one hand, the central government is asking us to take appropriate measures (to contain the spread of Covid-19) and on the other, it is asking its four newly-inducted ministers (from Maharashtra) to take out rallies and yatras. The gatherings in these rallies will impact the spread of Covid-19,” the deputy chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader also said that the effect of these rallies will be seen in the coming days if Covid-19 cases rise at the locations where these rallies were held. “In the next few days, we will see the effect of these rallies wherever they are taking place. If Covid-19 cases rise in the areas where the rallies are taking place, who will be responsible for it?” Ajit Pawar said.MVA’s criticism of Jan Ashirwad YatrasThe Maha Vikas Aghadi, which consists of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, earlier also expressed their criticism towards the Jan Ashirwad Yatras which were undertaken by Union Cabinet ministers who hail from the state.Shiv Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire last week claimed the Jan Ashirwad Rally in Aurangabad lasted past 10pm, flouting Covid-19 rules, according to a PTI report. The Sena mouthpiece Samaana said that these rallies were meant to ‘hypnotise’ people.It was also during one of these rallies that Union minister Narayan Rane last week allegedly said that he would "slap" Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, which led to the Union minister’s arrest and clashes between cadres of the BJP and the Shiv Sena in Mumbai and across several places in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-says-jan-ashirwad-yatras-will-impact-covid-19-numbers-in-state-101630244602014.html
29-08-2021||Bhopal||Two held in MP's Ujjain for forcing Muslim man to chant 'Jai Shri Ram': Police||A Muslim scrap dealer was allegedly threatened and forced to chant 'Jai Shri Ram' by two men at a village in Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain district, following which the police have arrested the accused duo, an official said on Sunday. The incident occurred on Saturday and two purported videos of it have gone viral on social media. Talking to reporters, R K Rai, Sub Divisional Officer of Police (SDOP), Mahidpur, said, "The incident happened on Saturday when scrap dealer Abdul Rasheed, a resident of Mahidpur town who has been doing this business here for a long time, went to Sikli village under Jharda police station area to collect some scrap in his mini truck." However, Rasheed was forced to leave the village and also threatened against doing his scrap business in the area. When he left the village, two men intercepted him at Pipliya Dhuma, manhandled him and forced him to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. The man somehow got out from there after giving in to their demand, he said. Jharda police station in-charge Vikram Singh Ivne said that an offence was registered against the two accused, identified as Kamal Singh (22) and Ishwar Singh (27), for disturbing communal harmony, and they were arrested. The duo was booked under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion), 505 (2) (public mischief), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), among others. Meanwhile, two videos of this incident went viral on social media, which drew the ire of several netizens. In one purported video, the two men were seen throwing scrap from the victim's four-wheeler and asking him not to enter the village again, while another video shows them threatening and forcing him to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. It shows them asking him how he dared to enter their village and the victim chanting the slogan as told by the accused. Reacting to the incident, Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath said that similar incidents had earlier occurred in Indore and Dewas in the state. "Has it been happening under a specific agenda? The government is watching everything as a mute spectator. An atmosphere of anarchy is being created in the entire state and the law is being mocked," he said while demanding a strict action against the accused who are "disturbing peace" in the state. Minister for Medical Education Vishvas Sarang said the state government was taking strict action in all such incidents. "We are committed to taking action and preventing such incidents. But the questions remain as to why such videos are being made viral from the social media department of Congress. Whether the Congress is behind making such videos and spreading them?" he said. It is a matter of investigation whether these incidents are planned, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/police-arrest-2-in-ujjain-mp-for-forcing-muslim-man-to-chant-jai-shri-ram-101630243710438.html

Recently, she claimed that Congress completely lost the digital war to BJP and the TMC is going to fight the BJP digitally.On Sunday afternoon, Dev distributed TMC flags to all the newly joined members and asked them to display them in front of their houses.“BJP spreads lies in a cleverly presentable manner that attracts common people which Congress did not realise. We are going to make our own IT setup so strong that we will highlight the lies of the BJP before common people using digital media. This is the need of the hour and we are going to train each and every member of the Trinamool Congress on how to stay relevant on social media. We’ll constantly discuss BJP’s lies and our party members will counter the BJP in their own language,” She said.Her father and former Union minister Santosh Mohan Dev died in 2017, he was a Congress leader. On Sunday, during the TMC event, Dev displayed her father’s portrait and also paid floral tribute to him before her speech.“At one point, Mamata Banerjee left the Congress party but she did not forget the ideology. I have already said that my father’s principles are always with me and I haven’t compromised those. He is my political guru also and I will always carry his legacy wherever I am.”Regarding her future plans, Sushmita Dev said that the central committee of the Trinamool Congress Party is targeting the upcoming assembly election in Tripura and she is going to play a vital role in strengthening TMC in that state. But their ultimate goal is to dethrone the BJP in the centre.“Congress party lost elections to BJP in almost all the states but BJP failed to cross the Trinamool hurdle in West Bengal. Whoever likes to take a stand against BJP is welcome to our party now. Hundreds of people from various parts of the northeast have already called us and expressed their desire to join the Trinamool Congress Party. We are going to fight hard in Tripura but our ultimate goal is to dethrone the BJP from the centre,” she said.Along with the young brigade, some senior Congress leaders who were part of Sushmita Dev’s father’s team in the Congress party, also joined Trinamool Congress on Sunday.Buru Sen, a 64-year-old Congress worker said, “Our lives and political careers have always been about Congress party. In the toughest moments, we did not leave the party but today, I have finally decided to join Trinamool Congress. The present Congress party is biased on issues like Barak Valley and Brahmaputra Valley. They joined hands with a communal party like the AIUDF and deprived many genuine Congress workers.”Sushmita Dev criticised the Congress for joining hands with the AIUDF to win the election in Assam. “Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, at one point, made a written resolution that at any circumstances, Congress will not join hands with communal forces like the BJP and the AIUDF. Now, after the election is over, they are talking about dissolving the alliance. But no Congress worker can say that their party will never join hands with the AIUDF again during any election.”Sushmita also informed that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and National general secretary of the All India Trinamool Congress Party, Abhishek Banerjee, along with some other leaders of the party are going to visit Barak Valley soon. She left for Kolkata to meet Abhishek Banerjee and other party leaders after the joining event on Sunday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-500-congress-workers-join-tmc-in-assam-101630244202207.html

On a short trip to Siliguri to meet the family of late former Assam legislator Aloke Ghosh, Sarma said, “West Bengal chief minister’s entry in Assam and Tripura will only help the BJP. Wherever she goes and does politics, she will divide the votes of Congress and other parties and help the BJP. If she comes to Assam, we will give her a red carpet welcome.” Asked whether Sushmita Dev, the former Silchar MP who recently joined the TMC, would pose a challenge to the BJP in Assam, Sarma said, “She is known to people in one district only. She will divide Congress votes.” Commenting on post-poll violence in Bengal, he said, “The assembly elections were closely contested both in Assam and West Bengal. The fact is that not a single stone was thrown at any house in Assam. But here, the Calcutta high court had to instruct the CBI to investigate. This speaks volumes.” “There are only 12 Bengali Hindu people in the detention camps in Assam and the process is on to give them relief,” said Sarma when asked about detention camps set up during enforcement of the National Register of Citizens in his state. “There will be no cases against the Gorkhas in Assam. We have decided to drop all cases against them in the foreigners’ tribunals. We have also given the Gorkhas protected class status even in tribal belts and community blocks,” said Sarma. On August 4, the Assam cabinet decided not to prosecute members of the Gorkha community. The decision was welcomed by Gorkhas who have a sizeable presence in Bengal’s Darjeeling district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-give-mamata-banerjee-red-carpet-welcome-assam-cm-101630235561975.html

29-08-2021||Pune||Yourspace: Punekars give thumbs up to eco-friendly Ganesh festival||With the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) banning the sale of idols on roadsides, residents are increasingly resorting to making their own Ganesh idol out of shadu mati, a type of clay. These idols are eco-friendly and do not pollute during immersion. There will also be no processions this year due to the Covid pandemic. Activists believe even sound pollution will reduce as a result. Should this be di rigueur even after the pandemic? Punekars share their views...Festivals, political events should be held in eco-friendly mannerI welcome the state government’s decision to celebrate the Ganesh festival as per guidelines due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Even otherwise, all festivals should be celebrated in an eco-friendly manner and the government should frame and implement such norms from time to time. The same should apply to political functions as well.Prakash NaharI support government’s decision on restriction due to pandemicPune is the land of origin of the Ganesh festival. However, the festival has lost its charm over the last few years as people make it commercial. We experience noise pollution and traffic problem during the festival. Therefore, I support the government’s decision to restrict the event and celebrate it in a more eco-friendly manner. Government should also set a code of conduct during celebrations of all festivals in public places.Sushas KulkarniPrecaution is still necessaryI like to celebrate Ganesh festival in a simple manner. It is a noble way of celebrating any festival, not only the Ganesh festival. I support the government’s decision on the background of the Covid-19 situation. We will have to take precautions now amid the possibility of a third wave. A festival is celebrated every year, but human life is precious.Sunil DayalLearn from past experienceFrom last year’s experience, my family has decided to celebrate the Ganesh festival in a simple way. There is a need for restrictions as people do not behave responsibly if the restrictions are eased. People haven’t learnt from the first and second waves of Covid-19.Nikeet DesmukhCelebrate festivals responsibly amid pandemicGanesh festival spreads happiness, so we should behave responsibly due to the Covid pandemic and rise in cases in the city. Many people indeed depend on such festivals for livelihood, but life is precious. Even if the government implements strict restrictions we should behave responsibly only then we can keep ourselves and others safe from the virus.Abhijeet WaghmareGovt should not impose restrictions during festivalsThe government has stipulated simple, unostentatious celebrations, without crowds and strictly Covid-19 protocols during the ten days which mark the state’s biggest public festival in which people from all communities participate. Government should not impose strict restrictions on festivals. Festivals of any religion are an expression of joy and happiness, togetherness, devotion. This year, we should be allowed to celebrate this festival in a big way.Vikrant JadhavCelebrate festivals without harming natureWe can celebrate all festivals without harming nature and even people in our surroundings. There are a lot of festivals which various communities celebrate for expressing love. Last year, we had celebrated all festivals with simplicity. There was no big celebration. We should follow the same thing this year also. It is good for individuals as well as for society.Nitin DeshpandeFestivals should be celebrated with family and friendsLast month, many people lost their lives due to heavy rains. We should not forget that. All festivals should be celebrated with our family and avoid public gatherings and functions. This year we should be more cautious and behave in a manner that will be safe for us and the people in our surroundings.Jyoti NikamMany people depend on such festivals for livelihoodFestivals provide employment opportunities for many. In a pandemic situation, when people have lost their jobs, the government should not put strict restrictions on the festivals.

They are under tremendous pressure for the last one and a half years. Festival is one of the reasons which will put a smile on the faces of people. We should celebrate the Ganesh festival in a big way by following three basic rules to wear a face mask, follow social distancing norms and sanitise hands as often as possible when one is out in public places.

29-08-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Finding my ‘voice’ to echo sentiments of a nation - Afghanistan||The week has been dominated by news from Afghanistan. Whatever is happening there, the images that are being made public are nothing short of heartbreaking. No wonder, most of the stories that are written about Afghanistan follow the same ethos, as the land has been witness to some conflict or the other since the past many decades. And the book ‘The Kite Runner’ is no exception.Khaled Hosseini’s book is already a phenomenon and I am sure that most of you must have read it. It is a powerful story of friendship, betrayal and redemption set mostly in Afghanistan. I had read the book years ago when it was recently published. And I remember being blown away, not just with the story, but the way the story blended with the political theatre in Afghanistan.We had travelled to Bengaluru for a play and the director of the play – Akarsh Khurana – bought a book at the book store to the theatre premises. It was a play based on ‘The Kite Runner’. I was immediately intrigued, as I did not know how the story would have translated on stage. I had seen the film which released in 2007, directed by Marc Forster, and that was one of the first screenplays I had read in my life. It was possible for the world of the book to be set up in the film, but I did not know how that could be set up on stage. Since we had a few hours before our show, I started reading it.The script by Matthew Spangler was engaging and I finished reading it in one go. One thing I noticed was that the play had followed the pattern of the protagonist being the narrator of the story. And because of that, the protagonist had a sizeable chunk of the lines and most of them were monologues. Akarsh asked me how I found the play and I told him that it will take a really good director to do justice to this script.A few months later I received a text from Akarsh telling me that he intended to direct the play and asked if I would like to play the protagonist – Amir. This made me extremely happy and afraid at the same time. Happy, because I had an opportunity to play the lead of one of the most coveted books of all time. And afraid because, I had read the script and I knew what a big responsibility it was! Not to mention the fact that while I could speak and converse in English, this was a completely different ball-game.I took my time to answer and it reached a level where Akarsh playfully threatened to end our friendship if I didn’t say yes. I knew that the rehearsals would be intense, in fact I wanted them to be so. I also knew that I would have to relocate to Mumbai for a few months for the rehearsals and the shows. I had just completed the shoot of my film and it had been a grueling few months and I would have liked to unwind, but I realised that this was too good an experience to pass up. I shifted to Mumbai and began rehearsing.It all started at the basics. There are many English words that I had read before, even written sometimes. But, I had never used them while speaking. It was the first time I was pronouncing them and realised that I had been pronounced them wrongly in my head all this while. It was a 65-pager script and I was on stage all the time. My character had at least 30 to 35 pages of dialogue. Memorising it became another task. While I have directed plays where actors had a lot of dialogue, this was a new experience! Akarsh stressed on movements while we were memorising lines so that both – the movements and the dialogue – become a part of our muscle memory.While that was going on, I was struggling to find the tone of the character. The journey of the character was from a 12-year old to the mid-20s to early 40s. And I was supposed to play all ages! The play started with my character’s monologue, and that was about an extremely traumatic incident. Akarsh was telling me to not play it that way and to narrate it like I would to a bunch of friends at a bar. While I understood what he was saying, I wasn’t able to implement that and it was getting frustrating for me.One day, I requested Akarsh for some one-on-one time. We spoke at length and while we were speaking casually, he asked me to start with my monologue. And just like that I had found the tone!With that in hand, rehearsals resumed in full swing. And a few days later, our opening date was decided! More on that, next week..Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-finding-my-voice-to-echo-sentiments-of-a-nation-afghanistan-101630233820778.html

29-08-2021||Patna||Mined sand valued at ₹179 cr goes missing in Bihar||A big mining scam has surfaced in Bihar’s Rohtas district with at least 52.7 million cubic feet (cft) sand, valued at ₹179 crore, disappearing from the mining department’s stock within three months between May and July this year, officials aware of the developments said.In the first week of August, the mining department accused mining contractor Aditya Multicom Private Limited (AMPL) of stealing the sand and registered criminal cases for theft and instituted proceedings for recovery of the amount from the company.The AMPL has responded by alleging that the department had cancelled its license for stocking the sand for sale in off season and seized the stored sand in April and the officials in custody of the seized sand were responsible for the theft. It has approached the Patna high court over the matter. The mining department officials didn’t respond to this charge.The mining department in 2015 awarded AMPL 5-year license for mining of sand from Sone river in Aurangabad and Rohtas districts beginning January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. The contract to the company was extended for one year up to December 31, 2020 and later up to September 30, 2021.The AMPL surrendered its mining license in the last week of April, 2021 alleging it was suffering huge losses due to illegal sand mining which could not be stopped despite several letters to district and state officials.The AMPL also had another related licence to store sand at 17 different points in Rohtas district to sell in off season. This is known as K-License and it was valid up to December 31, 2021.On May 1, AMPL’s K-License was suspended by the department till verification of the stock was done. The sub divisional magistrates of Dehri and Bikramganj, and assistant director mining Rohtas verified the stocks and found 48.3 million cft sand was stored at 17 points maintained by the company.The mining department later cancelled the firm’s K-License in the first week of July, alleging the company had violated storage rules.Later in the same month, the department’s project management unit (PMU) claimed that the total quantity of sand stored at the 17 points was 57.6 million cft, and only 4.927 million cft of sand was actually found at the storage sites on an inspection done around July 20. Following this, cases were filed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Bihar mining minerals rules, 2019 against AMPL in the first week of August, assistant director mining, Gopal Kumar said.The AMPL has questioned the department’s findings citing differences in the quantity of sand mentioned by the department in two different accounts. The company also claimed that since the mining department was the custodian of the stored sand after the company’s K-License was suspended and later cancelled, it should therefore be held accountable for the missing quantities.The company also claimed that it had paid the royalty for mining settlement and the K-License in advance but was deprived from selling the sand.The CPI-ML Kaimur district secretary and environment activist Vijay Yadav said that the officials under whose watch such huge theft, which in any case could not have been committed in a day or a week, should also be held responsible. Yadav has requested the Patna high court to take cognisance of the matter so that the racket ruining public exchequer, rivers and ecosystem in the region is exposed.In July this year, Aurangabad superintendent of police (SP), deputy superintendent of police (DySPs) of Aurangabad and Dehri and the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Dehri were among the 17 top officials suspended by the state government for their alleged involvement in illegal sand mining.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/mined-sand-valued-at-rs-179-cr-goes-missing-in-bihar-101630230640121.html

PM Modi’s praise for the city came while he was talking about the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the 80th episode of his Mann Ki Baat radio address.Also Read | Indore becomes India's first 'Water Plus' city. Here's why it matters“Whenever we talk about Swachh Bharat, Indore’s name automatically comes up. This is because the city has created a unique identity for itself when it comes to cleanliness and people of Indore deserve applause for this. Indore has topped Swachh Bharat rankings for many years now. But people have now decided that they are not merely content with the ranking. They want to move forward and achieve something new,” he said.Mann Ki Baat Highlights: Sanskrit strengthens cultural ties, says PM ModiResidents have made up their mind to keep Indore a Water Plus city, PM Modi further said. “Such a city is one where no sewage is released into a public water source without treatment. Citizens have themselves come forward to link drains in their houses to sewage lines and have also carried out the Swachhata Mission. Because of this, the volume of sewage water mixing into the waters of rivers Saraswati and Kanh has vastly reduced. This improvement is visible as well,” the Prime Minister explained.Also Read | PM Modi hails India's 'Yuva Shakti' in 80th episode of Mann Ki BaatAt a time when the nation is celebrating the Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav, we all should take a resolve to not let the cleanliness mission weaken, he added. “The more Water Plus cities we have in the country, the more beneficial it will be to us,” PM Modi remarked.Indore, the largest city and commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, was, on August 11, declared as the first Water Plus city in India by the Union government under the Swachh Survekshan 2021. To earn such a distinction, a city needs to fulfil three criteria: dirty water from it should not enter a river or drain, all public toilets there should be cleaned and connected to sewage lines, and 30 per cent of its sewage water should be recycled and reused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/on-mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-lauds-indore-for-becoming-india-s-first-water-plus-city-101630219705566.html

29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Only 16 takers for 76 leftover EWS seats in Chandigarh’s schools||After the UT education department recently issued a notice for leftover 76 vacant seats reserved for EWS students in 18 private unaided schools of the city, the education department has received only 16 responses.The entries were opened between August 16 and 22 and seats could be applied through Google forms. Confirming this, officials of the district education officer (DEO)’s office in Sector 19 said, “The demand for these seats depends on the schools where the vacancies have been announced. People tend to apply to more popular schools while those who don’t get admission there end up joining government schools.”Officials added that a similar trend was also seen in leftover seats in the EWS admissions in 2020: 74 seats were vacant in nine schools of the city, however, only around 20 applications were received at the time.UT director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We had announced these admissions through various mediums to ensure people were aware of them. We have closed the admissions for now and won’t be extending the last date to apply.”Brar added that he will also review whether people were facing difficulties applying or whether they were facing any problems from the school’s side.Director of Strawberry Fields High School in Sector 26, Atul Khanna, said, “Since the session for entry level classes has started already, it is possible that kids are already enrolled in school or they were not aware that another session of admissions had been announced. Once admissions for entry level classes for the new session starts, people will start applying again.”While there are no vacant EWS seats at his school, Khanna said that they enrol around 40 kids under the EWS category every year for which the school directly receives between 200-300 applications.In private unaided and recognised schools, 25% seats are reserved for EWS students under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For EWS admission, the annual income of the family needs to be less than ₹1.5 lakh and an income certificate issued by the administration has to be provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-16-takers-for-76-leftover-ews-seats-in-chandigarh-s-schools-101630186357315.html

This was discussed in a meeting of a varsity panel on August 27 that was attended by dean university instructions (DUI), dean student welfare (DSW) and other officials.If the situation allows, the campus will eventually be thrown open for other students in a phased manner. The final call is yet to be taken.The UT administration had allowed the reopening of educational institutes in the city from August with a rider that all teaching and non-teaching staff, besides students, should have received at least one dose of vaccination, minimum two weeks prior.“Number of students in exit classes is higher and the plan is to allow those with lab work and other project work on campus first,” said a university official, on the condition of anonymity.During the meeting, it was also discussed that PU cannot accommodate all the students in hostels given the Covid situation and data will be collected on the matter. Meanwhile, student bodies have been demanding the reopening of campus for the last 15 days; a few of them are on an indefinite strike outside the vice-chancellor’s office.UT colleges to reopen for more studentsMany colleges in UT are planning to allow more students to attend physical classes from September.

29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Kaun si qatil, chitti roohan de||Paradoxes of existence, complexities of interaction, parallel value systems and a conflict of interests can bedevil spaces shared by humanity with wild creatures. Cremation grounds are appointed with towering trees which support avian life and attendant biodiversity even as resident wild creatures witness the repetition of grieving human rituals. Birds breed in cremation ground trees and new lives flower even as the logs below greedily hiss and crackle, flames devour spent flesh, and rage at those hard bones that stubbornly stage their last stand against the inevitability of ashes. We have glimpsed peacock and crows foraging in the remains of a pyre in late evening or at dawn when all is morosely quiet and lukewarm in the rows of ash beds.At the cremation ground of village Shankarpura in Punjab’s Batala tehsil, this accommodation of death and birth spanning many years suffered a breakdown. A looming Philkhan tree sporting a fast-growing, widening canopy and situated in the ground’s centre had been occupied by Paddy egrets and Little cormorants. Over time, the canopy grew crowded with bird apartments and cast a shadow on the pyre spots below. That had genuine implications for mourners. Ten days back, Shankarpura bore three deaths in a day leading to a surge of mourners. That became the catalyst for a breakdown of human-bird coexistence. “The birds’ poop and overpowering stink caused severe discomfort to mourners and their relatives who had come from far and near. It affected the village’s reputation as mourners had to stand under the tree with poop falling on them. The demand from villagers to prune the tree gathered pace after those three back-to-back cremations. So, the village’s gurdwara committee took the decision to prune and put an end to the birds’ occupation,” Sawinder Singh, husband of Shankarpura’s sarpanch, Davinder Kaur, told this writer.The effect on the other side, the birth givers, was catastrophic. “An estimated 100 egrets and eight cormorants lost their homes after the drastic pruning. Chicks and eggs were destroyed. A squirrel pup lay dead. Fortunately, the cremation ground is surrounded by paddy fields where some homeless chicks secured refuge from dogs. The villagers should have waited for the breeding season to end before hacking,” Amit Sharma, an environmentalist and banker posted at Shankarpura told this writer after having witnessed the pruning. Bird carcasses, egg shells, struggling chicks, logs and feathers drifting in the wind like ashes bore grim testimony to the apocalypse. The biodiversity scene was now more in harmony with simmering pyres. Tearless egrets perched on piles of logs looked down at their smothered dead chicks and wasted eggs. The tree’s amputated limbs had come to signify a short-lived transition from ‘womb to tomb’ for the avian progeny. The spectacle was reminiscent of shanties razed by bulldozers, with melancholic children retrieving toys and ragged text books from home’s rubble.Wise to prevalent social, religious and cultural values, Sharma reached out to the tree hackers in a creative manner. He chose not to hector them with ‘save our planet’ sermons. “I addressed them in their cultural idiom. I said, you people believe the departed human spirit is associated with shades of white --- the ‘chitti rooh’. These white egrets are actually the ‘rooh’ of your elders who have departed from this world and have taken the form of birds. They make homes on trees of the cremation ground as they do not want to leave your company. You can daily seek the blessings of your departed elders by tolerating these birds instead of driving them away. This had a positive effect and they expressed remorse at the destruction of nests, saying they were ignorant and had not realised pruning would have such consequences for breeding birds. I fervently hope they will not hack nesting trees again,” said Sharma.The writer can reached at vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-kaun-si-qatil-chitti-roohan-de-101630185638209.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column | It’s a brave, new world for Generation C||With schools starting to reopen, partially and in a phased manner, first timers will experience the physical aspects of schooling in a different modus. This generation will be the first to have never known the joys of a mask-free childhood, sitting in classrooms and auditoriums crammed with hundreds of students, the fun of sharing a tiffin with unsanitised hands, and the appreciative smile on an unmasked teacher’s face. Those conceived or born during the pandemic have been given the name ‘coronials’, toddlers who are already taking classes on zoom are being called ‘baby-zoomers’ and then there are the ‘quaran-teens’, the teenagers resigned to spend their college life in a room next to their parent’s. Clearly, Generation C will be defined by the traits and behaviour changes brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. The early years of a child’s life are very important for his or her health and mental development and several studies are now suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic would have a huge role in defining our next generation. Children are growing up under the watchful eye of their parents and extended family and are mirroring their elders’ thoughts and personalities. They are constantly being piloted to safe and clean surrounding, told to their masks up, deprived of the joy of free touch and asked to avoid close proximity with people, even friends. At this vulnerable age, they are likely to become germophobes, overprotected individuals with obsessions and compulsions and may even imbibe a socially distant mindset. Some recent studies have found that the pandemic may have a positive impact as well.Generation C will know how to thrive in adversity, will develop techno-dexterous abilities, a heightened sense of self-awareness and give priority to wellbeing and sustainability. Jason Dorcey, president, Centre for Generational Kinetics, says , “The pandemic is likely to lead to structural changes and new norms that the next generation could ultimately benefit from including shifts in online learning, physical work spaces, contactless payments, a vaccine and other new technology.” Will they pay for these advantages with a lost childhood? The new generation will miss out on the joys of living without barriers and restraints, having soiled hands and clothes, making new friends in public parks, and raising their uncovered faces to wind and rain. The phrase ‘young wild and free’ is probably not as applicable in the post-Covid age as the young can no longer be wild and free anymore.

29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays | Those uneasy rendezvous after lockdown||The pandemic has shown us many faces, and many facets of life. People have discovered and rediscovered aspects of their persona that they hardly knew existed.The prolonged lockdown had till now obviated the possibility of meeting friends and socialising. But with the gradual lowering of guard, old friends and family members are getting together once more, often with quaint results.The most noticeable change in some personalities that the lockdown months have brought about is the newly acquired couldn’t-care-less attitude about their looks. Many friends have emerged greyer, and perhaps wiser, from the extended period of being home bound. They have actually stopped denting and painting their exteriors, so to say! Perhaps the philosophical nature of life in present times, where the true meaning of it has come closer home, has precluded the need to brush up one’s façade. Proprietors of beauty salons are probably not too happy about this trend, but they will anyway have a large number of takers, such being the variegated nature of society.Some others have actually found it difficult to meet real people, believe it or not, having spent 15 months or more ‘zooming’ before a screen. Special courses have actually been launched in the United States of America, for instance, on how people should begin to socialise again, and what social skills they would need to equip themselves with. In India, we seem to not need such courses, by and large, especially since we have been meeting the maids and Zomato/Swiggy chaps et al, almost throughout this phase.A viral whatsapp video actually had as its main character a man who would not accept people in real life beyond a point, and he would try to search for a non-existent mute button, to shut them up! That is a gross exaggeration of course, but millions who have found it difficult to re-adapt themselves to the real world. Children especially have needed weaning off from too much screen time. Carrying out real time conversations has never been their forte,and will never be, unless their virtual world fades a bit into the background.And we Indians have a love hate relationship with masks. We wear them because we’re supposed to but we drop them at the drop of a hat. When friends meet up after a long separation, they tend to keep their masks on for about 10 minutes. Then their tea or coffee or beer arrives. And that’s that. No masks are to be seen after that. Hugs and cuddles also become an integral part of the proceedings, once general levels of wariness go for a toss.Masked conversations are actually just not fulfilling enough. People often cannot hear muffled words with clarity. The smile or scowl are blatantly missing too. Non-verbal communication is said to be a major part of all forms of direct communication but masks hijack most of our facial expressions.Several spouses have become more liberal during this period, when it comes to “allowing” their better or worse halves to hob-nob with others. By being closeted together for over a year they have had enough of each other, several times over! Absence makes the heart grow fonder, of course, and being cooped up together in lockdown has bred anything but fondness, in most cases! Be that as it may, many couples have learned to respect each other’s space, quite literally.Human beings are, after all, social beings. Our mental health improves when we confabulate with others. Whenever the virus numbers go up again, and I truly hope that they do not, I am sure that prudence will prevail over daredevilry and most masks will be up again. But for now, old pals and gals are gathering for coffee after coffee, akin to pre-pandemic times.Working from home has led to the emergence of a new breed of artists, chefs, musicians, writers, photographers and the like. Not all of them are supremely talented, shall we say, and some of them may be quite insufferable, but at least the general levels of creativity have gone up.One never knows, the world might actually have become a better place, while we were locked down!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-those-uneasy-rendezvous-after-lockdown-101630184920355.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||NGOs raise doubts over Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project||Members of various NGOs under the banner of Public Action Committee for Sutlej and Mattewara staged a silent protest on Saturday at Jamalpur bridge near Central Jail on Tajpur Road, under their ongoing campaign to stop the pollution of the Buddha Nullah and Sutlej river. They also raised their doubts over the allegedly ill-planned Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project.Members of NGOs including Naroa Punjab Manch, Vigilant Citizens Forum, Punjabi Bhasha Pasar Bhaichara also highlighted the delay in setting up the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) to treat dyeing industry waste, which is resulting in release of effluents into the nullah. Colonel CM Lakhanpal (retired) and Jaskirat Singh said the existing 48 mld STP at Jamalpur has developed snag due to inflow of industrial waste and now again, the authorities have a contingency plan to treat it in the new 225 mld STP being established at Jamalpur. Colonel Lakhanpal said, “The problem of waste water in Ludhiana has reached horrendous proportions. The government has spent hundreds of crores in the name of cleaning the Buddha Nullah, but the problem has only increased over the years. Ministers and bureaucrats see it as nothing more than a cash cow and there is very little transparency. “Mohinder Singh Sekhon from Punjabi Bhasha Pasar Bhaichara said that there are many scattered industries in the city which are not connected to the clusters of these CETPs. He added that the government should formulate a strict policy to link them to the CETP clusters or shut them down. They should not be allowed to discharge their industrial effluent into the municipal sewer lines, he added.The protesters also slammed the administration for misleading the public by claiming that releasing fresh water into the nullah has reduced the pollution level by 80%. They protesters also demanded that the government rollback the decision to establish an industrial park on the banks of Sutlej river in Mattewara. Industrialist Ranjodh Singh said, “The government wants to shift the textile and dyeing industry of the city to the banks of the Sutlej near Mattewara forest, which will add to pollution in the already polluted river which is a source of drinking water for southern Punjab and many districts of Rajasthan. The proposal should be scrapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngos-raise-doubts-over-buddha-nullah-rejuvenation-project-101630184919115.html

The rotund jar contained a magical cream, cheekily named Afghan Snow.

The Afghan Snow was a part of most Indian homes until the 70s. The brand had also sponsored early Miss India contests and leading yesteryear star Devika Rani lent her face for its promotion. As the story goes, the Afghan king Mohammed Zahir Shah had visited united India in 1919 and a young Indian entrepreneur presented him a hamper of cosmetics, the pearly white cream included. He asked the king if he could name it Afghan Snow and permission was generously granted. Indeed, snow in Afghanistan is a sight to behold. Actor Tisca Chopra, who spent a portion of her youth in Kabul, where her father was the principal of a school says one of her most vivid memories was waking up to four feet of snow on the hill that was home to them. She too expressed concern for the Afghan women and children with the US beating a hasty retreat leaving the country in ravage and fear.Strange that remembrance and fragrance should return at a time when both Afghan Snow and Afghanistan that inspired its name are struggling for survival.Growing up with KabuliwalaNot just phantom perfumes, the chant ‘Kabuliwala aaya pista badam laaya’ also rings in the ears. It was in 1961, at the city’s lone Kiran Cinema that one made a new on-screen friend, a ‘Kabuliwala’ named Rehmat. One has never seen the like of him in the fledgling city of Chandigarh. One longed to go to Kolkata in the hope that one would find him there in his colourful clothes walking the streets, singing and dancing with children and giving them pistachios, almonds and raisins. At six, one envied little Mini who could befriend such a large-hearted soul who carried a bag brimming with goodies and could summon fairies, elves and animal friends from the forests by just swinging his magical stick.Rabindranath Tagore’s classic Bangla story ‘Kabuliwala’, penned in 1892 when the subcontinent was a British colony explores human relationships. The prominent message, however, was that human relationships transcend differences in caste, creed, race, age and culture. In Bengal, every child grew up knowing this story as it was a prescribed text in schools. However, it was Bimal Roy’s film that brought the fascinating story to the children in north India and Pakistan. The story continues to thrall 129 years after it was written. The film was empathetically directed by Hemen Gupta, who was part of the Indian National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose, and includes a memorable music score by Hemant Kumar. Two of Hemant’s songs that transcend the test of time are Ae mere pyare watan and Ganga aaye kahan se.Kumkum is doing fineThe sequel to Tagore’s Kabuliwala came from across the border by well-known Urdu writer Zahida Hina. She wrote the sequel, ‘Kumkum Theek-Thak Hai’ (Kumukum Is Doing Fine) after the 2001 US attack on Afghanistan, following 9/11. Now, who is Kumkum? Well, time has moved on and Mini of the Kabuliwala times is Kumkum’s grandmother. A doctor, she goes to Afghanistan as a volunteer and forms an empathetic bond with an injured Afghan militant. Penned as a letter to her grandmother in Kolkata, it is the revival of kindness and human warmth that had once been given to her grandmother by a Kabuliwala named Rehmat who saw in her shades of his daughter far away amid the Afghan snow. In this chain of literature, art and love, it is Kumkum who must have the last word as she writes to the Mini of yore: “You told me that Rehmat Baba had also a daughter your age who lived in Kabul. He didn’t have the money to get her photographed or perhaps in those days, there were no photographers in Kabul, so he had a print of her hand on a piece of paper, and used to keep it in his pocket, near his heart, just like papa used to keep my photo in his wallet. Your father, I mean my great-grandfather, had given some money to Rehmat Baba so that he could go back to Kabul and see his daughter, which made great-grandmother very angry. Nowadays, when I receive wounded, bleeding patients, shouting with pain or breathing their last, I sometimes ask myself, had you not eaten those almonds and pistachios from Rehmat Baba’s bag 70 years ago, had my great-grandfather not written his story, would I still be here in Kabul, in Kandahar, in Herat, in Helmund?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-a-whiff-of-afghan-snow-the-kabuliwala-s-call-101630184498469.html

Hours after Middukhera’s murder in Sector 71 of Mohali on August 7, the Davinder Bambiha gang had taken responsibility for the attack in a Facebook post. It claimed that Vicky was killed as he was allegedly acting as an “informer” for the Bishnoi gang.Mohali senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh said, “We spotted the i-20 car, used in the crime, crossing the Haryana border. We have got some vital clues and will be able to crack the case soon.”Another senior police officer, who is also investigating the case, said, “We have obtained the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage from many roadside dhabas on route to Ambala. In most of these, an i-20 car has been spotted speeding towards Uttar Pardesh. We have already sent teams to both Delhi and UP.”In the past three weeks, Mohali police have grilled three dreaded gangsters Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha, Aman Jaittu and Bhupi Rana but nothing substantial came to fore and the police have ruled out their role in the crime. Police have also questioned 55 other criminals associated with the Devinder Banbiha gang and others directly or indirectly involved or associated with other gangsters but without any success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-three-weeks-on-no-headway-in-middukhera-murder-case-101630184080726.html

The high court bench of justice GS Gill acted on the plea of Gurjeet Singh Johar and Charanbir Singh Sethi. They had approached high court in July 2021. The dream project of the previous Akali government, Mohali Junction was launched in 2009, with a deadline of December 2011. It was touted to be the first Busopolis project — a bus terminal with a commercial centre and hotel — in the region. However, nine years later, only the ISBT has become operational, leaving investors in the retail shops and office spaces disgruntled. In their complaint to the police, some of the investors alleged that they had been cheated of their money deposited with the company. The complainants had booked shops and offices in B and C towers of the project, and claimed to have paid 35% to 90% of the total cost of the retail space. As the developer failed to deliver the possession even after years, the complainants had sought refund of the money deposited with 18% interest. But, despite repeated assurances from the company, they had not received anything. In August 2018, the FIR was registered against six people, including firm chairman Gurjeet Singh Johar. The bench granted bail in view of the fact that challan has already been presented and they are senior citizens. But they have been directed to appear before trial court within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-junction-case-hc-grants-bail-to-two-including-chairman-of-firm-101630184078427.html

The window period is short to comment on what might have happened. Also, when a patient is not able to speak, it gets more complex.”Kumar informed that so far doctors had not revealed any possibility of sexual assault. “The woman has severe head injury and has undergone neuro-surgery. She has gained consciousness, but cannot speak. Doctors are hopeful that in 2-3 days, she will be able to talk,” said the ACP.The FIR was registered on August 27 under Section 307 and 34 of the IPC against an unknown person on the complaint of the victim’s brother, a resident of Manpura village in Solan district.“She commutes daily from home to work, taking an autorickshaw till Majri Chowk and from there either bus or another auto till Pinjore. From there, we used to pick her up,” he said.The victim’s sister said, “On August 26, she finished her shift and left the hospital at around 8:25pm. She hired an auto-rickshaw till Majri Chowk. We were chatting till the time she reached Nada Sahib gurdwara, and just within 4-5 minutes the incident happened.”She added: “Most likely, it is a case of an attack as her gold chain is missing. She must have tried to run after the snatcher and met with an accident.” The victim’s sister further said that some people were spreading misinformation that her sister was kidnapped. She denied having given any such statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nurse-found-injured-in-panchkula-two-days-on-no-arrests-made-yet-101630184077347.html
29-08-2021||Other||Pet dog bylaws finally notified in Mohali||Punjab local bodies department has finally notified pet-dog bylaws for Mohali, making it mandatory for residents to get their furry friends registered and follow other norms regarding their upkeep.The draft for the bylaws was first prepared in December 2013 following which the Mohali municipal corporation (MC) had invited objections within 30 days, but ever since, it had been hanging fire.Why pet registration is necessaryAs per a rough estimate, there are around 20,000 pet dogs in the city but none of them are registered, and thus kept without rules and regulations. Pet registration not just helps ensure the safety and well-being of a domesticated animal but also regulates how it interacts with the society and vice-versa. In November 2019, the Mohali court had awarded six-month jail to a woman found guilty of negligence after her pet dog bit a neighbour in April 2018. The court also imposed a fine of ₹1,500 on the convict, Minakshi, who stays on rent in Phase 10. Every year, around 2,000 dog bite cases are reported at the civil hospital, Phase-6, Mohali.Medical officer health (MOH) of MC, Mohali, Dr Tamana said, “We will start registration of pet dogs from September 10 and give residents a month to complete the formalities, failing which they will be penalised as per the rules.Know the bylawsA resident is allowed to keep only two pets dogs at home.Pet dog owners will have to pay a one-time registration fee of ₹100 and further, ₹100 as the annual renewal fee. For those who fail to get their pet dogs registered within the stipulated time (by October 10), a penalty of ₹100 will be charged for a month’s delay, ₹200 for a delay of two months. For delay of more than two months, the penalty is ₹500.According to the bylaws, if a pet dog is found loitering on the streets, the animal may be detained and a fine of ₹5,000 will be imposed on the owner, besides ₹500 per day for feed. If the pet dog is repeatedly found loitering, a fine of ₹10,000 will be imposed.On registration, MC will provide the owner with a metal badge engraved with the name and address of the owner. The owner will have to make the pet dog wear the badge at all times.A penalty of ₹50 a day will be imposed, if the dog owner does not keep a dangerous dog under control.A penalty of ₹2,000 will be imposed, if the owner does not provide information regarding rabid animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pet-dog-bylaws-finally-notified-in-mohali-101630183896750.html

Victims Pradeep Malik alias Bablu and his wife Babli Devi were cremated in Rohtak, while the body of his mother-in-law Roshni was consigned to flames in Sampla. The condition of the couple’s 17-year-old daughter is said to be critical. Rohtak police spokesman Sunny Loura said efforts to nab the assailants were on while refusing to share details.On Friday, Rohtak SP Rahul Sharma had said they received a PCR call that three bodies are lying inside a house in Vijay Nagar area. “It seems the attackers barged into property dealer Bablu’s house and fired shots at his family in which three were killed and one sustained injuries. Prima facie it appears the miscreants planned this gruesome incident over financial or property dispute,” he said.“Bablu’s brother’s family also stays in the same colony and were the ones to discover the bodies after breaking open the door of the house,” the SP added.“We are checking footages of the CCTV cameras installed near the victims’ house and registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959.

Those headed for the hills had their plans go haywire as they got stuck in a traffic jam, which extended to several kilometres, due to the blockade. The blockade here started around 2.30pm and was not lifted until about 7.15pm.A woman in her 30s, who had made a trip to Shimla to celebrate her birthday, was left disappointed, as she and her friends from Maharashtra got stuck in the jam. Similar was the status of others.ACP (traffic) Rakesh Guleria said, “Roads from Majri Chowk to Old Panchkula and then from Old Panchkula to Fun Republic remained packed. Apart from this, the highway was choked as tourists were not allowed to cross the Toll Plaza.”Heated arguments also broke out between farmers and travelers at some points.At 4:10pm, CP Panchkula tweeted a traffic advisory, “Surajpur toll plaza (Kalka-Zirakpur Highway) has been blocked by protesting farmers. This route has been diverted. All commuters are advised to avoid this route.”Panchkula police could be seen making announcements that those who wanted to go to Shimla could leave via Siswa road. “We are not sure for how long this jam will continue,” a policeman announced. Jams in Zirakpur, Dera Bassi tooMassive traffic jams were also witnessed in Zirakpur and Dera Bassi due the blockade. The entire traffic approaching the Patiala crossing was diverted to the road beneath the flyover, causing a bottleneck. This blockade also resulted in a jam on the Panchkula side.In anticipation of another group of farmers, the police also barricaded the Zirakpur-Lalru highway. In Ambala, farmers had blocked several spots, primarily the Shambhu toll (Ambala-Patiala border) and Milk Majra toll (Ambala-Yamunanagar border). The blockades were lifted following an appeal by farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni. Ambala DSP (HQ) Sultan Singh said the traffic was thrown open after farmers vacated their agitation sites and movement eased at around 7:30 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/commuters-hassled-as-agitated-farmers-block-chandimandir-toll-highways-for-over-4-hours-101630183417810.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||PSPCL moves to ‘scrap’ PPAs with Goindwal Sahib, Purulia power plants||The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has set in motion the process to ‘cancel’ power purchase agreements (PPAs) with GVK Group’s private thermal plant at Goindwal Sahib in the state and the one run by Damodar Valley Corporation at Purulia district in West Bengal by serving them with “repudiation notices”. The corporation will also issue notices to other Punjab-based private power plants, but not for scrapping the PPAs, it is learnt.The government has decided to “repudiate” the PPA with the Goindwal Sahib thermal plant as its per unit rate is as high as ₹10 even as power is available at ₹3 to ₹3.5 per unit from the national grid. Similar reason was cited in case of the Damodar Valley Corporation’s Raghunathpur plant in West Bengal’s Purulia district that had entered a PPA with the PSPCL. However, the government decided to serve a default notice on the Talwandi Sabo plant which it said was functional for 12 months in the last three years, which is less than the minimum requirement of 65%. For the Rajpura thermal plant, the government has decided to serve a notice for revisiting the PPA, saying the availability of its units was not guaranteed during the paddy sowing season. According to the notice, the plant will be asked to amend the PPA to ensure its 95% availability during the paddy season besides reducing the electricity rates as bank interest rates and corporate taxes have come down in the recent past. “With serving of notices, the government has acknowledged that the PPAs were faulty and against the interests of the state and its people. Now, it should punish the erring officials who entered into these agreements. A white paper should be brought in the next Vidhan Sabha session as promised by the chief minister,” said a senior corporation engineer. Except the Damodar Valley and GVK notices, no other communication is serious, he added. The decision to serve notices on the private power plants was taken by chief minister Amarinder Singh whom the PSPCL has forwarded a proposal in this regard. The CM had asked the corporation to scrap or revise the PPAs that are adversely affecting the consumers. PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said he has forwarded the file to the director (generation) to act as per the decision taken by the government. “I will comment once the process is completed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-moves-to-scrap-ppas-with-goindwal-sahib-purulia-power-plants-101630183296667.html

Addressing a function organised by newly-inducted leader Anil Joshi here, Sukhbjr said, “It is my life’s mission to make Amritsar an world-class city. We started on this mission during our previous tenure and achieved a lot but the development came to a stop during the Congress rule.

The blockade was lifted at 7.30 pm. The call to block highways was in response to a lathicharge by police on a group of farmers at Bastara toll plaza on NH 44 near Karnal. The police action drew sharp criticism with Opposition leaders slamming the state government.Members of different farm unions had assembled at the Bastara toll plaza as chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar chaired a state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting at a private hotel ahead of the upcoming local polls, people aware of the matter said.The police said Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which bans the assembly of five or more people, was imposed in the area, which made the farmers’ gathering “unlawful”. According to the police, they made repeated announcements to the farmers to disperse but they were adamant on moving towards the venue of the BJP meeting. All roads leading to the venue were heavily barricaded. The farmers said the police started beating the protesters without any provocation, injuring at least 10. “Many farmers were injured after police brutally lathicharged them without any provocation. Some even could be seen with blood all over their clothes,” Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (Charuni) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni said.The police, however, denied the charge. ADGP law and order Navdeep Virk released a video saying that the farmers had first attacked the police and hurled stones when the police tried to stop them at the toll plaza. “The police had to use mild force as four farmers and 10 police officials sustained injuries in the clash”, he added. Farmers agitating against the central farm laws have been staging protests near the public functions of the state’s ruling BJP- Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) combine in Haryana since last year. Later, Charuni said: “The police have released the farmers and we have decided to open the blockade but the next decision about the agitation will be taken during a meeting in Karnal on Monday.”Traffic on all major roads disrupted The movement of traffic remained affected on NH 44, Delhi-Chandigarh, Hisar-Ambala-Chandigarh, Kurukshetra-Pehowa-Patiala, Panipat-Rohtak, Kurukshetra-Kaithal, Karnal-Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra-Yamunanagar routes forcing the authorities to divert the vehicles on link roads. The Milk Majra toll plaza connecting Ambala with Yamunanagar and further with Uttar Pradesh was also blocked, while traffic movement was disrupted on Shambu border at Punjab-Haryana border too. Long queues of vehicles could be seen on all the highways and even on the link roads as people were seen struggling to reach their destinations. People also remained stranded in the traffic jams in villages as the police diverted the traffic on the link roads. “I remained stuck in the traffic for more than three hours and travelled 50km extra to return to my home”, said Praveen Kumar, a Karnal resident. BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said four farmers with serious injuries have been hospitalised at the civil hospital in Karnal and three of them are critical. Khattar said that nobody should create a hurdle in the programme of others. “They were allowed to raise their issue in a democratic way and peacefully. If they pelted police with stones and blocked roads the action was initiated by the police,” the CM said. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda condemned the lathicharge and tweeted: “The action on farmers at Karnal is undemocratic and inhuman. Everyone has the right to protest in a democracy. Governments are not run with fear of the bullet but by winning hearts.” ‘Crack the heads’ of farmers: Haryana official in a viral videoChandigarh A video showing a top district official in Haryana asking policemen to “crack the heads” of the farmers who try to cross the barricades has surfaced on social media. In the video, Karnal’s sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha is purportedly seen standing in front of a group of policemen and instructing them to not allow the farmers to cross the barricades. “You don’t need anyone’s direction, just crack their heads and thrash them hard if they try to cross the barricade,” he can be heard as saying in the video. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. htc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/angry-over-lathicharge-on-protesters-in-karnal-farmers-block-highways-in-haryana-for-nearly-5-hours-commuters-suffer-101630183117147.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Panel recommends separation of investigation and law & order wings in Chandigarh police||The one-member police reform commission, in a report submitted to UT administrator and Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore on Saturday, has recommended the separation of the investigation and law-and-order wings of Chandigarh police for better efficiency. The report stated that when the same personnel are assigned investigations and law- and-order duties, it has a cascading effect on the probe and leads to delays. People-friendly force and thanasThe panel, which was headed by KB Singh, a former IPS officer and former ADC to the Punjab governor, further recommended making the police force and thanas more people friendly. It stated that the number of police stations and subdivisions must be increased for better reach. Beat boxes must be made more effective and a major chunk of grievances must be resolved at the beat-box level so that people do not have to visit police stations. A new design and requisite infrastructure at the booth-level has also been proposed.The report says that in police stations, there should be a separate area where people can walk in and register their complaints. This should be under close-circuit television (CCTV) camera surveillance and there should be a dedicated receptionist to guide the visitors. “On walking into a police station, a person often feels lost. He doesn’t know where to file his complaint and who to go to. So, all police stations should get a reception area which has a dedicated receptionist to help the person,” said Singh adding that every complaint should first be registered here. This will also eliminate the chances of cops later saying that they did not get the complaint. On cop strengthThe report says the number of sanctioned strength of cops is adequate in Chandigarh and does not suggest any change in the current ratio of deployment of DANIPS cadre officials and local promoted officers. However, police need more ministerial staff. To increase promotional avenues to inspectors for the posts of DSPs, deputy commandant posts should be revived, it recommends. There are around 6,000 to 7,000 personnel in the Chandigarh police. Of this, 600-700 are in the traffic wing. There are other departments in the police, including law and order, operation cell, crime branch, economic offences wing, CID, PCR among other departments. Currently, the city is headed by a DGP and DIG along with two SSPs and two SPs, one ASP and 18 DSPs. One DSP works with the UT administration in the vigilance department. Traffic policeAs of traffic police, the report says CCTV coverage should be increased at lightpoints as even now, around 100 points are not covered. Booths for traffic cops should be developed as facilitation centres with facility of toilets etc. And these should be equipped with latest gadgets, it recommends. Women police stations, cyber crime and EOWThe commission has also recommended for five more police stations to be built in the city and a special thana for economic offences wing. Women police station should not have male cops posted, it says. The report lays special emphasis on dealing with cyber crime. A separate police station for the cyber cell, which is currently housed at the Sector 17 police station, should be in place. Domain experts should be hired as cyber crime is becoming challenging by the day, it says. Recruitment and trainingThe commission has asked for revising criterion for recruiting constables and assistant sub inspectors introducing curriculum during training to make them more compassionate and empathic. The report also lays emphasis on upgrading weaponry and adding more vehicles for transportation and patrolling. As of coordination with neighbouring police, it says there should be greater coordination from the SHO-level of bordering districts to SPs and then top-level officers at frequent intervals. The administrator, after receiving the report, expressed the confidence that implementation of the recommendations made by the commission will help make the Chandigarh Police a more responsive, robust and efficient force. The implementation of the report is to be done by the local administration in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/police-reforms-panel-recommends-separation-of-investigation-and-law-order-wings-in-chandigarh-101630182997837.html

Leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda in a statement said that farmers were canecharged by the police despite protesting at Bastara toll plaza which is a good 15 kilometers away from the spot where the BJP event was organised. “This shows the anti-farmer mindset of the state government,’’ Hooda said.

Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said that the brutal lathi charge by the police showed that BJP-JJP government was an enemy of the farmers. Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh said the BJP-led ML Khattar government has once again used brute force in a desperate bid to end the farmers’ stir against the draconian farm laws. “Khattar government-sponsored attack on farmers is not only unacceptable but outright condemnable,” said Amarinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/karnal-lathi-charge-opposition-slams-khattar-govt-101630182158271.html

Taking a dig at the farmer unions protesting against the Centre’s 3 agriculture laws, Sharma, who was in Ludhiana to attend a meeting of traders and industrialists, said though everyone has the right to protest no one can hurt or silence others. “They are taking law in their hands and are disturbing the law and order situation in Punjab. The protestors are attacking our party workers and trying to disrupt their functions at the behest of the Congress government,” he added. ‘Will provide cheaper, 24x7 power if voted to power’ Sharma said the BJP will provide electricity at cheaper rates round the clock to the industry, traders and households if voted to power in the state in the assembly elections. “The traders and industry suffered losses during the lockdown but the state government failed to provide any relaxation to them. We will waive fixed charges on electricity and property tax imposed by the Congress government. The professional tax imposed in the state is ‘Jajiya’ and it will be withdrawn by the BJP after coming to power,” he said addressing a press conference later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protesters-running-a-parallel-govt-in-punjab-bjp-state-chief-101630182041790.html

In a tweet, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra highlighted that 200 deaths have been caused in a year because of spurious liquor in Uttar Pradesh. “Those involved are openly trading in spurious liquor while attacking journalists and police but to no action.

Rizwan Raisuddin Prince from Samajwadi Party said that the state leadership of party has asked a delegation of SP leaders in Agra to visit the affected villages on Sunday where lives were lost due to spurious liquor. “The properties of those found involved should be attached and sold. The sale proceeds should be used to compensate the affected families. Time and again such loss of lives surfaces and thus requires a long-lasting solution to save precious lives,” said Rahul Chaturvedi from Chanakya Sena, a social organisation in Agra. ‘Support India’, a voluntary organisation, has called for a protest to be held at the district headquarters on September 1. “We will raise the issue of spurious liquor because it is often the poor, mostly residing in villages, who are the losers.

Does anyone remember who came second?” asked Pankaj Munjal, chairperson and managing director of Hero Cycles. Munjal was addressing industrialists, the majority whom were youngsters during a symposium on “strategies for growth” organised by the Chamber of Commercial and Industrial Undertaking (CICU). Expounding his point, Munjal said, “In this era of cut-throat competition where a minor laxity can cost one dear, it is the eye for detail and appearance of a finished product, which will determine long-term sustainability.” Munjal said risks and opportunity go hand-in-hand and it is the failures that have taught him the most important lessons in life. Heading a company that manufactures one of the most expensive bicycles in the world, (HNF Nicolai priced at 3000 Euros ( ₹2.6 lakh)), Munjal said he always believed in doing what he loved the most. Munjal said that with the bicycle sector growing globally, it was imperative for the company to shift globally and eye a bigger market. “When you are thinking of goals in business or life, think of bigger goals as they will grow you into a better individual. The world is changing very rapidly and we will have to change. Good practices need to be followed and adopted in order to sustain growth,” he said. “It is your passion that is bound to take you places. Discipline is the key; you have to keep looking forward and remain focussed. Think big, think global, compete global,” he said. Upkar Singh Ahuja, president, CICU highlighted the importance of well-formed strategies as they enable business growth and provide an edge against competitors. Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU said the evolution of the electric vehicle will open new horizons for the industry.

29-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Why has Centre, Maharashtra BJP taken different stands on fests, reopening of temples?’||The Congress has pointed at the contradictory stands taken by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in the Centre and the party’s Maharashtra unit over celebration of the festivals and reopening of temples amid the threat of potential third wave of Covid-19. Despite the Narendra Modi government’s directives on restrictions on festivities, why are the Maharashtra BJP leaders demanding that celebrations be allowed and temples be reopened, the Congress has asked. BJP’s spiritual coordination cell has announced a ‘Shankhnaad’ protest on Monday to push the demand of reopening of the temples in the state. BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil has asked all party workers, office bearers and elected representatives to participate actively in the protest near their homes. Other BJP leaders have announced to violate the prohibitory orders of the state government and celebrate dahi handi. BJP leader Ram Kadam said that they will celebrate dahi handi even if the permission was not granted.“A few dahi handi mandals have been seeking state’s permission by imposing restrictions, but the government has been giving step-motherly treatment to Hindu festivals. They have been allowing celebrations of other religions. We will not tolerate this. If the state government, which has been issuing orders by sitting in air-conditioned offices, is not allowing us to celebrate, we will violate the orders,” Kadam said.Raising questions over the ‘contradictory views’ taken by BJP’s state leadership. Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The Niti Aayog has projected that the Covid-19 case count in Maharashtra could go up to 6 million, while Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written to Maharashtra government to restrict the dahi handi and Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations to contain the spread of the virus. Despite that, BJP leaders have been politicising the issue by demanding that temples be reopened and celebrations be allowed. It is surprising that while the Modi government is asking states to impose restrictions on festivals, Maharashtra BJP leaders are acting immorally,” he said.On Thursday, Bhushan wrote to state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, asking him to impose restrictions on dahi handi and Ganesh festival. “In the view of the mass events and public gatherings expected during the celebrations of upcoming festivals, including dahi handi and Ganpati utsav in Maharashtra, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings,” the letter has stated.Sawant said the state government and police should take strict actions against them if they violate the prohibitory orders issued by the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-has-centre-maharashtra-bjp-taken-different-stands-on-fests-reopening-of-temples-101630181016718.html

The Yuva Sena office bearers in their letter to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai expressed deep anguish about the unfortunate gang rape and assault of the young MBA student, who is from Mumbai. “It has been reported that the male friend accompanying the woman was also assaulted and despite him reporting the incident, more than 24 hours have passed and no arrest have been made yet,” said the letter. “Any delay in nabbing the accused will make it even more difficult to ensure justice to the survivor. The police must treat this incident with the utmost urgency and take all relevant steps to arrest the accused as soon as possible,” it added. The letter said that Yuva stands in solidarity with the victim and family, it urged Bommai. “We can surely say that you will have the gratitude of humankind everywhere if you ensure that the survivor gets the best medical treatment and psycho-social support and the accused is prosecuted in a time-bound manner,” it added. According to the Mysuru police, the incident took place around 7pm when the victim and her male friend was returning from Chamundi hills. A gang of six men, who were reportedly in an inebriated state, stopped the bike and asked for money. When the male friend said that they have no money on them, the miscreants reportedly attacked him and hit the girl.

It has, however, sought the custody of the two accused ex-police officers claiming that after the arrest of former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and four others, the agency suspects that some more persons have played a key role in the two cases and it needs to question Vaze and Mane about it. The duo is in judicial custody in Taloja jail.“After the arrest of the last five accused (Sharma, Satish Mothkuri, Manish Soni, Santosh Shelar and Anand Jadhav), we have found some new things that we need to confront Vaze and Mane with,” Gonsalves said after the special court asked why the agency needed the custody of the two accused when it is about to file the charge sheet.The agency has said that they have already utilised Vaze’s 28-day custody and there are two more days of his custody left under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, while Mane will end after 16 days.“Vaze and Mane, both being (former) police officers, were well-aware of the tricks to evade interrogations by the investigating agency with wrong leads. However, the agency now has some incriminating material that needs to be confronted with them,” said the agency.The agency added that statements of several witnesses have been recorded under 161 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) on which they need to be confronted and the trail of the money seized also needs to be found.Meanwhile, Vaze’s counsel Raunak Naik has moved an application seeking home food for the 52-year-old and permission to get treated at a private hospital as he is having three major heart blockages. Naik informed the court that Vaze has been advised to urgently undergo open heart surgery when he was taken to Sir JJ Hospital for treatment after complaining of chest pain.“While you want to get him admitted, the agency wants his police custody,” judge Sitre observed.Vaze’s counsel pointed out that there is a health emergency, as his client was unwell and had to undergo the surgery at the earliest. The court has now posted the matter for Monday.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia on Carmichael Road in south Mumbai, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a note threatening to kill members of the industrialist’s family.On March 5, the body of Hiran – the SUV’s owner who is an auto parts dealer from Thane – was found dumped in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra.NIA took over investigations in both the cases and claimed that Vaze is the main accused in the case and carried out the crimes out of purported desperation to “restore his lost glory in police.” Later, NIA also arrested Sharma and four others who allegedly throttled Hiran and dumped his body in creek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-case-nia-suspects-role-of-more-persons-seeks-custody-of-ex-mumbai-cops-101630180356545.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Bathinda HIV+ blood transfusion: Migrant woman, husband, daughter test +ve after they return from UP||A 33-year-old woman, who was infused HIV infected blood by the blood bank staff of Shaheed Bhai Mani Civil Hospital at Bathinda last year, tested positive for the virus. Her husband and a three-year-old daughter were also found HIV positive, but a four-year-old son tested negative.After staying at their native place in Uttar Pradesh for over seven months, the family recently returned to live in a rented accommodation near the Police Lines in the city. The hospital management had earlier declared the woman patient untraced.After being traced last week in Bathinda, the family was tested for HIV on Friday. On May 5 last year, the woman was admitted to the hospital with acute anaemia and was administered two units of blood of an HIV + person. Like the donor, the woman was not alerted by the civil hospital about the infection.Doctors said the woman’s daughter may have caught the infection due to breastfeeding.“My husband is a labourer and our life has been shattered due to the callous attitude of the hospital staff. He is in a state of trauma and crying since the test reports were given to us. My daughter’s life has been ruined,” the woman said.Earlier, four thalassaemia patients, between 7 and 13 years, being treated at the Bathinda district hospital were found HIV positive. Two panels of the health department and Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS) had confirmed large-scale irregularities in running the blood bank.Senior medical officer Dr Maninder Singh, in-charge of the civil hospital, declined to comment on the HIV+ reports to maintain the confidentiality of patients. He also refused to confirm the number of patients who contracted HIV due to the wrong blood transfusion.Sonu Maheshwari, president of Naujawan Welfare Society (NWS), a Bathinda NGO fighting for the wrong blood transfusion victims, demanded a speedy action against the accused and financial compensation to the victims. A serious breach of blood donation protocol came to light in October last year when a seven-year-old thalassaemia patient was infused HIV+ blood at the government hospital.A fact-finding panel found that an HIV-infected volunteer, a regular blood donor, had donated blood in May last year and the blood bank staff violated standard operation procedure (SOP).The blood bank officials were negligent on two accounts. First, they did not check the blood before issuing it and they did not alert the patient and the hospital administration about the goof-up.Role of at least six staffers then posted at the blood bank came under the scanner in the serious breach of strict guidelines of blood infusion. Main accused Baldev Singh Romana, a medical laboratory technician (MLT) was arrested under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-hiv-blood-transfusion-migrant-woman-husband-daughter-test-ve-after-they-return-from-up-101630179576485.html
29-08-2021||Lucknow||Old Kashi getting a new face||Old Kashi is on the cusp of change. Its quintessence is getting a modern face. And the Varanasi Smart City mission is propelling this move forward for the ancient city. Even so, snapshots of the two facets, the old and the new, co-exist side by side. At daybreak, one can still see sadhus standing in knee-deep water in the Ganga and taking a holy dip in the river in the city considered holy by Hindus. Not far from this vignette of Varanasi’s spiritual life, the city’s “busiest” Godowlia crossing now has a multi-storey smart parking facility built at a cost of ₹19 crore. Serpentine lanes in the Dashashwamedh Ghat and five other areas under the Varanasi Municipal Corporation or Varanasi Nagar Nigam have been repaired with square, plain cement concrete tiles and beautified as part of the Varanasi Smart City mission. Soothing paintings with religious themes adorn the walls of these lanes.The iconic ghats have smart heritage signage. Landscaping has been done near overhead tanks. A smart school has been built in the Machhodari area at an estimated cost of ₹19 crore. It is equipped with smart classrooms for children, playing area and skill development centre. Potable water supply pipelines are being renewed in six municipal ward areas. The Smart City mission has also given a facelift to parks.The change has come about in the last six years under the Varanasi Smart City project.Varanasi is one of the 100 cities being equipped with smart facilities under Smart Cities Mission (SCM) launched by the BJP government at the Centre in 2015. Varanasi Smart City Limited was formed to carry forward the mission in Kashi. It came up with 15 projects, including a project for the redevelopment of old Kashi, construction of the government composite school (primary and upper primary combined) in Machhodari, development of smart parking, beautification of parks and overhead tanks, preservation, repairing and beautification of lanes of Kashi, said Shakambhari Nandan Sonthalia, public relations officer, Varanasi Smart City. Sonthalia said a survey identified the areas in which developmental works was needed on priority. The survey revealed that sewer lines and water supply pipelines were very old in Varanasi’s old city areas, including Dashashwamedh Ghat, Kaal Bhairav ward, Rajmandir Ghat, Jangamwadi ward, Kameshwar Mahadev ward and Gharwasi Tola ward.Both the water supply line and sewage system were laid in 1932 as per the records. They were in a dilapidated state. The old water pipelines were replaced with new ones and the sewer system was being renewed. Over 60% work in these VMC area wards has been completed and the remaining is 40% likely to be completed by November. Equipping the iconic ghats of Varanasi with smart heritage signage involved an expenditure of about ₹5 crore.Made of COR-TEN (weathering) steel, signage with an introductory note has been set up at each ghat. Sculptures have also been installed at some ghats, including Assi Ghat. Giant LED screens have been installed at six locations, including Assi Ghat, Dashashwamedh Ghat, Rajendra Prasad Ghat, Raj Ghat, Godowlia and Varanasi Cantt station, said Sonthalia. He added that live streaming of Kashi Vishwanath temple and Ganga aarti was done daily on these screens for the devotees. The multi-level smart parking facility (ground and four floors) near the Godowlia intersection has come up at a cost of about ₹19 crore.This crossing is the busiest one in Varanasi and it connects Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Ganga ghats and other important landmarks. Equipped with hydraulics and queuing area, it has the capacity to accommodate 375 two- wheelers. Smart parking at the Town Hall will be ready in October, said Sonthalia. Besides, an underground parking facility with a capacity for 470 cars and 130 two- wheelers has come up at Benia Bagh Park.Varanasi Smart City, which built the parking facility, is beautifying the park and landscaping is underway there. It will also have a football ground, amusement area, open gym, yoga garden and other facilities. This entire project is worth about ₹90.42 crore. Likewise, the Khidkiya Ghat has been redeveloped and it is being equipped with a tourist facility centre, ticket booth, cafeteria, kids’ play zone, wall art and murals, selfie point, yoga and meditation space. This would be divyang friendly. A CNG filling station has already come up at the ghat. In addition, a concrete road is being built between Maidagin and Godowlia under the area based development road project worth ₹86 crore. So far, 200 boats have already been converted into CNG-operated ones and the remaining 1000 will also be converted into CNG operated vessels by November. The work is underway to install surveillance cameras at 720 locations and 25 of them will be advance facial recognition surveillance cameras. Camera installation work has also begun, and it is likely to be completed by end of this year, said Sonthalia.The advance cameras to be installed at Godowlia, BHU gate and several other important places will be connected to the Kashi Integrated Command and Control Centre. As soon as any person breaches the speed limit or is found not wearing helmet or a bike has three riders, the camera will capture the vehicle number and send an alert. Similarly, these cameras will record the footage of the crowded and important places. Once the cameras are installed, the entire security system will be smart, said Sontholia. D Vasudevan, general manager of Varanasi Smart City Ltd, said, “While trying to preserve the heritage, cultural and religious characteristics of the ancient city of Kashi, Varanasi smart city is adding to various facilities to the city by using information technology, modern trends like artificial intelligence to enhance the safety, security, quality of life and livability of the citizens.” But not everyone is satisfied. Shailendra Singh, a resident of the Cantt area, is one such local questioning the smart facilities.“Where are the smart facilities? I couldn’t find even one. In the city, roads like Chauka Ghat-Hukulganj, Pandeypur-Panchkoshi are damaged at various stretches. Several lanes in Assi area and some other localities are rough and uneven,” Singh said. Manoj Yadav Golu, a resident of Sikraul area, said, “Lanes are being beautified in six wards only. There are 90 wards in the Varanasi Nagar Nigam area. What about the 84 other wards?” Yadav said the sewage system of the city was so poor that streets were waterlogged during the first rain of the monsoon. On the other hand, Vijay Yadav, a resident of Pandeypur area, said he was satisfied with the development works in the city.“Overhead tanks, lanes, walls, and streets have been repaired and beautified. It will take time to make every facility smart,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/old-kashi-getting-a-new-face-101630179516597.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sufficient material to summon Badals, Cheema: HC on SAD constitution row||The high court said there was sufficient material on record before the Hoshairpur judicial magistrate to summon former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and party vice-president Daljit Singh Cheema in an alleged forgery case involving their undertakings with regard to the constitution of the party.In a 51-page judgment, the high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia observed that it would not be appropriate for the HC to go into the merits of the case. “Sufficient material has come on record wherein two contrary stands have been taken regarding the constitution of the political party and whether it has adopted the principles of secularism or is still a religious party. It has also come on record that the SAD has been contesting the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee polls,” the bench observed in its detailed judgment released on Saturday.On Friday, the high court had dismissed a 2019 plea against the SAD leaders’ summoning in the alleged forgery case. On November 4, 2019, a Hoshiarpur court had summoned them in a 2009 case of alleged forgery and cheating filed by one Balwant Singh Khera. The SAD possessed two constitutions and gave a false undertaking to the Election Commission of India (ECI) that it had amended its constitution to incorporate the principles of socialism and secularism to fulfil the constitutional obligation to obtain recognition as a political party. But it continued its activities as a religious outfit as well to fight the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) polls, he had alleged, adding that even the resolution as claimed was not passed by the general house of the party.The high court further observed that on consideration of the materials supplied by the complaint, examination of same and his witnesses or report of inquiry, if a prima facie case is made out, process of summoning could be initiated against the accused. “The court is not required to evaluate the evidence and its merits, and whether there is sufficient material to record a conviction or not, is not to be gone into,” it said, adding that there are several stages yet to be passed by the complainant himself. Opportunity would come to the petitioners too to reply, cross-examine the witnesses and dig holes in the complainant’s case. The charge also is only liable to be framed, if the magistrate comes to the conclusion that accused has committed an offence after evaluating necessary evidence. As of Badal, in whose case it was argued that he was not named in the complaint but still summoned, the court observed that once the material has come on record, prima facie showing his involvement being the office-bearer of the party and in filing of the undertakings wherein contrary stands were taken and the fact that resolution incorporated the issue of secularism was not passed by the House but the impression given was to the contrary, there was sufficient material for the magistrate to summon him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sufficient-material-to-summon-badals-cheema-hc-on-sad-constitution-row-101630179456445.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Patiala first district in state to implement policy for street vendors||Patiala Patiala has become the first district in the state to implement the street vending policy. The municipal corporation has initiated the process for the execution of street vendors’ plan on four main roads by rehabilitating 397 hawkers. The civic body is under a legal obligation to accommodate street vendors under the provisions of the Street Vendors’ Act.Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said the corporation has already identified 28 spots where the street vendors should be rehabilitated. “As many as 4,025 street vendors were identified by the private consultants hired by the corporation for systematic implementation of the policy,” the mayor said.Joint commissioner Abhishek Gupta said the street vendors will be provided with all facilities, such as toilets, water supply and streetlights at the vending zones.The street vending plan envisages a geographic information system (GIS) mapping and biometric identity of street vendors so as to formulate a fee and licence structure for regulating street vending, besides finalising the terms and conditions for hawking and corrective action against defaulters.The MC will provide place to the vendors to carry out their businesses and it will be ensured that they are shifted to the allotted place.A smart chip card, containing the biometric data, government-approved licences, and certificates containing all details, has to be issued to the vendors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patiala-first-district-in-state-to-implement-policy-for-street-vendors-101630179276561.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena strategy: Single out Narayan Rane, target him||Even as it is engaged in a slugfest with Union for medium, small and micro enterprises (MSME) minister Narayan Rane, the Shiv Sena has adopted a strategy to single him out, while avoiding any attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This was clearly evident on Saturday as for the second day in a row, the party blamed Rane for the current friction between the former allies. None of the senior BJP leaders chose to support Rane in his personal attack on Sena leadership even though they defended him in his crossfire with the party. Significantly, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray had a one-on-one chat with opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday. The meeting between the two believably ended on an understanding that the tussle between the two parties should not stoop low. After the clashes and exchange of words between Shiv Sena and BJP following Rane’s arrest on Tuesday for objectionable remarks against the CM, both the parties have taken steps forward for some sort of reconciliation over the past two days. The leaders from both sides have said that they have not been separated ideologically. The attempt is also seen towards singling out Rane, as a section of BJP does not approve of his politics of hatred and personal attacks. BJP insiders believe that too much personal attack on the Sena leadership may be counter-productive and if Rane continues doing so, it will result in his isolation in the near future. “It is true that Rane has been attacking the Sena leadership on a personal level. We, too, have attacked the Sena and the Thackerays, but the emphasis was never on personal issues. The reactions by senior leaders of the state unit are indicative of disapproval of Rane’s style of working. We do not want to close the doors on the possibility of joining hands with Sena, as it is still the first choice to come to power in the state. Besides, a section of the party is apprehensive that the Rane episode may backfire on us if the Sena leadership gets the sympathy of its voter base,” said a senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, had on Saturday, reiterated that the relations between the two parties have strained because of Rane. “BJP needs to do some introspection over the entire issue. Ever since Rane has joined BJP, the party has been deteriorating by 10 feet every day and will soon remain just half a foot. BJP will soon realise the mistake [of inducting Rane].” According to the leaders from Sena, CM has made it clear to BJP during his meeting with Fadnavis that Sena would not tolerate any more attack from Rane. “There was a meeting between CM and Fadnavis yesterday [Saturday]. All know what they discussed. Uddhavji must have told him whatever needed to be said,” said Raut.Sena leaders claim that Rane’s stand had softened after the meeting between Thackeray and Fadnavis. On Saturday, Rane had said in Sindhudurg that he will follow the party’s stand if BJP and Sena come together in the future.Raut also warned Rane that if the latter kept talking about digging out old cases and records, the Sena has an entire box of cases against him. “We have political differences with BJP, but if it wants to shoot us from Rane’s shoulders, we too can use such a shoulder to fire back,” he said.On Thursday Raut had said that the relations between the two parties were spoilt because of the “newcomers” inducted in BJP. He had also likened Rane to Bangladeshi infiltrators and said that the “newcomers” are dangerous like the infiltrators who engage in terrorism and narcotics activities. He had further stated that though the Sena and BJP have parted their ways because of political differences, there is a common thread of Hindutva between them. He also had hinted that anything was possible in politics.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had two days ago said that they share the relationship of brotherhood with Shiv Sena. It was seen as an attempt by the BJP leadership to keep a window open for political reconciliation, if required in the future.BJP, however, dismissed any speculations of political realignment. “There is no question or possibility of the two parties coming together in the near future. Whatever Raut has said about Sena’s bonding with BJP is due to the fear of existence. After the response to Rane’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra, the Sena is scared that it may lose its base in Konkan. As far as the brotherhood remarks by our state unit chief are concerned, it was not meant in that sense. We are in the Opposition against the Sena-led combine and will remain to be so. The party is whole heartedly standing by Ranesaheb in this entire episode,” Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said.Political analyst Prakash Akolkar said that not only BJP and Sena are extending an olive branch to each other but the three ruling parties also have been trying to keep each other under check. “There is no doubt that BJP has no other option left apart from Sena if it really wishes to come to the power without polls or even after polls. Similarly, the Sena wants to keep its option open, as it is not confident that the two other ruling parties [Nationalist Congress Party and Congress] will support it till the end [of the tenure]. By highlighting that the Sena and BJP are still attached to each other with the common thread of Hindutva, the Sena has tried to send a message to BJP. Sena would definitely want BJP to tame Rane,” he added.Meanwhile, Rane held his third phase of Yatra in Devgad, Malvan, on Saturday amid a huge response from party workers and his supporters on his home turf. He, however, avoided any attack on the Shiv Sena or its leadership on Friday. His yatra will culminate in Sindhudurg on Sunday. The organisers of the yatra are facing cases in parts of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg for violation of Covid-19 norms.Rane was arrested on Tuesday in Ratangiri for his “slap CM” remarks during a press conference on Monday. Referring to Thackeray’s August 15 speech at Mantralaya, Rane had said that he would have slapped the CM had he been present there. Thackeray had enquired about the year of Independence with an official standing behind him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-strategy-single-out-narayan-rane-target-him-101630179216940.html
29-08-2021||Chandigarh||Jallianwala Bagh has inspired countless revolutionaries: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday dedicated the renovated Jallianwala Bagh memorial to the nation virtually.During the event that showcased the multiple development initiatives taken by the government to upgrade the complex, the PM also inaugurated the museum galleries at the national memorial revamped in wake of 100th anniversary of the 1919 massacre.Earlier in the day, farmers and Left organisations held protests a few metres from the Jallianwala Bagh against the government.Speaking on the occasion, the PM said the dreams of the innocent boys and girls, of the sisters and brothers are still visible in the bullet marks on the walls of Jallianwala Bagh. “Today, we are remembering the love and lives of countless mothers and sisters, which were snatched away in that Shaheedi Well,” he said.Jallianwala Bagh is the place which inspired countless revolutionaries such as Sardar Udham Singh and Sardar Bhagat Singh to die for the freedom of India, he said, adding: “Those 10 minutes of April 13, 1919, became the immortal story of our freedom struggle, due to which we are able to celebrate the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom today. On such an occasion, dedication of the Jallianwala Bagh memorial in the modern version in the 75th year of Independence, is an opportunity of great inspiration for all of us.”“It is the responsibility of every nation to preserve its history as it teaches us and gives us the direction to move forward. It is not right for any country to ignore such horrors of its past. Therefore, India has decided to observe 14th August every year as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day,” the PM said.For the all-round progress of Punjab and the country, a combined effort is needed, the PM said, adding “virasat (heritage) and vikaas (development) must coexist”. A wreath-laying ceremony was held and a two-minute silence was observed in the memory of martyrs of the Jallianwala massacre.Initiate steps to bring back Udham Singh’s diary, pistol from UK: CaptDescribing the renovated Jallianwala Bagh memorial as a tribute to the great martyrs and a symbol of inspiration for the youth, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the monument must serve as a reminder for the future generations about the right of the people to peaceful democratic protest.Amarinder also requested the PM that the Government of India should use its good offices to bring back the personal belongings, such as pistol and personal diary of Shaheed Udham Singh, who avenged the injustice of this massacre, from the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jallianwala-bagh-has-inspired-countless-revolutionaries-pm-101630179158826.html

The survivor has been undergoing treatment in Sir JJ Hospital, where she is being periodically counselled by experts from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) and Dongri shelter home, said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Pradeep Chavan of GRP (Western Railway).“We will rehabilitate the survivor and after she is discharged from the hospital, we will admit her for some vocational courses so that she could get independent,” said Chavan, adding that the entire expenses for her rehabilitation will be borne by GRP.The survivor was found in a distressed state near Dadar railhead on August 7. “She was unable to speak to us owing to the trauma but a medical test confirmed that she was brutally sexually assaulted,” said Chavan.Psychiatrists from TISS then counselled her, following she managed to recollect the name of one of the accused as Ajay. She also she had been sexually assaulted between mid-July and August.The suspect scouted for 40 people named Ajay and finally zeroed in on the accused truck driver from Naigaon, who confessed to the crime said Chavan. “The accused, Ajay Jaiswal, was traced to Naigaon. Through him, we traced two water tanker drivers, Akram Chaudhary and Munna Yadav, and arrested them under sections 363 (kidnapping) and 376 (d) (gang-rape) of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences), 2012. The railway court sent them to police custody. To make it a watertight case, we will plead for a special public prosecutor who will bring justice to the teen, said Chavan.The girl’s father had died last year, while her mother had died when she was younger. Her father had remarried, but her stepmother used to harass her. After her father died, she was abandoned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/grp-in-mumbai-to-rehabilitate-gang-rape-survivor-101630178976828.html

Rawat apprised Rahul of the latest developments as factions supporting chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and state unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu are engaged in a war of words. “I have briefed him on whatever the situation in Punjab is,” Rawat, also the in-charge of party affairs in the state, told reporters after meeting Rahul here.“In the next two-three days, I will visit Punjab and will meet party leaders. I will also meet Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu,” he said.The Punjab Congress finds itself as a divided lot a few months ahead of assembly elections, with Amarinder and Sidhu being at loggerheads. The infighting refuses to die down even after the former cricketer was appointed the PCC chief. Sidhu has also urged the party leadership to give him freedom in decision-making, telling them that he does not want to be a dummy party chief.He said this after one of his advisers -- Malvinder Singh Mali -- had to quit following pressure from the chief minister’s camp over his alleged controversial remarks on Kashmir.Some dissident ministers and MLAs had met Rawat at Dehradun and demanded Amarinder’s removal as the CM. However, Rawat made it clear that the next assembly elections would be fought under Amarinder’s leadership.The chief minister’s camp also sought action against Sidhu over Mali’s remarks on Kashmir and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-row-rawat-briefs-rahul-on-punjab-to-visit-state-next-week-101630178857317.html

29-08-2021||Mumbai||‘Fibrosis-like lung damage reverses in 80% of Covid patients’||Early this year, a 50-year-old IT engineer from Pune spent 10 days in a local hospital battling Covid-19. At the time of discharge, he underwent a second high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest that showed ground-glass opacity, reticulation shadow and traction bronchiectasis. In medical parlance, these were classic HRCT signs of pulmonary fibrosis — an irreversible condition that causes scarring and thickening of lung tissues, making it difficult to breathe. The IT engineer went back home with a diagnosis of “post-Covid fibrosis” and was advised pulmonary rehabilitation. Three months down the line, his chest scan improved. The hazy grey areas labelled as ground-glass opacities had reduced, his diffused lungs appeared to be expanding and the cough had reduced too. By July, six months since his hospitalisation, the scan was normal, with no sign of fibrosis. In many Covid-19 patients like this IT engineer, the lung fibrosis or fibrosis-like changes that appeared on the scan, reversed over a period of time. In some patients, the improvement is fast, while others may take anywhere between three months to a year. “When we said fibrosis, it meant that the condition is lifelong and irreversible,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Pune-based Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation, who treated the IT engineer. “But gradually, we started noticing the fibrosis-like changes that we saw in Covid patients resolved with time,” he said. These observations have prompted discussions among the medical fraternity if they should label such diagnosis as post-Covid fibrosis at all. “Most of us are now resisting the term post-Covid fibrosis,” said Salvi. “Now, we identify the Covid-induced lung changes as post-Covid interstitial lung disease — a broader term used for a larger group of diseases that cause lung scarring. The term fibrosis is used only in cases where the lungs don’t improve and worsen further” he said. A study from China published in the PLOS One journal in March found that patients who had a severe clinical classification of Covid-19 had more extensive and severe lung inflammation as well as severe residual pulmonary fibrosis. “In most of these patients, pulmonary fibrosis improved or even resolved within 90 days after discharge,” the study observed. Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care specialist at Fortis Hospital in Mumbai and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force said with experience, doctors now prefer to wait and watch instead of labelling the lung changes as pulmonary fibrosis. “Since what we saw as fibrosis reversed over a period of time, we realised that most Covid patients may not have the true form of irreversible fibrosis,” said Pandit. “After the preliminary Covid treatment, we refer such patients to pulmonary experts for longer follow-ups,” he said. Progressive fibrosis in 20% Covid patients In pulmonary fibrosis, the lung tissues are damaged with scarring and thickening, and the damage worsens over a period of time. As the tissues thicken and become hard, the lungs don’t expand fully, making it difficult for the patients to breathe. Pulmonary fibrosis is known as a terminal illness. Pulmonary rehabilitation including breathing exercises and some anti-fibrotic medication may slow down the progress in some cases. Doctors use a battery of tests and scans — complete pulmonary function tests, including the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO); six-minute walk test, among other tests — to diagnose fibrosis.Another classical sign to detect the condition is listening for velcro-crackles from the lungs. Velcro crackles sound similar to what we hear when a joined strip of velcro is separated. According to Salvi, while 80% of Covid patients who may have shown “fibrosis-like” lung changes recover over a period of time, at least 20% suffer from the progressive form of fibrosis. Mumbai-based chest physician Dr P Prabhudesai agreed. “Progressive fibrosis is the most concerning outcome of Covid,” he said. “The 20% patients who develop a progressive form of fibrosis are generally those who have been on oxygen support for a longer period, have underlying lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), history of smoking, age and other related co-morbidities,” he said. But Prabhudesai refrains from attaching the term “irreversible” to the progressive fibrosis seen in Covid-19 patients. “We should wait at least for another six months before labelling these cases as irreversible,” he said, adding that it is not a simple black and white when it comes to following up on Covid-19 patients. “In some cases, we may stop anti-fibrotic medication within four to six weeks as they start showing improvement, while in some patients we may have to add the anti-fibrotic drugs,” he said. According to Prabhudesai, some amount of fibrosis was also seen during the H1N1 outbreak and many patients improved back then. “The severity and spread of Covid-19 is definitely much more compared to H1N1. But we had seen cases of fibrosis that resolved over a period of time in H1N1 pneumonia,” he said. The pandemic hit Maharashtra in March 2020. Doctors say that it is advisable to closely follow up with patients with lung damage for a longer period to understand the irreversibility factor. However, a small percentage of Covid-19 patients have suffered from irreversible lung damage, which led to lung transplants.In August 2020, doctors in Chennai performed a bilateral lung transplant on a 48-year-old patient who had suffered from severe lung damage due to Covid related fibrosis.Last December, a 34-year-old marketing professional from Haryana who suffered from post Covid lung fibrosis underwent a double lung transplant at a Hyderabad hospital. Lung transplants on Covid patients in the United State have also seen a rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fibrosislike-lung-damage-reverses-in-80-of-covid-patients-101630178556747.html

Farmer leaders said efforts were on to make the Sambhal mahapanchayat being organised by Bharatiya Kisan Union’s ( BKU-Asli) national president Harpal Singh Bilari as well as the one by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, a grand success. “More than 50000 people will participate in the Sambhal mahapanchayat,” claimed Bilari. He said SKM leaders including Gurnam Singh Chadhuni, Rajpal and Yogendra Yadav will attend the mahapanchayat. “The mahapanchayat will help in deciding how to scale up the farmers movement in Uttar Pradesh”, he said. Bilari claimed that the farmers’ movement had been successful in both Haryana and Punjab. “This is quite evident as cases against 36000 farmers have been registered in Haryana and against 12000 in Punjab. UP has no such record which indicates that more direct involvement of people is needed to build up the movement across UP,” he said. “A resolution would be passed in the Sambhal mahapanchayat to prepare the blueprint for ‘Mission UP’ as part of which we would reach out to people to apprise them about issues that farmers are protesting against for past 9 months,” said BKU (Asli) leader Surendra Singh. He accused “mainstream media” of not showing real issues of farmers. “We would reach out to people to expose dirty play of the government to exploit farmers,” he said. Preparations are also on for the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat. BKU chief Naresh Tikait is meeting influential leaders like ‘khap heads and holding village level meetings to mobilise farmers and ensure maximum participation. “The mahapanchayat will strengthen the campaign against BJP in villages and it would also help clear how the three farm laws were against interest of farmers and why the legal status to MSP is essential for survival of farmers,” a farmer leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-unrest-two-back-to-back-mahapanchayats-in-west-up-in-september-101630177776502.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Housing society fined for failing to allot parking lots as per bylaws||The District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum (DCDRF) has fined a cooperative housing society in Bhandup for failing to frame a policy for allotment of parking lots and allot the lots in terms of its bylaws. The forum has asked the society to systematically allot parking spaces in their premises in accordance with relevant bylaws.Kamlakar Rai, a resident of Joy Homes Co-operative Housing Society, had approached the forum in September 2018 complaining that though the developer had handed over the property to the housing society, the society had failed to properly allocate available parking lots to its members in terms of the bylaws adopted by the society.Rai, in his complaint, alleged the society had allowed members to continue to hold the parking lots purchased by them from the developer as their individual property and had decided to allocate remaining parking spaces by charging certain amounts. He further alleged that while allocating parking space, the society was biased as they left out old members and gave spaces only to new members without adhering to society bylaws.The plea was contested by the society on several grounds. The society claimed that as per the bylaws, space allocation for parking was on first-come-first-serve basis. It added that it was decided that owners were not permitted to use any other space than the allocated space for parking their vehicles.As per the order, the society has a total of 297 flats and six shops and 181 parking spaces, which includes 41 stilt parking lots and 136 open spaces. As submitted by lawyers from both sides, the society has allocated parking spaces to 158 members and rest were asked to use remaining parking on rotation basis.In this backdrop, the forum held that it was necessary for the society to allocate parking spaces per flat as per their own bylaws — on first-come-first-serve basis. The forum observed that the society has not allocated parking spaces according to the bylaws, a deficiency in services and also unfair trade practice.The forum, hence, imposed cost of ₹10,000 on the housing society and held that the society has to allocate available parking spaces as per the bylaws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/housing-society-fined-for-failing-to-allot-parking-lots-as-per-bylaws-101630175916154.html
29-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees rise in fresh Covid-19 cases for 4 days||There has been an increase in fresh Covid-19 cases in Mumbai over the past four days, going against the dip in daily cases from middle of August. During this period, cases have shot up to over 300 per day, whereas Mumbai had hit as low as 195 and 196 infections on August 16 and 17 respectively. Post August 17, the city reported less than 300 cases per day until the recent surge. The hike in cases has worried civic officials amid concerns of a third wave ahead of the festival season. On Saturday, Mumbai reported 391 new cases as Mumbai conducted 37,335 tests. On Friday, Mumbai reported 362 cases as 35,870 tests were conducted; on Thursday, Mumbai reported 398 cases against 41,628 tests, and on Wednesday Mumbai reported 342 cases with 42,723 tests conducted.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now increased the number of tests conducted per day, which were around 30,000 during mid-August. During the four days when the surge in cases has been reported, Mumbai has also seen an increase in the positivity rate. On Saturday and Friday, Mumbai’s positivity rate went over 1%. On Saturday, it was at 1.04%, and on Friday it was at 1%. On Wednesday and Thursday, Mumbai’s positivity rate was under 1%. Last week, Mumbai had a positivity rate of less than 0.5% on some days.The surge has been attributed by authorities and experts to the increase in the number of tests per day and the opening up of the city from August 15. Civic authorities have also pointed that BMC has changed its testing policy for high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients, which can lead to an increase in cases.Earlier, the civic body would test high-risk contacts after the fourth or fifth day of detection of the original case, or after symptoms began to show. However, now BMC has started testing the high-risk contacts on day one, or the subsequent day. This will help in mitigating the further spread of the infection as positive cases among high-risk contacts will also be isolated immediately.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have increased our testing and contact-tracing measures. We have also changed the testing policy for high-risk contacts, and begun to test them on day one of tracing them after detection. As aspects of city life are opening up, we expect a higher number of cases in comparison to earlier. However, we are watching the positivity rate closely, and it has only marginally increased.”From August 15, hotels, restaurants, and shops have been allowed to stay open till 10pm. Following this, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed the civic administration to increase contact tracing from 1:15 to 1:20, that is, 20 high risk contacts per positive case, and also increase testing in the city.Dr Rahul Pandit, who is a member of the Maharashtra government Covid-19 task force, said, “As the city has opened up more from August, people begin to go out, eat out more, initially more frequently. During this period, it is likely that we see a relatively higher number of cases. Moreover, the civic body has also increased testing, which is a necessity, and can contribute to increase in cases.”Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to citizens and organisers to ensure that all Covid-19 regulations are followed during the festive season. “We had already restricted the festivals but now even the Union Health Ministry and ICMR have endorsed our stance,” said Uddhav. Uddhav said that for him saving lives was a priority and hence all religious, social and political outfits should follow all rules while celebrating the festivals. Thackeray said that Covid-19 threat still exists and hence it was necessary to show the country that we are responsible citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-rise-in-fresh-covid-19-cases-for-4-days-101630175857119.html

29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi cabinet okays ₹139 crore budget for cloud-linked health management system||The Delhi cabinet has cleared a budget of over ₹139 crore for its health management system, which will store the complete medical records of every Delhi resident on a cloud, data that will be accessible to doctors of their choice. The plan will initially link Delhi government-run hospitals and later bring private hospitals on board. The cloud-based system will also enable facial recognition and biometric identification of patients, according to a government statement. “All the hospitals of Delhi are being connected to the Health Information Management System (HIMS). All the medical services will be brought under one platform, through the HIMS portal. It will inform us how many beds are vacant in a hospital, the status of medicine stocks and staffers, number of ventilators and any other information about medical infrastructure. One won’t need to stand in queues in hospitals anymore, you will be able to get appointments on the phone itself and go as per your convenience,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The system will be capable of scheduling doctors’ appointments, generate e-prescriptions, dispense medicines, connect patient with an ambulance, and issue disability certificates. For doctors, it will have a decision support system for diagnosis and treatment, record voice to text or digital pen notes for case reports, and have mandatory checklists in the operation theatre. The system will also integrate the back-end logistics such as availability of beds, medicines, and other consumables. The system will also provide support for community outreach programmes.A QR-code enabled health card will be issued to all Delhi residents (as per voter ID and population registry) under the scheme,and the collected data will be used for family mapping for government schemes and programmes, the statement said.“The Delhi government will conduct surveys across the entire state to make sure every citizen can get their e-Health card made. The cards will also be made at hospitals and other dedicated centres, and will be distributed through a door-to-door campaign,” said the state government’s press note. The project has been awarded to NEC Corporation India Private Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cabinet-okays-139-crore-budget-for-cloud-linked-health-management-system-101630175675489.html

29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi to get 6,800 new ICU beds in 6 months: Kejriwal||The Delhi government will create over 6,800 new intensive care unit (ICU) beds at seven facilities over the next six months, according to a proposal approved by the Delhi cabinet on Saturday. Currently, there are 10,000 ICU beds across Delhi government hospitals. The 6,836 new beds will increase the capacity by 70%, said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.The beds will be added to existing as well as proposed new hospitals at a cost of ₹1,260 crore.There will be 1,430 beds in the Shalimar Bagh facility, 458 at the Kirari facility, 1,912 at the GTB Hospital, 1,565 beds in Raghubir Nagar, 610 beds at Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalay in Geeta Colony, and 525 beds at the Sultanpuri facility.“Delhi government hospitals at present have a capacity of 10,000 ICU beds; a 70% increase is being made to this number. This is no small task. These beds will be ready within 6 months. On one hand, it will help in dealing with the third Covid-19 wave, on the other if the wave does not come, they will act like additional beds for regular treatment,” said Kejriwal. The new facilities will consist of three main buildings – emergency, outpatient clinics, and ward blocks – and a services building including space for pressure-swing adsorption oxygen plants or oxygen tanks and multi-level car parking. Provisions for adding more floors in the future have also been created.The city administered over 185,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses on Saturday, the most in a day since June 29.The uptick in the Capital’s inoculation numbers came a day after the country hit the milestone of highest ever 10 million vaccinations in a day for the first time ever.Daily vaccinations in Delhi have so far crossed the 200,000 mark thrice — on June 26, 28 and 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-6-800-new-icu-beds-in-6-months-kejriwal-101630175501494.html
29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Suspect in Jantar Mantar hate slogan case denied bail||A Delhi court has denied bail to a man accused of raising inflammatory slogans during an event at Jantar Mantar on August 8, saying that even though the right to assemble and freedom to air thoughts are cherished under the Constitution, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.Additional sessions judge Anil Antil, on August 27, denied relief to Preet Singh, and said the accused participated in the event in his individual capacity and as the main organiser of the event itself.The judge also said the accused is “clearly seen” actively participating in the incendiary speeches along with his other associates.A video of anti-Muslim sloganeering during a protest at Jantar Mantar was widely circulated on social media, following which the Delhi Police registered a case in connection with the matter on Monday. Hundreds of people had attended the protest organised by “Bharat Jodo Aandolan” at Jantar Mantar on August 8.On August 27, the judge noted that the event at Jantar Mantar was conducted despite the Delhi Police denying them permission for the same.“It is apposite to mention that the applicant not only voluntarily organised the event but also actively participated and provided support to the views and contents of inflammatory speeches, which were being made by the participants/accused persons at that time, by acknowledging and endorsing via gestures and clapping intermittently,” the court said.He said given the stature of the accused, it was expected that he ought to have exercised his authority, in these circumstances, and prevented participants from the airing such inflammatory opinions in the larger interest of the public and committee welfare.“In addition, on prima facie analysis of the inflammatory and incendiary content of the speeches or interviews of the participants members of the event, comments especially those pertaining in express pejorative references to a religious community, and keeping in view that the applicant was an active organiser of the event, he cannot later absolve himself of the responsibility of the content or consequences arising therefrom,” the court said.The court also held that being an active, main organiser of the event, the accused was an influential personality and there was a possibility of him interfering with the investigation and influencing the witnesses of the case, if released on bail.While opposing the application, the prosecution told the court that the accusations were severity in nature and the investigation was still at a nascent stage.It also said a number of accused people were absconding and evading the process of law and the entire incriminating material is yet to be recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhisuspect-in-jantar-mantar-hate-slogan-case-denied-bail-101630175436699.html
29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Kejriwal inaugurates Mayur Vihar Phase-1 flyover loops||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday inaugurated two cloverleaf ramps, service roads and a cycle track on the Mayur Vihar-I flyover on the Delhi-Noida Link Road, which will help ease travel between east Delhi and Noida.Kejriwal said that the two loops -- both 300 metres longand connecting the Delhi-Noida Link Road with the Barapullah phase-III flyover -- will bring a lot of relief to commuters travelling from Mayur Vihar-I to Akshardham and from Noida to Mayur Vihar-I.The newly-opened loops will benefit over 10,000 vehicles as, officials said, till now, commuters coming from Mayur Vihar had to drive over a kilometer extra on the Delhi-Noida Link road to take a U-turn to join the lane heading towards Akshardham.Inaugurating the stretch along with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and PWD minister Satyendar Jain, Kejriwal said, “This will bring a huge relief to the people of this region as well as the entire east Delhi area from traffic jams... The way in which the PWD (Public Works Department) has been functioning is commendable. They finish projects before deadlines, complete them not only within the estimated costs but also save money, and craft more sustainable and cost effective designs. This has been made possible because an honest government is in power.”The project, which is part of the phase-III extension of the Barapullah elevated road corridor from Mayur Vihar to Sarai Kale Khan, cost over ₹40 crore. Officials said the idea behind the project was to allow vehicles to avoid the traffic signal on the Mayur Vihar Phase-l junction, which will in turn reduce the carbon dioxide emission and noise pollution.Commuters here have suffered from traffic jams since 2015, when work began on the construction of the flyover and the two loops.A PWD official had said, “There were several obstacles to building these loops, especially when the Mayur Vihar flyover was on the verge of completion and resulted in a surge in diverted traffic. The flyover and the loops were being built simultaneously, and one had to be stopped to ensure traffic was not adversely affected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-kejriwal-inaugurates-mayur-vihar-phase-1-flyover-loops-101630175436228.html
29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: South MCD restores vertical garden below Africa Avenue flyover||The vertical garden undone by squatters in the vacant space below the Africa Avenue flyover near the Outer Ring Road, has now been restored by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) which has also put in place iron grills to enclose the garden and prevent any encroachment in the future.A total of 970 plants of eight different species -- ficus panda, kamal cactus, yuca, raphis palm, sansaevieria, Arica palm, desi palm and ficus benjamina -- have been planted in the space over this month.“The varieties planted are all shade-loving trees. This is because only minimal sunlight reaches the space below the flyover. Hence, we had to pick such species that grow well under the shade. We are also in the process of appointing an agency for the maintenance of the patch,” said an official from the SDMC’s horticulture department, adding that the agency will also be allotted a small space to advertise.Officials said the space below the flyover was initially given a makeover in 2017 -- on the intervention of the Lieutenant Governor -- as part of a scheme to improve the aesthetics of vacant spaces under 12 flyovers and reclaim them from encroachers. According to officials in the SDMC’s horticulture department, who took up the greening project, the squatters and the homeless persons were initially shifted to night shelters.“While most other beautified flyover spaces have remained fine since then, this small patch of about 100-150 square metres under the Africa Avenue flyover was encroached by anti-social elements. We had to take assistance from the Delhi Police on a regular basis to evict such elements from the area and redo the space once again. Regular police patrolling helped us reclaim the space,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhisouth-mcd-restores-vertical-garden-below-africa-avenue-flyover-101630174835558.html
29-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi court terms northeast Delhi riots case probe ‘callous’, ‘inefficient’||A Delhi court termed a police probe into a northeast Delhi riots case “highly callous”, “inefficient” and “unproductive”, but said it cannot ignore the statements of the witness while framing charges in the case.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said that “prima facie there is enough material on record to frame charges against one Rohit for unlawful assembly, rioting, house trespass, theft, mischief with fire”.The FIR in the matter was registered on February 26, 2020, on complaints by three persons, claiming that a riotous mob consisting of about 400-500 persons, armed with dandas and iron rods, blocked the main Gokalpuri road and thereafter set on fire some shops and vehicles in the area of Ganga Vihar and A, B, C and D blocks of Gokalpuri, Delhi-94 on February 24, 2020.The court, in an order of August 23, said that there was also evidence in the form of supplementary statements of complainant Irshad as well as statements of independent public witnesses where they have given categorical account of the incident in question and the role played by Rohit.“Ocular evidence is considered the best evidence, unless there are strong reasons to doubt it,” the judge said, adding that the defence has not been able to give any reason worth to disbelieve or discard the evidence of witnesses by doubting their presence at the spot on the date and time of incident.The judge also said that the beat constables had also identified the accused and such statements cannot be brushed aside/discarded at this stage, merely because there has been some delay in recording their statements or since the complainants had not specifically named them in their initial written complaints.“Be that as it may, it is worth noting that investigation in the matter appears to be highly callous, inefficient and unproductive; however, as noted earlier this court at this stage, cannot ignore the statements of victims dehors the delay in recording of FIR in the matter,” the court said.“I am of the considered opinion that prima facie there is enough material on record to frame charges against the accused under requisite sections,” it added.Communal riots had broken out in north east Delhi last year, claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-terms-northeast-delhi-riots-case-probe-callous-inefficient-101630174775487.html
29-08-2021||Lucknow||Ex-UP minister Ambika Chaudhary, Mukhtar’s brother Sibghatullah rejoin SP||Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s elder brother Sibghatullah Ansari and former Samajwadi Party (SP) heavyweight and ex-Uttar Pradesh minister Ambika Chaudhary rejoined the SP on Saturday.Both have left the BSP, which they had joined ahead of the 2017 UP assembly polls.At the rejoining the party, Ambika Chaudhary broke down, reminding people of a similar homecoming to the SP by senior leader Mohammed Azam Khan in 2010. Then, SP founder Mulayam Singh Yadav and Azam were both in tears.Responding to Ambika’s emotions, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said: “He is not able to say what he wants to. Today, I could realise what all he must have gone through (after being away from the party). It will be my effort now to bring back all those who are associated with Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav)...Don’t know why at times very strong political relationships break very easily. But now all are coming back on track. In politics, ups and downs are routine.”Ambika Chaudhary was a senior leader in the Samajwadi Party till he had an unceremonious exit during the internal feud in the party ahead of the 2017 UP assembly polls. Chaudhary then joined the BSP.Chaudhary, a strong eastern UP leader and former minister in both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav governments, had also been chief whip of the party for a long time.Sibghatullah Ansari also rejoined the SP on Saturday.In fact, before the 2017 UP Assembly polls, the Ansari brothers (Afzaal and Sibghatullah ) had joined the Samajwadi Party with the intention of contesting the 2017 assembly polls on the SP ticket instead of their own party Quami Ekta Dal (QED). The Ansari brothers had taken this step at the initiative of SP cabinet minister Shivpal Yadav during the feud between Akhilesh and him. When Akhilesh had objected to Ansaris’ joining the SP, they made a retreat and joined the BSP instead. Sibghatullah had contested the Muhammadabad assembly seat in Ghazipur on the SP ticket in 2007 and had won. He retained the same seat in the 2012 assembly polls on the Quami Ekta Dal ticket, but lost when he contested on the BSP ticket in 2017. The SP is likely to give him a ticket to contest the seat again.Akhilesh also said: “These joinings will strengthen the Samajwadi Party and send the message across that the SP is going to make a full majority government in the next polls.”Reacting to Sibghatullah Ansari joining the SP, the BJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit said the Samajwadi Party in its desire to grab power in the state was ready to even shake hands with the family of Mukhtar Ansari , according to a PTI report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/exup-minister-ambika-chaudhary-mukhtar-s-brother-sibgatullah-rejoin-sp-101630174536390.html
29-08-2021||Lucknow||Expansion of Yogi Adityanath cabinet likely after President’s Uttar Pradesh visit concludes||The much-talked about expansion of the Yogi Adityanath government is expected soon after President Ram Nath Kovind’s four-day Uttar Pradesh visit is over on Sunday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders indicated on Saturday. The Yogi government has 53 ministers, including 23 cabinet ministers, nine ministers of state (independent charge) and 21 ministers of state at present. It can accommodate seven more. “The template is going to be the same,” a BJP leader said, hinting that the focus on OBCs (Other Backward Classes) and Dalits would continue as was evident when the party accommodated seven faces from Uttar Pradesh in the Union council of ministers in July.Of the seven faces from UP, three each were OBCs and Dalits and there was a lone Brahmin. The expansion would also indicate how the BJP prefers to deal with its allies ahead of the UP assembly election due in early 2022, party leaders said, indicating that leaders from both Apna Dal (Sonelal) and the Nishad Party could be accommodated in the Yogi ministry. Leaders with a clean track record are expected to be given priority in the election year, party leaders said.All discussions on the subject have reportedly been held with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior UP leaders, including state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. “The exercise got delayed due to the demise of Kalyan Singh and the President’s visit. Now, it’s all set,” a BJP leader said.Sanjay Nishad, the head of the Nishad party that has a hold on members of the riverine community like fishermen and boatmen, after several rounds of meetings with the top BJP leadership is camping in New Delhi ahead of the exercise. Nishad, whose son Praveen is a Lok Sabha MP from Sant Kabir Nagar on a BJP ticket, had a meeting scheduled with BJP chief JP Nadda on Saturday. The meeting, however, failed to materialise ostensibly owing to Nadda’s busy schedule. “The BJP is like a big brother,” Nishad said in Delhi while reiterating his view about his party’s perceived influence in 160 assembly constituencies of the state.He has made it clear that the Nishad party would contest the 2022 UP elections with the BJP. Nishad is expected to be one of the four names from the list of nominated MLCs to be declared ahead of the expansion, the party leaders said. Apna Dal (S) MLC Ashish Patel, husband of Union minister and Mirzapur MP Anupriya Patel, is also said to be among the leaders in the running for a ministerial berth in UP. “Technically, Anupriya Patel and BJP MP Pankaj Choudhary, who have been made Union ministers are all from UP and both represent the Kurmi subcaste of OBCs. So would they want to accommodate another Kurmi or settle for some other OBC subcaste remains to be seen, but Ashish is among the list of leaders in the running for a berth,” a BJP leader said. The BJP leaders indicated that while accommodating allies in the ministry, the party may also give a chance to groom its own home-grown leaders from the community.“To balance Anupriya, the BJP also appointed its own Kurmi MP Pankaj Choudhary in the Union ministry and I would not be surprised if a similar pattern is followed here. That’s because while promoting allies, the BJP is conscious of grooming its own OBC and Dalit leadership too,” the party leader said. Jitin Prasada, the Brahmin leader from the Congress who has switched sides to the BJP and only recently shared photos of his family meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is expected to be a top claimant for a cabinet berth in the Yogi government, party leaders said. Among Dalit faces, the party is expected to opt for either veteran Vidyasagar Sonkar or Ravi Sonkar, the party MLA from Mahadeva assembly constituency in Basti district, BJP leaders said. Sangeeta Balwant Bind, the party’s 41-year-old woman postgraduate MLA, is also said to be in the running.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/expansion-of-yogi-cabinet-likely-after-president-s-uttar-pradesh-visit-concludes-101630174176094.html

29-08-2021||Lucknow||Integrated system of medicine gaining ground fast: President Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday said the Ayush system of medicine played a key role in boosting people’s immunity, especially during the Covid second wave and added that a health garden to boost Ayush medicine was being developed at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy system of medicine are collectively referred to as Ayush. “In the fight against Covid-19, especially during the Covid second wave, Ayush medicines played a key role in boosting immunity,” the President said while laying the foundation stone of the Ayush University in Gorakhpur. The Ayush University has been named after Baba Gorakhnath, the founder of the Nath Hindu monastic movement to which Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath belongs. The President, who is on four-day visit to Uttar Pradesh, later also inaugurated the Mahayogi Gorakhnath Vishwavidyalaya (University) campus. He said the concept of an integrated system of medicine was fast gaining ground and spoke of how Rashtrapati Bhavan, too, was doing its bit to popularise this. “In Rashtrapati Bhavan, too, along with an Ayurvedic clinic, we also have got an Ayush treatment facility available. Only recently, we decided to develop a Arogya van (health garden) at Rashtrapati Bhavan and work on it has started,” the President said. Hailing the fact that there was unity in diversity in India, the President said that the existence of different therapies, too, was a testament to the same. “Various medicinal and treatment therapies have been popular in India. In 2014, the Ayush ministry was set up for an organised teaching and research of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy. The UP government, too, set up a separate Ayush ministry in 2017 and now this Ayush university is coming up where I am told that a research institute, too, would be set up,” the President said.The state government plans to spend ₹815 crore on the construction of the Ayush University, for which it had acquired 52-acre land near Pipri and Tarkulhi villages in Gorakhpur. The Ayush University will be run according to the guidelines of the Central Council of Indian Medicine, regarding the establishment of Ayurveda, Unani, homeopathy, yoga, and naturopathy educational institutions in the university, a state government official said.“Gandhiji used to say that we must have knowledge about our villages and our forests which are a virtual treasure trove of various natural medicines and herbs that help in treating common ailments easily,” the President said on the occasion while recalling the contribution of Guru Gorakhnath. The President recalled, how social reformer and saint Kabir had lavished praise on Baba Gorakhnath, describing him as someone who was “Kalikal main amar” (one whose popularity transcends time) and for whom Goswami Tulsidas had said, “Gorakh jagayo jog (Gorakhnath made yoga popular).” As it started raining during the event, President Kovind said, “This is such a good omen. Hindus believe that if it starts raining during any auspicious event, then the event becomes even more auspicious.” The President whose address was punctuated by numerous Sanskrit couplets cited a verse of Baba Gorakhnath, “Yadi sukham, tad swargam, yadi dukham tad narkam (happiness is akin to being in heaven and sadness is like hell)” to emphasise the importance of a healthy body. He also invoked Goswami Tulsidas to substantiate the point further.“Goswami Tulsidas had said bade bhag manus tan pawa (one gets a human form after great blessings and good fortune). And I am happy that the Ayush university is a step in the right direction,” he said. Governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh Ayush minister Dharam Singh Saini and Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan were among those present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/integrated-system-of-medicine-gaining-ground-fast-president-101630166920597.html
29-08-2021||Lucknow||Gorakhpur on way to becoming city of knowledge, says President Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the Mahayogi Gorakhnath University in Gorakhpur on Saturday and said that the eastern UP town was on way to becoming a “city of knowledge.” “This is my second visit to Gorakhpur over the last three years. During my visit here on December 2018, I had expressed the desire to see the Gorakhpur develop as a city of knowledge. I am happy to note that the setting up of Mahayogi Gorakhnath University is a step in that direction,” the President said after inaugurating the university. Baba Gorakhnath University would be run by the Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad set up in 1932. “Along with regular courses and imparting various skills sets through employment-specific courses, the university would also run courses for women and farmers,” the President said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath would be the chancellor of the university. “Gorakhpur is named after the great Guru Gorakhnath as well as this entire region is associated with great names. They include Mahatma Buddha, Teerthanker Mahaveer and Sant Kabir. It is the land of Baba Gorakhnath, Guru Digvijayanath, Mahant Avaidyanath. It has also been associated with Baba Raghav Das, Hanuman Prasad Poddar, Ram Prasad Bismil, litterateur Prem Chand, Raghupati Sahai Firaq Gorakhpuri and Vidya Niwas Mishra,” the President said. “There is this belief that Mahayogi Baba Gorakhnath was an incarnation of Lord Shiva and his place of worship, the Gorakhnath Math, has for ages, played a role in the country’s religious and spiritual awakening. During freedom movement, this Math also played a role in the country’s political movement. Now, it has become an important centre of great importance not just in India, but abroad too,” he said. The President also praised the new education policy, saying it laid down the blueprint for overall, holistic development of the students and was tailored to develop patriotic and human and cultural values and equip the students with different skill sets. “The Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad which set up the Baba Gorakhnath University is running more than 50 academic institutions. I am happy to note that the institutes run by the Parishad focus on overall, holistic development of the individuals. Affinity towards Indian culture, love and willingness to sacrifice and surrender oneself for the motherland is also a key ingredient. I am confident that under the chancellorship of chief minister Yogi Adityanath and governor Anandiben Patel, this Mahayogi Gorakhnath University would fulfill its avowed objective,” he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said India’s traditional healthcare system had got global recognition due to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said International Yoga Day celebrations on June 21 were a good example as the day was being observed globally.The chief minister was speaking in Gorakhpur where President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the Mahayogi Gorakhnath University and laid the foundation stone of Ayush University.“PM Narendra Modi had in 2019 laid the foundation stone of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical University in Lucknow and all medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh will be affiliated to it. Similarly, all Indian traditional healthcare system institutes in the state will be affiliated to the Ayush university,” he said.Adityanath also said, “For the people of Gorakhpur as well as for whole of east UP, it’s a unique coincidence that while one university has been inaugurated, the foundation stone of another has been laid. This well and truly means that we are on course to realizing the President’s ambition of seeing Gorakhpur develop as a city of knowledge.”The chief minister, who is also the head priest of the Gorakhnath Mutt, is the chancellor of the Mahayogi Gorakhnath UniversityHe said: “We are thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the new education policy, which is set to provide newer opportunities to students. The new university would offer courses in nursing, Ayurveda and various para medical courses. The university has cleared its schedule for the next five years. We are confident that Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad and Gorakhnath University, Gorakhpur would realise all that the country’s top leadership and the Parishad’s illustrious founders and mentors had envisioned for them.” Governor Anandiben Patel praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath for working on President Ram Nath Kovind’s agenda of transforming Gorakhpur into a “city of knowledge”. The governor also praised Gorakhpur’s “rich and glorious past and its bright present”. She also lauded the Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad that was founded in 1932 and under which the Mahayogi Gorakhnath University has been set up. “The chief minister is fulfilling the President’s agenda to develop Gorakhpur as a city of knowledge. Once Ayush University whose foundation stone was laid today is ready, Gorakhpur would actually become an education hub,” the governor said. She also praised the new education policy saying it would ensure that students don’t run into language issues in their quest for greatness.“The new education policy would also help focus on skill-based education and training,” she said. ‘I am sure that the university would be successful in fulfilling the vision for which it has been established,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gorakhpur-on-way-to-becoming-city-of-knowledge-president-101630166855642.html
29-08-2021||Kolkata||ED summons Mamata’s nephew, his wife over money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued summons to Trinamool Congress (TMC) national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and his wife, Rujira, to appear before it for questioning in Delhi in connection with its money laundering probe into an illegal coal mining scam, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.Abhishek, 33, TMC Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, has been asked to appear for questioning on September 6 and Rujira on September 1. The TMC leader faces both ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the case. CBI questioned Rujira in February this year as well.Reacting sharply to the summons, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government for “letting loose central agencies” on het party MP in the case, claiming that some BJP ministers were working hand in glove with coal mafia. She also accused the Centre of trying to “bulldoze the federal structure” of the country and snatching away rights of the states.“The BJP and the Union government can’t fight us politically. The party was defeated in the assembly polls and now they are using central agencies against our leaders like Abhishek Banerjee and others. But let me tell them, they can’t bulldoze or intimidate us by such threats. We will continue our fight against them,” Banerjee said, while proposing to call a meeting of all chief ministers to fight against “the Centre’s authoritarianism”.Some police officers from West Bengal have also been asked to appear before ED in September, people cited above said.The ED’s money laundering probe is based on a CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered in November 2020 over alleged mass coal pilferage in Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in Kunustoria and Kajora in West Bengal.A local contractor, Anup Majhi alias Lala, is said to be the prime suspect in the scam.ED told a Delhi court in April this year that Abhishek Banerjee was allegedly a beneficiary of funds obtained in the illegal mining. TMC rejected the charges as political. ED also informed the court, just ahead of the West Bengal elections, that illegal mining was flourishing in the state under the “patronage” of the political party in power.ED has cited the probe and alleged ₹1,352 crore was generated by Majhi through illegal coal mining in two years. It is alleged that the funds collected by Majhi and others in connivance with the police officers reached the political leaders in West Bengal and then were laundered in India and abroad.Former TMC Youth leader Vinay Mishra, who is wanted in the case, is absconding. His brother Vikas Mishra and a police inspector, Ashok Kumar Mishra, were arrested in March and April.“Investigation revealed a deep system of political patronage and well-oiled network by which the system was subverted to carry out these illegal activities in a brazen manner,” ED said in April.It said the alleged kingpin of this coal pilferage scam did “illegal coal mining business smoothly by managing senior functionaries of the political party of West Bengal though Inspector Mishra”.The agency claimed that documents it has seized show that Majhi “assisted in transferring substantial funds derived from the proceeds of crime to Abhishek Banerjee’s close relative (wife and sister-in-law) at London and Thailand.”“If you show us (threaten us with) ED, we will also send proof against BJP leaders to the agency. A section of BJP ministers and leaders are working hand in glove with the coal mafia. They even stayed at hotels run by them during elections,” the Bengal CM said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ed-summons-abhishek-banerjee-his-wife-in-illegal-mining-case-101630144535669.html
